Wind and Solar photovoltaic power plants outputs are usually highly variable due to gusts of wind and sharp sun irradiance level variations caused by cloud shading effects. These effects negatively impact system security, especially in weak power networks. On the other hand, due to the recent technological progress and cost reductions, electrical energy storage systems are an attractive alternative that can be easily integrated into non-despatchable power plants to compensate for those power output fluctuations. This study proposes a methodology for optimal sizing of a hybrid (lithium-ion battery and ultracapacitor) energy storage system for renewable energy network integration. Special attention is paid to the battery cycling degradation process. It is shown that battery aging due to cycling is a major driver for optimal sizing. The resulting sizing problem is posed as a non-linear programming problem. Finally, real and illustrative case studies are presented for both, wind and photovoltaic power plants integrating a hybrid energy storage system. Results are reported by comparing different energy storage system configurations.
