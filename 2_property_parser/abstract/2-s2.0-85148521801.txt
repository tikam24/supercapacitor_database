Deprived electrochemical performance and declining cycle constancy of electrode materials restrict the capacity of energy storage systems like batteries and supercapacitors. To obtain significantly larger performance and stability, which are essential characteristics to assess the electrode material for energy conversion applications, nanostructured materials must be created. These materials must have enhanced specific surface area (SSA) and electrical conductivity. In the current work, samarium selenide (SmSe) supported on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) nanohybrid is produced using a simple and inexpensive hydrothermal approach. The structure, chemical composition, and morphology of the sample were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-rays diffraction analysis (XRD), respectively. The SmSe/MWCNTs nanohybrid shows excellent stability of 5000th cycles, with 2152 F/g of specific capacitance, and 160 Wh/Kg of specific energy at a current density of 1 A/g. The nanohybrid exhibits a greater double-layer capacitance (Cdl) value of 21.9 mF and small charge transfer hindrance (Rct) of 0.32 Î© than pure materials. Hence, the SmSe/MWCNTs nanohybrid material has outstanding electrochemical capabilities with significant technological implications in the future.
