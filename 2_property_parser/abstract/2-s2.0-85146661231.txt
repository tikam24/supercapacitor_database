Metal-organic framework (MOF) is one of the well-investigated nanomaterials with favorable properties exhibiting high surface area and tailorable porosity. In energy storage systems, MOFs have been highly anticipated as templates to obtain the desired properties of MOF-based nanomaterials. Such products of MOF-derived porous carbon, metal/metal oxide, and metal/metal oxide@C have shown exemplary performance in electrochemical energy storage devices. However, the growing studies of MOF-inspired derivation into the chalcogenide group of sulfide, selenide, and telluride have not fully been explored. This review reports the development of MOFs from their initial pristine state to their highly functionalized MOF-derived forms. Particularly, we report the current methodologies and challenges for obtaining MOF-derived transition metal chalcogenides (TMC representing S, Se, and Te). Such advantages of MOF-derived TMC are then explored in electrochemical applications including batteries (lithium-ion, sodium-ion, and potassium-ion), supercapacitors, and electrocatalysis (hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction). The review concludes by addressing the challenges and future perspectives of MOF toward its commercialization in electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems.
