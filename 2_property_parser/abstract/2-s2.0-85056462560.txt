Environmental problems caused by metal ions have caused widespread concern in recent years. In this work, carbon aerogels (CAs) adsorbing different metal ions were prepared. The adsorption performance and kinetics of metal ions (Cu(II), Cr(VI), and Fe(III)) on carbon aerogels were systematically investigated. The results indicated that the maximum adsorption capacity of Cu(II) was 424 mg·g-1 in 600 mg·L-1 copper solution. Adsorption performances of Cu(II), Cr(VI), and Fe(III) on CAs well fitted with a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The structures and morphologies of metal-containing samples were characterized by scanning electron micrographs (SEM), Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results demonstrated that the texture and electrochemical performance of CAs adsorbing metal ions exhibited a clear change. The specific surface area of CAs for adsorbing copper ions was 450 m2·g-1 and they showed a small average pore diameter (7.16 nm). Furthermore, CAs adsorbing metals could be used for the super capacitor. The specific capacitance of CAs adsorbing copper ions could reach 255 F·g-1 at a current density of 1.0 A·g-1. The CA-Cu electrode materials exhibited excellent reversibility with a cycling efficiency of 97% after 5000 cycles.
