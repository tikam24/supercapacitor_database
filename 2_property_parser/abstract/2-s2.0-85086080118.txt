B4C is widely known by a series of unique advantages, such as low density, high hardness, good chemical stability and excellent environmental stability, as a hard ceramic material. However, the study of B4C as the electrode material on micro-electrochemical energy storage devices has not yet been reported. To some extent, the poor conductivity of B4C is an important reason to limit its extensive application in energy storage field. Here, we first report an elaborated design B4C@C of core-shell structure by simple vacuum heating synthesis strategy as electrodes for flexible all-solid-state micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) with the method of mask assisted-vacuum filtration. Notably, the B4C@C-MSCs exhibit outstanding electrochemical performances, such as high areal capacitance of 7.33 mF cm−2, remarkable cycling stability with 100.94% capacitance retention after 50000 cycles, wide operating temperature range (−25 to 75 °C), excellent mechanical flexibility without obviously performance degradation under different bending states, distinguished environmental stability and superior integration. These results suggest that the hard ceramic materials B4C have a promising prospect in micro-electrochemical energy storage devices.
