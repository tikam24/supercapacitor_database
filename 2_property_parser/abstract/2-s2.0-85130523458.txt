Usage of battery-grade Ni(OH)2 in combination with a highly stable electrode material can lessen the ion diffusion distance and boost charge-storage capacity. To acquire superior surface characteristics, electrochemically active lanthanide-oxide CeO2 is decorated over Î±-Ni(OH)2 using a simple, uncomplicated coprecipitation technique. The unique nanoarchitecture of Ni(OH)2 nanosheets embedded with CeO2 spheres promote ion/electron transit channels on the electrode surface, leading to excellent electrochemical charge storage. In specific current of 0.5 A g-1, the finest composite developed, attained a specific capacity of 257 C g-1 (960 F g-1). Owing to the evident improvement in the electrochemical activity of the synthesized CeO2-Ni(OH)2, it holds potential as electrode in futuristic battery-type supercapacitors.
