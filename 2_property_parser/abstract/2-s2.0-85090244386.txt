We found that the V 2p XPS spectrum of the VN sample obtained before the cycling stability test, shown in Figure 2f, is incorrect. We accidentally used the same spectrum obtained from VN after testing in the LiCl/PVA electrolyte. The correct XPS spectrum of the VN sample is shown here. {figure presented}. The comparison of the XPS spectra obtained from VN before and after testing in 5 M LiCl solution and LiCl/PVA gel reveals that the oxidation of VN to VO x during cycling is substantially alleviated in the LiCl/PVA gel. The corrected figure still supports our statement in the text that "Core level V 2p and N 1s spectra also showed that the compositional modification of VN electrode was minor (Figure 2f and Figure S2). These results confirmed our hypothesis that the LiCl/PVA gel electrolyte can effectively suppress the irreversible oxidation reaction and structural pulverization of VN nanowires, without sacrificing their electrochemical performances".
