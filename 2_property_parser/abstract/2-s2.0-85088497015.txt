A one dimensional high-nucleus silver polymer (SSc: silver supercapacitor) was designed by a simple and single-step synthesis. This stable highly conductive metallic polymer without any modification steps such as pyrolysis or doping provides a desirable path for electron transfer and shows high capacitance as a non-hybrid electrode (specific capacitance of 827 F g-1 at 5 A g-1). This polymer could tolerate low to high scan rates (200 mV s-1 to 1 V s-1) and exhibit rectangular cyclic voltammetry shapes, high power density and long cycle life over 5000 cycles (90.7%). These results could promise the development of new types of high-performance supercapacitors by overcoming the low conductivity and the limited capacity challenges of known structures without the need for any modification which is unique in non-hybrid electrode materials.
