A mild and room temperature route has been developed for the synthesis of Mn3O4 nanoparticles by mixing the aqueous solution of MnSO4 and Na2CO3. The Mn3O 4 products were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electrochemical tests. A specific capacitance of 205 F g-1 was obtained for Mn3O4 nanoparticles at a current density of 0.5 A g-1 in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution. The Mn3O4 nanoparticles exhibited a good rate capability and electrochemical stability. In addition, γ-MnO2 nanorods were prepared from Mn3O4 nanoparticles by a simple hydrothermal treatment at 120 °C under the acidic condition. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.
