For low energy consumption and operational stability, multimode equivalent energy consumption, an optimal energy management and control method, is proposed in this paper. This method effectively solves the problem of energy distribution between the primary power - a high-power fuel cell and an auxiliary power - and a supercapacitor, in complex operating conditions. In all four states of the hybrid electric tram, i.e., traction, coasting, braking, and station parking, the optimal energy distribution method, with the highest energy efficiency of the tram, is obtained through the whole system modeling and the equivalent energy consumption calculation. In order to verify the responding speed, this method gets the analytical solution and is tested on the RT-LAB hardware-in-the-loop simulation platform. The results show that compared to the power following method the new method can reduce the overall tram energy consumption by 2.5% in complex operating conditions. What is more, when this method is successfully applied to the world's first commercial fuel cell/supercapacitor LF-LRV hybrid tram, its energy consumption and fuel cell system (FCS) output fluctuation rate are effectively reduced according to the operational data, which indicates a good chance of extending the life of the FCS as well.
