MnO2 is a promising material for pseudocapacitor applications due to its high specific capacity and low cost, while MnO2 electrodes suffer from their low electrical and ionic conductivities. Herein, a facile and low-cost method is adopted to synthesize MnO2 - tin-doped indium oxide nanowires (ITO NWs) composite with highly ordered network structures for electrochemical supercapacitors. Such network structure can effectively decrease the ion diffusion and charge transport resistance in the electrode. The specific capacitance of bare ITO NWs is only 2.83 F g−1, thus the contribution of the matrix material to capacitance can be ignored, and the optimized MnO2 possesses a high specific capacitor of 508.54 F g−1 at the scan rate of 5 mV s−1. It is anticipated that the synthesized MnO2-ITO NWs composite will find wide applications in supercapacitors (SCs) and other devices in virtue of their outstanding characters of good conductivity, convenient synthesis.
