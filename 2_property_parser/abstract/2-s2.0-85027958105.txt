Polythiophene (PT) thin films have been prepared by chemical bath deposition (CBD) method at room temperature (300 K) via oxidative polymerization of thiophene using ammonium peroxodisulfate (APS) as an oxidizing agent. Globular particulates of PT are deposited on the stainless steel and glass substrates. The morphology and chain structure of PT are studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy techniques, respectively. The electrochemical behavior of PT electrode is studied using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge studies. PT thin film shows maximum specific capacitance of 300 Fg-1 at 5 mVs-1 in 0.1 M LiClO4/PC electrolyte. The asymmetric device formed with PT and graphite shows supercapacitive properties useful in the power applications.
