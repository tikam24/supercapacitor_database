The dynamic behaviour - steady-state and transient - of the DC Microgrids during power disturbance can affect the system's general performance. A hybrid combination of energy storage devices with slow frequency response, like a Fuel Cell, and with a fast dynamic response, like a Super-Capacitor, provides an improved dynamic response to stabilise DC bus voltage. However, control parameters should be designed based on the preferences of the system. This paper proposes a fuzzy-based controller to determine the Virtual Capacitor Droop controller to achieve the desired transient response. The proposed dynamic control method is validated through MATLAB/Simulink.
