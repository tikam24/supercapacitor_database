This paper presents Permanent Magnet Synchronous generator (PMSG) based a variable speed wind turbine systems including energy capacitor system (ECS). The ECS is the combination of electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) known as supercapacitor and power electronic devices for wind power application with its detailed modeling and control strategy which can supply smooth electrical power to the power grid and makes the system better stable and reliable. As generated power from wind fluctuates randomly, the objective of this control system is to select a line power reference level and to follow the reference level by absorbing or providing active power to or from ECS to smooth output power fluctuation penetrated to the grid and to keep the wind farm terminal voltage at a desired level by supplying necessary reactive power. The performance of the proposed system is investigated by simulation analysis using PSCAD/EMTDC software.
