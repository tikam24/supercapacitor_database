Heteroatom-doped porous carbon materials are promising candidates for supercapacitor electrodes, but the simple and low-cost preparation method for heteroatom self-doped carbon, especially derived from biomass, remains a challenge. Herein, we developed a novel strategy that can provide an aerophilic interfacial reaction to produce N, S, P self-doped and oxygen functionalized porous carbon from the outer layer structure of durian peels in facile environment. The obtained porous biochar with N, S, P self-doped and abundant oxygen-containing functional groups can enhance the electrochemical capacitor performance, stability, and hydrophilicity of carbon electrode. When employed into symmetric supercapacitor device, the biochar of functionalization could deliver a specific capacitance of 158.20 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, a high energy density of 21.97 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 500 W kg−1 within a voltage window of 1.0 V and a remarkable cycling durability with 101.35% after 20,000 charge/discharge cycles at 4 A g−1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte. This work provides an effective and economic approach to obtain heteroatom self-doped and highly stable carbon-based electrode materials.
