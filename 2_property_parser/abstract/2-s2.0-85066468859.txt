Non-graphitic nitrogen plays a significant role in determining the electrochemical performance of carbon materials in the field of energy storage. However, the synthesis of carbon materials with a high level of non-graphitic nitrogen doping is still a great challenge. In this paper, a facile one-step pyrolysis approach was developed to synthesize 2D carbon nanosheets with a ultrahigh non-graphitic nitrogen content. Through an ingenious design, g-C3N4 and NH3, both generated during the pyrolysis process, play major roles in the generation of the non-graphitic nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets. The intermediate g-C3N4 acts as both a self-sacrificial template and a nitrogen source, whereas NH3 offers a nitrogen-enriched chemical atmosphere. Benefiting from the high pyridinic-nitrogen content of the maternal g-C3N4 and the reductive atmosphere of NH3, the as-prepared carbon nanosheets exhibit a strikingly high non-graphitic nitrogen content (up to 17.36 wt.%); also, thanks to the g-C3N4 self-sacrificial template, the as-synthesized carbon nanosheets are 2D with an ultrathin thickness (3–4 nm) and a porous structure. These novel features make the as-prepared carbon nanosheets an excellent supercapacitor electrode material in terms of superior specific capacitance (316.8 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), excellent cycling stability (without obvious capacitance loss after 10 000 cycles at 10 A g−1) and high energy density (up to 10.56 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 500 W kg−1). This work provides a new idea to prepare non-graphitic nitrogen enriched carbon materials.
