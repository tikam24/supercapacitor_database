Super-capacitor is an accent to many developing technology for energy storage. Super-capacitors possess the ability to store energy with a higher capacitance value unlike traditional electrolytic capacitors. It also derives other advantages over traditional capacitors in terms of its charging and discharging time. There are many concerns in this field of research in order to increase the efficiency and charge storing ability.Capacitance value is given importance while its internal resistance is overlooked. Reducing internal resistance can increase capabilities of super-capacitors. This paper presents the effect of addition of various proportions of metal powders of different kinds in electrode materials on the equivalent series resistance and capacitance of the super-capacitors. The super-capacitors are constructed by mixing equal proportion of activated carbon and manganese dioxide along with increasing mix of metal powders. Reduction in internal resistance can increase power density. It can eliminate the need of voltage balancing.
