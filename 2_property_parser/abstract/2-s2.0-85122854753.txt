Synergetic control-based co-ordination controller is proposed in solar powered assisted hybrid energy storage system (HESS) assisted Remote Area Power system (RAPS) to achieve better dynamic response and good dc bus voltage regulation. Detailed mathematical modelling of power converters and controller used in this system is presented in this manuscript along with design guidelines. Proposed scheme by redirecting the uncaptured reference current to SC, and for the tracking of those currents and also to maintain the DC bus voltage regulation synergetic controller is proposed in this paper. By this control strategy, the performance of HESS is enhanced without changing converter components. Proposed system is validated with the help of 0.72kW Remote Area Power System (RAPS) developed on Matlab Simulink Environment. Critical performance of the proposed controller is tested under environmental varying and load varying conditions, and its performance is compared with the conventional PI and robust sliding mode control. Designed synergetic controllers able to operate at constant switching frequency (reduced the burden of designing passive components for wide range of frequency operation) and also eliminated chattering phenomena compared to sliding mode controller. Results confirmed the feasibility of the proposed controller and also proven that the proposed controller offers better dynamic performance under both line and load varying conditions compared to existing solutions.
