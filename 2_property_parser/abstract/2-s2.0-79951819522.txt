A thin film of novel hierarchical structure, suitable for supercapacitor applications, has been developed through combining conductive multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and square IrO2 nanotubes (IrO2NT) of nanometer size. Synthesis of this hierarchical structure with open porosity is performed by depositing IrO2 short tubes densely along the long wires of carbon nanotube on a substrate of stainless steel. A IrO2 tube of rutile structure grows in the [001] direction, with an opening at its top, surrounded by very thin walls. The IrO2 addition on the MWCNT template increases the capacitance of the CNT thin film effectively, because of pseudocapacitance of the IrO2 surface. For this particular composite, featured with two tubular nanostructures, the specific capacitance increases from 15 F g-1 (MWCNT) to 69 F g-1 (IrO2NT/ MWCNT), measured using the galvanostatic discharge experiment. Its property of fast retrieval of the stored charge is assured in the impedance measurement, showing that the internal resistance of the IrO2NT/MWCNT nanocomposite electrode is lower than that of the bare MWCNTs.
