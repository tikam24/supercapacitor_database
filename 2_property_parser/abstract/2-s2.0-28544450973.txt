This paper introduces the Virtual Test Bed (VTB) for modeling, dynamic simulation and virtual-prototyping of power sources in the system context. Typical electrochemical power sources such as battery, fuel cell and supercapacitor are first modeled in VTB environment, then their usage in several applications are demonstrated here. Other features of VTB, such as the interactive links to other software (e.g. Matlab/Simulink) and the capability of advanced visualizations of simulation results, make this software quite powerful.
