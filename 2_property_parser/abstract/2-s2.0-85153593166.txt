In order to improve the power quality and stability of the dual-electric marine DC propulsion system, an improved distributed collaborative control strategy of the ship-borne hybrid energy storage system composed of supercapaci-tors and batteries was designed. The battery and supercapaci-tor were controlled with proportional sag and integral sag respectively to achieve high and low frequency power distribution. Each battery was equipped with a local distributed compensator to enable autonomous power distribution and state-of-charge (SoC ) balancing between multiple parallel batteries. At the same time, the DC bus voltage was used to adjust the voltage secondarily to realize the autonomous recovery of the DC bus voltage, and combined with the integrated droop control to achieve fast SoC recovery of the supercapacitor. Finally, a general mathematical model of the shipboard hybrid energy storage system was established, and the dynamic analysis was carried out by using the proposed model, which theoretically verified the effectiveness of the system' s battery SoC dynamic equalization, supercapacitor SoC fast recovery, autonomous power distribution and DC bus voltage autonomous recovery. The results of hardware-in-the-loop experiments are consistent with the theoretical analysis, which effectively proves the multi-function characteristics of the system.
