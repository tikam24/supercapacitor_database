This contribution offers an outline of simplified theories describing processes occurring in porous and nanostructured electrodes, their properties from the view of impedance spectroscopy and their application in electrochemical supercapacitors. Many electrode materials possess multi-level structures starting with macroporosity and ending with nanostructures. Differences as well as similarities between capacitor electrodes and intercalation electrodes will be emphasized. As a conclusion, some examples of electrodes suitable for practice will be given in this survey. Â©The Electrochemical Society.
