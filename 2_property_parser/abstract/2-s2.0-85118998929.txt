With the increasing use of green energy resource, energy storage device has become one of the key issues in energy production. Supercapacitors have attracted great attention because of their advantages in energy storage. The electrode material is the core part of the supercapacitor and determines the performance of the supercapacitor. Cobalt-based nanomaterials (such as cobalt oxide, cobalt hydroxide, and cobaltous sulfide) have attracted extensive attention in recent years due to high theoretical capacity, low cost, and abundant natural resources. This review briefly introduces the recent report of cobalt-based materials in the field of supercapacitors and divides them into several groups according to their chemical composition. Some important problems related to the preparation, properties, and improvement of these materials have been discussed, and some synergistic effects have been observed. Finally, the research and development prospects of cobalt-based materials are prospected.
