The paper proposes a method for the determination of parameters of the fractional-order elements, i.e. the supercapacitor and the fractional-order coil. The method is based on the phase resonance phenomenon in a series circuit containing the fractional-order element L and the classic reactance element - capacitor C, or induction coil L. In the case of determining the parameters of the fractional-order coil L the two resonance frequencies have to be measured, in the circuit containing this coil and two switchable classic capacitors C Similarly, when calculating the supercapacitor parameters, two resonance frequencies also need to be measured in a circuit containing a supercapacitor and two switchable reference inductances L The developed method allows the determination of the lossy parameters of the fractional-order elements too. The paper presents a detailed description of the developed method, its physical basis, simulation and experimental verification.
