The importance of energy recovered from desalination techniques has been of considerable interest because of increasing water scarcity and energy crises. Capacitive deionization (CDI), a promising desalination technology using pairs of carbon electrodes under an electric field, has an attractive advantage in that energy stored during the charging step for salt removal can be further recovered during the discharging step. In this research, an energy recovery system based on a four-switch buck-boost converter with variable frequency was successfully constructed to transfer electric energy from a CDI module to a supercapacitor. The effects of the influent NaCl concentration and the distance between two oppositely placed electrodes were investigated on both the desalination behavior and energy recovery performance. The experimental procedure involved a charging step for ion removal, stop-flow operation for energy recovery, and discharging step for electrode regeneration. For the desalination of a 10 mM NaCl solution, a deionization capacity of 10.1 mg g−1 and a total energy input of 0.09 kWh m−3 were obtained. Overall, as demonstrated, a higher energy recovery ratio was achieved with a higher influent NaCl concentration and a shorter distance between the two electrodes. Significantly, up to 49.6% of the energy stored in the CDI module while reducing the salinity of a 50 mM NaCl solution could be directly recovered, indicating that the energy recovery system based on a four-switch buck-boost converter shows superior performance. The utilization of CDI integrated with a supercapacitor in this work holds great potential in both low-energy-requirement desalination and high-efficiency energy storage.
