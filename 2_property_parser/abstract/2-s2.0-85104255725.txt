The public awareness about global warming, emission of green-house gases and depletion of natural resources like oil and natural gas, are the main factors due to which fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles (FHEVs) have attained importance in automotive industry. Hard driving conditions like steep areas, slippery roads and rough terrains boost up the nonlinearities present in vehicle's model. The considered unified mathematical model of FHEV is based on fuel cell as a primary source, ultracapacitor and battery as storage units as well as the induction motor dynamics. The variations in parameters like resistance, capacitance, inductance and the nonlinearities of the dynamical system have also been considered. Three adaptation based nonlinear controllers namely adaptive terminal sliding mode, adaptive terminal synergetic and adaptive synergetic controllers have been proposed for the regulation of DC bus voltage along with speed tracking when subjected to European extra urban driving cycle. Lyapunov stability theory has been used to ensure global asymptotic stability of the system. Proposed controllers have been simulated on MATLAB/Simulink, where their comparison has been presented with each other and with recently proposed nonlinear controllers in the literature. Furthermore, ATSMC has further been implemented on real-time microcontroller hardware in the loop setup. The experimental results show that it provides better performance.
