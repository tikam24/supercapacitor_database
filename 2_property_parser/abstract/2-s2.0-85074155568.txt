Nuclear magnetic resonance is one of the rare techniques able to probe selectively the ions inside the nanoporous network in supercapacitor devices. With a magnetic resonance imaging method able to detect all ions (adsorbed and nonadsorbed), we record one-dimensional concentration profiles of the active ions in supercapacitors with an electrode configuration close to that used in industry. Larger anionic concentration changes are probed upon charge and discharge in a carbide-derived carbon (CDC) with micropores smaller than 1 nm compared to a conventional nanoporous carbon (CC) with a larger distribution of pore sizes, up to 2 nm. They highlight the increased interaction of the anions with CDC and provide a better understanding of the enhanced capacitance in CDC-based supercapacitors.
