For the last few decades, revolutionary scientific research regarding carbon related nanomaterials (carbon nanotubes, graphene, etc.) and the corresponding polymer-based nanocomposites in nanoscience is helping to modernize the functionality and applicability of various electronic devices of different catagories. Graphene-based polymer nanocomposites are having their applications in the field of gas sensors, field effect transistors (FET), super capacitors, electromagnetic interference shielding materials (EMI), etc. The modification of graphene nanoparticle is also a neccessary parameter to apply for a specific electronic application as well. The present chapter discusses the synthesis of graphene nanomaterial, modification of the graphene nanomaterials, and graphene-polymer nanocomposites. The present chapter deals with the synthesis and modification of graphene, modified graphene, and its polymer nanocomposites in the electronics field mainly FET, supercapacitor, sensors, EMI shielding, etc.
