A new material design strategy is developed to prepare high-performance flexible electrochemical electrodes. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and nickel/nickelous hydroxide (Ni/Ni(OH)2) are compounded through a chemical plating method and hydrothermal process. A single-side printing method is used to combine the active material and a flexible cotton substrate. The interfinger microstructure of the textile electrode can greatly facilitate charge/ion transfer at the electrode-electrolyte interface. One side of the fabric, which is untreated, could directly contact with human skin, providing a comfortable and user-friendly surface. With the CNTs/Ni/Ni(OH)2 ternary composite as a positive electrode and CNTs as a negative electrode, we assembled an in-plane asymmetrical micro-supercapacitor device (SF-NPCs). Thanks to a synergistic effect, SF-NPCs displays a high energy density of 0.29 W h cm-2 at a power density of 7.2 W cm-2. The operating window is extended to 1.5 V, and the device displays good potential for applications in the field of smart textiles.
