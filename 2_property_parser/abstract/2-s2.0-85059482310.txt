Design and fabrication of unique micro/nanostructural MnCo 2 O 4 -based electrode material for applications in supercapacitors with excellently electrochemical performance is still of great challenge. In this work, novel MnCo 2 O 4 /CoCo 2 O 4 ellipsoid-like (MCE) microstructures were synthesized through a facile hydrothermal route with a post annealing treatment in air. Such MnCo 2 O 4 /CoCo 2 O 4 composite possessed a specific surface area of 42.2 m 2 g −1 with an average pore size of 17.4 nm. The electrochemical performance of the obtained porous MnCo 2 O 4 /CoCo 2 O 4 ellipsoids as electrode for pseudocapacitors was investigated by galvanostatic charge-discharge and cyclic voltammetry measurements in 2 M of KOH electrolyte. The composite exhibited a specific capacitance as high as 614 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 and an outstanding cycling behavior with about 77.5% capacitance retention of its initial specific capacitance after 5000 cycles at 5 A g −1 . The outstanding electrochemical performances of the porous MnCo 2 O 4 /CoCo 2 O 4 composite are mainly attributed to the combination of both types of electrode materials and its intriguing mesoporous ellipsoid-like structure, and make it one of the most promising candidate materials for the advanced energy storage devices.
