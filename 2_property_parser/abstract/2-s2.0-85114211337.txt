The importance of Super-capacitors (SCs) stems from their distinctive properties including long cycle life, high strength and environment friendly, they are sharing similar fundamental equations as the traditional capacitors; for attaining high capacitances SC using electrodes materials with thinner dielectrics and high specific surface area. In this review paper, all types of SCs were covered, depending on the energy storage mechanism; a brief overview of the materials and technologies used for SCs is presented. The major concentration is on materials like the metal oxides, carbon materials, conducting polymers along with their composites. The composites' performance was examined via parameters like capacitance, energy, cyclic performance power and the rate capability also presents details regarding the electrolyte materials.
