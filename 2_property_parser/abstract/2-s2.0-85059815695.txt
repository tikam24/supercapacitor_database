Unique ZnWO 4 oblate nanospheres (ZWO-ONSs) deposited on Nickel foam (Ni foam) are successfully prepared via facile hydrothermal route. The ZWO-ONSs show high specific surface area of 89.47 m 2 g −1 . The as-prepared nanostructures tested in 3 M KOH aqueous solution, perform excellent electrochemical performances showing specific capacity of 1198 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 , and high retention rate cyclic stability 96.56% after 1000 cycles at 10 A g −1 . Distinctive binary metal oxide nanoarchitectures are dynamic material for energy storage systems.
