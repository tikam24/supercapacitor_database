A novel stereoscopic snowflake-like CoO material is synthesized via a simple two-step process, including the hydrothermal process for the formation of the stereoscopic snowflake-like Co(OH)F as precursor and thermal conversion process to CoO without altering the original shape of the precursor. The possible formation mechanism of the stereoscopic snowflake-like morphology of CoO was investigated by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction patterns. The hydrothermal temperature and NH4F were critical to the formation of stereoscopic snowflake-like morphology of CoO. The supercapacitor properties of as-prepared CoO were investigated by the electrochemical measurements on a conventional three-electrode system.
