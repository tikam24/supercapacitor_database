Uniform and adherent cobalt oxide thin films have been deposited on glass substrates from aqueous cobalt chloride solution, using the solution spray pyrolysis technique. Their structural, optical and electrical properties were investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron micrograph (SEM), optical absorption and electrical resistivity measurements. Along with this, to propose Co 3 O 4 for possible application in energy storage devices, its electrochemical supercapacitor properties have been studied in aqueous KOH electrolyte. The structural analysis from XRD pattern showed the oriented growth of Co 3 O 4 of cubic structure. The surface morphological studies from scanning electron micrographs revealed the nanocrystalline grains alongwith some overgrown clusters of cobalt oxide. The optical studies showed direct and indirect band gaps of 2.10 and 1.60 eV, respectively. The electrical resistivity measurement of cobalt oxide films depicted a semiconducting behavior with the room temperature electrical resistivity of the order of 1.5 × 10 3 Ω cm. The supercapacitor properties depicted that spray-deposited Co 3 O 4 film is capable of exhibiting specific capacitance of 74 F/g. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
