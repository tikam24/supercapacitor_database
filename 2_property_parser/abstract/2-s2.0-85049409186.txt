Motivated by the presence of metallic conductivity in the group VI transition metal dichalcogenides, the supercapacitive performance of the 1T phase of molybdenum (MoS2xSe2(1-x)) sulfoselenides is explored. Ultrahigh frequency response (∼1.4 kHz) along with excellent electrochemical stability are exhibited by 1T MoS2xSe2(1-x)-based supercapacitors. The S:Se ratio in the mixed chalcogenide is shown to influence the rate performance of the device. High areal capacitances of ∼450 μF cm-2 with short RC time constants of ∼1.3-3.2 ms at 120 Hz are achieved in the case of 1T MoSSe phase. The i-v characteristics are almost rectangular at very high scan rates of ∼1000 V s-1. Very stable gravimetric specific capacitance of ∼36 F g-1 is retained for several thousands of charge-discharge cycles leading to an energy density of ∼12.1 Wh kg-1 at a specific power of ∼842 W kg-1. The observed specific power of ∼50 kW kg-1 at ∼1.5 Wh kg-1 energy density makes the sulfoselenide phase capacitors attractive for high power applications without compromising on the energy density.
