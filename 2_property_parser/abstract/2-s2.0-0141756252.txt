Polyindole derivatives with a series of electron-withdrawing groups (-F, -Cl, -Br, -CN, -NO2) substituted via 3-, 5-, and 6-positions have been investigated for their electrochemistry and the capabilities as electrode materials for supercapacitors (redox capacitors) or proton batteries. All of the 5- and 6-substituted indoles were successfully electropolymerized to give thin electroactive films with varieties of electroactivities and molecular weights. Among the poly (5- and 6-indole)s, a poly(5-cyanoindole) exhibited the most positive E0′ (1.15 V vs. Ag/AgCl), the highest specific capacity (53 Ah kg-1) and an excellent cycleability over several thousand cycles. On the other hands, the 3-substituted indoles did not give any electroactive polymeric products. The relationship between the apparent formal potential (E0) and Hammet constants (σ) for the electroactive poly(substituted indole)s was also investigated.
