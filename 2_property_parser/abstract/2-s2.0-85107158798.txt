g-C3N4@Ni3C nano-sheets have been prepared by a simple pyrolysis under different temperature, and the as-prepared samples have been characterized by many means, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and pore size distribution. The as-prepared g-C3N4@Ni3C nano-sheet has been proved to be a versatile functional material, that is the application in supercapacitor electrode materials, hydrogen generation via NaBH4 hydrolysis and reduction of p–nitrophenol. This method offers a new strategy for preparation of environmental energy materials through simple raw materials.
