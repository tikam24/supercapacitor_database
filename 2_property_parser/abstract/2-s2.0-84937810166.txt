Graphene quantum dot-doped polyaniline composites have been prepared by the chemical oxidation of aniline. Synthesized novel fibrous composites show an excellent specific capacitance value of âˆ¼1044 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 as well as moderate cyclic stability with a retention of life time of 80.1% after 3000 cycles.
