Medium-temperature fluoroalkylation of microporous activated carbons (ACs) with 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane is presented. Supercapacitor (SC) electrodes based on the fluoroalkylated ACs showed enhanced specific capacitance and high specific energy in electrolytes, either aqueous potassium hydroxide solution or tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate-acetonitrile solution. We found the largest increase in the specific capacitance, up to 89 F g–1, and in the specific energy, up to 7.5 Wh kg–1, at the voltage of 1.5 V. The specific capacitance of the SC electrode based on the sample prepared at 350 °C increases by a factor of ~ 2–3 × for certain scan rates in the organic electrolyte. The fluoroalkylated ACs have good electrochemical stability in the tested model systems. We associate the registered enhanced SC parameters with an increase in the total fluorine content and high specific surface areas of the carbon electrode materials. The surface “isolated fluorine” formed during fluoroalkylation at 300–400 °C ensures the production of improved electrode materials for SC applications. Fluoroalkylation is a simple and cost-effective method of improving the specific capacitance of carbon-based SC electrodes.
