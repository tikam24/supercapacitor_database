The cellulose derived carbon/graphene/ZnO aerogel composite was prepared as an electrode in order to investigate the electrochemical properties. Carbon aerogel was synthesized using paper as an available cellulose source, and the composite was obtained through a new and simple preparation method including the immersion of monolithic carbon aerogel in graphene oxide/Zn2+ suspension and subsequent chemical reduction and freeze drying. The morphology, functional groups and crystalline structure of the samples were studied with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray Diffraction Spectroscopy (XRD), respectively. Electrochemical performance of the prepared binder free electrodes was examined using Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Galvanostatic Charge-Discharge (GCD) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). The data revealed that flexible carbon/graphene/ZnO composite resulted in a low density (0.035 g cm−3) electrode with the capacitance of 900 mF cm−2 at a high current density of 10 mA cm−2, lower IR drop and high cyclic stability (capacitance retention of 96%) after 1000 cycles, at 10 mA cm−2. These features were due to the presence of 3D porous conductive network, highly reduced graphene oxide, and the formation of ZnO nanoparticles on graphene sheets. Moreover, polyaniline (PANI) was introduced to carbon/graphene/ZnO composite electrode using electro-oxidation method at different reaction time and aniline concentration in order to achieve remarkably improved capacitance of 2500 mF cm−2 (at 10 mA cm−2) and low charge transfer resistance. Also, after the supercapacitor device assembly, the capacitance was retained. Based on the results, the synthesized composite is a promising material for new generation of lightweight freestanding electrodes with the high electrochemical performance.
