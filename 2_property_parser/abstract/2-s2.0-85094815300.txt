In this study, we successfully synthesized NiCo2O4 supported on Ni foam (NNCOs) with different morphologies by changing the synthesis conditions. The research results of electrochemical properties show that the morphologies have a strong influence on the electrochemical properties of materials. Specifically, the nanosheet-like NNCO-1 sample exhibited an enhanced specific capacity of 503.5 C g−1 at current density of 1 A g−1, ca. 134-350 % higher than that of NNCO-2, NNCO-4 (nanorod-like) and NNCO-3 (grass-like). All materials also show high stability with the ability to maintain 95 to 97% capacitance after 2000 discharge cycles at a current density of 2 A g−1. We hope that, the NNCO-1 material is promising electrode material for hybrid supercapacitor.
