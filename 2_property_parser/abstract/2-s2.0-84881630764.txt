Supercapacitor assisted low dropout (SCALDO) regulator is a new approach to develop high efficiency DC-DC converters with supercapacitors used for energy recovery. One limitation in these topologies is that in some configurations a large number of low-speed switches are required. If the SCALDO technique is adapted to build voltage regulator modules (VRM), it is necessary to reduce number of switches combined with a high current capable LDO. A new topology-variation with less number of switches can be achieved by reconfiguring the original SCALDO and adding an extra LDO to the circuit. The paper presents a summary of some preliminary work, and experimental results for a 2.5V proof of concept-prototype. Â© 2013 IEEE.
