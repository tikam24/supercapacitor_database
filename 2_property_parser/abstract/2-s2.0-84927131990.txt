Electrochemical study of hybrid supercapacitor based on porous carbon material and the LiMn1.5Fe0.5O4 anode has been performed. It is shown that the degree of crystallinity of spinel increases with synthesis temperature. It is established that hybrid supercapacitor with anode based on spinel synthesized at 1073 K has the best operating parameters that is explained by the lack of amorphous component and intensive intercalation of lithium ions in nanoscale anode particles.
