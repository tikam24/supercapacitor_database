Lithiated spinel, LiCrTiO4 is synthesized by sonochemical method followed by calcination at 923 K for 2 h. The prepared material is characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersion X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Cubic phase LiCrTiO4 with Fd3m space group is evident from the XRD. Particles of 60-70 nm in size are observed from the microscopic images. The presence of respective elements is confirmed from EDX analysis. The electrochemical characteristics of LiCrTiO4 electrode were evaluated in a lithium battery cell. It has been found that the intercalation of lithium ions into LiCrTiO4 lattice occurs at 1.5 and 1.65 V vs. Li/Li+ with ionic conduction behavior. A reversible specific capacity of ∼ 160 mAh/g was obtained. Nanocrystalline LiCrTiO 4 is exploited as anode for asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor and the electrochemical performance is investigated. The cell exhibited a specific capacity of 59 mAh/g at 1 mA/cm2 in a non-aqueous electrolyte. It also showed good cycling performance for 1000 cycles with 96% retention in capacity. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
