Cerium-based CeMO3 (M = Co, Ni, Cu) perovskites were efficiently synthesized by electrospinning process. The structures, morphologies, elemental compositions, and valence states of CeMO3 perovskites were manifested in detail using X-ray diffraction analysis, Raman spectroscopic analysis, UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively. The tolerance factor (t) was accurately calculated to confirm the perovskite structure stability. The electrochemical properties of CeMO3 perovskites were investigated, and the specific capacitances of CeCoO3, CeNiO3, and CeCuO3 perovskites are 128, 189, and 117 F g−1 at the current density of 0.5 A g−1, respectively. This study could provide an efficient and potential applications of the cerium-based perovskites into the supercapacitor electrode materials.
