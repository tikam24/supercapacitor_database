Nanostructured Cu oxides hold great promise as electrode materials for supercapacitors due to their low cost, high theoretical capacitance (1800 F g −1 ), as well as superior environmental benignity. In this work, hybrid three-dimensional (3D) network and flower-like structure CuO nanoparticles in situ grow on a 3D submicron-porous/solid copper current collector (S/SPCu) via a simple hydrothermal method using H 2 O 2 . Benefited from this unique hybrid porous architecture, the as-prepared CuO/S/SPCu electrode shows a high specific capacitance of 445 F g −1 at 2 mA cm −2 , high rate capability (60.7% at 64 mA cm −2 ) and good cycling stability (82.8% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles). The high performance hybrid structure makes the environment-friendly and low-cost CuO/S/SPCu electrode a promising electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
