In this study, ruthenium oxide-polypyrrole (RuOx-PPy) composite nanostructures were prepared as electrode materials for electrochemical capacitors. Pyrrole was electrochemically polymerized in the pores of an anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) template. RuOx was further deposited on the surface of the PPy nanorod array by an electrochemical method. The morphology and composition of the RuOx-PPy nanocomposites were observed by SEM and EDX. The capacitive performance of the RuOx-PPy nanocomposites was investigated by the galvanostatic charge/discharge test as a function of the amount of RuOx. The maximum specific capacitance of the RuOx-PPy nanocomposite electrode was 419 mF cm-2/681 F g-1. Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
