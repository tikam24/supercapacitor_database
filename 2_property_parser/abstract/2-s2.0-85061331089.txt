Wire-shaped micro-supercapacitors attracted extensive attentions in next-generation portable and wearable electronics, due to advantages of miniature size, lightweight and flexibility. Herein, NiMoO 4 nanorods supported on Ni film coated Cu wire are successfully fabricated thorough direct deposition of Ni film onto Cu wire as the conductive substrate, followed by growth of the NiMoO 4 nanorods on Ni film coated Cu wire substrate by means a hydrothermal annealing process. The prepared 3D, porous electrode demonstrates extremely high areal specific capacitance of 12.03F cm −2 at the current density of 4 mA cm −2 and retained capacitance of 8.23 F cm −2 at a much higher current density of 80 mAcm −2 . The electrode, also, shows an excellent cycling stability with capacitance retention of 99.3% after 3000 cycles. The superior electrochemical performance can be attributed to the high area surface, low contact resistance between NiMoO 4 nanorods and Cu wire current collector and presence of a 3D and porous structure provides many electroactive sites and sufficient open space for easy diffusion of the electrolyte ions during redox reactions. Benefiting from their structural features, a fiber shaped asymmetric micro-supercapacitor based on NiMoO 4 /Ni film/Cu wire as the positive electrode and carbon fiber coated with reduced graphene oxide as the negative electrode is assembled. The fabricated fiber device presents a wide potential window between 0 and 1.7 V and exhibits high specific capacitance of 0.504F cm −2 (38.8F cm −3 ) at a current density of 4.8 mA cm −2 with a high energy density of 202 µWh cm −2 (15.6 mWh cm −3 ) at a power density of 4050 µW cm −2 (313 mWh cm −3 ). The energy density retains 124 µWh cm −2 (9.54 mWh cm −3 ) when the power density is increased to 13530 µW cm −2 (1040.73 mWh cm −3 ). In addition, the asymmetric device exhibits an outstanding cycling stability (98.5% capacitance retention after 1000 consecutive cycles) and good mechanical stability. Therefore, this work suggested the promising potential of NiMoO 4 nanorods supported on Ni film coated Cu wire as an advanced electrode material for construction of flexible and portable next-generation energy storage micro-devices with superior electrochemical performances.
