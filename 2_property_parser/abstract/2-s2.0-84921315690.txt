A supercapacitor (SC) with electrodes fabricated from graphite oxide reduced by a microwave exfoliation (MEGO) method and the separator made from the graphite oxide paper (GOP) formed after precipitation of water suspension of graphene oxide was designed for the first time. The specific capacitance of this SC exceeded 200 F/g. The specific area of our MEGO is 2400 m2/g when measured using the standard contact porosimetry method, whereas it is several times smaller (âˆ¼600 m2/g) when measured by using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method based on the low-temperature nitrogen adsorption. By using the angle resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy we found that surface layers of the GOP separator contain smaller oxygen concentration than the bulk layers.
