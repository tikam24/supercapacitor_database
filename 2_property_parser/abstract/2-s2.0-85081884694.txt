The advancements in supercapacitors (SCs) are happening at an exceptionally high rate as the remarkable need for these storage devices are identified in different areas of life mainly hybrid vehicles, portable electronic devices, aircraft, smart grids, short term energy storage etc. Batteries with high energy densities are the state-of art solutions but they suffer from safety risks especially with poor compatibility with flexible systems. SCs, as the energy storage device bridging the gap between Lithium-ion batteries and conventional capacitors, are excellent candidates with fast charging-discharging rates, long cycle life and safer operation. This overview highlights the fundamentals of SC and its different varieties based on type and electrode materials with particular emphasis on factors affecting the performance of SCs. The dynamic characteristics of SCs strongly related to the ion mobility of the electrolyte used and the porosity effects of the porous electrodes. The advent of high energy density nanomaterials has made SC superior in different areas of energy needs of present world.
