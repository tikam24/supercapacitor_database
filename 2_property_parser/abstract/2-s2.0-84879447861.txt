An improved mean-field model used earlier (J. Phys.: Condens. Matter2011, 23, 022201) to explain the anomalous increase of capacitance in nanoporous supercapacitors is extended to the study of charging dynamics. We find that charging of initially empty (i.e., ionic liquid-phobic) pores proceeds in a front-like way, while charging of filled (i.e., ionophilic) pores is diffusive; in both cases, however, the accumulated charge grows as a square root of time. We also discuss two-step complementary optimization of porous electrodes for supercapacitors. In a first step, the optimal pore width is chosen to maximize the stored energy density; in a second step, the optimal pore depth/length (that is, electrode's thickness) is chosen to satisfy the requirement on charging times. In addition, the use of "nanoporous channels" in a "multilayered" configuration is suggested to decrease the volume and to increase the capacitance, stored energy, and power density of a supercapacitor.
