The commonly used prepare methods of NiCo2O4 and theirs composite materials and application of in supercapacitors were reviewed. The NiCo2O4 electrode material directly growth on a conductive substrate has better electrochemical performance comparing to the electrode material prepared by mixing adhesive and conductive agent, three-dimensional and porous electrode materials structure have high capacitance performance, which is attributed to that the porous structure and 3 d structure provides continuous networks and more active site for redox reaction. The problems existing in the NiCo2O4 and their composites materials were analyzed and the development trend was prospected.
