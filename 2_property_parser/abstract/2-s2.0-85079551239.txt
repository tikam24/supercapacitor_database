Conducting polymer gels possess both gel-network structure and organic semiconductor properties, thus exhibit high energy density, excellent charge-discharge stability, and good flexibility, etc. They are considered as ideal materials for producing flexible electrodes, however the traditional fabrication of conducting polymer gels often introduced non-conducting chemical crosslinkers, limiting the electrical conductivity. In this work, a coordination polymer gel was employed as template to produce uniform network of polypyrrole nanowires, and after polymerization the template could be easily removed thereby improving the performance of the polypyrrole gel. The results showed that the polypyrrole gel fabricated by template method had a three-dimensional network structure composed of uniform nanowires, having good mechanical properties, large specific surface area, and excellent electrochemical properties. At a current density of 0.28 A/g, the specific capacitance could reach 450 F/g, meanwhile the the specific capacitance could be maintained at 88.6% after 1000 times charge-discharge cycles at a current density of 2.8 A/g. The polypyrrole nanowire network gels were loaded with glucose oxidase to give a flexible sensor, which had rapid responsiveness to glucose at low concentration(0.2 mmol/L), therefore they were expected to have application in supercapacitors, electrochemical sensors and so on.
