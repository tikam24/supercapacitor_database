Hybrid multilayered nanocomposites have been extensively produced and used as electrode in electrochemical energy storage devices. The electrochemical performances of electrodes are dependent on the electrodes composition, which in turn,mainly depends on the various methods of fabrication. Herewith, multilayer N-doped Mo2C@MoO3 (N-MoC) nanocomposites were synthesized using an in situ method by pyrolysis of a mixture containing ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate and amino triazole under a N2 atmosphere. The electrodes were systematically produced via insertion of N-MoC at different weight percentages (N-MoC X, X:1, 5, 10 and 15) prepared with carbon composite host material. Among all prepared electrodes, N-MoC10 shows a high specific capacitance of 322 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in 3 M Glycerol/KOH with a wide operation window from 0 to 2 V. In addition, the assembled symmetrical device conveys an energy density of 37.5 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 2.495 W kg−1. The present findings suggest that the application of N-MoC nanocomposites improves both physical and electrochemical performance of materials used for electrodes preparationand the corresponding assembled devices.
