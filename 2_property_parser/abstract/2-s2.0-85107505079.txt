This study reports the electrochemical properties of Manganese dioxide (MnO2) with four types of conducting polymers such as polyaniline (PANi), polythiophene (PTh), polypyyrole, and polyindole (PIn) by preparing their composites. All four conducting polymers were prepared by chemical oxidative polymerization approach. The prepared composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, ultra–violate visible (UV–VIS) spectroscopy, and photoluminance (PL). Similarly, the supercapacitive properties such, cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve, capacitance retention and cycle stability of composite materials were investigated. The highest value of specific capacitance was obtained for MnO2-PANi (Mn-PANi) composite, which was found to be 633.75 Fg−1.
