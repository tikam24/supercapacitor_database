Due to the ever-increasing concern for the environment and the progression of technology, renewable energy such as solar photovoltaic (PV), wind, and super capacitor is being widely used. Many creative approaches have been used to convert the power from renewable sources. One such creative solution is using power electronic converters to match the load and grid requirements so that the renewable generation's dynamic but instead steady-state characteristics are enhanced, with the goal of achieving maximum power point tracking (MPPT) regulate and energy storage to resolve this issue. This new design seeks to increase circuit efficacy and power density by using a multiple DC-DC converter [3] which has a DC input port for renewable sources, an unidirectional Input voltage port for energy storage, as well as an Output signal port for operating the load. A few new DC-DC four converters have developed in recent years and are now being researched in the literature. This study reviews several three-port DC/DC converter topologies that have been developed by different research organizations. The study concludes that topologies based on three-port Power converter with power terminals and a single inductor are likely for further research. The suggested system's simulation is done using MATLAB/SIMULINK.
