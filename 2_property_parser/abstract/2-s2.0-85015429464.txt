High-performance supercapacitors require the design and development of electrode materials with high conductivity and a large electrolyte-accessible surface area. Here, the use of a conductive NiCoP nanoarray on nickel foam (NiCoP/NF) as a superior pseudocapacitor electrode is demonstrated. This 3D electrode exhibits high areal capacitances of 9.2 and 5.97 F cm−2 at current densities of 2 and 50 mA cm−2, respectively, with good rate capability and cycling stability. The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device assembled using NiCoP/NF as positive electrode and active carbon as negative electrode delivers a high energy density of 1.16 mWh cm−2 at a power density of 1.6 mW cm−2 with 72 % retention of its initial specific capacitance after 2000 cycles at 50 mA cm−2. The practical use is further demonstrated with two such ASC devices in series to light six LED indicators and also to drive an alkaline water electro- lyzer using NiCoP/NF as both cathode and anode for hydrogen production.
