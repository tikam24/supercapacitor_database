This article proposes a complete power processing circuit for an indoor 2.45 GHz Wi-Fi energy harvesting system. The proposed power processing circuit works by using power harvested from indoor Wi-Fi transmitters. The overall system of this work is simplified as an equivalent circuit and analyzed mathematically. A two-port network is analyzed in formulating the relevant equations of the equivalent circuit. The importance of matching the impedance of a harvesting antenna to the rectifier circuit is highlighted by using simulation analysis, and it is shown that the impedance matching for both components has satisfied the conditions for a high sensitivity circuit and radio frequency-to-direct current (RF-to-DC) power conversion. Actual experiments showed that the proposed power processing circuit could operate with an incident power as low as -50 dBm. It has been found that the proposed harvesting system stored 0.11 J in a 200 mF supercapacitor as the storage device in 20 hours of the experimentation periods. Moreover, actual results for the overall energy harvesting system is compared with previous research, and it has been found that the proposed system has advantages over the listed works.
