The relatively poor performance stability of pseudocapacitors over a wide temperature window (i. e. temperature stability), particularly at low temperatures, hinders their practical applications. Here, well-aligned hierarchical pseudocapacitive electrodes are fabricated, featuring run-through channels in a graphene network (GN) as ion-buffering reservoirs, open inter-sheet channels between vertical graphene nanosheets (VGNSs) for fast ion transport and MnO2 nanopetals on VGNSs for efficient interfacial pseudocapacitive reactions. With reduced ion diffusion length and charge-transfer resistance as well as improved ion-transport rate, the capacitance of pseudocapacitive electrodes decreases from 541 to 490 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 as the temperature drops from 25 to 0 °C, revealing a high capacitance retention of 90.7 %. Furthermore, the specific capacitance of a symmetric device based on the hierarchical electrodes at −30 °C maintains 80.8 % of the room-temperature capacitance. Such outstanding temperature stability is comparable to the state-of-the-art electric double-layer capacitors. Importantly, 86.0 % of capacitance is retained after repeated heating and cooling at temperatures ranging from −30 to 60 °C for 5000 cycles. Asymmetric supercapacitors with the hierarchical architecture in the positive electrode exhibit stable performance over a wide temperature range. These results demonstrate the rationality of the electrode design for practical energy storage applications in harsh temperature environments.
