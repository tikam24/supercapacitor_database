To meet the increasing demand for wearable sensing devices, flexible supercapacitors (SCs) as energy storage devices play significant roles in powering sensors/biosensors for healthcare monitoring. Because of its high conductivity and remarkable specific capacitance in SCs, molybdenum nitride (MoN) has been widely used. Herein, a flexible helical structure of MoN modified on nitrogen-doped carbon cloth (CC@CN@MoN) has been prepared by a simple nitride process, delivering an ultralong cycle life of 10,000 cycles and high areal capacitance of 467.6 mF cm-2 as SCs. Moreover, the as-fabricated flexible all-solid-state asymmetrical SCs (ASCs) of CC@CN@MoN//CC@NiCo2O4 demonstrated outstanding electrochemical behavior after 10,000 cycles and over 90% retention, and the value of areal capacitance could reach 90.8 mF cm-2 at 10 mA cm-2. Integrated with solar energy, ASCs could be used as a self-powered energy system for strain sensors in detecting human movement, and finger movements could be further real-time monitored remotely via a smartphone. Prospectively, wearable helical MoN solid-state SCs for self-powered strain smartsensors would inspire the development of structured materials in the application of energy storage, portable self-powering, and strain or chemical/biochemical smartsensors.
