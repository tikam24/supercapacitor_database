As a typical supercapacitor electrode material, the reported Mo-N compounds mostly own one part of outstanding electrochemical properties (specific capacitance (Csp), voltage window and cycling stability), and the well integration with three aspects was rare. Here using a novel MoO3 precursor with ultra-long nanobelts (NBs) and stable orthorhombic crystal structure, we prepared unique Mo3N2 NBs, which inherited the morphology and structure of the precursor greatly. Compared with other Mo-N compounds, the Mo3N2 NBs both possessed the high Csp (220.3 F/g at 0.4 A/g), great cycling stability (98.3% Csp retention after 1500 cycles) and wide voltage window (0.95 V) due to the improved morphology, stable structure and excellent conductivity.
