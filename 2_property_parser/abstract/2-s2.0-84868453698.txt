Highly porous carbons were obtained from solid wastes generated in the chemical and the mechanical processing of birch wood (substandard kraft cellulose, hydrolysis lignin, chips and bark). NaOH-chemical activation of these residues at 575-800 °C resulted in an efficient process to produce carbons with specific surface areas well above 1000 m 2 g -1 and average pore widths of 1-1.7 nm. Comparative evaluations have shown the potentiality of wood wastes-based carbons in applications related to environmental protection. Activated carbons derived from chips- and bark-birch wood displayed specific capacitances as high as 308 F g -1 in the H 2SO 4 aqueous electrolyte and 200 F g -1 in the (C 2H 5) 4NBF 4/acetonitrile organic medium. Moreover, their capacitive performance at high current density competed well with that found for commercial carbons used in supercapacitors. Wood-derived carbons also proved to be highly promising for CO 2 capture in power stations, achieving uptakes under post- and pre-combustion conditions of 11-16 wt.% and 49-91 wt.%, respectively. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
