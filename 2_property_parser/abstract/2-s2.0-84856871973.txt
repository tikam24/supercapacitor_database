The study of 26 microporous carbons with average pore widths L o between 0.7 and 1.8 nm shows that the volume-related capacitance C mi (F cm - 3) in the organic electrolyte (C 2H 5) 4NBF 4/acetonitrile is an inverse function of the average micropore width L o. This means that for a given micropore volume W o, the gravimetric capacitance C (F g - 1) is larger for carbons with smaller pores due to the higher surface to volume ratio. Furthermore, the increase of C mi (F cm - 3) in smaller pores suggests that the surface-related capacitance C (F m - 2) should be relatively constant in slit-shaped micropores. This has important technological consequences for the design of carbon-based supercapacitors. Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
