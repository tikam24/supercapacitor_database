The objective of this study is to investigate the synthesis and influence of MoS2 on carbon nanowalls (CNWs) as supercapacitor electrodes. The synthesis of MoS2 on CNW was achieved by the introduction of hydrogen remote plasma from ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (ATTM) without deterioration of the CNWs. The topographical surface structures and electrochemical characteristics of the MoS2–CNW composite electrodes were explored using two ATTM-dispersed organic solvents— acetonitrile and dimethylformamide (DMF). In this study, CNW and MoS2 were synthesized using an electron cyclotron resonance plasma. However, hydrogen radicals, which transform ATTM into MoS2, were provided in the form of a remote plasma source. The electrochemical performances of MoS2–CNW hybrid electrodes with various morphologies—depending on the solvent and ATTM concentration—were evaluated using a three-electrode system. The results revealed that the morphology of the synthesized MoS2 was influenced by the organic solvent used and affected both the electrochemical performance and topographical characteristics. Notably, considerable enhancement of the specific capacitance was observed for the MoS2 with open top edges synthesized from DMF. These encouraging results may motivate additional research on hybrid supercapacitor electrodes and the rapid synthesis of MoS2 and other transition metal dichalcogenides.
