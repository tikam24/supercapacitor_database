In this study, a new topology of grid-connected four-level inverter is introduced. The proposed structure, based on intermediate supercapacitors energy storage, is introduced to ensure two operation modes: to provide power to a microgrid from renewable energy sources and to regulate its voltage during short-term power disturbances. The main idea is to replace ordinary capacitors of a four-level flying capacitor (FC) inverter by supercapacitors and operate them under variable voltage conditions. The control strategy applies linear matrix inequalities approach as well as space vector modulation technique to generate the appropriate switching states. The latter part of this study is dedicated to the redundant state selection method for supercapacitors voltages balancing. Through experimental implementation, presented results highlight the efficiency of the proposed hybrid inverter in ensuring microgrid stability.
