The Co3O4 and La2O3 electrodes are prepared using chemical bath deposition method. The electrochemical properties of Co3O4 and La2O3 electrodes show maximum specific capacitance of 415 and 288 F g−1 in potential window of 0.0 to −0.6 and −0.2 to 0.5 V/SCE, respectively in 1 M KOH electrolyte at scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The solid state asymmetric supercapacitor device (ASC) is fabricated using Co3O4 as an anode and La2O3 as a cathode with PVA–KOH gel as a solid electrolyte and separator. Co3O4//La2O3 asymmetric supercapacitor shows good performance with specific capacitance of 15 F g−1 and 92% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles. The energy and power densities are 42.9 Wh kg−1 and 108.2 W kg−1, respectively. Two assembled Co3O4//La2O3 ASCs devices in series lights up red LED after charging for 45 s.
