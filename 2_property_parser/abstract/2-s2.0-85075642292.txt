Flexible textile-based supercapacitors (SCs) have attracted a lot of attention, with the artificial intelligence technology and smart wearable electronic textiles developing rapidly. However, energy-storage performance of common textile-based SCs is always restricted with the low-dimensional substrates (i.e., one-dimensional fibers or two-dimensional fabrics), and hence flexible textile-based SCs with multifarious hierarchical substrates are highly desired. Herein, a multidimensional hierarchical fabric electrode model with a bionic fiber microarray structure has been designed, inspired by the "grasp effect" of the sophisticated arrangement structures of hedgehog spines, and the bionic assembled SCs exhibit an enhanced specific areal capacitance (245.5 mF/cm2 at 1 mV/cm2), compared with the planar fabric-based SCs (41.6 mF/cm2), and a high energy density (21.82 Î¼Wh/cm2 at 0.4 mW/cm2). Besides, the SCs also show a stable capacitance ratio of 83.9% after 10 000 cycles and a mere capacitance loss under different bending states. As a proof of concept, an all-fabric smart electronic switch is fabricated with self-power and wearable properties, along with some other trial applications. Such a hierarchical fabric with a bionic fiber microarray structure is believed to enhance the performance of the assembled SCs. We foresee that the multidimensional hierarchical fabric would bring more promising prospects for flexible textile-based energy-storage systems and be used in smart wearable textile applications.
