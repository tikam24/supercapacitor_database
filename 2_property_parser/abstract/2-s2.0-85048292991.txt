Hybrid nanocomposites with different composition prepared from polyaniline (PAni) and exfoliated MoS2 and WS2 were prepared by a mechanochemical method and studied as electrodes of symmetrical supercapacitors (SSC). Nanoparticles of MoS2 and WS2 have been found to promote electrochemical reversibility of redox conversion in PAni at high potentials and contribute to the stability of these nanocomposites during prolonged charge-discharge cycling. The specific capacity of such materials can reach 600 F/g and the specific power of SSC can reach ~4.1 kW/kg for specific energy ~23.5 WÂ·h/kg.
