Thin films of manganese oxide doped with various percentages of cobalt oxide were grown by pulsed laser deposition on silicon wafers and stainless steel substrates. The films were characterized by Xray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy in order to identify their phases and microstructures. The pseudo-capacitance behavior of the Co-doped manganese oxide films were then evaluated using electrochemical cyclic voltammetry in an aqueous electrolyte. Their specific current and capacitance determined by electrochemical measurements were compared with undoped manganese oxide films, and the results show that Co-doped amorphous MnOx films have significantly higher specific current and capacitance than undoped amorphous MnOx films. The 3.0% Co-doped MnOx (i.e., Mn 0.970Co0.030Ox) film had the highest specific capacitance of 99 F g?1 at a 5 mV s?1 scan rate. However, Co-doped crystalline Mn2O3 films did not show an improvement in specific current and capacitance compared with undoped Mn 2O3 crystalline films. High Co doping level (20.7% doped) in the crystalline Mn2O3 films actually decreased both the specific current and capacitance values. These findings demonstrate that elemental doping is an effective way to improve the performance of pseudo-capacitive metal oxides. Â© 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
