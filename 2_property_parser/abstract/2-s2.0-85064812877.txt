Hierarchical bimetallic Ni-Co phosphides hollow spheres were encapsulated in P-doped reduced graphene oxide (PrGO)to provide superior electrochemistry performances. The hollow spheres with controlling Co/Ni ratios were obtained via a hydrothermal process and following phosphorization reaction using Ni-Co based glycerate microsphere as a self-sacrificing template. The hollow shell with vertical branches was formed via a morphology evolution of solid, yolk-shell to hollow. The hollow spheres were encapsulated in PrGO networks by a hydrothermal synthesis and phosphorization process to fabricate PrGO/Ni-Co phosphide composite (PrGO/NiCoP). Because of unique morphology and composition, the composite with a Ni/Co molar ratio of 1:1 exhibits enhanced supercapacitor and electrocatalysis properties. As a supercapacitor electrode, PrGO/NiCoP provides high discharge specific capacity, excellent rate performance and cycle stability. An asymmetric supercapacitor assembled with PrGO/NiCoP and activated carbon possesses an energy density of 49.7 Wh/Kg with power density of 0.366 kW/kg, which can successfully illuminate red-light light emitting diode. As an electrocatalyst, PrGO/NiCoP exhibits high hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction activities in 1 M KOH electrolyte. PrGO/NiCoP electrolyzer shows excellent overall water splitting performance and durability, which required a cell voltage of 1.56 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cmâˆ’2.
