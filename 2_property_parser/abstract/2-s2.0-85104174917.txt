Research carried out in this paper proposes a reduced sensor energy management system (EMS) for a DC microgrid with a hybrid energy storage system (HESS). The proposed system ensures continuous power supply to loads in a DC microgrid. The EMS considers the renewable power variation, availability of grid, state of charge of HESS and changes in local loads. without measuring load currents/powers, this system can detect the operating mode of system. In the proposed system, current stress on a battery can be reduced by supercapacitor and better DC link voltage regulation is achieved. The EMS also addresses extreme operating conditions such as load shedding, off-MPPT operation of PV, elimination of critical oscillation of HESS powers. With the time domain simulation studies, the performance of the proposed EMS is verified.
