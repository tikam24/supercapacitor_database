Supercapacitors are a boon in today's modern world. The role of a supercapacitor is important in providing electrical energy in the most efficient way for the usefulness of the society. Herein, co-precipitation technique was adapted to prepare electrodes for energy storage and water-splitting purposes. Role of ammonia at different concentrations was deliberated. Better 269 and 364 F/g capacitance was attained for best electrode from cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic chargeâ€“discharge (GCD) curves, respectively. The capacitive and diffusion contribution of all electrodes were estimated and found to be 91.88 and 8.12 for the best sample. A better diffusion contribution of the higher-concentration ammonia sample revealed a higher specific capacitance. In this study, 91.33% capacitive retention and 90.38% columbic efficiency were calculated after 5000 cycles of charge and discharge. Further electrochemical method like linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chronoamperometry (CA) was explored for water-splitting applications and 367 mA/g current density with 264 mV overpotential was achieved in the LSV plot. CA test was carried out for 10 h to reveal 189 mA/g current density and delivered 74% stability. Therefore, the present study describes different technique to extend electrochemical supercapacitor and water-splitting purposes.
