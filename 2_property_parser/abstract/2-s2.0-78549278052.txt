In order to increase the specific capacitance and energy density of supercapacitors, non-aqueous supercapacitors were prepared using lithium transition-metal oxides and activated carbons as active materials. The electrochemical properties were analyzed in terms of the content of lithium transition-metal oxides. The results of cyclic voltammetry and ACimpedance analyses showed that the pseudocapacitance may stem from the synergistic contributions of capacitive and faradic effects; the former is due to the electric double layer which is prepared in the interface of activated carbon and organic electrolyte, and the latter is due to the intercalation of lithium (Li+) ions. The specific capacitance and energy density of a supercapacitor improved as the lithium transition-metal oxides content increased, showing 60% increase compared to those of supercapacitor using a pure activated carbon positive electrode.
