Energy storage systems are wildly included in the electrical system to enhance the stability, power quality and reliability of the electrical systems as well as harnessing the high penetration of renewable energy sources. In this paper, assessment of application energy management in the microgrid system incorporating a hybrid energy storage system including batteries and supercapacitor unit. The energy management algorithm aims to enhance the system performance by diminishing the fluctuations of the DC link bus voltage of the microgrid. The simulation results reveal that the proposed energy management technique can improve system stability considerably.
