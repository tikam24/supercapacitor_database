To improve the electrochemical performance of electrode material for supercapacitor, coal-based activated carbons were prepared by two steps of physical-chemical activation. Firstly, the columnar activated carbon(AC-1) was prepared from Taixi anthracite by molding, carbonization and physical activation with CO2. After acid pickling and de-ashing, AC-1 was impregnated by KOH solution to obtain electrode material AC-2. The total yield of the two steps of activation is 45. 18%. The electrochemical tests of the as-prepared activated carbons were conducted in a three-electrode system and a double-layer capacitor system. Results show that when the concentration of KOH electrolyte is 6 mol/L, and the current density is 0.5 A/g, the specific capacitance rises from 68.5 F/g (AC-1) to 122.5 F/g (AC-2) in the three-electrode system, while improving from 75 F/g (AC-1) to 165.5 F/g (AC-2) in the button supercapacitor system. Moreover, AC-2 has favorable long cycle satiability. Its capacitance remains almost unchanged after 5 000 times of recycle. Compared with mere physical activation, the physically and chemically activated carbon has much higher total pore volume and mesopore volume, indicating better electrochemical performance.
