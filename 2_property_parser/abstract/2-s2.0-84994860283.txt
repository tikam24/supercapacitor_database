We fabricated graphene oxide (GO) films on glass substrates by blade coating a lyotropic GO liquid crystal dispersion. Substrate temperature and blading speed were precisely controlled to manipulate the surface morphologies of GO films. The temperature and blade speed influenced the drying rate of film and the amount GO dispersion supplied. By controlling these parameters, film-thickness modulation and three types of surface wrinkle patterns were selectively achieved. We also plotted the wrinkle patterns diagram as functions of the film fabrication conditions. The films exhibited different optical anisotropies depending on wrinkle patterns. GO films with controlled wrinkles can be used as electrodes for supercapacitor applications owing to the large surface areas.
