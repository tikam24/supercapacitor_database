In this paper, a sphere-like thulium/samarium mixed-metal MOF with 1-imidazole-carboxylate (IMC) as the organic linker (i.e. Tm,Sm-IMC-MOF) was grown onto Ni-foam (NF) porous support by one-step cathodic deposition procedure. The synthesized Tm,Sm-IMC-MOF material was characterized through XRD, FT-IR, TGA/DSC and FE-SEM/EDS techniques. The charge storage performance of the fabricated Tm,Sm-IMC-MOF/NF electrode was analyzed through CV and GCD tests, where a battery-like supercapacitive ability with a highest capacity of 645 C/g at 1 A/g was observed. The assembled Tm,Sm-IMC-MOF/NF//RGO/NF ASC device showed specific capacity of 239 C/g, areal capacity of 2.11 C cmâˆ’2 at 4 A/g and ~63 % capacity retention after increasing the applied current load from 1 to 20 A/g. The assembled ASC device exhibited 85.4 % and 91.5 % cycling retentions after 5000 cycles at 4 and 8 A/g, respectively. These results demonstrated that the fabricated Tm,Sm-IMC-MOF/NF electrode could be a promising candidate as active electrode material for electrochemical supercapacitors.
