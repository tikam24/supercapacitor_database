Paper describes the simulation model of energy harvesting of the 1575.42 MHz band (GPS L1 Band). Increase in pollution caused by the non renewable energy sources can be reduced by making use of renewable energy sources such as solar, mechanical vibration, thermal, microwave signals etc. There are multiple harvester circuits readily available in market but still rapid inventions are in progress. Harvested energy is used for charging of the battery operated system which has low power consumption. Inset feed patch antenna designed to receive the signal at 1575.42 MHz band. Rectifier and multiplier circuit is designed using Dickson voltage circuit and tested for the input power ranging from -10 dBm to +20 dBm. Matching circuit between antenna (RF 50 O line) and rectifier circuit is designed for efficient power transmission. Output of the rectifier is fed to the super capacitor which acts as an energy reservoir for the preceding stage. All the simulation is carried over in Keysight ADS and LtSpice XVII. Overall system efficiency of 35% is achieved in this work. Designed antenna has achieved gain of 3.127 dBi, directivity of 6.145, efficiency of 46.66% and return loss of 11.045 dB. Designed matching network inserted between antenna and rectifier has achieved a return loss of 25 dB. Harvesting system is verified for the input power ranging from -10 dB to +15 dB and load ranging from 100O to 30 kO.
