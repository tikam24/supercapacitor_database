The ultrathin, ternary nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4) nanosheets supported on Nickel foam (NF) were prepared via a facile two step process, which includes electrodeposition method combined with a thermal treatment. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterisation of as-prepared material demonstrates the nanostructure grown on Ni foam is consisted of NiCo2O4 layer and NiCo2O4 nanosheets. The as-prepared samples are directly fabricated as electrodes for supercapacitors, and the outstanding electrochemical performance of 2517 F g-1 is achieved at 1 A g-1 with a mass loading of 1Â·2 mg cm-2.The cyclic stability is also tested under current density of 8 A g-1, and 64% of initial capacitance is still maintained after 800 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance of the as-prepared nanosheets suggests their promising application as supercapacitor electrode material.
