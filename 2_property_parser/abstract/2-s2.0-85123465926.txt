Textile-based supercapacitors are promising flexible energy storage device that can provide stable power supply for wearable electronic devices. Herein, solid-state textile-based coplanar supercapacitors have been prepared by utilizing the cost-effective multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as integrated electrodes and current collectors. The integrated electrodes are fabricated with facile screen-printing process and show great potential of mass production. By optimizing the concentration of MWCNTs ink, porous and uniform conductive electrode network is formed on fabric substrate, which provide more active sites for electrolyte ions adsorption. The textile-based coplanar supercapacitors show great capacitive behavior and gravimetric specific capacitance of 26.4 F g−1 at scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Moreover, there is no significant change on the electrochemical performance of textile-based coplanar supercapacitor under dynamically bending with relatively high strain rate of 20% s−1, which demonstrates excellent flexibility and electrochemical stability. It provides an important strategy for the large-scale application and development of flexible supercapacitors.
