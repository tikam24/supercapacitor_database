Transition metal oxides have achieved tremendous attention in the field of supercapacitor devices due to their outstanding structural properties and capacitive behavior. Herein, a porous α-MoO3 microspheres (A-SMO) were synthesized with the aid of CrCl3.6H2O via a facile hydrothermal reaction and subsequent annealing treatment. The results showed that CrCl3.6H2O plays a crucial role in manipulating morphology and increasing the specific surface area of the as-prepared products. Moreover, annealing treatment could transform the crystal structure from metastable hexagonal MoO3 to stable orthogonal MoO3, which is more beneficial for electron storage due to the layered crystal structure. Furthermore, the A-SMO displayed an excellent specific capacitance of 201.4 F g−1 compared with the pristine MoO3 (MO) of 62.0 F g−1 and the annealed MO (A-MO) of 186.5 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1, when they were directly served as supercapacitor electrodes. This research demonstrates that the as-obtained α-MoO3 microspheres can serve as promising electrode materials for supercapacitors.
