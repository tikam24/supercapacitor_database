Supercapacitors have gained great interest as they could provide the high-power density and excellent cycling stability properties. According to the storage mechanisms, supercapacitors can be divided into an electrical double-layer capacitor (EDLC) and pseudocapacitor. Conducting polymers and their derivatives have been explored for supercapacitor electrode materials owing to their low electrical resistivity and high mechanical flexibility. However, they are suffered from high volume changes during the cycling process resulted in the poor lifecycle. Hybridization of conducting polymers with carbonaceous and transition metal oxides to form nanocomposites can enhance the electrochemical performances of supercapacitors.
