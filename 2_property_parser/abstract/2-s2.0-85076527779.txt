Developing high-performance electrode material with excellent flexibility still remains a big challenge. Herein, we report a simple interfacial polymerization method to fabricate interconnected polypyrrole (PPy) on a commercial nylon membrane (NM). Owing to the special and uniform microstructure of PPy/NM composite film, the free-standing electrode shows a maximal specific capacitance of 2911.4 mF cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2 and superior capacitance retention of 88.7% after charge/discharge for 10,000 cycles. The symmetric all-solid supercapacitor assembled by the PPy/NM composite film exhibits outstanding cyclic stability (capacitance retention of 92.4% after 5000 cycles) and excellent flexibility (capacitance decreasing by 3.3% after bending around a rod with a diameter of 9 mm for 1000 times). The results indicate that the PPy/NM composite film has great potential for high performance flexible supercapacitors.
