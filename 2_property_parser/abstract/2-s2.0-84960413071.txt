Compared with traditional energy storage battery, ultracapacitor is widely used for electric vehicle because of its friendly charge-discharge properties, while the key and foundation of this kind of vehicle is how to get ultracapacitor batteries charged. This paper adopts modular design method to design a hardware system of smart charger for ultracapacitors which uses single chip PIC with CAN function as control core and IGBT power components to make up DC/DC converter. The paper also makes a series of protection design in detail including under-voltage and over-voltage protection, default phase protection, over-current and short circuit protection, overheat protection and so on. CAN interface is designed in charging system for real-time data exchange between the charger and ultracapacitors, which provides a basis for closed-loop and smart control. Finally, we test the voltage stabilization precision of smart charger in condition of constant current, the change of IGBT temperature working in condition of different output power and charging time and work efficiency of charger. The results show that its performance index meets design requirement and it can operate reliably.
