Innovations in electric vehicle technology have led to a need for maximum energy storage in the energy source to provide some extra kilometers. The size of electric vehicles limits the size of the batteries, thus limiting the amount of energy that can be stored. Range anxiety amongst the crowd prevents the entire population from shifting to a completely electric mode of transport. The extra energy harnessed from the kinetic energy produced due to braking during deceleration is sent back to the batteries to charge them, a process known as regenerative braking, providing a longer range to the vehicle. The work proposes efficient machine learning-based methods used to harness maximum braking energy from an electric vehicle to provide longer mileage. The methods are compared to the energy harnessed using fuzzy logic and artificial neural network techniques. These techniques take into consideration the state of charge (SOC) estimation of the battery, or the supercapacitor and the brake demand, to calculate the energy harnessed from the braking power. With the proposed machine learning techniques, there has been a 59% increase in energy extraction compared to fuzzy logic and artificial neural network methods used for regenerative energy extraction.
