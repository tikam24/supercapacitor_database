This study is focused on the preparation of the CuS/RGO nanocomposite via the hydrothermal method using GO and Cu-DTO complex as precursors. X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study revealed the formation of the CuS/RGO nanocomposite with improved crystallinity, defective nanostructure, and the presence of the residual functional group in the RGO sheet. The morphological study displayed the transformation of CuS from nanowire to quantum dots with the incorporation of RGO. The galvanostatic charge/discharge curve showed that the CuS/RGO nanocomposite (12 wt % Cu-DTO complex) has tremendous and outperforming specific capacitance of 3058 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 current density with moderate cycling stability (âˆ¼60.3% after 1000 cycles at 10 A g-1). The as-prepared nanocomposite revealed excellent improvement in specific capacitance, cycling stability, Warburg impedance, and interfacial charge transfer resistance compared to neat CuS. The fabricated nanocomposites were also investigated for their bulk DC electrical conductivity and EMI shielding ability. It was observed that the CuS/RGO nanocomposite (9 wt % Cu-DTO) exhibited a total electromagnetic shielding efficiency of 64 dB at 2.3 GHz following absorption as a dominant shielding mechanism. Such a performance is ascribed to the presence of interconnected networks and synergistic effects.
