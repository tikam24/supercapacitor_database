The energy density of supercapacitors could be improved significantly using microporous carbon-based materials (MP-CMs) with multitudinous redox-active heteroatoms through the hybrid charge storage behaviors of both pseudocapacitance and electrochemical double layer capacitance in a redox-mediated aqueous electrolyte system. Waste-derived MP-CMs were prepared using a simple activation process and used as high-performance electrode materials for redox-mediated supercapacitors, showing a high specific capacitance of ˜512 F g−1 and a reasonable rate and cycling performance.
