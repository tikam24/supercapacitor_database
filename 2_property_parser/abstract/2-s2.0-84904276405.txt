Nanoscale cobalt oxide (Co3O4) particles are produced on three-dimensional nickel/silicon microchannel plates (Ni/Si-MCPs) as the active electrode materials in miniature supercapacitors. The Co 3O4 nano-flakes are fabricated on the surface and interior of the Ni/Si-MCPs by annealing the nano-structured Co(OH)2/Ni/Si- MCPs, and the electrical conductivity and capacitance retention are improved. The Ni/Si-MCPs covered with nano-flaked Co3O4 supercapacitor offer smaller charging current leakage and higher discharging voltage than Ni/Si-MCPs electrodeposited with cobalt hydroxide {Co(OH) 2}. Specific capacitance as high as 2.424 F/cm2 or 606.24 F/g is achieved from the materials and the retention ratio is 89.85% after 2000 cycles thus demonstrating excellent potential in miniature supercapacitors.
