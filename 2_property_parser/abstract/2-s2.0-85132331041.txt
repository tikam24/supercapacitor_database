Moringa Oleifera leaf extract has been prepared and used as an environmental-friendly reducing agent. Reduced graphene oxide (RGO) has been decorated with vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) in presence of Moringa Oleifera leaf extract to generate a RGO/V2O5 nanocomposite. Analytical, spectroscopic, and electrochemical characterizations of synthesized V2O5, RGO, and RGO/V2O5nanocomposite have been used to evaluate its morphology and structure. The RGO production and recombination with V2O5 are confirmed by the Characterization result. RGO, V2O5, and RGO/V2O5 nanocomposite have been evaluated for their electrochemical performances in supercapacitor applications by using various electrochemical techniques. The enhanced specific capacitance of 906 Fg−1 has been accomplished for RGO/V2O5 nanocomposite compared to 146 and 535 Fg−1 for V2O5 and RGO, respectively, at 2 mVs−1 scan rate using cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique. Chronopotentiometry technique has also been evaluated and observed the specific capacitance of 380 Fg−1 at a current density of 0.5 Ag−1. RGO/V2O5 nanocomposite could be a choice of material in energy storage devices.
