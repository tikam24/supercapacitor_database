In this study, we successfully prepare porous carbon (PC) nanostructure derived from bituminous coal that shows it as a hopeful hydrogen storage adsorbent. The PC is characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscope (FT-IR), N2 adsorption/desorption (BET), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The PC shows high ultramicroporosity and high total pore volume. This prepared PC achieves an excellent discharge capacity equal to 3485 mAh/g (corresponding to a hydrogen storage capacity of 11.6 wt%) at room temperature. Moreover, our results suggest that this PC can store H2 in the range of 10.1â€“11.6 wt% which meets the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) purpose of 2020. Due to its exceptional characteristics, this PC provides reversible higher hydrogen storage capacities than the previously reported porous carbons.
