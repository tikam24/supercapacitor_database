Supercapacitors or ultracapacitors (electrochemical capacitors) have attracted lots of attraction in the last few decades, because of the increase in demand for high energy and power storage. These supercapacitor devices earned numerous applications to power hybrid electric vehicles and other electronic devices which require electrical energy for their operations. Due to population increase, the usage of vehicles increases as well as the fuel price. Concerning the price of the fuel and the environment, the research community now focuses on developing high charge storage battery-propelled electrical vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles. A supercapacitor is a most versatile device which can deliver electrical energy in a short period of time with a long cycle span, yet this kind of hybrid capacitor faces technical problems in reaching industrial expectations. In this chapter, we are going to see about the types of supercapacitors present today in the market for the transportation application including electric cars and buses and their charging stations, especially how TESLA designed their fully electrical cars, how to bring down the price of the market by discussing the electrode material of the supercapacitors present in the recent model Tesla electric car, continues with the future perspectives and challenges.
