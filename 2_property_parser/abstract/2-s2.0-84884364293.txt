The pseudocapacitance and morphology of electrodeposited transition metal oxides depend significantly on the morphology of the substrate. The nanoporous nickel substrate, derived from selective electro-dissolution of antimony from an electro-deposited Ni-Sb alloy, effectively promotes the electrochemical utilization of manganese oxide deposited on this structure. The large electronic and ionic conduction within the nanostructured deposit improve the energy storage performance of Mn oxide as compared to that on flat Ni substrate. In this work, the MnO2 specific capacitances of around 612 F g-1 were obtained, which was five times higher than Mn oxide deposited on a flat Ni-ribbon. A highly porous electrode having improved electrochemical capacitance has been fabricated by simple and efficient electrochemical procedures. Â© 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.
