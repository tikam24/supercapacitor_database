Electrochemical capacitors, a type of capacitor also known by the product names Supercapacitor or Ultracapacitor, can provide short-term energy storage in a wide range of applications. These capacitors are powerful, have extremely high cycle life, store energy efficiently, and operate with unexcelled reliability. This article discusses highly-reversible energy storage, presents electrochemical capacitor basics, and identifies several resources that may be useful to a researcher who wishes to participate in this technology arena. A perspective on the future of electrochemical capacitor technology is offered.
