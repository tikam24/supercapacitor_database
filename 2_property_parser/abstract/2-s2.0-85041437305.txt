Active voltage balance has been a popular voltage balance method in high power supercapacitor applications. In this paper, an improved active voltage balance strategy is proposed for renewable generation energy storage systems. First, we propose an improved active voltage balance circuit based on the multi-winding transformer. A clamping capacitor is inserted in the primary side of the transformer to provide a better transient performance. Then a simple but efficient control logic is proposed to decide the sequence of cells to be charged. The supercapacitor is modeled as a RC equivalent circuit. Instead of balancing the terminal voltage of cells, we use an constant-current charging method to identify the parameters of supercapacitors, and calculate the equivalent capacitor voltage, which is further used in the voltage balance. Experiment results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the design.
