We demonstrate a novel preparative strategy for the well-controlled MnCo<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4.5</inf>MnO<inf>2</inf> hierarchical nanostructures. Both δ-MnO<inf>2</inf> nanosheets and α-MnO<inf>2</inf> nanorods can uniformly decorate the surface of MnCo<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4.5</inf> nanowires to form core-shell heterostructures. Detailed electrochemical characterization reveals that MnCo<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4.5</inf>δ-MnO<inf>2</inf> pattern exhibits not only high specific capacitance of 357.5 F g<sup>-1</sup> at a scan rate of 0.5 A g<sup>-1</sup>, but also good cycle stability (97% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles at a scan rate of 5 A g<sup>-1</sup>), which make it have a promising application as a supercapacitor electrode material.
