In this paper, WO3 nanowires were successfully synthesized via a one-step water bath method at an appropriate temperature. The XRD (Energy Dispersive Spectrometer), SEM (Scanning electron microscope), TEM (Transmission Electron Microscope) and other characterization methods proved that the synthesized product was WO3, and the product of water bath reaction for 9 h showed the nanowires’ structure. The nanowires were evenly distributed, and the length ranged from 2 µm to 4 µm. The results showed that the nanowires had excellent light transmittance (66%), a very short response time (1.2 s, 2 s) and excellent color rendering efficiency (115.2 cm2 C−1 ) at 650 nm. The electrochemical performance test showed that the specific capacity of the WO3 nanowires was up to 565 F/g at 1 A/g. Change the different current densities and cycle 100 times, then return to the initial current density, accounting for 99% of the initial specific capacity of 565 F/g. We used this method for the first time to prepare tungsten oxide nanowires and investigated the bifunctional properties of the material, namely the electrochromic and capacitive properties. All of these data indicate that WO3 nanorods have excellent electrochromic and electrochromic properties and have potential market prospects in the fields of electrochromic glass, variable glasses, advertising, and supercapacitors.
