Rapidly growing improvement of portable and wearable devices stimulates requirements for multifunction tactile electronics. Herein, we report a novel electrochemical-driving supercapacitor-mode self-powered tactile sensor based on polygonal litchi–like nanospheres embedded 3D reduced graphene oxide aerogel framework, which displays outstanding compressibility to accommodate complex external conditions such as large-scale mechanical deformations. The sensor has the power to realize function of both strain compression sensing and energy storage capabilities simultaneously. The porosity of aerogels and pseudocapacitance property of polygonal litchi–like CoV2O6 nanospheres endows the composite aerogel with superior electrochemical performance with energy density of 139.18 Wh kg−1 at 500.0 W kg−1. Taking advantage of splendid elasticity of aerogel structure, self-powered supercapacitor-mode sensor response to external pressure signal sensitively. The self-powered sensor not only presents promising potentials in wireless charging system, but also expands the practical application areas of electrochemical energy storage device greatly.
