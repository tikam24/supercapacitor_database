Supercapacitors are one of the promising devices for the accumulation and storage of electrical energy. The purpose of this study is to develop a synthesis and modification method of carbon material to improve the electrochemical characteristics of a supercapacitor. In the proposed study, by varying the sequence and parameters of the processes of carbonization, mechanoactivation and thermochemical activation, the conditions for obtaining nanoporous carbon with a specific surface area of 2200 (Â±50) m2/g from walnut shells (WSs) are optimized. In addition, to increase the electrochemical efficiency of the electrode material, the resulting nanoporous carbon was modified with nickel oxide (NiO) nanoparticles by the thermochemical method. It is shown that the modification with nickel oxide nanoparticles makes it possible to increase the specific capacitance of the supercapacitor electrode by 16% compared to the original unmodified nanoporous carbon material.
