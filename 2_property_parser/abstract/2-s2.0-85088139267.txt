Nowadays, for electrochemical energy storage, supercapacitors epitomize a well-known candidate. But the shortcoming of the low energy density of supercapacitors restricts its commercial applications. In this article, we propose assembling of NiCo2O4 nanorods over the layered network of CoWO4 nanostructures as a high performance binder free supercapacitive electrode material by applying hydrothermal construction with post annealing method. After a brief characterization method, we analyzed its capacitive behavior. The electrochemical properties of CoWO4/NiCo2O4 nanostructures are enhanced by the individual electrode of NiCo2O4 nanorods and CoWO4 nanostructures. The improved nature is attributed due to the synergistic effects between the surfaces of electrode materials and electrolyte ions with the low value of electrolyte resistance and charge transfer resistance of the binder-free electrode. This approach provides a new methodology for scheming high-performance electrode materials with exceptional specific capacitance with charge rates for the long-lived performance of electrochemical energy storage devices.
