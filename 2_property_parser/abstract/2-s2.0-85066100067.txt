Flexible fiber-based supercapacitors applied in portable energy storage devices and wearable electronics have recently aroused widespread research interests. However, challenges still exist in the pursuit of facile fabrication technique for simultaneously realizing high capacitive performance and excellent mechanical stability. Here, two novel types of core-sheathed hybrid electrodes with carbon nanotube fiber (CNF) as the core and three-dimensional (3D) porous carbon nanotubes/polypyrrole (CNTs/PPy) or reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as the sheath were hierarchically constructed through one-pot electrochemical deposition. An all-solid-state asymmetric fiber-shaped supercapacitor was assembled by wrapping the gel electrolyte coated negative CNF/rGO electrode along the positive CNF/CNTs/PPy electrode. Thanks to the combination of abundant 3D pore structure and synergistic effect of different components in the fiber electrodes, the resulted supercapacitors exhibited a broadened potential window of 1.6 V, a high areal specific capacitance of 58.82 mF cm−2 and a high areal energy density of 20.91 μW h cm−2. It should be noted that 98.6% of the initial capacitance of the supercapacitor device can still be maintained after experiencing 200 reciprocating bending cycles, demonstrating outstanding mechanical stability. Moreover, the supercapacitor exhibited excellent cyclic performance, which was testified by 90% capacity retention after 10000 times of galvanostatic charge-discharge process.
