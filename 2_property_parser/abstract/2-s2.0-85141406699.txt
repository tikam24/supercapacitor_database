Polyaniline (PANI) is a promising conductive polymer for use in energy storage applications. Here, a one-step hydrothermal method of PANI polymerization on carbon felt electrode was synthesized using an azo dye, a bisulfonated dichloro anionic dye molecule to enhance an efficient textile-based flexible supercapacitor electrode material for energy storage applications. The electrode material synthesized at concentration of 2 mM AY17 exhibits 814.1 F g-1 at the scan rate of 5 mV s-1 with multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Due to electrostatic interaction with the polymer, the presence of high electronegativity Cl atoms in the dye molecule significantly improves the PANI structure's electron donor/acceptor properties. A symmetric supercapacitor exhibits an energy density of 11.7 W h kg−1 at a power density of 300 W kg−1, and it is 4.5 W h kg−1 at 1800 W kg−1 in 3.0 M KCl aqueous electrolyte. The capacitance retention performance value of the symmetric supercapacitor exhibited 81.76% after 2500 cycles.
