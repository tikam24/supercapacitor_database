We first present a new aqueous zinc-ion (Zn-ion) capacitor based on vanadium pentoxide (V205) cathode, activated carbon (AC) anode, and 2 mol路L-1zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate (Zn(TfO)2) electrolyte. The Zn-ion capacitor possesses a wide electrochemical window of 1.4 V, good rate capability and cycling stability. The XRD data demonstrates that the Zn2+ion serving as the charge carrier could be reversibly intercalated into the V205. This capacitor delivered a power density of 181 W路kg-1and an energy density of 4.5 Wh路kg-1at 1000 mA路g-1. This work may open up new opportunities for developing multivalent ion-based electrochemical capacitors.
