Supercapacitor electrodes have received much attention for energy storage devices, but they often suffer from unsatisfying rate properties and limited intrinsic conductivity. Herein, core–shell Cu–Co–Se–P arrays were developed via hydrothermal strategy, followed by selenisation and phosphorisation. Owing to the core–shell arrays with porous structures, Cu–Co–Se–P electrodes showed an exceptional specific capacity of approximately 12 F cm−2 at 5 mA cm−2 and good cycle stability (81.2% after 10,000 cycles). In addition, the supercapacitor device based on Cu–Co–Se–P electrodes exhibited good flexible properties. The results offer a new method to develop mixed phosphides and selenides for supercapacitor applications.
