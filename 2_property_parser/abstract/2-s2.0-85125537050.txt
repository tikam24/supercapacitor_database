Ternary nanocomposite comprising of manganese ferrite/poly (3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/reduced graphene oxide (MnFe2O4/PEDOT/rGO) is synthesized by hydrothermal method. The synthesized nanocomposite is observed to have the crystallite size of approximate 19 nm. In situ incorporation of MnFe2O4 decorated PEDOT layers into rGO has enhanced the ion transportation by providing sufficient interconnected path. The better ion transportation has decreased the resistance of bare ferrite by three orders of magnitude (107 Ω). The synergistic charge storage mechanism of individual components in ternary nanocomposite is evaluated. The energy storage has taken place due to the synergistic effect of Mn2+ and Fe3+ ions as evaluated from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The synthesized nanocomposite has shown both EDLC and pseudocapacitive behavior with good specific capacitance of 298.97 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 current density and 325 F g−1 at 2 mV s−1 scan rate. The material has shown high electrochemical stability with retention of 81% of capacitance over 5000 cycles. The nanocomposite also shows good capacitance retention of 87 F g−1 at higher current density of 10 A g−1. Altogether, the synthesized ternary nanocomposite with the better ion transportation could be utilized as an electrode material for supercapacitor fabrication.
