The templated mesoporous carbon(TMC) was prepared using SBA-15 as a template and sucrose as a carbon source at 700Â°C carbonized temperature. The structure and morphology of mesoporous carbon were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm. The electrochemical properties of mesoporous carbon which was used as the active material of coin supercapacitor were studied by cyclic voltammery, constant current charge-discharge, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, leakage current, self-discharge, and cycle life measurements. The results show that the sample possesses two-dimensional (2-D) hexagonally ordered mesoporous structure, and the pore volume of the sample is 1.88 cm3/g, the specific surface area is 1394 m2/g; it possesses mesoporous structure and narrow pore size distribution, the average pore size is 3.4 nm. The supercapacitor has good electrochemical performance, the specific capacitance is 95 F/g at a charge/discharge current density of 500 mA/g after 10000 cycles, and specific capacitance fluctuates between -4% and 4%.
