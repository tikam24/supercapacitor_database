3D printing-based supercapacitors have been extensively explored, yet the rigid rheological requirement for corresponding ink preparation significantly limits the manufacturing of true 3D architecture in achieving superior energy storage. We proposed the stereolithographic technique to fabricate the metallic composite lattices with octet-truss arrangement by using electroless plating and engineering the 3D hierarchically porous graphene onto the scaffolds to build the hierarchically cellular lattices in quasi-solid supercapacitor application. The supercapacitor device that is composed of composite lattices span several pore size orders from nm to mm holds promising behavior on the areal capacitance (57.75 mF cm−2), rate capability (70% retention, 2–40 mA cm−2), and long lifespan (96% after 5000 cycles), as well as superior energy density of 0.008 mWh cm−2, which are comparable to the state-of-the-art carbon-based supercapacitor. By synergistically combining this facile stereolithographic 3D printing technology with the hierarchically porous graphene architecture, we provide a novel route of manufacturing energy storage device as well as new insight into building other high-performance functional electronics.[Figure not available: see fulltext.].
