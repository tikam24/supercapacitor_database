In this paper, carbon aerogel was prepared by the polycondensation of resorcinol (R) with formaldehyde (F), and sodium carbonate was added as a catalyst (C). MnO2 powders for the application of supercapacitor was prepared by using KMnO4 and Mn(CH3COO)2Â·4H2O as raw materials, MnO2/CRF composite electrode materials were prepared by a chemical precipitation method. Physical properties of MnO2, CRF and MnO2/CRF were characterized by N2 adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that carbon aerogel is an amorphous material with a pearly network structure, the MnO2 possessed nanoscaled structure and the MnO2/CRF composite materials were nano-size particles. Electrochemical performances of the MnO2/CRF composite electrodes with different ratio were studied. Good electrochemical performances of MnO2/CRF composite electrodes were confirmed by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurement. The results indicated that MnO2/CRF composite electrodes have high reversibility and excellent charge-discharge property. However, when the loading amount of MnO2 was 60%, the specific capacitance of MnO2/CRF could reach 226.3 F/g, the capacitance of composite electrode was about two times larger than that of carbon aerogel electrode. Besides, this supercapacitor with MnO2/CRF composite electrodes had an ideal capacitance properties, good cycle life.
