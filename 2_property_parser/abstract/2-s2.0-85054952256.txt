A method described on obtaining of graphene oxide from the crystalline graphite flakes (silvery grey black), by a modified Hummers' method followed with obtaining of reduced graphene and few-layer graphite. The structure and electrical properties of obtained materials are provided. The possibility to create a cheap flexible electrode of high capacitance based on the polyethylene substrate and a layer of conductive paint is demonstrated.
