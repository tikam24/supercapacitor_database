Polyimide-based nitrogen-doped ordered mesoporous carbon was successfully synthesised utilising SBA-15 as a hard template. By controlling the molar ratio of 4,4′-oxydianiline to pyromellitic dianhydride during copolymerising and carbonisation, nitrogen-doped ordered mesoporous carbon (NOMCx) with various nitrogen content and pore distribution were obtained. When the molar ratio of 4,4′-oxydianiline to pyromellitic dianhydride was 6, NOMC6 presented the highest content of nitrogen (7.94 wt%) and moderate specific surface area (890 m2 g−1). Accordingly, NOMC6 showed a high specific capacitance of 282 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, and excellent cycle stability (no capacitance loss over 10,000 cycles) in 1 M H2SO4. The synthesised ordered mesoporous carbons do not show a significant decrease of capacitive performance in the current density range of 2 to 20 A g−1. Furthermore, a symmetrical supercapacitor consisting of two NOMC6 electrodes exhibited an energy density of 4.77 Wh kg−1 at power density of 500 W kg−1 (1 A g−1).
