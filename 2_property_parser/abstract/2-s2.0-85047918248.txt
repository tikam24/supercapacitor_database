In this work, we have reported a nanocomposite, composed of a BiFeO3 nanowire and reduced graphene oxide (BFO-RGO), as an electrode material for a high-performance supercapacitor. A facile hydrothermal method was employed to prepare BFO-RGO nanocomposite. The electrochemical measurements were performed by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The specific capacitance of the BFO-RGO nanocomposite was 928.43 F g-1 at current density 5 A g-1, which is superior to that of pure BiFeO3. Additionally, this nanocomposite shows good cyclic stability, and âˆ¼87.51% of specific capacitance is retained up to 1000 cycles. It also exhibits a high charge density of 18.62 W h kg-1 when the power density is 950 W kg-1. These attractive results suggest the potential of BiFeO3 nanowire-RGO nanocomposite as an active material for the construction of a high-performance supercapacitor electrode. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the application of BiFeO3 nanowire-RGO nanocomposite as a supercapacitor has been reported.
