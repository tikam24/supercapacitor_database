A hydrothermal method was employed to synthetise NaV6O15 nanobelts, then nanobelts were annealed in air, the nanorods (NRs) were obtained at 350â„ƒ, which possess a length and diameter of 500nm and 100nm, respectively. NaV6O15 NRs as the electrode of supercapacitor exhibit significantly improved electrochemical performance compared with the untreated NaV6O15 electrode, and yield a high specific capacitance (402.8F/g at 300mA/g). Furthermore, the annealing treated nanorods show excellent cycling stability (80% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles at a scan rate of 100mV/s), this can be ascribed to that annealing turns the amorphous NaV6O15 into crystalline. These findings may further broaden the application of NaV6O15-based materials for high performance supercapacitors (SCs), aqueous rechargeable lithium batteries and Li-ion capacitors.
