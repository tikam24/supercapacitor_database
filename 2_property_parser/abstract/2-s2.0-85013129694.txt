Transition metal materials, NiS, NiO and NiSe2, with a uniform hollow-structure were obtained based on NiS2 hollow spheres, and were successfully synthesized with an l-cysteine assisted hydrothermal method at 120 °C. The electrochemical properties of the NiS2, NiS, NiO and NiSe2 hollow sphere electrodes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests. Firstly, the cyclic voltammetry curves of the four materials all displayed pseudo-capacitance behaviour. Moreover, the galvanostatic charge-discharge tests showed that the specific capacitance of the NiS2, NiS, NiO and NiSe2 electrodes was 1643 F g−1, 1076 F g−1, 581 F g−1 and 341 F g−1, respectively, at a current density of 1 A g−1. After 1000 cycles, the specific capacitance of the NiS2, NiS, NiO and NiSe2 electrodes was retained at 455 F g−1, 368 F g−1, 246 F g−1 and 269 F g−1, respectively. The results implied that both the NiS2 and NiS electrodes exhibited higher specific capacitance, while the NiO and NiSe2 electrodes showed a longer cycling life. This work highlights the advantageous electrochemical performance of the different nickel compounds, and contributes to providing a good reference for the preparation of superior supercapacitor materials with high performance.
