Novel Cu2O/MoS2/rGO nanostructure has been synthesized using simple and cost-effective microwave method. SEM and TEM observations confirm spherically-shaped Cu2O nanoparticles coated simultaneously with MoS2 and rGO thin layers. The nanocomposite electrode exhibits high specific capacitance of 388F/g with excellent cyclic stability of 95.6% retained over 3000 chargeâ€“discharge cycles. The as-fabricated nanomaterial is a potential candidate for supercapacitor applications.
