Flexible and wearable electronics have recently attracted increasing attention, because they can open up new possibilities for next-generation portable devices. Cellulose paper serves various purposes in daily life, including in writing, printing, wrapping, and packaging applications. Since paper materials are sustainable, mass produced, inexpensive, biocompatible, recyclable, lightweight, and flexible, the use of paper has recently been extended to flexible electronic applications. In this chapter, we describe cellulose-based flexible paper electronics. Wood-derived cellulose pulp or nanocellulose is composited with conductive nanomaterials such as silver nanowires, carbon nanotubes, and graphene. The as-prepared paper composites are successfully applied as transparent conductive paper, paper antenna, paper sensor, and paper supercapacitor. These paper devices demonstrated both high device performance and flexibility compared with the state-of-the-art polymer-based flexible devices. Our findings provide a promising route to realize green and flexible paper electronics.
