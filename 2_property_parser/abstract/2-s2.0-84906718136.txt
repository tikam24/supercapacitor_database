The paper first outlines control strategies for all three cooperating energy sources of TriHyBus and conditions for their cooperation. For optimization of routine operation of the bus a mathematical model in MATLAB© - Simulink© has been developed at Department of Power Engineering, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague. The solution of power flow consists of control strategies for fuel cell, charging of batteries and supercapacitor, and conditions for both limiting situations: lack and surplus of energy on the main bus. In the second part of the paper the MATLAB© model is tested and verified by data obtained from the actual operation of the bus and the conclusions about differences between the model and the actual operation are made. © The Electrochemical Society.
