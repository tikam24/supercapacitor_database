Lithium-ion capacitor (LIC) is a promising energy storage device, which combines double advantages of high-energy lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and high-power supercapacitors. However, the reported anode materials for LICs are synthesized based on the high-purity chemicals under complicated and time-consuming conditions, which exhibit a prohibitive cost in practical application. Herein, natural molybdenite is employed as the precursor to construct a high-capacity and low-cost anode material of LICs. Specifically, molybdenite is exfoliated into thin-layer MoS2 under the interaction of hydrazine hydrate and sodium hydroxide, and then coupled with reduced graphene oxide to form a MoS2@rGO composite. Resulting from high reactive activity and structural stability, the MoS2@rGO anode shows excellent lithium-ion storage performance including high specific capacity (936 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1) and rate capability (446 mAh g−1 at 5000 mA g−1). By using MoS2@rGO as an anode and activated carbon as a cathode, the assembled LIC device provides a maximum energy density of 105 Wh kg−1. Even at a high power density of 25 000 W kg−1, the energy density is still up to 65 Wh kg−1. This work provides a reference for the commercial utilization of natural molybdenum resources in the energy storage field.
