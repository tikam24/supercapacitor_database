This paper deals the supercapacitor (SC) and battery energy management in Hybrid Vehicle applications. The main goal of this study is based on embedded energy share between these sources using a full bridge converter topology. The originality of this paper is focused on full bridge converter control methodology for embedded energy management. The proposed strategy is based on classical PI controller. This strategy is implemented on PIC18F4431 microcontroller for full bridge converter control. For reasons of cost and existing components (no optimized) such as the planar transformer, the inductances, the batteries and power semiconductors (IGBT), the experimental test bench is designed in reduced scale. Some experimental results, obtained from this strategy are presented and analyzed. Â©2009 IEEE.
