This study aimed to prepare activated carbon obtained from biomass waste of lamtoro fruit peel, Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) (LAC), and analyze its physical as well as electrochemical properties. The preparation process used a simple, uncomplicated, and cost-effective technique that does not require additional adhesive to increase the use value of biomass waste. Furthermore, impregnation with low ZnCl2 concentrations at 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 M was performed to maximize the potential of LAC to produce the best conditions from the electrode with the highest specific capacitance. The results showed that the LAC-0.3 sample had the best physical and electrochemical properties with the carbon content reaching 93.05 % and the availability of 6.89 % oxygen heteroatom doping. Besides, the large number of irregular porous lumps in the sample can increase the electrochemical performance of the carbon electrode from 74F/g to 176F/g, with an optimum energy density of 26.81 Wh kg-1 and a power density of 96.6 W kg-1 obtained using the GCD method. Electrochemical testing for LAC samples was carried out at a low potential of 0-1 V with a scan rate of 1 mV s-1 and an aqueous electrolyte of 1 M H2SO4. These findings showed the extraordinary potential of lamtoro fruit peel waste as a basic material for making activated carbon electrodes for supercapacitor with competitive capacitance.
