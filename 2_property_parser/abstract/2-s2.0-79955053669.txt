Ordered mesoporous carbon/PbO host-guest composites were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method. The XRD, TEM and N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms tests confirm the host-guest structure of the composites. The PbO loading amount affects the structure and electrochemical properties of the composites and the optimum amount of Pb (NO3)2 added is found to be 60 % of that of the saturated solution. Besides, the specific capacitance of the composite (83 F g-1) is more than twice of that of the pristine PbO (37 F g-1) at the scan rate of 5 mV s-1 and is more or less equal to that of the ordered mesoporous carbon at the scan rate of 200 mV s-1 (the specific capacitance of the composite is 58 F g-1), demonstrating excellent rate capability. Furthermore, the composite electrode material shows a stable cycle life in the potential range of 0-0.9 V after 500 cycles. Â© J. New Mat. Electrochem. Systems.
