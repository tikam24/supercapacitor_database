Solutions of novel fluorinated lithium dodecaborate (Li2B 12FxH12-x) salts have been evaluated as electrolytes in nonaqueous asymmetric supercapacitors with Li4Ti 5O12 as negative electrode, and activated carbon (AC) as positive electrode. The results obtained with these new electrolytes were compared with those obtained with cells built using standard 1 M LiPF 6 dissolved in ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate (EC:DMC; 1:1, v/v) as electrolyte. The specific energy, rate capability, and cycling performances of nonaqueous asymmetric cells based on these new electrolyte salts were studied. Cells assembled using the new fluoroborate salts show excellent reversibility, coulombic efficiency, rate capability and improved cyclability when compared with the standard electrolyte. These features confirm the suitability of lithium-fluoro-borate based salts to be used in nonaqueous asymmetric supercapacitors. Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V.
