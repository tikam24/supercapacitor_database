Recently, hierarchical porous materials have received tremendous attention in electrochemical supercapacitors and CO 2 adsorption. Both areas of application have a positive impact on global warming by reducing CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere. Herein, we synthesized new silica-based ceramic monoliths composed of polysiloxane microspheres sheathed by carbon allotropes (Graphene or MWCNT) and metal nanoparticles. The as-synthesized hybrid ceramics show a high specific surface area of 540 m 2 g −1 with hierarchical micro-/meso-/macroporous structures. With the structural benefits, the obtained ceramics exhibits excellent performance in supercapacitors and for CO 2 adsorption as probed in this study. As an electrode material for supercapacitor, the hybrid ceramics delivered the specific capacitance of 93 F/g at 2 mV s −1 in 0.5 M KOH electrolyte solution with a capacity retention of 88% after 50 cycles. Further, as a solid adsorbent, the hybrid ceramics shows the maximum CO 2 adsorption capacity of 2 mmol g −1 at 100 kPa equilibrium pressure and 303 K, while maintaining 98% capacity retention after 10 cycles. Thus, the hybrid ceramics with its unusual properties make them a promising candidate for both, supercapacitors and CO 2 capture in the sheer physical adsorption process.
