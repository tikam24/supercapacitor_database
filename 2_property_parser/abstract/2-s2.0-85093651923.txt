In this work, we report the synthesis of layered 2H–MoSe2 nanosheets via an in-situ selenization route and investigated their electrochemical charge storage performance. The structure and morphology of the as-synthesized samples have been investigated systematically. The electrochemical performance of the MoSe2 nanosheets towards the supercapacitor has been probed by a three-electrode cell configuration in 2 M KOH electrolyte solution. The prepared MoSe2 nanosheets show excellent electrochemical performance with a specific capacity of 46.22 mAh g−1 at a current density of 2 Ag-1. The MoSe2 electrode exhibit remarkable cyclic stability up to 2000 charge-discharge cycles. In addition, the fabricated MoSe2 symmetric supercapacitor delivered a specific capacitance of 4.1 Fg-1 at a current density of 0.5 Ag-1. It exhibited high cyclic stability with capacitance retention of 105% and high coulombic efficiency of 100% even after 10000 cycles. The high specific capacity and good cyclic stability of the MoSe2 nanosheets suggest its application as an efficient electrode material for electrochemical supercapacitor.
