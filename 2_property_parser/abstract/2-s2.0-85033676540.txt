Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanoflowers consisting of hybridized 1T/2H phases have been synthesized by using a microwave-assisted hydrothermal (MTH) method. The concentration of the 1T phase, ranging from 40 % to 73 %, is controlled by simply adjusting the ratio of the Mo and S precursors. By using the hybridized 1T/2H MoS2 as an electrode material, it was demonstrated that the resulting supercapacitor performance is dominated by the 1T phase concentration. It was found that a supercapacitor with 73 % 1T phase exhibits excellent capacitance of 259 F gâˆ’1 and great cyclic stability after 1000 cycles. The formation mechanism of the MHT-synthesized hybridized 1T/2H MoS2 is also reported. More importantly, the mechanism also explains the observed relationship between the 1T phase concentration and the ratio of the Mo and S precursors.
