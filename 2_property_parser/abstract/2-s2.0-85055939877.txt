Hierarchical porous NiCo2S4 nanostructure directly grown on Ni foam (HP-NiCo2S4/NF) as a bind-free electrode for hybrid supercapacitors has been successfully developed through a facile and efficient hydrothermal method. Such hierarchical nanostructure is constructed with interconnected ultrathin NiCo2S4 nanosheets subunits, forming numerous interspaces. The novel structure not only exposes more reaction active sites but also facilitates fast ion and electron transport. In addition, the integrated bind-free architecture ensures good conductivity. As a result, the as-fabricated HP-NiCo2S4/NF exhibits a high specific capacity of 1209.7 C g− 1 at a current rate of 1 mA cm− 2, while maintaining an excellent rate capability and satisfactory cycling stability. Furthermore, an aqueous hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) device has been successfully assembled by employing HP-NiCo2S4/NF and activated carbon (AC) as positive electrode and negative electrode, respectively. The optimized device delivers a maximum energy density of 69.4 Wh kg− 1 at a power density of 372.1 W kg− 1. Moreover, energy density still retains a high value of 44.6 Wh kg− 1 when power density reaches as high as 14.9 kW kg− 1. Meanwhile, an excellent cycling stability of 94.48% capacitance retention is obtained after 2000 cycles.
