Phosphorus oxide modified graphene was prepared by one-step electrochemical anodic exfoliation method and utilized as electrode in a redox supercapacitor that contained potassium iodide in electrolytes. The whole preparation process was completed in a few minutes and the yield was about 37.2%. The prepared sample has better electrocatalysis activity for I−/I−3 redox reaction than graphite due to the good charge transfer performance between phosphorus oxide and iodide ions. The maximum discharge specific capacitance is 1634.2 F/g when the current density is 3.5 mA/cm2 and it can keep at 463 F/g after 500 charging–discharging cycles when the current density increased about three times.
