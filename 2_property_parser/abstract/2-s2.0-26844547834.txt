Energy-storing supercapacitors which have electrical parameters and occupy a functional position between ordinary capacitors and batteries are used as power sources or reserves. Concentrating on the high-power end of the supercapacitor spectrum, Epcos brands its products 'UltraCaps' and recently introduced a second-generation series of products. Panasonic's GoldCaps comprise several ranges of pc-board-mounting capacitors with values of 0.1 to 2F at 2.3 or 5.5V, targeting a variety of data-retention and -backup functions. The company recently added the Ultra-Power (UP-Cap) device, which it aims at emerging 42V automotive applications.
