An integrated system has been provided with a-Si/H solar cells as energy conversion device, NiCo2O4 battery-supercapacitor hybrid (BSH) as energy storage device, and light emitting diodes (LEDs) as energy utilization device. By designing three-dimensional hierarchical NiCo2O4 arrays as faradic electrode, with capacitive electrode of active carbon (AC), BSHs were assembled with energy density of 16.6 Wh kg–1, power density of 7285 W kg–1, long-term stability with 100% retention after 15,000 cycles, and rather low self-discharge. The NiCo2O4//AC BSH was charged to 1.6 V in 1 s by solar cells and acted as reliable sources for powering LEDs. The integrated system is rational for operation, having an overall efficiency of 8.1% with storage efficiency of 74.24%. The integrated system demonstrates a stable solar power conversion, outstanding energy storage behavior, and reliable light emitting. Our study offers a precious strategy to design a self-driven integrated system for highly efficient energy utilization.[Figure not available: see fulltext.].
