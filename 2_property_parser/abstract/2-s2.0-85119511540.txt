The core technical challenges faced by the battery industry is lifespan, cost, and toxic lead recycling. Increase in battery's health and use life is a research hotspot to reduce cost and delay recycling. In the first part, a battery-supercapacitor (SC) hybrid is designed and simulated. In this two-stage design, the SC protects the battery from fatal damage and deep discharge. A simple decision-based control strategy is employed to proportionally share the power delivery capabilities of hybrid battery-SC storage units. Later, the rate-limiting strategy is simulated using the fresh and weak batteries for a scaled 125W load with a peak of 1000W in a typical rural home. The simulated results show effective coordination of such a low-cost fresh and weak battery-battery combination for handling light load variation. The proposed hybrid configuration demonstrates practical and economic advantages and best suits community electrification with an increased social acceptance.
