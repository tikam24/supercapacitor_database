Electrospinning of nanomaterial composites are gaining increased interest in the fabrication of electronic components and devices. Performance improvement of electrospun components results from the unique properties associated with nanometer-scaled features, high specific surface areas, and light-weight designs. Electrospun nanofiber membrane-containing polymer electrolytes show improved ionic conductivity, electrochemical stability, low interfacial resistance, and improved charge-discharge performance than those prepared from conventional membranes. Batteries with non-woven electrospun separators have increased cycle life and higher rate capabilities than ones with conventional separators. Electrospun nanofibers may also be used as working electrodes in lithium-ion batteries, where they exhibit excellent rate capability, high reversible capacity, and good cycling performance. Moreover, the high surface area of electrospun activated carbon nanofibers improves supercapacitor energy density. Similarly, nanowires having quasi-one-dimensional structures prepared by electrospinning show high conductivity and have been used in ultra-sensitive chemical sensors, optoelectronics, and catalysts. Electrospun conductive polymers can also perform as flexible electrodes. Finally, the thin, porous structure of electrospun nanofibers provides for the high strain and fast response required for improved actuator performance. The current review examines recent advances in the application of electrospinning in fabricating electronic components and devices. Â© 2010 American Scientific Publishers.
