Vehicles that use a fuel cell as a primary energy source (FCEV-Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle) require one or more secondary energy sources to supply the power demanded by the electric motor, or motors, that propels the vehicle, as well as by the rest of the components connected to the main supply bus. This is due to the reduced dynamic response and the limitations in the energy direction presented by the fuel cells. Before the experimental construction of the system and after the initial design, it is usually advised to perform a set of simulations, co-simulations, tests based on specialized electronics simulation programs or even Hardware in the Loop (HIL) simulations, to verify the correct operation of the complete system. This work compares different co-simulation combinations based on Simulink, PSIM, Modelsim, Vivado, and HIL. These co-simulations are intended to check the designed system performance and ensure a proper hardware control implementation.
