Increased renewable energy production and storage is a key pillar of net-zero emission. The expected growth in the exploitation of offshore renewable energy sources, e.g., wind, provides an opportunity for decarbonising offshore assets and mitigating anthropogenic climate change, which requires developing and using efficient and reliable energy storage solutions offshore. The present work reviews energy storage systems with a potential for offshore environments and discusses the opportunities for their deployment. The capabilities of the storage solutions are examined and mapped based on the available literature. Selected technologies with the largest potential for offshore deployment are thoroughly analysed. A landscape of technologies for both short- and long-term storage is presented as an opportunity to repurpose offshore assets that are difficult to decarbonise.
