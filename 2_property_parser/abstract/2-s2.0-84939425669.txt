Nanocomposites in the 3-D nanoarchitecture using vertically aligned ZnO nanorods template to create conducting polymer Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (Pedot) nanotube and nanofibrous network structures using the facile electrochemical synthesis approach is described. Such electrodes structured at the nanoscale enable many fold enhancement of electroactive surface and interface with electrolyte facilitating absorption, ingress and diffusion of electrolyte ions which lead to increased energy and power density of supercapacitor devices. Electrochemical properties evaluated by electrochemical impedance show specific capacitance of 99 to 162.99 mF.cm<sup>-2</sup> and extremely low bulk and charge transfer resistance of 5.4 Î©cm<sup>2</sup> in comparison to ZnO and Pedot.
