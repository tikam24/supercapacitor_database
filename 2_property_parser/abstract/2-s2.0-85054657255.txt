A polyoxometalate (POM)-based composite material (NiPW12NP/NMC) was synthesized, in which the nanoparticle of a POM compound (NiPW12NP) distributes on orange juice derived nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon matrix (NMC) homogenously. When employed as a cathode material, NiPW12NP/NMC exhibits high specific capacitance, remarkable rate capability and long-term stability. When the current density is 4 A·g−1, a specific capacitance as high as 547 F·g−1 is achieved by NiPW12NP/NMC. With NiPW12NP/NMC serving as cathode and MnO2 acting as anode, a high performance asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled, which possesses a high energy density of 10.88 Wh·kg−1 at 0.64 kW·kg−1. It also shows a good rate capability, when the current density increases from 4 to 12 A·g−1, its specific capacitance decreases from 113 to 88 F·g−1, with 77.9% capacitance retention. After 5000 cycles charge-discharge experiments, 92.8% of its capacitance can be maintained, which exhibits good stability.
