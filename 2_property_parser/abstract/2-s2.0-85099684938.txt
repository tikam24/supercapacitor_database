Heavy electric vehicles vary their power demands due to frequently varying loads. The paper proposes an applied fuzzy logic algorithm for the acceleration strategy of supercapacitor assisted electric vehicles, which selects the appropriate power source based on the vehicle power demand. The algorithm can determine the supercapacitor cutoff phase within 200 milliseconds with the developed test vehicle system during the initial vehicle acceleration based on the peak current and current slope. The system reduces battery stress by limiting transient power, improving the hybrid powertrain's longevity and efficiency.
