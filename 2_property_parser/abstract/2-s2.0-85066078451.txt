Abstract: MCo2S4(M = Mn, Ni) nanomaterials are attracting considerable attention because of their unique nanostructure, good redox properties, excellent theoretical capacitance, low cost and easy preparation. Herein, MCo2S4(M = Mn, Ni) nanotube arrays have been fabricated by a one-pot hydrothermal method and could be used as conductive additive and binder-free electrodes for supercapacitors. The results show that the specific capacitance of MCo2S4(M = Mn or Ni) nanotube arrays could reach as high as 2667 and 1623 F/g at the current density of 10 A/g, respectively, indicating high rate performance. Furthermore, the MnCo2S4 nanotube arrays exhibited excellent cycling stability (68% of initial specific capacitance after 1800 cycles). These excellent electrochemical properties benefit from the synergistic effects of unique tubular microstructure and high conductivity of the samples.
