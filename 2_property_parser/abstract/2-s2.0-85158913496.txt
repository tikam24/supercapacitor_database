Vacancies are ubiquitous in nature, usually playing an important role in determining how a material behaves, both physically and chemically. As a consequence, researchers have introduced oxygen, sulphur and other vacancies into bi-dimensional (2D) materials, with the aim of achieving high performance electrodes for electrochemical energy storage. In this article, we focused on the recent advances in vacancy engineering of 2D materials for energy storage applications (supercapacitors and secondary batteries). Vacancy defects can effectively modify the electronic characteristics of 2D materials, enhancing the charge-transfer processes/reactions. These atomic-scale defects can also serve as extra host sites for inserted protons or small cations, allowing easier ion diffusion during their operation as electrodes in supercapacitors and secondary batteries. From the viewpoint of materials science, this article summarises recent developments in the exploitation of vacancies (which are surface defects, for these materials), including various defect creation approaches and cutting-edge techniques for detection of vacancies. The crucial role of defects for improvement in the energy storage performance of 2D electrode materials in electrochemical devices has also been highlighted.
