Nickel hydroxide/activated carbon (AC) composite was prepared by a chemical precipitation method. The structure and morphology of nickel hydroxide-AC composite were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the measurements of nitrogen gas adsorption isotherm (BET). The results showed that p-nickel hydroxide was loaded into the activated carbon. Electrochemical performance of the composite electrodes with different loadings was studied by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurement. It was demonstrated that the introduction of small amount of nickel hydroxide could promote the specific capacitance of composite. The composite electrode had good electrochemical performance and high charge-discharge properties. Moreover, when the optimal loading nickel hydroxide was 6% (Ï‰), the electrode showed better electrochemical behavior. A hybrid supercapacitor was fabricated using an Ni (OH)2-AC composite as positive electrode and an activated carbon as negative electrode. The electrochemical properties of the electrodes and the capacitive behavior of the resulting supercapacitor were studied by cyclic voltammetry and constant current charge-discharge tests. The specific capacitance of activated carbon supercapacitor was 245.6 F/g, while the hybrid supercapacitor had a higher specific capacitance of 330.7 F/g, which was increased by 34.6%. Moreover, the hybrid supercapacitor had better charge-discharge and cycling performance in 6 mol/L KOH electrolyte.
