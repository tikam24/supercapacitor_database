Highly ordered mesoporous manganese oxide films were electrodeposited onto indium tin oxide coated (ITO) glass using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and ethylene glycol (EG) which were used as a templating agent and stabilizer for the formation of micelle, respectively. The manganese oxide films synthesized with surfactant templating exhibited a highly mesoporous structure with a long-range order, which was confirmed by SAXRD and TEM analysis. The unique porous structure offers a more favorable diffusion pathway for electrolyte transportation and excellent ionic conductivity. Among the synthesized samples, Mn2O3-SDS+EG exhibited the best electrochemical performance for a supercapacitor in the wide range of scan rate, which was attributed to the well-developed mesoporous structure. The Mn2O3 prepared with SDS and EG displayed an outstanding capacitance of 72.04 F g−1, which outperform non-porous Mn2O3 (32.13 F g−1) at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1.
