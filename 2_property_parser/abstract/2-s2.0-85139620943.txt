Direct current (DC) microgrids are an efficient alternative solution in the current energy crisis, and it plays a leading role in applications like power supply to off-grid telecommunication towers, data centers, and industries that use high-power electrical equipment and machinery. Also, extensive usage of these applications is possible if two or more renewable energy resources are integrated with energy storage. There is no current zero-crossing point in DC systems; the detection of fault and fault protection implementation are tedious. Owing to this problem, the proposed work concentrates on modeling a DC microgrid where photovoltaic (PV) and wind generation systems are generating sources that have been integrated along with battery and supercapacitor (SC) bank as an energy storage that supplies the load to form an autonomous DC microgrid that provides higher efficiency and reliability. Also, the implementation of fault detection using Arduino for DC microgrid is done, and the simulations are carried out using MATLAB Simulink.
