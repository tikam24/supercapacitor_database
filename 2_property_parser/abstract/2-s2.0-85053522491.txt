As lightning energy produces very high voltage and very high current, normal storage devices like batteries, flywheel, normal capacitors cannot handle that huge voltage and current and also they don't have ability to store the energy within the fraction of second, so this experiment shows the viability of supercapacitor as energy storage device integrated with lightning-energy system. All the experiment has been conducted in numerical computing environment to experiment the viability of supercapacitor integrated five level inverter within lightning-energy storage device. The presented paper shows the response of five level inverter connected with various loads as RL Load, Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine Load and Grid. The five level inverter has been integrated with supercapacitive storage to measure the response of inverter with supercapacitor and also to measure the variation in supercapacitor for various load.
