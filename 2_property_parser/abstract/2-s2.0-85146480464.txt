NiCoSe4 nanoflowers were synthesized on carbon fiber felt (CFF) by microwave method, and the effects of microwave time and microwave power on the morphology, physical phase and performance of NiCoSe4@CFF were explored. The results display that the nanostructured NiCoSe4 prepared under the microwave irradiation of 1000 W for 120 s is uniformly loaded on the CFF. The NiCoSe4@CFF electrode exhibits a superior specific capacity of 1653.6F g−1 at 1A/g and maintains a superior cycling performance of 87.05 % of the initial capacitance over 150,000 cycles. In addition, the flexible supercapacitor fabricated with NiCoSe4@CFF as the cathode exhibits excellent flexibility and flexural strength. As an effective catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), NiCoSe4@CFF demonstrates a low overpotential of 0.358 V, a relatively small Tafel slope of 115.93 mV dec−1 and an excellent lifetime at 10 mA cm−2.
