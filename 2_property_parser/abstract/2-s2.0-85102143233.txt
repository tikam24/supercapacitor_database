In recent years, with the rapid development of flexible wearable devices, tactile feedback devices, energy harvesters and other fields, dielectric elastomers (DE) and supercapacitors (SC) has attracted much attention, due to energy increase, high energy storage efficiency, and compactness, having a very wide range of applications. Since the performance of the flexible electrode directly affects the power generation and driving efficiency of DE and the energy storage efficiency of SC, it is an important part of DE and SC. Here, based on the different types of flexible electrode materials, this article first introduces several typical electrode materials and their properties, such as carbon electrodes, metal electrodes, and composite electrodes. Then, the preparation method of the electrode is described. Then, the application of DE and SC assembled from flexible electrode materials in various fields is summarized, and the problems and challenges faced by electrode materials are analyzed. Finally, the development trend of flexible electrode materials is prospected.
