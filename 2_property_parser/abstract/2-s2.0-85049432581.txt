Herein, 3D heterostructured MCo2O4/Co3O4 nanocomposites (M = Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn) were synthesized successfully through a facile ion-exchange method. The unique hierarchical structure possess high specific surface area and ion transmission thoroughfare, which provide more attainable reaction sites, facilitate diffusion of reactants and products, and finally enhance the electrochemical property. What's more, the synthetic method was very versatile and can be conveniently extended to synthesize series of hierarchical transition metal oxides. Then, the heterostructured NiCo2O4/Co3O4 nanocomposites were prepared for using as supercapacitor electrode, which exhibited higher specific capacitance of 1165 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. In addition, as a proof-of-concept, a performance of as-assembled symmetrical supercapacitor was demonstrated using a DC motor.
