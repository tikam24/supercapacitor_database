Lightweight, inexpensive and flexible electrodes are required for flexible technological applications. As polymers are generally low cost, flexible and have low density, they are potential candidates for use as flexible electrodes. However, polymers are not conductive and thus cannot be used as electrodes or current collectors. Polymers have been coated by metals/alloys to make them conductive for use in various applications including electromagnetic shielding and sensors. In this work, a flexible electrode was successfully fabricated by electrodeposition of Cu and Ni on polyester fabric for an energy storage application. The growth of metals was carried out in non-aqueous ionic liquid electrolyte, with the deposition condition of Cu and Ni studied by means of cyclic voltammetry. Non-electrochemical (FTIR, XRD, SEM and EDAX) characterizations of the metal-coated polyester are also presented. Modified flexible electrodes were transferred to an alkaline electrolyte for electrochemical characterization. The specific capacitance of Cu-and Ni-coated polyester reached 33.4 F/g and 50.2 F/g at the same scan rate of 5 mV/s. These results suggest an inexpensive and straightforward method for the fabrication of a flexible electrode for energy storage applications.
