The present work proposes a technology for obtaining of graphene and its deposition as nanolayer onto aluminium substrate. The essence of the technology is the deposition of nano-graphene coating onto the electrically conductive part of the electrode by generation of high-voltage discharge between the main metal layer and the carbon electrode. For this purpose, a special generator â€“ a highvoltage chamber with volume of 27.10-3 m3 was used, which generates electric arc between the graphite electrode and metal substrate. It causes evaporation of the cathode and facilitates the deposition of nano-coating on the substrate. The design of generator allows regulating the distance target-substrate. The optimal technological regimes for uniform deposition of the graphene coating were determined.
