Manganese dioxide/reduced graphene oxide/indium tin oxide (MRI) and polypyrrole/reduced graphene oxide/indium tin oxide (PRI) electrodes were prepared via the chronopotentiometric-deposition of either manganese oxide or polypyrrole, respectively, onto a RGO/ITO film at a constant current density. Solid-state asymmetric supercapacitors (ASC) were assembled using MRI as the positive electrode and PRI as the negative electrode in a PVA/LiCl gel electrolyte. These devices displayed a power density of 7.4. kW/kg (for an energy density of 13. Wh/kg), an energy density of 16. Wh/kg (for a power density of 0.3. kW/kg), and a capacitance retention of 75% over 2000 cycles. The MRI//PRI ASC exhibited a much improved capacitive performance compared to the symmetric PRI//PRI (3. Wh/kg at 0.47. kW/kg) and MRI//MRI (9. Wh/kg at 0.12. kW/kg) supercapacitors. The superior capacitive performance of the MRI//PRI ASC was ascribed the improved conductivities and mechanical stabilities of MRI and PRI electrodes, obtained by preparing the polypyrrole and manganese oxide films on a graphene-coated electrode.
