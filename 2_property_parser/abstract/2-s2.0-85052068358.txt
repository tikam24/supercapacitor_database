This work introduces a fault diagnosis method for transformer based on self-powered radio frequency identification (RFID) sensor tag and improved Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT). Consisted by RFID tag chip, power management circuit, MCU and accelerometer, the developed RFID sensor tag is used to acquire and wirelessly transmit the vibration signal. A customized power management including solar panel, low dropout (LDO) voltage regulator, supercapacitor and corresponding charging circuit is presented to guarantee constant DC power for the sensor tag. An improved band restricted empirical mode decomposition (BREMD) which is optimized by quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is proposed to deal with the raw vibration signal. Compared with traditional methods, this improved BREMD method shows great superiority in reducing mode aliasing. Then, a promising fault diagnosis approach on the basis of Hilbert marginal spectrum variations is brought up. The measured results show that the presented power management circuit can generate 2.5V DC voltage for the rest of the sensor tag. The developed sensor tag can achieve a reliable communication distance of 17.8m in the test environment. Furthermore, the measurement results indicate the promising performance of fault diagnosis for transformer.
