The transition metal oxides with multiple oxidation states and large electrical conductivity have been extensively studied in energy storage capacitors. Herein, the core-shell cobalt sulfide/manganese molybdate composites grown on reduced graphene oxide/Ni foam (CoS/MMO/rGO/NF)have been successfully prepared via hydrothermal and followed by electrodeposition methods. It is found that the deposition mass of CoS has a significant effect on the morphologies and electrochemical properties of CoS/MMO/rGO/NF electrodes. When the mass of CoS is 0.4 mg cm−2 (CoS-0.4/MMO/rGO/NF), the composite yields a remarkable specific capacitance of 3074.5 F g−1 (1 A g−1)and a good cycling performance of 87% through 5000 cycles. Moreover, an asymmetric device based on the CoS-0.4/MMO/rGO/NF composite shows a maximum energy density (50.3 W h kg−1 at 415.8 W kg−1)and a good long-term stability (retention 96% even after 8000 cycles). These characteristics of CoS-0.4/MMO/rGO/NF are mainly attributed to the high conductivity of reduced graphene oxide and the synergistic effects of MnMoO4 and CoS, as well as its unique morphology. These superior properties of CoS-0.4/MMO/rGO/NF demonstrate its potential application as electrode material in energy storage capacitors.
