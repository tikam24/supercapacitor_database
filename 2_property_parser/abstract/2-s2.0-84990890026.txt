Vertically aligned multi-wall carbon nanotube (VA-MWCNT) arrays have been used for deposition of molybdenum sulphide from a water solution of ammonia molybdate and thiourea. A hydrothermal synthesis at 175 Â°C resulted in formation of quasi-spherical nanoparticles inside and on the top surface of arrays without destruction of the array structure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed a molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) composition of the nanoparticles, while Raman spectroscopy detected the bands characteristic of light scattering in the MoS2 crystallites only after a treatment of synthesis products in hydrogen flow. As compared to the initial VA-MWCNTs, the composites showed enhanced specific capacitances in 1M H2SO4 electrolyte especially at low scan rates due to redox reactions involving MoS2. The reactions were more pronounced for the hydrogen treated composite. Cyclic voltammetry curves demonstrate an enhanced specific capacitance of MoS2/MWCNT array (fragment of the structure is shown in the insert) as compared to initial array due to redox reactions.
