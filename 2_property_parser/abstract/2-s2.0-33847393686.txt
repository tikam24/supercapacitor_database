Nanocrystalline manganese oxide powders were synthesized by gas condensation technique. Nanocrystalline manganese oxide powders with various sizes, shapes and compositions could be prepared by controlling the processing parameters. The characteristics of the as-prepared nanocrystalline manganese oxide powders were investigated by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, and synchrotron in situ X-ray diffraction techniques.
