The current challenge for supercapacitors based on sustainable materials is the difficulty of elevating energy density while maintaining the power density and capacitance retention. Herein, we demonstrate a strategy to boost the energy density of renewable all-lignin-based supercapacitors via sound design of lignin porous carbon electrodes isolated from poplar wood as well as employing lignin/deep eutectic solvent (DES) gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) with a wide electrochemical window. The resulting device exhibits a remarkable specific capacitance of 181.5 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and favorable capacitance retention of 80.2% at 5 A g-1 over 2000 cycles, which is attributed to the large specific surface area of 1125 m2 g-1 as well as a high degree of graphitization possessed by the electrode materials and excellent conductivity of 13.5 S/m held by the DES gel polymer electrolytes. Furthermore, the supercapacitor delivers a maximum energy density of 40.8 Wh kg-1 and it remains 29.0 Wh kg-1 at an ultrahigh power density of 3.2 KW kg-1.
