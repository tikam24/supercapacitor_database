Porous carbons are promising materials for supercapacitor electrodes owing to their excellent electrical conductivity, high surface area, unique porous networks, and superior chemical inertness. This article summarizes the recent development of block copolymer-based porous carbons for supercapacitor electrodes. We first introduce the fundamentals of supercapacitors and block copolymers, followed by representative examples to highlight the use of block copolymers for fabricating porous carbons that have morphologies unattainable by other strategies. Instead of a comprehensive review, the article surveys papers published within the past five years. We discuss block copolymer-based porous carbons in the formats of zero-dimensional powders, one-dimensional fibers, two-dimensional films, and three-dimensional monoliths. In the end, the article presents a few challenges and opportunities associated with the application of block copolymers for supercapacitors.
