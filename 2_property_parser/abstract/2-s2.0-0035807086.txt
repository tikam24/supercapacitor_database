Some fluorinated polyphenylthiophene have been chemically synthesized with good yields. The characterization of their positive and negative doping processes was performed by cyclic voltammetry and showed high capacities, but proved no real stability in cycling experiments. The application of the P-4-FPT as electroactive material in supercapacitor systems showed interesting properties in term of energy and power delivered. Â© 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.
