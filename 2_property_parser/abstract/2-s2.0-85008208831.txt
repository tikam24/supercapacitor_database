Here, we used waste mineral water bottles as carbon precursor and prepared carbon materials through direct carbonization. The effects of the carbonization temperature and carbonization time on the properties of the carbon materials were studied. The results indicate that the carbonization time in a certain range has no big influence on the properties of the carbon materials, whereas the carbonization temperature has a pronounced influence on the carbon materials. The structure, morphology, and electrochemical properties of the carbon materials are highly dependent on the carbonization temperature. HDPC-800-2 showed excellent capacitive property (specific capacitance under 1 A g−1 current density is 176 F g−1) and cyclic stability (91.67% capacitance is retained after 5000 charge-discharge cycles under 2 A g−1 current density) in 6 M KOH electrolyte.
