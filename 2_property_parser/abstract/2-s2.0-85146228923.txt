The abundance of food waste across the globe has called for the mitigation and reduction of these discarded wastes. Herein, the potential of biochar derived from food waste is unquestionable as it provides a sustainable way of utilizing the abundance of available biomass, as well as an effective way of preserving the ecosystem through the reduction of concerning environmental issues. This review focuses on the food waste–based biochar as advanced electrode materials in the energy storage devices. Efforts have been made to present and discuss the current exploration of the food waste utilization, along with the biochar production technologies through thermochemical conversion, including combustion, gasification, and pyrolysis method. Finding its limitation in literatures, discussion on the food waste–based biochar fabrication method as the electrode materials is elaborated, alongside the current food waste–based biochar that has been explored in the energy application thus far. Towards the end, the outlook and perspective on the further development of food waste–based biochar have been outlined.
