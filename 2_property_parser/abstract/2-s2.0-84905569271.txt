Due to the unique advantages of Pt, it plays an important role in fuel cells and microelectronics. Considering the fact that Pt is an expensive metal, a major challenging point nowadays is how to realize efficient utilization of Pt. In this paper, a cost-effective atomic layer deposition (ALD) process with a low N2 filling step is introduced for realizing well-defined Pt nanotube arrays in anodic alumina nano-porous templates. Compared to the conventional ALD growth of Pt, much fewer ALD cycles and a shorter precursor pulsing time are required, which originates from the low N2 filling step. To achieve similar Pt nanotubes, about half cycles and 10% Pt precursor pulsing time is needed using our ALD process. Meanwhile, the Pt nanotube array is explored as a current collector for supercapacitors based on core/shell Pt/MnO2 nanotubes. This nanotube-based electrode exhibits high gravimetric and areal specific capacitance (810 Fg-1 and 75 mF cm-2 at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1) as well as an excellent rate capability (68% capacitance retention from 2 to 100 Ag-1). Additionally, a negligible capacitance loss is observed after 8000 cycles of random charging-discharging from 2 to 100 Ag-1. A straightforward but highly cost-effective atomic layer deposition process is demonstrated to synthesize pre-defined Pt nanotube arrays. The Pt nanotube arrays are utilized as a superior current collector of core/shell Pt/MnO2 supercapacitors. The cost-effectiveness of the fabrication method together with a high specific capacitance and rate capability make the Pt nanotubes very attractive for the next-generation of supercapacitors.
