In this work, a kind of novel MnO2/mesoporous silica nanocomposites as electrode materials was synthesized by a facile chemical synthesis for application in supercapacitors. Their structure and morphology were characterized by different techniques such as X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area measurements, etc. Their electrochemical properties in supercapacitors were investigated in detail. The results indicate that the asymmetric supercapacitors using MnO2/mesoporous silica nanocomposites as positive electrode materials exhibit superior electrochemical performances. The MnO2/MCM-41 (MnO2/Mobil company mater) and MnO2/HMS (MnO2/hollow mesoporous silica) nanocomposites show maximum energy densities and power densities 56.3 Wh·kg-1 and 8265.6 W·kg-1, 73.9 Wh· kg-1 and 10685.1 W·kg-1, respectively, much higher than 37.8 Wh·kg-1 and 8605.6 W·kg-1 of pure MnO2. In comparison with the pure MnO2, the improved electrochemical properties of MnO2/HMS nanocomposite can be ascribed to its special structure and relatively larger specific surface area.
