Firstly, Ni/CNTs precursor was synthesized using NiCl2·6H2O as nickel source and ethanol as solvent by solvothermal method. And then in hydrothermal reaction conditions, Ni/CNTs precursor was vulcanized by Na2S2O3·5H2O to successfully obtain NS/CNTs composites. The specific capacitance of NS/CNTs composites reach 533.33 F·g-1 at a current density of 1 A·g-1, and 42.50% of the specific capacitance is maintained after 1000 cycles. Compared with NS nanosheets (146.67 F·g-1 and 27.27%), the electrochemical properties of NS/CNTs composites have been greatly improved. The results indicate that the addition of CNTs can effectively enhance the electrochemical properties of nickel sulfides.
