In this paper, we have proposed an improved model of human following robot which will assist bycarrying his or her luggage. This automates the act of carrying loads that benefit in tiring and exhaustive routines. After reviewing devices available to identify and maneuver behind target person in a crowd in real time and power requirement of them, we proposed our approach in which a carrier senses the ultrasonic waves sent by transmitter powered by piezo insole charged super-capacitor. By getting signals the carrier itself decides its path and follow without the use of internal maps and ability to self-localize. This solar energy rechargeable device has obstacle avoidance behavior to keep a safe distance behind its user. In this paper, a rectifier is used to obtain DC current from a piezo-crystal. Further, the charge produced is stored in a 5.5V 1F super-capacitor which powers the ultrasonic beacon. The proposed algorithm has been successfully implemented in the hardware design demonstrated in the paper.
