In this paper, the characteristic curves considering complete Current-Voltage (I-V) and Power-Voltage (P-V) relations for PV system are presented. Based on the I-V characteristic curve, a novel Maximum Power Point Capturing (MPPC) technique is proposed to overcome the steady-state oscillation and slow dynamic response problems existing in the conventional Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) technique. In order to further mitigate the fluctuations for PV system, an appropriate supercapacitor (superC) is selected to be connected in parallel with the PV system. The simulation results demonstrate the designed MPPC-superC structure has a better performance than the conventional MPPT method and MPPC method in both steady-state and dynamic responses.
