Thin films of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanodots decorated onto the multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) were prepared by simple and inexpensive two-step chemical method which includes 'dip and dry' process followed by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. The as-prepared ZnO/MWNTs (ZCN) composite films were characterized with different physicochemical techniques. The surface morphological analysis shows that the ZnO nanodots with average size less than 15 nm get uniformly decorated onto the MWNT walls. Furthermore, the electrochemical analysis carried out for ZCN composites suggests that these are the efficient electrodes for electrochemical charge-storage applications.
