This paper proposes a simple and easily control method in energy management strategy for hybrid storage system that consists of Li-ion battery and electric double layer capacitor (EDLC). In this load dispatching, battery outputs average component in an averaging time, while EDLC outputs fluctuation component. The Averaging Time is decided based on the sum of the section time and standard deviation for overall driving cycle. This paper deals with three famous driving cycles, JC08-mode, UDDS and NYCC. In addition, actual driving patterns (measured by author) are used to estimate the battery degradation level by using dynamic degradation model for the battery. To compare the economy, cycle cost is introduced. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method improves the degradation level and reduce the cycle cost.
