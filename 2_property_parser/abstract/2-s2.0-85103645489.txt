Abstract: Nitrogen-doped graphene nanoflakes with a high nitrogen content (6.6 at %) and developed mesoporosity were synthesized via pyridine pyrolysis. They were tested in a supercapacitor with a non-aqueous electrolyte: a 1.2 M solution of ionic liquid Et4N+TFSIâˆ’ in acetonitrile. It was found that incorporation of nitrogen into the graphene layers nearly tripled the specific capacitance of the electrode, compared to the undoped nanoflakes.
