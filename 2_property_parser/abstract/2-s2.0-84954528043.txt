Three types of Î±-MnO 2 nanomaterials are synthesized in different Mn-based precursor solutions by using a facile electrochemical deposition at the same depositional condition. The relationships between the precursor solutions and corresponding MnO 2 nanomaterials' morphology as well as the electrochemical performance have been studied. As an electrode, electrochemical measurements show that the MnO 2 deposited in MnCl 2 precursor solution (MnO 2 -P3) exhibits an enhanced specific capacitance (318.9 F g -1 at 2 mV s -1 ). Moreover, this electrode demonstrates a good rate capability with 44% retention, which is higher than the MnO 2 -P1 deposited with Mn(CH 3 COOH) 2 solution and the MnO 2 -P2 deposited with Mn(NO 3 ) 2 precursor solution. Besides, the specific capacitance of the MnO 2 -P3 electrode nearly has 98.2% retention after 2000 cycles, showing good long-term cycle stability. These findings show that the MnO 2 -P3 is a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.
