We use a carbonization method to synthesize a high-surface-area carbon (HSAC) material from a biomass source: peanut shells. Due to its high specific surface area of 1279 m2g−1 and porous structure, HSAC is a promising material for energy storage application. We employ a simple hydrothermal method to grow HSAC successfully on nickel (Ni) foam. The biomass-derived HSAC and HSAC growth on Ni foam (HSAC-Ni) is investigated by X-ray powder diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller-based analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. We study HSAC-Ni as a potential material for supercapacitor electrodes. A three-electrode system with HSAC-Ni as the working electrode in 1 M KOH and 1 M Li2SO4 aqueous electrolytes demonstrates maximum specific capacitances of 242.84 Fg−1 in KOH and 272 Fg−1 in Li2SO4 at a scan rate of 10 mVs−1. The HSAC-Ni shows stability after electrochemical measurement, which indicates that HSAC material is an excellent choice as an electrode material.
