Green chemistry is the use of chemical sources to reduce and eliminate industrial production of environmental pollution, reactant atoms are all converted into the desired final products. Precise control of synthetic materials can not only reduce raw material consumption, but also improve production efficiency. This is exactly what green chemistry requires. Therefore, we use the solvent ratio precise control to synthesize the CoFe2O4 hollow skeleton nanobox structure. In addition, we used the solvent ratio and structure-directing agent control to synthesize other CoFe2O4 with special morphology is synthesized and their electrochemical properties are compared and analyzed. So, the NF/CoFe2O4 hollow skeleton nanobox electrode as anode shows an excellent specific capacity of 466.7 C g−1 (1 A g−1). An as-prepared aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor achieve the maximum energy density is 39.6 Wh kg−1 at power density of 193.4 W kg−1. The aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor manifests long cycling with 93.2% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles. In addition, it is proved that the developed assembled asymmetric supercapacitor has good mechanical energy storage capacity and good conversion rate.
