In this paper, an energy management strategy for electric vehicles equipped with fuel cell (FC), battery (BAT), and supercapacitor (SC) is considered, aiming at improving the whole performance under a framework of vehicle to network application. In detail, based on wavelet transform and equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS), the demand power of vehicles is optimized to enhance the lifespan of fuel cell, fuel economy, and dynamic performance of electric vehicles. The wavelet transform is used to separate the high-frequency power in order to provide a peak power and recycle the braking energy. The equivalent consumption minimization strategy is used to distribute the low-frequency power to fuel cell and battery for minimizing the hydrogen consumption. Obtained results are studied using an advanced vehicle simulator, and its effectiveness of the strategy is confirmed, which provides a fundamental control method for the IOV application.
