The stability of electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLC) utilizing an ionic liquid and tetraethylammoninium tetrafluoroborate (TEABF4) in acetonitrile electrolyte was tested by cycling and by constant voltage hold tests. It turned out that possible degradation of the EDLC is visible in the voltage hold test after a time period which is typically much shorter if compared to the cycle tests. A constant capacitance during several thousands of cycles does not necessarily indicate stability. For capacitor cells using a carbon black as active material and an ionic liquid as electrolyte constant capacitance could be demonstrated over 12,000 cycles between 0 V and 3.75 V. Clear ageing was observed, however, during the voltage hold test at 3.75 V after 300 h. For a maximum voltage of 3.5 V both the cycle and the voltage hold test indicated stable performance over 12,000 cycles or 500 h, respectively. For capacitors using an activated carbon as active material and standard electrolyte TEABF4 in acetonitrile both tests clearly demonstrated degradation for a maximum cell voltage of 3.5 V. The evolution of capacitance loss observed for the voltage hold test at 3.25 V is in good agreement with the degradation observed at 3.5 V for the voltage hold test. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.
