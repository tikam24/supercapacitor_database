Activated biocarbons (aBCs) and activated biocarbon monoliths (aBCMs) were obtained by several procedures in order to study their behaviour as PtSn support for ethanol electro-oxidation, and also for use as an electrode in supercapacitors. The textural and chemical properties of the materials were correlated with the electrochemical behaviour. The prepared E. grandis wood based biocarbon materials, have good qualities for use as PtSn catalyst support for DEFCs, and in supercapacitor electrode application. The micropore size and the content of oxygenated functional group have direct incidence on the distribution of the catalyst particles on the aBCs support surface. In consequently, the electrocatalytic behaviour of the PtSn/aBC is affected. The content of oxygenated functional groups also has a marked effect on the supercapacitors electrode behaviour. It was demonstrated that these functional groups are actively involved in the energy storage by the pseudocapacitive phenomenon. The nitric acid treatment is a good method to generate these functional groups on the aBCMs.
