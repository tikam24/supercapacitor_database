Electrical Equivalent Model Selection of an Ultracapacitor with its parameter estimated with sufficient accuracy provides an easy mechanism for predicting electrical behavior of the Ultracapacitor under various load conditions, and aids in the overall system design. This paper presents a study and comparison of several Ultracapacitor models through experimental and simulation results. A 650 F Ultracapacitor of Maxwell make is used for the present study. Experimental results obtained with constant current charge discharge tests and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) tests are used for validating the performance of the models selected for the study. The Model performance results presented can aid in the selection of the model based on the application.
