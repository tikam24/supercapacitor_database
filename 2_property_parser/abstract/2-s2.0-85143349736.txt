In this work, a one-step solvothermal technique was used to produce CuCo2O4/CuO composite. The composites have a high surface area of 45.36 m2 g−1, and a 16.41 nm pore size. The composite with mesoporous structures is suitable for fast faradaic reactions because it can ensure enough interaction between the electrolyte and electrode, and those ions and electrons can move quickly. In the backdrop of the supercapacitors, the composite electrode showed the typical features of battery-type characteristics and exhibited a high specific capacity of 458 C g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1. In addition, the composite electrode exhibited better rate capability (60% of its initial value at 10 A g−1) and 10% capacity loss after 8000 cycles at 7 A g−1. In this context, CuCo2O4/CuO composite has excellent electrochemical properties, making it an ideal electrode material for supercapacitors.
