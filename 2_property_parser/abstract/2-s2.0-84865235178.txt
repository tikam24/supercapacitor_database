TiO<inf>2</inf> nanobelts (NBs) and nanoparticles (NPs) have been coupled with the chemically reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to form nanocomposites which are used as supercapacitor electrodes. The specific capacitance of rGO-TiO <inf>2</inf> composites is higher than that of monolithic rGO, TiO<inf>2</inf> NPs or NBs. The optimal electrochemical performance is achieved with the rGO-TiO<inf>2</inf> composites at a rGO:TiO<inf>2</inf> mass ratio of 7:3. In addition, the rGO-TiO<inf>2</inf> NBs exhibit better performance than the rGO-TiO<inf>2</inf> NPs in terms of specific capacitance, rate capability, energy density and power density. The specific capacitances of rGO-TiO <inf>2</inf> NBs and rGO-TiO<inf>2</inf> NPs with a mass ratio of 7:3 are 225 F g<sup>-1</sup> and 62.8 F g<sup>-1</sup> at a discharge current density of 0.125 A g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The better performance of the rGO-TiO <inf>2</inf> NBs is attributed to the nanobelt's unique shape, better charge transport property and larger area of contact with the rGO nanosheet.
