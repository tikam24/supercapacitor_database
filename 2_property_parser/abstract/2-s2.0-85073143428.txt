The nano-hexahedron porous carbon was prepared by directly carbonizing a Zn-based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) at designed temperatures. After carbonization, the nano-hexahedron porous carbon shows a large specific surface area of 1142 m2 g−1 at a pore diameter of approximate 3 nm, a high capacitance of 187 F g−1, a remarkable rate-capability of 75.9%, and an unchangeable capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles. Furthermore, the symmetrical supercapacitor exhibits a high energy density of 9.04 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 350 W kg−1 and a notable capacitance retention of 80.2% after 5000 cycles. All results have suggested that the nano-hexahedron porous carbon is adaptable to the assembly of effective electrode materials for supercapacitors.
