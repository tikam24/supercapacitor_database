The purpose of this paper is to provide a general guideline for identifying an appropriate electricity storage technology for large-scale energy management applications such as load leveling, peak shaving and arbitrage. Several emerging energy storage technologies are presented and their merits are compared against some recommended criteria. Some conventional storage technologies are also included in the analysis as reference points. In conclusion, a few of these technologies that are presently available or are most likely to become available in a few years, are identified.
