The capacitive properties of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with different reduction levels were investigated. GNRs have been synthesized through thermal reduction of oxidized GNRs in the temperature range 100-400 °C. Oxidized GNRs were synthesized by longitudinal unzipping of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) by means of chemical treatments. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy observations showed, that the efficient tube unzipping yielded improved effective surface area without any tube annihilation by the unzipping process of MWCNTs. Electrochemical studies indicated that through unzipping of MWCNTs, specific capacitance increased from 8 to 28 F g-1 at discharge current density of 0.5 A g-1, confirming increased active surface area and increased defect density in the MWCNTs surface. Unzipping of MWCNTs resulted in decreased rate capability of the electrode because of low electrical conductivity due to oxidization during the unzipping process. Thermal reduction of unzipped sample affected both specific capacitance and rate capability of electrodes. The highest specific capacitance of 62 F g-1 at discharge current density of 0.5 A g-1 was obtained for the sample unzipped and thermally annealed at about 150°C. The amount of oxygen-containing groups was shown to be an important factor influencing the performance of the GNRs. These results make unzipped MWCNTs promising electrode materials for supercapacitor applications. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
