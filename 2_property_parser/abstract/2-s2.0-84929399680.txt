A composite materials carbon nanosheets supported MnO<inf>2</inf> nanorods exhibiting high capacitance performance can be fabricated by a simple and scalable method. The carbon nanosheets are easily obtained from the orange peel by carbonization at 800Â°C, and MnO<inf>2</inf> nanorods can be grown on the carbon nanosheets through the reaction between KMnO<inf>4</inf> aqueous solution and the carbon. The electrochemical studies showed that the supercapacitor based on the hybrid materials with MnO<inf>2</inf> content of 3.8 % exhibited the largest specific capacitance of 656 F g<sup>-1</sup> at a current density of 1 A g<sup>-1</sup>, after 5000 cycles, the capacitance still retention above 80%. In addition, after MnO<inf>2</inf> nanorods attached onto the carbon nanosheets layer, the BET specific surface area of this hybrid materials is improved to 573 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, the addition of carbon nanosheets as a conducting agent improves the high-rate capability considerably, and the MnO2 nanorods crystals in turn is of great benefit to further exfoliating carbon nanosheets, which give the composite potential application as high-performance supercapacitor electrode materials.
