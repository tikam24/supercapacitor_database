The main source of every dayâ€™s energy is dependent on fossil fuels and plays a vital role in all energy applications. The present study focuses on the effective development of nitrogen-doped graphene (NG)/Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) composite as competent electrode materials for various energy and power applications. Graphene oxide and NG were synthesized by modified Hummers method and solvothermal process. PEDOT was prepared by oxidative polymerization and with NG it opens up a commendable electrochemical window. The physical characterizations of the prepared samples were carried out using X-ray powder diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, and High resolution-transmission electron microscopy analysis. Catalytic studies performed by cyclic voltammetryinvestigate the capacitance performance and studies for the steady-state and dynamic behavior of the above mentioned two composites. Nitrogen-doped graphene/PEDOT (NGP) has high specific capacitance value of 359 F/g with energy and power density values 115 Wh/kg and 356 W/kg at 0.5 A/g and shows a remarkable adherence with excellent stability up to 2400 s. The results NGP composite exhibited are likely to have a great future as an inexpensive and high-performance metal-free catalyst as electrode materials for supercapacitor applications.
