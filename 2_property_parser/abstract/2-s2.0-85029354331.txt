For supercapacitors, pores in electrode materials can accelerate chemical reaction kinetics by shortening ion diffusion distances and by enlarging electrolyte/electrode interfaces. This article describes a simple one-step route for the preparation of pure-phase porous Ni 3 (NO 3 ) 2 (OH) 4 nano-sheets by directly heating a mild Ni(NO 3 ) 2 and urea solution. During heating, urea decomposed into NH 3 ·H 2 O, which provided a suitable alkaline environment for the formation of Ni 3 (NO 3 ) 2 (OH) 4 nano-sheets. Meanwhile, the side product, NH 4 NO 3 , created numerous pores as a pore-forming agent. After NH 4 NO 3 removal, the specific surface areas and pore volumes of products were boosted by ∼180-times (from 0.61 to 113.12 m 2 /g) and ∼90-times (from 3.40 × 10 −3 to 3.17 × 10 −1 m 2 /g), respectively. As a cathode material of supercapacitor, the porous Ni 3 (NO 3 ) 2 (OH) 4 nano-sheets exhibited a high specific capacitance of 1094 F/g at an ultrahigh mass loading of 17.55 mg/cm 2 , leading to an impressive areal capacitance of 19.2 F/cm 2 . Furthermore, a Ni 3 (NO 3 ) 2 (OH) 4 nano-sheet//commercial active carbon asymmetric supercapacitor was constructed and delivered an energy density of 33.2 Wh/Kg at a power density of 190.5 W/Kg, based on the mass of active materials on both electrodes.
