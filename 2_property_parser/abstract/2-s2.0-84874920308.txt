An upgraded electrospraying device, which is able to spray upside down to produce nanoparticles with much more narrow size distribution, has been developed. It is equipped with the heating electrode to accelerate the evaporation of the solvent, which also enables final modification of the produced nanoparticles. Applications chosen to be tested include the enhancement of lithium batteries with lithium-titanate nanoparticles. Such batteries should have short charging times, higher safety, increased capacity, and other properties. The second application is the manufacturing of the third generation of solar cells (dye sensitized solar cell). The third application is the manufacturing of the supercapacitor, with relatively high energy density. This is an abstract of a paper presented at the CHISA 2012 - 20th International Congress of Chemical and Process Engineering and PRES 2012 - 15th Conference PRES (Prague, Czech Republic 8/25-29/2012).
