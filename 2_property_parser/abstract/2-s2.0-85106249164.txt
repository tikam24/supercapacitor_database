Three-dimensional (3D) carbon from the assembly of low-dimensionally isolated segments have attracted much attention as these carbon materials not only inherit the superiorities of individual building blocks but also acquire new synergic effects. However, it remains a big issue to assemble isolated carbon segments into a 3D carbon superstructure by a facile strategy. Herein, the spheroidizing growth of hydrothermal carbon as an assembly drive and in situ formed melamine cyanurate nanosheets as structure-directing agent are combined to design and assemble B, N and O co-doped carbon flower as a promising cathode for Zn2+ hybrids supercapacitors. The flower-like carbon exhibits large nanosheets area, interlinked conductive network, nanoscale architecture and rich electroactive sites. Boron doping enhances the chemical adsorption of SO42âˆ’ onto the carbon cathode surface and the reaction between oxygen dopant and Zn ions added additional capacity for Zn-ion supercapacitors. The resulting device achieves an energy density of 119.7 Wh/kg at 890 W/kg and maintains 63.5 Wh/kg even at a power density of 16.5 kW/kg.
