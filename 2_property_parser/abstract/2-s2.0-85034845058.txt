Mn3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) are decorated with reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (rGO-Mn3O4) through a facile and eco-friendly hydrothermal method. The as-synthesized composite was characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM and Raman spectroscopy. The electrochemical properties of (rGO-Mn3O4) nanocomposite were studied as electrode materials for supercapacitors. The rGO-Mn3O4 nanocomposite exhibit high specific capacitance of 457 Fgâˆ’1 at 1.0 A/g in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. The rGO-Mn3O4 exhibits good capacitance retention by achieving 91.6% of its initial capacitance after 5000 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to the increased electrode conductivity in the presence of graphene network.
