Nanocomposite electrode materials have gained much interest in supercapacitor applications because of their exceptional energy storage performance. In this pursuit, the current work reports a low cost, facile, hydrothermal synthesis of crystalline ZnTiO3 nanoflakes (NFs) as an efficient electrode for supercapacitors. The phase formation and degree of functionalization of as-synthesized ZnTiO3 nanoflakes were confirmed using XRD and FT-IR spectroscopic analysis. The hierarchical ZnTiO3 nanoflakes annealed at 600â¸°C consisting of Zn wrapped with TiO2 surface are confirmed using FE-SEM and HR-TEM images. The synthesized symmetric ZnTiO3 NFs in 6 M KOH electrolyte exhibits a high specific capacitance of 132 F/g at the current rate of 1 A/g with outstanding rate performance and excellent electrochemical stability of 85 % for 10,000 cycles at a high current density of 5 A/g. The fabricated asymmetric solid-state ZnTiO3/Activated carbon (AC) supercapacitor shows 240 F/g at 1 A/g current density in a single cell with an outstanding energy density of 27 Wh/kg at a power density of 962 W/kg. High performance in supercapacitors application is largely due to the synergistic effect of ZnTiO3 intercalation during the electrochemical reaction. In the demonstration, LEDs are connected to the device, and power is delivered rapidly. As a result of its excellent electrical conductivity, low cost, and environmental friendly properties, ZnTiO3 is a potential candidate for use in energy storage and electrochemical sensors in the future.
