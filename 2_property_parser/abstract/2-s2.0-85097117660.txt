This paper summarizes the research progress of waste tire pyrolysis technology in recent years, mainly discusses the pyrolysis technology of waste tires such as low temperature vacuum pyrolysis technology, co-pyrolysis technology and catalytic pyrolysis technology, and describes pyrolysis equipment, temperature, pressure and catalyst. Consequently, it is devoted to compare the influences of pyrolysis carbon black on pyrolysis reactors, temperature, pressure, catalysts, etc. In addition, the comparison of different modified upgrade methods are also investigated. Further recycle utilization of pyrolytic carbon black is also summarized.
