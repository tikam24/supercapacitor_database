The advantages of reference design and the various products developed by the designers based on the reference design in the field of wireless technology, are discussed. This reference design addresses the design challenges as inherent in meeting both standby and active mode energy efficiency regulation also offers a cost effective solution. National Instrument's CompactDAQ consists of an eight slot chassis that accepts hot swappable, auto detectable I/O module capable of measuring up to 256 channels of electrical, physical, mechanical, acoustic signals, and offering signal conditioning capabilities. Australian supercapacitor company Cap-XX is targeting mobile phone applications that requires more power to produce brighter flashes and higher resolution images. Cambridge Display Technology (CDT) and Litrex are developing an inkjet printing solution capable of producing OLEDs with a resolution of 200 pixel/in that will make backlight redundant, with a low power utilization.
