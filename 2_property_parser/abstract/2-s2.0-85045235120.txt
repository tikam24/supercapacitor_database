Hybrid electrical vehicles have become widely used over the last 20 years, which made the energy systems of these vehicles a very common area of research. The purpose of this research is to design an energy storage system for a hybrid electrical vehicle controlled by two different controllers (Conventional PID and modern Fuzzy logic controllers FLC). The main goals of these controllers are to eliminate the energy loss throughout the system components (mainly the lithium ion battery and the Ultra-capacitors), and to produce a perfect system response which deliver the exact power demand needed at the output. This paper also compares these two controllers in terms of design and performance.
