The review pr√©cises advancement in the design, fabrication, characteristics, and potential of unique nanoflowers and polymer/nanoflower nanocomposites. The inorganic nanoflowers, polymer nanoflowers, and carbon nanoflowers have been designed using advance approaches. The polymer/nanoflower nanocomposites have been fabricated with polyaniline, polyurethane, epoxy, chitosan, and several other matrices. The polymer and nanoflower based nanocomposites possess improved structural and physical properties. Consequently, polymer/nanoflower nanocomposites own unique hierarchical nanostructure, electrical conductivity, capacitance, sensing, current density, thermal stability, mechanical sturdiness, biocompatibility, and other features. The practical applications of polymer/nanoflower nanocomposites have been experiential in fields of supercapacitors, sensors, fuel cells, drug delivery, and tissue engineering.
