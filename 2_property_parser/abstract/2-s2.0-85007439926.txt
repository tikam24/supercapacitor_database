Co–WO3/functionalized carbon nanotube (f-CNT) nanocomposites have been prepared by solution growth technique. The physico-chemical characterization of the prepared nanocomposites was carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy techniques. The XRD analysis revealed the formation of orthorhombic phase of the prepared nanopowder. The SEM images showed the porous structured morphologies. The electrochemical behavior of the undoped and doped/f-CNT modified electrodes was investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge techniques. The specific capacitance of 60.14 F/g was achieved for the Co–WO3/f-CNT nanocomposites.
