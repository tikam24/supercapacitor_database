Synergistic Mn-Al-Fe impregnated rGO hybrid (MAF-rGO) is developed and verified for arsenic remediation. Preliminary adsorption studies are observed through vibrational spectroscopy and morphological tools. Adsorption isotherms are fitted by Freundlich model multilayer sorption with a loading of 402 mg g−1 [As(III)], and 339 mg g−1 [As(V)]. Adsorption kinetics study in competing ion environment [SO42−, PO43−, NO3−, CO32−] confirms the PSO model-controlled chemisorption as the rate-limiting step. The irradiation of white light (> 420 nm) in adsorption kinetics study shows a two-fold increase in the arsenic loading parameters (5–10 min). Multiplet peaks in As3d spectra (XPS) confirm the transformation of arsenic species in the near-surface region of hybrid [i.e., As(III), As(V)]. The occurrence of redox-active, ligand-exchange reactions are confirmed by individual Mn2p, Fe2p, Al2p, O1s, and C1s spectra. The dedicated electrochemical study confirms arsenic decontamination occurred through both reduction and sorption (i.e., electrosorption). An energy bandgap (Eg) of 2.17 eV resulted in the photocatalytic activity, which enhanced the arsenic remediation. Photo-electrocatalytic synergism resulted in high photocurrent densities (0.2–0.9 mA cm−2) with charge separation [e−–h+], and built-in potential abilities (Schottky-junction; Water-splitting). Arsenic-treated hybrid (i.e., sludge) is observed with an ultra-high stable charge–discharge cyclic performance for 100,000 cycles (~77 %) with improved specific-capacity of 125 F g−1 over pristine hybrid (92 F g−1). The better electrochemical parameters of sludge are due to the efficient lithiation/de-lithiation process supported by adsorbed arsenic. This work proposes sustainable approach towards environmental remediation and energy storage applications.
