Herein, reporting the state-of-the-art device innovation for the advanced new in-plane supercapacitor devices using layered stacked configuration. It is achieved by creating two regions with varying resistance over the plane. It is fabricated through reactive DC sputtering over altered FTO plates followed by spin coating and it can be scalable to any size. This configuration is entirely different from the regular two isolated films patterned in planar arrangement, affords more flexible and scalable to any size. To validate the new geometry many test devices (trials) were fabricated and tested, among them TiVC showed an areal capacitance of 45.49 and 294.27μFcm−2 at high (10 V/s) and low (0.01 V/s) scan rates using cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique and achieved an areal capacitance of 166.96 and 115.92 μFcm−2 through galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) at 0.1 and 0.5 mA/cm2 applied current respectively.
