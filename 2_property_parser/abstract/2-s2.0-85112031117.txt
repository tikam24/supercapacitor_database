Recently, solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are of great current interest as substitutes to conventional liquid type electrolytes. Although the SPEs significantly alleviate the safety issues of the lithium-ion batteries based on conventional liquid electrolytes, they intrinsically exhibit low ion conductivity. In this study, a bicontinuous solid polymer electrolyte containing polyacrylonitrile (PAN) membrane and a mixture of succinonitrile (SN) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide was prepared with different molarities of the lithium salt. Porous PAN membrane was fabricated via a thermally induced phase separation method (TIPS). The PAN-based SPE exhibited the maximum ionic conductivity of ∼5.0 (Formula presented.) 10−3 S/cm at the salt molarity of 1.0 M.
