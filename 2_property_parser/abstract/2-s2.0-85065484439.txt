Electromagnetic interference in electric vehicles (EVs) is a major problem. In order to achieve electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), analysis of common mode (CM) and differential mode (DM) noises in EVs are essential. In this paper, for the first time, different operation modes of an EV equipped with a supercapacitor are studied from conducted electromagnetic interference (EMI) aspect. In the simulations, the supercapacitor impacts on exceeding the EMI permissible range are investigated considering the relevant standard.
