Nowadays, energy conversion devices have gradually gained attention while vigorously developing clean energy. Carbon materials are promising candidates for supercapacitors, but two issues have plagued the researchers. 1) Does the cation radius in the neutral electrolyte significantly impact the electrochemical performance of carbon materials? 2) How to introduce heteroatoms while constructing hollow structures in carbon spheres. This work proposes a facile template free strategy that uses aniline and pyrrole as nitrogen sources to synthesize carbon sphere precursors. High-temperature carbonization combined with alkali treatment leads to the formation of N-doped hollow porous carbon spheres. Robust wall structure (thickness is about 60–80 nm) and ideal surface structure (the specific surface area is 1079.9 m2 g−1) endow the carbon spheres with excellent electrochemical performance and outstanding cycle stability. The specific capacitance of the carbon spheres in Li2SO4 and Na2SO4 electrolytes under negative working potential (−0.8–0 V) are 378.4 and 367.6 F g−1, respectively, at a current density of 1 A g−1. After 5000 cycles, the capacitance retentions are 87.1% and 94.8% in Li2SO4 and Na2SO4 electrolytes. We inferred that the cation radius has a negligible effect on the specific capacitance of carbon materials, but has a more significant effect on the cycling stability and capacitance rate performance. It is hoped that this work can provide a reference for the subsequent construction of N-doped hollow carbon spheres and reasonable selection of electrolytes.
