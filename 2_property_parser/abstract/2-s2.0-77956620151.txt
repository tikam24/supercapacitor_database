This article presents the main features of electrochemical double layer supercapacitors, made of nanostructured carbon materials with specially selected and optimized porosity structure and electrolyte based on solvent-free ionic liquid as follows 1-methyl-3-butylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (1Me3BuImBF 4). The performance of supercapacitor was carried out by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements. The main characteristics of stacked supercapacitors exhibit a nominal voltage 3.0 V and a maximum cell voltage 3.5 V as well as a specific capacitance (individual electrode of supercapacitor) of 111 F/g. The specific energy of 4.1 Wh/kg and specific power of 1.7 W/kg for industrial stacked supercapacitor has been achieved. Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
