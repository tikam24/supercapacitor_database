Zn-Ni hydroxide nano-sheets were successfully deposited on nickel foams through a mild, cost-effective chemical bath method. SEM observation shows that these interconnected nano-sheets form a uniform marray layer and completely cover the surface of nickel foam. At the same time, additional homogeneously-precipitated hydroxide nano-sheets locate in the skeleton voids of nickel foams as aggregated porous clumps, resulting in a relatively high mass-loading of 4.27 mg/cm2. Afterwards, the electrochemical capacitive behaviors of this binder-free electrode were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. It is found that the Zn-Ni hydroxide electrode exhibits a specific capacitance of 746.2 F/g (areal capacitance of 3.18 F/cm2) at a current density of 1 A/g in 2 mol/L KOH electrolyte. Meanwhile, the Zn-Ni hydroxide electrode also shows a decent long-life cycling stability, retaining 70.9% of the initial capacitance after 3000 charge-discharge cycles.
