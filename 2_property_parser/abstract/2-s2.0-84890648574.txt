A straightforward method is presented for the synthesis of onion like carbon nanoparticles from candle soot (CS) that can be used as an effective electrode material for supercapacitors. Based on well shaped candle soot, a pompom like core-shell MnO2@CS nanocomposite material was also developed to increase the specific capacitance as high as 309 F g-1.
