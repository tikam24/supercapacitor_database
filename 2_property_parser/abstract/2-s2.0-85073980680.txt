Transitional metal oxides are demonstrated as promising candidates for pseudocapacitive electrode materials for use in high-performance supercapacitors. Here, we report a rational design of the MnO2@NiO nanosheets@nanowires hybrid structure. The as-prepared hierarchical structure shows highly uniformity and interconnection between ultrathin MnO2 nanosheets and NiO nanowires. The well-designed MnO2@NiO is directly used as binder-free electrode and exhibits a high specific capacitance (374.6 F g−1 at a current density of 0.25 A g−1; areal capacitance of 1.3 F cm−2), good rate capability, and excellent cycling stability (92.7% capacitance retention after 5000 charge/discharge cycles). An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is assembled using the MnO2@NiO as the positive electrode and activated microwave exfoliated graphite oxide as the negative electrode. The assembled ASC shows excellent electrochemical performance with an energy density of 15.4 W kg−1 and a maximum power density of 9360 W kg−1. These analytical and experimental results clearly indicate the advantages of multicomponent hierarchical core–shell structure for engineering high-performance electrochemical capacitors.
