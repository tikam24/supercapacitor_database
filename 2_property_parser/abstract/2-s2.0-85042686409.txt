The porous structure of three-dimensional graphene not only improves the contact area with the electrolyte but also provides a fast electron transport channels for the active materials anchored on it, therefore the electrochemical performance of the supercapacitors can be effectively enhanced, which makes them to be the promising materials for supercapacitors. This review summarizes the preparation methods of the three-dimensional graphene with a porous structure, large specific surface area, good electrical conductivity and excellent mechanical properties. In addition, the application status of the three-dimensional graphene composites in supercapacitors is described.
