The effect of molarity of SnCl4 in the spraying solution on the properties of tin oxide thin films has been studied. Tin oxide thin films are characterized for structural, optical, morphological and electrochemical measurements. X-ray diffraction patterns reveal polycrystalline nature of tin oxide thin films with tetragonal crystal structure. The films are highly oriented along (200) plane. The AFM results indicate that increase in solution molarity brings about more porous tin oxide thin film surface due to increasing particle size. The optical study suggests that the bandgap of the tin oxide thin films can be decreased by increasing solution molarity of SnCl4. The tin oxide thin films show a good electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance over 150 F g−1 calculated from CV and 138 F g−1 calculated from charge/discharge measurements.
