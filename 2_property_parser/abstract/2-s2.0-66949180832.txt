A new thermal model, which allows temperature distribution determination inside a supercapacitor cell, is developed. The model is tested for a supercapacitor based on the activated carbon and organic electrolyte technology. In hybrid vehicle applications, supercapacitors are used as energy-storage devices, offering the possibility of providing the peak-power requirement. They are charged and discharged at a high current rate. The problem with this operating mode is the large amount of heat produced in the device which can lead to its destruction. An accurate thermal modeling of the internal temperature is required to design a cooling system for supercapacitor module, meeting the safety and reliability of the power systems. The purpose of this paper is to study the supercapacitor temperature distribution in steady and transient states. A thermal model is developed; it is based on the finite-differential method which allows for the supercapacitor thermal resistance determination. The originality of this paper is in the fact that a thermocouple (type K) was placed inside the supercapacitor from Maxwell Technologies. A test bench is realized. The cases of supercapacitor thermal distribution using natural and forced convection are studied. Simulations and experimental results are reported to validate the proposed model. The results obtained with this model may be used to determine the cooling system required for actual supercapacitor applications. Â© 2009 IEEE.
