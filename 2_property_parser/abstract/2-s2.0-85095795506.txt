Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) derived materials are promising materials for energy storage due to good conductivity as well as the ability for effective charge-transfer and mass-transfer. However, the agglomeration properties, poor pores and surface inertness of rGO limit its applications in energy storage. Herein, rGO modified by N-doped mesoporous carbon layers anchored by hollow carbon spheres nanocomposites (rGONC) have been prepared via a strategy of direct multi-constituent co-assembly. The obtained rGONC exerts the synergistic effects of both components with favorable characteristics such as mesoporous hollow structure with separated rGO sheets, high specific surface area and moderate N doping, making it an effective applying in energy storage systems. When rGONC is used for potassium-ion batteries, a high initial reversible capacity, an ultra-long cycling life, as well as a prominent rate capability are received. As an electrode in supercapacitors, rGONC demonstrates outstanding electrochemical performances of a high specific capacitance, a superior cycling stability and an extraordinary rate capability.
