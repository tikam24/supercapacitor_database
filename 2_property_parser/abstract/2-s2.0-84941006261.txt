Ultralong (NH4)2V6O16·1.5H2O nanobelts were synthesised by a combination of sol-gel and hydrothermal methods. The chemical composition, morphology and microstructure of products were characterised by X-raypowderdiffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, field emissionSEM and TEM respectively. Typical (NH4)2V6O16·1.5H2Onanobelts are several hundreds of micrometres in length, 502100 nm in thickness and 2002500 nm in width. It is indicated that SO2-4 ions are critical to the formation of ultralong nanobelts. Electrochemical performance shows that (NH4)2V6O16·1.5H2O nanobelts can exhibit a specific capacitance as high as 220 F g-1 at 0.05 A g-1 over a potential range of 20.1-0.9 V in 1MNaNO3 due to their high conductivity and ion diffusion rate. Thiswork provides new insights for the growth of ultralong NH4V3O8 nanobelts and their application in supercapacitors.
