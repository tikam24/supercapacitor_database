This paper deals with energy management of hybrid system composed of (PV-Battery-Ultracapacitor) for remote area. In effect, PV panels are coupled to boost converter with Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) Control. In other hand, batteries are connected to reversible DC-DC converter to regulate the Direct Current (DC) bus and control the State of Charge (SOC) of batteries. Another ultra-capacitor is also associated to batteries in order to compensate the peak power. So, an energy control algorithm is developed to manage the energy flow between the input sources. An intensive simulation is carried-out to prove the effectiveness of the power control.
