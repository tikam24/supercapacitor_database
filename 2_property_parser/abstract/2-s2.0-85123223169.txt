The proceedings contain 107 papers. The topics discussed include: ESR and capacity measurement of supercapacitor banks; on the transient of the induction machine with rotor in motion when connecting to the power supply; fault tolerant fractional-slot concentrated-wound permanent magnet synchronous motor with redundancy for critical applications; arc protection function modelling using petri nets; modeling and simulation of electromagnetic absorption properties of nano-structured composites in the radio frequency/microwave range; a new approach for long-term optimal scheduling of photovoltaic panels cleaning; and solving multimodal problems using genetic algorithms â€“ a case study in electromagnetics.
