In this contribution, a comprehensive discussion of electrochemical energy conversion systems, particularly about batteries, fuel cells, and capacitors, is presented, by focusing on fundamental theory, background information, classification, analysis, and performance assessment. The types of fuel cells, batteries, and supercapacitors are described for various applications. Thermodynamic analyses of fuel cell systems are also presented, including a case study and illustrative example. Furthermore, the electrochemical measurement techniques are evaluated for practical applications.
