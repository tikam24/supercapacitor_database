A hierarchical structure consisting of Ni-Co hydroxide nanosheets (NCHN) electrodeposited on vertically-oriented graphene nanosheets (GN) on carbon cloth (CC) was fabricated for high-performance pseudocapacitive electrodes. NCHN was uniformly distributed on GN, forming a sheet-on-sheet hierarchical structure. Such NCHN/GN/CC hybrid electrodes exhibit high capacitance and ultrahigh electrochemical-stability that structure and electrochemical properties of hybrid electrodes are not affected by the cyclic low-rate scanning (at 5 mV s-1 even over 1000 cycles). GN vertically grown on CC is used as nano-bridge between NCHN active materials and CC current collector, which effectively facilitates ion/charge transfer between the electrolyte and electrode, consequently leading to the ultrahigh electrochemical-stability of hybrid electrodes. To assess functional behavior, two-terminal flexible asymmetric supercapacitor devices with NCHN/GN/CC as positive electrode and GN/CC as negative electrode were assembled and electrochemically treated to demonstrate the ultrahigh electrochemical stability.
