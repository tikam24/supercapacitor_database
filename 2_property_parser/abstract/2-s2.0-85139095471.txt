In order to meet the requirements of the power performance and load capacity of the fuel cell hybrid electric tram，a parameter configuration method based on the fish swarm optimization algorithm was proposed. Based on the tram dynamics model，the traction calculation under three driving states is completed，the fuel cell/lithium battery/supercapacitor hybrid power system is selected，and the multi-objective function with the smallest system volume and mass is established. The algorithm solves the configuration number of fuel cells，lithium batteries and super capacitors，and analyzes the parameter configuration results and the dynamic performance verification. The results show that compared with the particle swarm method，the method proposed in this paper has faster convergence speed，smaller volume and mass，higher power density and energy density，and makes full use of the transmission advantages of each power source to ensure the stable operation of trams.
