Novel unique fabrication of ZnO nanoparticles decorated graphene beaded carbon nanofibers (G-CNF) encapsulated by polyaniline (PANI) nanocomposites through three steps by electrospinning, hydrothermal and in-situ polymerization is reported. As-synthesized G-CNF/ZnO/PANI and CNF/ZnO/PANI nanocomposites were comparatively studied by scanning electron microscopy and electrochemical characterizations for supercapacitor application. Electrochemical measurements of G-CNF/ZnO/PANI electrode revealed the maximum specific capacitance, discharge time, energy density and power density as compared to that of CNF/ZnO/PANI indicating the increase in surface area due to graphene incorporation in electrospinning of carbon nanofibers. The combination of electric double layer charge (EDLC) capacitance from high surface area of G-CNF and pseudo-capacitance from PANI and ZnO nanoparticles facilitates the synergistic effect of ternary components to enhance the electrochemical performance of G-CNF/ZnO/PANI nanocomposite.
