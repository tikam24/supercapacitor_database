High surface area carbon, ionic liquid and polymer are incorporated in an electromechanically active composite. This laminate bends when voltage (typically less than 3 V) is applied between the electrodes, and generates voltage and current when bent with an external force. By suitable optimization, the material can be used either as an actuator, energy storage element (supercapacitor) or sensor. Strain caused by bending promotes dislocation of ions in the micropores of carbon. As a result, the charge separation occurs because ions of ionic liquid are likely trapped in the micropores of diameters close to the ion sizes..
