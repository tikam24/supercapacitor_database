Co3O4 has attracted tremendous attention for the application in supercapacitors, but the design and fabrication of Co-based electrodes in novel construction are still a challenge. An effective strategy is successfully demonstrated to promote electrochemical performance by the combination of Co3O4 with highly conductive transition metal phosphides Co2P to form a composite electrode. The as-synthesized Co2P decorated Co3O4 nanocomposites (Co2P@Co3O4) exhibit an enhanced areal specific capacitance of 0.504 C cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2 and the capacitance is increased by 49.2% compared to that of the pure Co3O4 electrode. Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor by the assembly of a Co2P@Co3O4 cathode and a porous carbon cloth (PCC) anode exhibits a maximum volumetric capacitance of 5 C cm−3 and excellent cycling performance (only 6% capacitance loss after 8000 cycles) at a reversible working voltage of 1.6 V.
