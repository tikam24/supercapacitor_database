Metal sulfides (MS) and mixed metal sulfides (MTMS) have been considered potential candidates over their metal oxide/mixed metal oxide counterparts in recent years. Herein, one MTMS, i.e., NiCo2S4, was combined with 2D MS MoS2 through a single-step solvothermal process with different morphologies (sheet-like and rod-like) for supercapacitor applications. The resulting electrode exhibited excellent coulombic efficiency, high specific capacitance, superior energy density, and, most importantly, ultra-high cycling stability. In particular, the electrode delivered a capacitance of 2594 F g−1 at 0.8 A g−1 after 45,000 charge/discharge cycles with a remarkable stability of 192%. Moreover, the corresponding hybrid supercapacitor device displayed an impressive coulombic efficiency of 123% after 20,000 cycles and 118% after 45,000 cycles. In addition, the device also exhibited a decent energy density of 31.9 Wh kg−1 and good cycling stability of 102% over 15,000 cycles.
