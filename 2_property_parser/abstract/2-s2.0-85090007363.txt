Energy is essential for human development. The consumption and production of energy dependent on combustion of fossil fuels will severely impact the global economy and environment. Therefore, the demand for high performance, environment friendly renewable energy storage devices is growing. Electrochemical energy is an inevitable part of the clean energy portfolio. Supercapacitors have received a lot of attention due to their unique characteristics such as high power, longevity and environmentally friendly nature. They support the energy-power distinction between conventional capacitor (high specific power) and fuel cells/batteries (high specific energy). In this point of view, global research has been reported to address this and rapid progress in the utilization aspects of basic as well as the applied supercapacitors. At present years, there has been increasing interest in hypercross-linked polymer (HCP) derived porous carbons as an alternative electrode material for supercapacitor. HCP is promising for the development of an alternative supercapacitor electrode material because of its ease of synthesis and its high surface area and microporous nature. The present article reviews recent developments in the porous carbon originated from HCP, heteroatom doped HCPs and its composites for supercapacitor applications.
