This study depicts the chemical synthesis and supercapacitive behavior of nanocomposites of Polyaniline nanorods wrap with graphene oxide (PANI/GO). Synthesis of PANI/GO nanocomposites was carried out by in situ oxidative solution polymerization of aniline in the presence of Nitric acid, acting as a proton donor. The nanocomposites were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis, contact angle analysis, cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge test and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. FESEM revealed the formation of PANI nanorods with the aspect ratio in the range of 3–5, while TEM revealed the wrapping of GO sheets on the PANI nanorods. Thermal stability showed decreasing trend while surface hydrophobicity was of increasing trend with GO concentration due to partial reduction of GO, as observed in Raman spectra. PANI/10 wt% GO (PANI/GO 10 ) nanocomposite electrode showed highest specific capacitance of 276 F/g as compared with 180 F/g of Pure PANI. Cyclic stability of 80% was retained for PANI/GO 10 nanocomposites after 500 cycles at a current density of 0.5A/g as compared with unstable PANI. The enhanced specific capacitance and good cyclic stability with increasing GO concentration revealed the good potential of PANI/GO nanocomposites for supercapacitor applications. POLYM.
