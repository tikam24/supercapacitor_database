Micro-supercapacitors with excellent electrochemical performance and aesthetic property are realized using the carbon nanotubes/manganese dioxide nanosheets (CNTs/δ-MnO2) composite as electrodes. This CNTs/δ-MnO2 nanocomposite is excellently compatible with the slurry dispensing process for electrode fabrication, and thus is conducive for preparing thick electrode films, which exhibits a specific capacitance of 257 F/g with an electrode thickness of 13 μm. By involving laser-scribing technique, the electrode film can be patterned with a high resolution and fabricated into a planar micro-supercapacitor, showing the maximum energy density of 6.83 mWh/cm3 at the power density of 154.3 mW/cm3, and maintained a value of 2.71 mWh/cm3 at the maximum power density of 2557.5 mW/cm3. Considering the versatility of the laser-scribing technical platform, the micro-supercapacitors fabricated in this way exhibit excellent aesthetic property and can cater to various miniaturized wearable electronic applications. This technology opens up opportunities for facile and scalable fabrication of high performance energy devices with shape diversity and a meaning of art.
