Two-dimensional (2D) porous carbon nanosheets attract great attention because of their thin sheet-like morphology, abundant pores and high specific surface area, and their potential applicability in many fields including adsorption, oxygen reduction reaction, organic transistor and energy storage. Herein, a feasible method, named self-templating, to prepare 2D nitrogen-doping hierarchically porous carbon nanosheets (N-HPCNs) with prominent performances as supercapacitor electrode is reported. During the process of preparation, the inexpensive and easily available MgO rods are treated in water to form Mg(OH)2 nanosheets further using as templates and then nitrogen contained resorcinol–formaldehyde resin oligomers as carbon and nitrogen precursor co-condense onto the templates by electrostatic interaction. The obtained N-HPCNs with large specific surface area, hierarchical pores and unique interconnected sheet-like structure are the potential candidates for high energy storage devices. As an active electrode material for electrochemical double-layer capacitors, N-HPCNs exhibit a capacitance of 201 F g−1 at current density of 1 A g−1 and high specific capacitance (78.1% retention of initial capacitance even at 10 A g−1), with excellent cycling life stability (3.5% loss after 5000 cycles).
