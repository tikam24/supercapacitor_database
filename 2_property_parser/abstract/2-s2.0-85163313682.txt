This paper presents an intelligent power control strategy for the hybrid power system (HPS) independent microgrid which uninterruptedly provides the load's demand. This HPS system consists of a solar array, fuel cell, battery bank, supercapacitor, a DC bus and an AC bus as well. Intelligent computation of injected power references for the green resources converters as well as the reference power of storage unit converters executed through the artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm. Hence, this artificial intelligent supervisory controller can handle the sustainability of a stand-alone hybrid microgrid when it faces unpredictable fluctuations in the environmental parameter and load demand changes. The dynamic of each resource and storage system is challenged in three different test scenarios. This model is implemented in MATLAB/Simulink, and the observations of the presented results confirm that a combination of available resources and storage devices should be used to guarantee the resiliency of any microgrid.
