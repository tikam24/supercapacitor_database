A novel hybrid of polyaniline nanowire array/three-dimensional hollow graphene balls-graphene oxide (PANI NWA/3D HGBs-GO) is prepared. 3D HGBs are first fabricated by template-oriented carbon segregation, and then PANI NWAs are grown on their surface by in situ polymerization to obtain PANI NWA/3D HGBs. Finally, the surface of PANI NWA/3D HGBs is modified by hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium Bromide (CTAB), and PANI NWA/3D HGBs and GO are combined by electrostatic self-assembly method to obtain PANI NWA/3D HGBs-GO composite. Due to the unique structure, the hybrid exhibits a high specific capacitance of 690.0 F·g−1 at 1 A·g−1. When it is assembled into a symmetric supercapacitor, it exhibits an energy density of 30.9 Wh·kg−1 at a power density of 690.1 W·kg−1 and maintains a good cycle stability of 90% after 10,000 cycles at 1.0 A·g−1.
