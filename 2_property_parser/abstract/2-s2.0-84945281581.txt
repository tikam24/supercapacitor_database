A facile one-pot hydrothermal method was developed to synthesize a CoMoO4/Co3O4 hybrid nanostructure where CoMoO4 nanosheets were supported by a hierarchical framework assembled by Co3O4 nanorods. The morphology and structure of this three dimensional nanocomposite were characterized in detail and a rational growth mechanism was proposed based on them. The unique structural features of our CoMoO4/Co3O4 hierarchical nanohybrid allow for high specific surface and multiple faradaic redox reactions for electrode materials of supercapacitors. Consequently, a high specific capacitance (1062.5 F g-1 at the current density of 1 A g-1) and an excellent cyclic performance (90.38% of the initial capacitance retained after 2000 cycles at a current density of 20 A g-1) were obtained. In addition, an asymmetric supercapacitor with high energy density of 31.64 W h kg-1 was achieved at a power density of 7270 W kg-1. This work thus provides an excellent candidate for high-performance supercapacitor fabrication.
