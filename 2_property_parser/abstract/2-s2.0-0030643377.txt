The growing interest in electrochemical ultracapacitors is stimulated by their potential application for secondary power-storage in electric vehicles. We have been investigating polythiophene derivatives which n and p doped reversibly over a more than two volt range. In this paper, we report on the preparation and the electrochemical characterization of a series of 3-(monofluorophenyl)thiophene, 3-(difluorophenyl)thiophene and 3-(cyanophenyl)thiophene monomers. Monomer and polymer oxidation and reduction potentials are correlated with the number and position of the fluorine substituents on the phenyl ring. The electrochemical polymerization and charge-discharge properties of the resulting polymers were studied in various organic electrolytes. A strong substituent effect on the polymerization efficiency and on the charge-discharge behavior of the polymer, particularly in the cathodic region, was observed. Performance data of a symmetric supercapacitor based on 3-(monofluorophenyl)thiophene and 3-(difluorophenyl)thiophene is presented.
