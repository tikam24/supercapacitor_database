MnO2 nanoparticle was produced using liquid coprecipitation method, CNT was produced using microwaveplasma chemical vapor deposition(MWPCVD). SEM and EDS were used to examine the morphology and the elements of the samples. The diameter of MnO2 particle is about 300nm. And the CNT sample has a diameter about 10~20nm and a length longer than 5 μm. Two methods, namely annealing and doping CNT, were used to modify the electrochemical characteristics of MnO2 particle. The electrochemical characteristics were tested using galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling. And the results demonstrated that the prepared MnO2 have a good pseudocapacitance behavior and power characteristic. And the specific capacitor (SC) of MnO2 particle was about 145.41F/g, the SC of CNT was 136.30F/g, the one up to 179.89F/g with a dopant of CNT. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
