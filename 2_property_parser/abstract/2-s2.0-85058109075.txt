PbO2 electrode is one of crucial materials in electrochemical field, however, the fabrications of nanostructured PbO2 materials are highly confined to the template method. In this work, the nanostructured PbO2 materials were controllably synthesized by template-free electrodeposition method. It is found that the microstructure of PbO2 material was highly depended on the electrochemical deposition models, i.e., cyclic voltammetry (CV) method, potentiostatic method (PM), pulse potentiostatic method (PPM) and pulse galvanostatic method (PGM). Especially, PbO2 nanorod built by nanoparticles with chrysanthemum-like array synthesized in the absence of template by pulse potential deposition method showed high specific capacitance and good stability for supercapacitor application.
