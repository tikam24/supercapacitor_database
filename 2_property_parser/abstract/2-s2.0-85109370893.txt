The hybrid ion capacitor (HIC) is a hybrid electrochemical energy storage device that combines the intercalation mechanism of a lithium-ion battery anode with the double-layer mechanism of the cathode. Thus, an HIC combines the high energy density of batteries and the high power density of supercapacitors, thus bridging the gap between batteries and supercapacitors. Two-dimensional (2D) carbon materials (graphite, graphene, carbon nanosheets) are promising candidates for hybrid capacitors owing to their unique physical and chemical properties, including their enormous specific surface areas, abundance of active sites (surface and functional groups), and large interlayer spacing. So far, there has been no review focusing on the 2D carbon-based materials for the emerging post-lithium hybrid capacitors. This concept review considers the role of 2D carbon in hybrid capacitors and the recent progress in the application of 2D carbon materials for post-Li (Na+, K+, Zn2+) hybrid capacitors. Moreover, their challenges and trends in their future development are discussed.
