At present, the in situ synthesis of polyaniline (PANI) nanotubes via self-assembly of organic dopant acid is a particularly charming task in supercapacitors. Herein, we report the formation of uniform PANI nanotubes doped with malic acid (MA) and other organic acids, such as propionic acid (PA), succinic acid (SA), tartaric acid (TA) and citric acid (CA), which simultaneously acts as a dopant acid as well as a structure-directing agent. The morphology, structure and thermal stability of PANI nanotubes were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectra, Ultraviolet-visible spectra (UV-vis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Meanwhile, the electrochemical performance of the fabricated electrodes was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Furthermore, the PANI-MA and PANI-CA nanotubes, with [aniline]/[acid] molar ratio of 4:1, possessed highest specific capacitance of 658 F/g and 617 F/g at the current density of 0.1 A/g in 1.0 M H2SO4 electrolyte due to their unique nanotubular structures. It makes PANI nanotubes a promising electrode material for high performance supercapacitors.
