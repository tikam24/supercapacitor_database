This paper studies a Hybrid Renewable Energy System (HRES) as a reliable source of the power supply in the case of the connection to the grid. The grid connection imposes restrictions to the power delivered and harmonic content on the HRES. This causes the HRES to use multiple control systems and subsystems, as the normalization of the measurements, the current control, active harmonic compensation, synchronization, etc., described in this paper. Particular attention was paid to interactions in the storage system of the HRES. The durability of the HRES can be increased by the combination of the supercapacitors and batteries. This requires a power management solution for controlling the energy storage system. The aim of the supercapacitors is to absorb/inject the high-frequency fluctuations of the power and to smooth out the power of the batteries system of the HRES. This can be possible owing to the use of a low-pass second order filter, explained in this paper, which separates the high-frequency component of the storage system reference for the supercapacitor from the low-frequency component for the batteries system. This solution greatly increases the reliability and durability of the HRES.
