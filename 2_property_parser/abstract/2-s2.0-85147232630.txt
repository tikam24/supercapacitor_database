Polyoxometalates (POMs) are anionic metal-oxide clusters with diverse sizes and shapes. Because of their remarkable redox behavior and excellent affinity, they are often used as a multifunctional inorganic polydentate ligands. POMs can effectively combine various metal ions and organic ligands to synthesize porous materials with better structure and function. 1,3,5-benzene-tricarboxylic acid (BTC) is an oxygen-containing ligand with three symmetrically arranged carboxylic acid groups forming rigid planar connectors. Due to its high reactivity and multiple coordination modes, it is easy to modify and functionalize the POMs. Many studies have been carried out on BTC modified POMs. This review summarizes and compares the advantages and disadvantages of various synthesis methods of POMs modified by BTC, and summarizes the applications of synthetic compounds in different fields. In fact, there are four combinations between BTC and various POMs. BTC can not only be used as a template to support polymolybdate, but also form a large class of M−BTC to further modify POMs to form a large class of POM@M−BTC. POM@M−BTC not only combines their advantages, but also overcomes defects of POMs instability and achieves maximum material functionalization in many fields, which is the direction of future development. Therefore, the design and exploration of compounds based on BTC modified POMs are still the most compelling and challenging fields in POM chemistry.
