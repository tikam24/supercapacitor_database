This paper deals with a promising multi-functional material for energy storage and photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants. RGO-supported α-Fe2O3 nanocomposites (RGO@α-Fe2O3NC) were effectively prepared using the sol–gel method. The as-synthesized samples were utilized for the electrochemical energy storage device as well as for the photocatalytic activity. Further, the RGO@α-Fe2O3NC was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The 25 nm-sized α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles combined with RGO sheets showed specific capacitance of 127 F g−1 in addition to a superior cell voltage of 2 V. Enhancement in the degradation of the methylene blue (MB) dye was observed within 30 min, and robust photostability of the RGO@α-Fe2O3NC was detected when compared with bare RGO sheets and α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles.
