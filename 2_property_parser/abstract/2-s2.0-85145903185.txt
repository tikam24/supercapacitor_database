In this study, we report a one-step method to synthesize Co(OH)2 nanoflakes intercalated into nitrogen-doped graphene oxide (NrGO). The NrGO-Co(OH)2 (abbreviated as NRCO) nanocomposite is used as a positrode to fabricate a supercapattery device with activated carbon as the negative electrode. The surface morphology and microstructure of the NRCO nanocomposites were confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscope imaging and the structure was analysed by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. The electrochemical performances of the NRCO nanocomposite electrode are examined using cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurement. The NRCO nanocomposite electrode displayed a specific capacity of 75.2 C/g in a 1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. The cycle life of the supercapattery device fabricated with NRCO nanocomposite [with 2 wt.% CO(OH)2] exhibits a specific capacity to retain 93.1% of its initial capacity even after completing 3000 continuous charge/discharge cycles, which shows its potential among current energy storage devices.
