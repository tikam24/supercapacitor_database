The solubility of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) in nitromethane/water mixture was calculated by Hansen solubility parameter, and observed using optical microscope. The results showed PAN electrospinning precursor can be obtained in nitromethane and water mixed solvent with some volume ratio. PAN porous electrospun fibers/ribbons were obtained via solvent induced phase separation methods during electrospinning process. Then, PAN electrospun fibers/ribbons were carbonized and activated, the carbon nano-fibers/ribbons with meso/macro pores structure can be prepared. Furthermore, the supercapacitors were fabricated by porous PAN electrospun fibers/ribbons and carbon nano-fibers/ribbons as separator and electrode, respectively. The relationship between electrochemical performance and pore structure parameter of nano-fibers/ribbons was investigated in ionic liquid electrolyte, the results showed nano-ribbons with a high proportion meso/macro pores structure, which achieved high specific capacity (244.1 F·g−1), high charging/discharging efficiency (99.8%) and low internal resistance (0.52 Ω).
