Development of pseudocapacitive electrode materials with wide potential windows is the major challenge for supercapacitor application to overcome the critical energy crisis. In this consequence, we have prepared Mn3O4-WO3 nanoparticles based nanocomposite with the variable stoichiometric amount of Mn sources via the one-pot solvothermal method. Among all the synthesized nanocomposite and bare samples, Mn3O4-WO3 (10:1) nanoparticles nanocomposite pursue excellent specific capacitance in three and two-electrode systems. In a three-electrode system the synthesized Mn3O4-WO3 (10:1) nanoparticles nanocomposite displays maximum specific capacitance 358 F g−1 using a neutral electrolyte with a wide working potential window. The electrokinetic analysis of the synthesized Mn3O4-WO3 (10:1) nanoparticles nanocomposite has been predominant capacitive contribution over the charge storage. Further the fabricated symmetric supercapacitor device (SSD) using Mn3O4-WO3 (10:1) nanocomposite pursues the maximum specific capacitance 101 F g−1 along with the energy density of 56.11 Wh kg−1 and power density 5 kW kg−1. Moreover the fabricated device of the synthesized Mn3O4-WO3 (10:1) nanocomposite demonstrates outstanding durability which has 95.5% specific capacitance retention upto 5000 continuous charge-discharge cycles. The improved stability and higher electrochemical activity are due to the nanocomposite effect, high pore volume and surface area, and low charge transfer resistance of the synthesized Mn3O4-WO3 (10:1) nanocomposite.
