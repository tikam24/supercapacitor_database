Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework (ZIF-67) was prepared in two different solvents-water and methanol. Nanoporous carbon was derived from ZIF-67 via pyrolysis in an inert atmosphere. Anion exchange step of sulfidation on the synthesized material has a great influence on the structure and properties. Structural morphology and thermal stability were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM)/energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. The electrochemical analysis was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry, and impedance analysis. The as-prepared nanoporous carbon and cobalt sulfide (NPC/CS) electrode material (water) in 2M KOH electrolyte solution exhibit high specific capacitance of 677 F/g. The excellent electrochemical performance of the NPC/CS was attributed to its hierarchical structure. This functionalized ZIF driven strategy paves the way to the preparation of various metal oxide and metal sulfide-based nanoheterostructures by varying the type of metal.
