The association of more than one storage system to ensure the supplying of the hybrid and electric vehicle became more and more useful by the cars manufacturers. The asked question in this case is the optimal amount of the deferent energy sources to ensure the mission with the best lifetime. The first parameter witch influence the architecture of the hybrid storage system is the required autonomy. This paper deals with the choice of the architecture and the sizing of the hybrid source composed with battery and supercapacitor packs according to the desired autonomy. In this case, two technologies of Li-ion battery (power and energetic technologies) are associated with the supercapacitor. The obtained result about the size and the ageing of the source will be compared to that obtained using only power technology of Li-ion battery to supply the vehicle Â© 2013 IEEE.
