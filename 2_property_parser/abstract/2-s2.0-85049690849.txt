In this work, we propose an electromagnetic energy harvester and energy storage system for bike lighting applications. On the basis of an energy harvester technique, an electromagnetic mechanism will be designed to drive light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The circuit framework, which comprises an electromagnetic energy harvester, an energy storage capacitor, a boost controller and lighting LEDs, is a kind of wireless sensors network (WSN). This novel design has the following features: (1) the LED is driven via an electromagnetic mechanism without the need for an external power source or battery, (2) an ultracapacitor is used as an energy storage device to deposit induction energy when the bicycle is moving, and (3) power is uninterruptible because electric energy accumulated on the ultracapacitor is supplied to the LED when the bicycle is stopped. In order to verify the feasibility of the proposed bike lighting applications, a prototype electromagnetic energy harvester with the electronic circuit is installed and tested on a bicycle. The experimental results indicate a satisfactory performance. The LED is effectively lit whether the bicycle is moving or at rest.
