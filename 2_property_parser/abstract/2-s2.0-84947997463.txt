A novel negative electrode material of 3D irregular ellipsoidal VO2 with excellent pseudocapacitive properties is synthesized via a simple heat treatment method. The structural analysis and morphological features show the stable morphological basis of this material, which can favor electron transportation and electroactive species diffusion. The VO2 displays an excellent specific capacitance of 548 F g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1, a wide potential window of -1.0 V to 1.0 V, an excellent energy density of 194.8 W h kg-1 at a power density of 400.5 W kg-1, and a rapidly reversible redox Faraday response. In addition, a VO2//VO2 symmetric supercapacitor has been assembled with a high potential window of 1.6 V, higher than traditional carbon-based cells. As a result, the VO2//VO2 symmetric supercapacitor can deliver a specific capacitance of 60 F g-1 at a current density of 0.25 A g-1 with a good energy density (21.3 W h kg-1 at a power density of 207.2 W kg-1) and stable power characteristics, which demonstrate the excellent performance of the VO2//VO2 symmetric supercapacitor and the great potential of using a VO2 electrode as the negative and/or positive electrodes for supercapacitors with a high comprehensive performance.
