Design of an electrode is an important aspect to enhance the energy density of an energy storage device. However, challenges with conventional brush-coated electrodes still exist in achieving the goal of stable electrochemical performances. Herein, for the first time, island-structured and fractal-like electrodes are made by the friction generated and lifted Hele-Shaw cell method, respectively, using few-layer graphene (FLG). The island-structured electrodes exhibit a large perimeter-to-area ratio of >1 μm−1 as compared to the fractal-like electrodes. The surface is more irregular, rough, and porous in the case of an island-structured electrodes resulting in a large fractal dimension (Df) of 2.83. The island-structured electrode shows nearly two-fold gravimetric capacitance (CS) of 145 F g−1 at 0.50 A g−1 for three-electrode test as compared to brush-coated (77.2 F g−1) under 0.5 M K2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. However, a symmetric device capacitance (Cdev) of 57.5 F g−1 at 0.50 A g−1 is found for full configuration test for island-structured electrodes. A 27 % enhanced energy density (E) of 5.1 Wh kg−1 at power density (P) of 800 W kg−1 is obtained for island-structured electrodes as compared to brush-coated. Also, charge-transfer resistance (R2) is low for the island-structured electrodes (3.6 Ω). A practical aqueous device with total Cdev of 8.1 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 is demonstrated with lighted LED using FLG as the electrode material. Under aqueous electrolyte conditions, the FLG device obtains an E of 4.5 Wh kg−1 at P of 100 W kg−1. Considering its large capacitance, easy fabrication, and short processing time, an island-structured electrode can be a better choice for energy storage devices.
