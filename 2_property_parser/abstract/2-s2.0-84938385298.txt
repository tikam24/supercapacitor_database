High-power supercapacitors require excellent electrolyte mobility within the pore network and high electrical conductivity for maximum capacitance and efficiency. Achieving high power typically requires sacrificing energy densities, as the latter demands a high specific surface area and narrow porosity that impedes ion transport. We present a novel solution for this optimization problem: a nanostructured core-shell carbonaceous material that exhibits a microporous carbon core surrounded by a mesoporous, graphitic shell. Our tunable synthesis parameters yielded a structure that features either a sharp or a gradual transition between the core and shell sections. Electrochemical supercapacitor testing using organic electrolyte revealed that these novel core-shell materials outperform carbons with homogeneous pore structures. The hybrid core-shell materials showed a combination of good capacitance retention, typical for the carbon present in the shell and high specific capacitance, typical for the core material. These materials achieved power densities in excess of 40 kW kg-1 at energy densities reaching 27 Wh kg-1.
