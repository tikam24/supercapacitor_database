As highly efficient and clean electrochemical energy storage devices, supercapacitors (SCs) have drawn widespread attention as promising alternatives to batteries in recent years. Among various electrode materials, iron oxide materials have been widely studied as negative SC electrode materials due to their broad working window in negative potential, ideal theoretical specific capacitance, good redox activity, abundant availability, and eco-friendliness. However, iron oxides still suffer from the problems of low stability and poor conductivity. In this review, recent progress in iron oxide-based nanomaterials, including Fe 2 O 3 , Fe 3 O 4 , Fe x O y , and FeOOH, as electrode materials of SCs, is discussed. The nanostructure design and various synergistic effects of nanocomposites for improving the electrochemical performance of iron oxides are emphasized. Research on iron oxide-based symmetric/asymmetric SCs is also discussed. Future outlooks regarding iron oxides for SCs are likewise proposed.
