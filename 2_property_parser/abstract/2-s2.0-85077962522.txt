A lithium-ion capacitor is called a hybrid capacitor. It is a new energy storage device that combines the advantages of lithium-ion batteries that have been widely used and electric double-layer capacitors used for energy regeneration and electric power storage of automobiles. As it has not been long since the development of lithium-ion capacitors was started, it is generally difficult to procure them from the market except some overseas and Japanese manufacturers. However, many different varieties of lithiumion capacitors are expected to be commonly used with the future development of the market. This study opens a new path to the development of vertical lithium-ion capacitors.
