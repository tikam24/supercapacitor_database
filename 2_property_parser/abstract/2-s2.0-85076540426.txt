This paper designs a set of electromagnetic energy saving intelligent vehicle which can effectively save energy and ensure high speed running. The design includes the design of the mechanical structure of the vehicle model, the design of the circuit module, the design of the sensor signal processing, the design of the supercapacitor module, the preparation of the control algorithm five modules. The design of the mechanical structure of the car model is mainly about the design of the overall structure of the car and the selection of the car model materials, which can reduce the resistance and gravity of the car as much as possible, reduce energy consumption, improve the stability of the car and obtain a faster speed. The key point of circuit module design is to coordinate the work between each module, effectively reduce the total power consumption, and achieve energy saving. The sensor signal processing design focuses on the track information acquired according to the acquisition, so that the car can accurately and quickly adjust the attitude and smoothly pass through various tracks. The ultracapacitor module is the source of energy and power for the whole car. Giving full play to each joule is the key to energy saving. Control algorithm is the soul of the car, this paper is the incremental PID, to deal with a variety of tracks.
