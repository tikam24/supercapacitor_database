The reduced graphene oxide/polyaniline/Ni(OH)2 (GP-Ni(OH)2) and reduced graphene oxide/polyaniline/Ni (GP-Ni) nanocomposites were synthesized by facile in situ single step chemical method. The constituents were confirmed by powder-XRD, and the electrochemical characterizations were carried out using cyclic voltammetry(CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The electrochemical contribution of Ni(OH)2 and Ni to their supercapacitance along with reduced graphene oxide and polyaniline was compared. The GP-Ni nanocomposite exhibited a specific capacitance of 266.66 F g-1, energy density of 53.33 W h kg-1 and power density of 1385 W kg-1 at a current density of 0.25 A g-1 and the results were enhanced to 21% and more promising than that of nanocomposite GP-Ni(OH)2.
