As one of the supercapacitor materials, nickel–vanadium layered double hydroxide (NiV-LDH) has received wide attention, but poor electrochemical stability and capacitance constrain their applications. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) enable solving these issues. Herein, NiV-LDH@CNT is well designed and prepared through a facile one-step refluxing method, which is free of high temperature and complicated equipment. Benefiting from the hierarchical and accessible structure, the NiV-LDH@CNT composite indicates a high specific capacitance (1493 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and 432 F g−1 at 50 A g−1). It also has 68.8% cycling durability after 1000 charge/discharge cycles at 20 A g−1, compared with that of NiV-LDH of 28.1%. Furthermore, the asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) with activated carbon (AC) and NiV-LDH@CNT are fabricated by the screen-printing method. Surprisingly, the as-fabricated NiV-LDH@CNT//AC ASC device can achieve an ideal specific capacitance (85 F g−1 at 2 A g−1) and a large energy density (95.6 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 5417.8 W kg−1), which can be a great promising candidate for electrodes in the energy storage device.
