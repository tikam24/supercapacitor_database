Nanoceramics have conquered remarkable interest in the scientific community due to their wide range of properties and increased efficiency in energy storage applications. Nanoceramics exhibit exceptional characteristics in the physical, chemical, and mechanical domains. They have become a new backbone of composite materials due to their ability to induce phenomenal elevation in stress-endurance. The nanoceramic composites have 200% higher strength retention at extended temperatures and enhanced creep characteristics than pure ceramics. They have been intensively explored in various applications, including biomedical, wastewater treatment, and energy domains. High porosity, high surface area, elevated Seebeck values and dielectric constant values have made them feasible with energy innovation needs. Nanoceramics can be a game changer in applications like solid oxide fuel cells and photovoltaics that demand lower operating temperatures, lower operational costs, and higher oxygen activity based on their electrolyte moiety. This review discusses nanoceramic synthesis methodologies, fabrication techniques and properties, and applications in batteries, capacitors, and solid oxide fuel cells. This review highlights the critical developments in nanoceramics that have taken place from the early 2000s up to recent times in versatile wings of the energy sector, like energy harvesting, energy conversion, and energy storage.
