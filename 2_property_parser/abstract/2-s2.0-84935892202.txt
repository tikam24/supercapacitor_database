In this work, nickel cobalt oxides with controlled morphology are fabricated through a facile surfactant free hydrothermal method. When using urea as precipitant, mesoporous microsphere assembled by densely packed nano-needles is obtained. The molar ratio between nickel and cobalt (nNi:mCo) shows a significant influence on the fine nanostructure as well as the electrochemical capacitive behaviors of the products. When nNi:mCo equals to 1, the as-prepared nickel cobalt oxide exhibits maximum specific capacitance value of 696 Fg1 at a current density of 1 Ag1 with high mass loading of 6 mg cm2, and excellent cycling stability (âˆ¼100% retention upon 5000 charge/discharge cycles at 10 Ag1) are achieved.
