This paper describes the research on a large-scale dispatchable grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) system for supplying power to the grid for dispatch instead of supplying the electricity to a local load. In order to maximise the value of the solar energy, a hybrid electricity storage consisting of batteries and supercapacitors is used with the PV system. This paper proposes a control strategy focusing on the DC power at the DC link rather than at the grid-connected inverter. Two typical sets of real data, collected from existing sites, are used to demonstrate the practicality of the system. Finally, the simulation results are used to demonstrate the good performance and feasibility of the proposed system together with the proposed control strategy.
