In this study, we investigated the influence of electrode molding pressure, temperature, and time on the properties of the winding supercapacitors. Mechanical properties such as the crook degree and adhesion strength of the formed electrodes were tested. The electrochemical performance of a supercapacitor was examined using an AC impedance, cyclic voltammetry, and constant current charging/discharging tests. According to the results, at 20-MPa electrode molding pressure and 80 °C for 60 s, the supercapacitor showed the best performances with its electrochemical window reaching 4.4 V, a charge-discharge efficiency of 97.6%, and a specific capacitance of 370.0 Fg -1. © Springer-Verlag 2012.
