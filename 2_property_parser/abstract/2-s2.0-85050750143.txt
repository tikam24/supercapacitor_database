Novel power factor corrected ac-dc rectifier topologies suitable for induction motor drive based elevator application are proposed. These converters make use of coupled inductor for power conversion and are capable of providing high voltage gain at low duty cycle and high efficiency. The current flowing through the coupled inductor is controlled through a feedback control loop to achieve unity power factor. The total harmonic distortion (THD) value of the current is observed to be approximately 4.8%, which is within the limits prescribed by various standards. With the use of coupled inductor, the voltage stress of the switches operating at high frequency is reduced, which reduces switching losses. The loss comparison with the conventional converters shows a reduction of at least 22% of losses. The proposed scheme also results in reduction of the variable frequency drive's dc-link capacitance value as an ultracapacitor bank is interfaced with the dc link through a bidirectional converter for improving efficiency and providing transient power requirements. This also helps in increasing the reliability and dynamic response of the system. The settling time for a step change in voltage reference is observed to be reduced by nearly 50%. Proposed topologies and schemes are validated through MATLAB/Simulink simulations and experiments.
