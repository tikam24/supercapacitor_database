The rapid development of microelectronics has equally rapidly increased the demand for miniaturized energy storage devices. On-chip microsupercapacitors (MSCs), as promising power candidates, possess great potential to complement or replace electrolytic capacitors and microbatteries in various applications. However, the areal capacities and energy densities of the planar MSCs are commonly limited by the low voltage window, the thin layer of the electrode materials and complex fabrication processes. Here, a new-type three-dimensional (3D) tubular asymmetric MSC with small footprint area, high potential window, ultrahigh areal energy density, and long-term cycling stability is fabricated with shapeable materials and photolithographic technologies, which are compatible with modern microelectronic fabrication procedures widely used in industry. Benefiting from the novel architecture, the 3D asymmetric MSC displays an ultrahigh areal capacitance of 88.6 mF cm−2 and areal energy density of 28.69 mW h cm−2, superior to most reported interdigitated MSCs. Furthermore, the 3D tubular MSCs demonstrate remarkable cycling stability and the capacitance retention is up to 91.8% over 12 000 cycles. It is believed that the efficient fabrication methodology can be used to construct various integratable microscale tubular energy storage devices with small footprint area and high performance for miniaturized electronics.
