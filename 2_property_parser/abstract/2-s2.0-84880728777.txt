This paper presents a control law for distributed ac generation supplied by a fuel cell (FC) main source and supercapacitor (SC, auxiliary source). In this paper, a nonlinear control algorithm based on the flatness properties of the system is proposed. Using the flatness property, we propose simple solutions to hybrid energy management and stabilization problems. Unlike a classical cascade control, a single loop control is proposed. A hardware system is implemented in laboratory. The prototype small-scale power plant is composed of a main source FC (80 V, 10 A), and a SC Maxwell technology module (165 F, 48 V). Experimental results substantiate the excellent control scheme during load cycles. Â© 2013 IEEE.
