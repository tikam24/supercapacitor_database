In this paper, the principles of modelling and control of energy sources in hybrid propulsion systems are presented. Furthermore, the strategies for energy sources' control and management have been evaluated by using a standard test cycle (Artemis) in the test platform, in which the power supply, supercapacitor energy storage and traction system are composed. The test results show that the power supply can be directly or indirectly controlled to provide a continuous current, while the supercapacitor energy storage is controlled to provide the peak current or recuperate the regenerative braking energy. This feature can ensure the good operating condition of the power supply (e.g., fuel cell, battery). Hence, a long lifetime of the power supply, a high efficiency of the propulsion system and good dynamics of hybrid vehicles can be achieved by using the strategies presented in this paper.
