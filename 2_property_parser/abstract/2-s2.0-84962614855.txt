In this paper a simple technical solution for saving regenerative braking energy in tram systems is analyzed. This technical solution is energy storage system which contains only supercapacitor battery that is connected in parallel with traction substation. For the evaluation of this energy storage system a detailed simulation model in Simulink is developed and experimentally measured tram power diagrams are used as input data. Simulations for 19 hours long tram system operation are performed to assess the energy consumption with and without supercapacitors. Profitability of such energy storage system is also considered.
