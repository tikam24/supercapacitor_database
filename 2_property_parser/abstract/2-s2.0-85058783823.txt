Nitrogen and oxygen-doped carbon materials (NSL-x) were prepared by one-pot pyrolysis of sodium lignin sulfonate as carbon precursor and melamine as nitrogen precursor. The morphology and structure of obtained materials were characterized by SEM, XRD, XPS analysis. The results showed that NSL-x was composed of irregular carbon block with size ranging from hundreds of nanometers to several microns. Nitrogen doping did not change the morphology and crystalline structure of carbon block, the amorphous carbon structure was the main form of NSL-x. When the mass ratio of melamine and sodium lignin sulfonate was 4, nitrogen and oxygen content of the obtained NSL-4 can reached 2.41% and 20.12%, respectively. Electrochemical performance test results showed that NSL-4 exhibited a high capacitance of 229 F/g at the current density of 0.1 A/g in 6 mol/L KOH electrolyte, and even remained 137 F/g at 20 A/g. Meanwhile, under the current density of 10 A/g, NSL-4 remained 100% coulomb efficiency with only 1% capacity loss after 10 000 consecutive charge/discharge cycles, and showed excellent electrochemical stability.
