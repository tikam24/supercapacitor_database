The composite supercapacitor electrodes are fabricated by facile electrochemical deposition of Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets on NiCo 2 O 4 nanowire arrays which are grown radially on carbon fiber. The composite electrodes offer specific capacitance of 2400 F/g at 1 mA/cm 2 , excellent rate capability of 89% as the current density increasing from 1 to 20 mA/cm 2 . Electrochemical performances are investigated at different temperatures from 0 째C to 60 째C. The specific capacitance at 1 mA/cm 2 increases from 2100 F/g at 0 째C to 3000 F/g at 60 째C. The mechanisms of effect of temperature on the electrochemical properties of the composite electrode are investigated. This study provides a fundamental comprehension of the temperature dependent of composite electrodes.
