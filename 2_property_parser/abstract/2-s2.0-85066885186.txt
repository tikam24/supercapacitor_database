The proceedings contain 112 papers. The topics discussed include: scheduling of dual supercapacitor for longer battery lifetime in systems with power gating; parallelization of brute-force attack on MD5 hash algorithm on FPGA; modeling, fabrication and investigation of mixing in low-cost passive PDMS micromixers; design and analysis of a minimally invasive and ECG controlled ventricular assistive device; continuous transparent mobile device touchscreen soft keyboard biometric authentication; self-organizing maps-based flexible and high-speed packet classification in software defined networking; criticality aware soft error mitigation in the configuration memory of SRAM based FPGA; low-complexity continuous-flow memory-based FFT architectures for real-valued signals; and ultra low power digital front-end for single lead ECG acquisition.
