Purpose: Investigation of some parameters of energy storage devices (so-called supercapacitors) in which the structures of selected conductive polymers were implemented. Researchers were interested in the relationship between the parameters of the supercapacitor and the molecular structure of the conductive polymer used as the electrode material. Design/methodology/approach: The polypyrrole and its derivatives were produced by an electropolymerization process performed with cyclic voltammetry. During the research, polymer supercapacitors were created containing collectors made of ITO plates. Measurement of device parameters using cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry. In addition, the devices use polymer electrolytes based on poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). Findings: Devices containing polypyrrole have the best electrochemical parameters, while supercapacitors containing poly (phenylpyrrole) have the lowest parameters. This parameter is due to the high hindrance in the poly(phenylpyrrole) molecule in the form of an aromatic ring. Research limitations/implications: The most significant limitation of the devices is their durability due to the low strength of the conductive layer on ITO plates. This layer was easily degraded with too many test cycles. Practical implications: It was confirmed that polypyrrole and its derivatives could be used as electrode materials in energy storage devices. Originality/value: One of the few studies that allow the evaluation of the molecular structure of polypyrrole and its derivatives as electrode material in symmetrical supercapacitors.
