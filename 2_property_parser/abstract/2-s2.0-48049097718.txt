A rational layout of the synergic electric power supply system on board of the hybrid electri vehicle (HEV) was proposed based on the analysis of the effects of the loading of the supercapacitor on the parameters of its power components. The parameter matching was done to meet the demand for the energy and power of the HEV, and the parameters were optimized for the minimization of the lifecycle cost as the objective The matched results were analyzed by the simulation, strongly suggesting that including the supercapacitor in the HEV does make sense from the perspectives of the mass, the volume, the lifecycle cost, and the efficiency of recovering the braking energy, they are better than those of the HEV with a single electric battery power supply system.
