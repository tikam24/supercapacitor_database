In the present work, Butnea monsperma flower pollens (BMPs) were used to synthesize high surface area activated carbons (ACs). ACs were prepared employing one-step thermal activation process, by varying the ZnCl2 impregnation ratio. Optimization was done to ensure suitable porosity parameters and better electrochemical performance. Optimization succeeded in achievement of large values of total pore volume (~0.77 cm3 g−1) and specific surface area (~1422 m2 g−1). Electrochemical characteristics of optimized AC were compared in aqueous and ionic liquid based electrolyte. The value of capacitance of AC electrode was observed to be large ~130 F g−1) in aqueous electrolyte. Large magnitudes of specific energy (~42 Wh kg−1) and specific power (~19 kW kg−1) were observed in ionic liquid based electrolyte. Further, it has been observed that AC provided capacitance retention of more than ~99% (for more than 10,000 cycles). Synthesized AC is thus believed, profitable for energy storage devices.
