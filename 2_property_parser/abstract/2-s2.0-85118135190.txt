Here, we report a two-phase crystalline NiWO4/amorphous Co−B nanocomposite as an electrode material for supercapacitors, which is effectively synthesized via a simple hydrothermal method and chemical precipitation method. The obtained NiWO4/Co−B exhibits crystal-amorphous contact, which makes it have more active sites than other crystalline-crystalline phase boundaries, thereby enhancing electron transport. The NiWO4/Co−B electrode with the best mass ratio of crystalline and amorphous exhibits a great specific capacitance and excellent cycle durability. Compared to individual Co−B and NiWO4, it also shows enhanced rate capability Besides, NiWO4/Co−B/activated carbon supercapacitor device can provide a good specific capacitance and a maximum energy density of 10.92 Wh kg−1 at 200 W kg−1. This work provides new insights to develop novel electrode materials for energy storage and conversion.
