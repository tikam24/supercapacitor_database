In order to provide necessary electronic energy supply to portable wearable electronics, supercapacitor electrode with flexibility and high energy density is needed. In this paper, a hierarchical structure spionkopite has been in situ grown onto the electrochemical functional surface of commercial carbon cloth by a hydrothermal process. Combined from the hybrid energy storage process of battery-type and capacitance-type reactions of ultrathin Cu1.4S nanoplates, high specific capacitance, rate performance, and good cyclic performance are achieved. As a result, the Cu1.4S@CC electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance and specific capacity of 485 F g−1 and 727.5 C g−1 under 0.25 A g−1 based on the mass of Cu1.4S and maintains 66% initial capacitance even under the high current density to 10 A g−1. Besides, good mechanical robustness and electrochemical stability (retention of 80.2% capacitance after 1000 cycles) have been demonstrated. An asymmetric supercapacitor has been constructed by the Cu1.4S@CC negative electrode and nickel-based MOF positive electrode to study the practical electrochemical performance of Cu1.4S@CC electrode. The operating voltage has been effectively improved to 1.8 V in aqueous electrolyte, and the energy density could reach 52.5 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 0.9 kW kg−1.
