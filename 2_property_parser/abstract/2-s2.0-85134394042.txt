Transition metal sulfides are the prominent and leading materials for high-performance energy storage applications. Manganese molybdenum sulfide (MMS) is synthesized using facile hydrothermal method. The electrochemical active sites of the electrode material were enhanced by making the bi-metal sulfides with nanoporous diffusion channels in their crystal structure. The crystalline structure and morphology of the material were studied using X-ray diffraction pattern and high resolution-scanning electron microscope image, respectively. The functional groups present in the material were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. MMS-coated nickel foam shows an excellent cycle stability. In 2 M KOH electrolyte, its specific capacity raised to 160% after 10,000 galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) cycles at the current density of 10 A g− 1 and exhibited a higher specific capacity of 101.3 C g− 1 at 1 A g− 1. After 12,000 GCD cycles, the as-fabricated MMS//MMS symmetric device offers an elevated specific capacity of 228% from its initial value at the current density of 5 A g− 1.
