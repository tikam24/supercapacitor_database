Inaugurating the multistage hierarchical hybrid structure with ample surface area and synergistic contribution from polymetallic selenide and layered hydroxide in a conductive 3D substrate has been supposed to be appealing and highly-rated electrode material to enhance the general electrochemical parameters of supercapacitors (SCs), thanks to exclusive structural features, immense electronic states and relatively paramount electrical conductivity of the final product. In this work, hydrothermal assisted zinc‑nickel‑cobalt-selenide (ZNC-Se) nanosheets have been uniformly prepared onto the conductive rGO decorated Ni foam substrate, chased by uniform decoration of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) templated nickel‑cobalt-layered double hydroxide (NC-LDH) onto tri-metallic (ZNC-Se) nanosheets to achieve the hierarchical hybrid structure of ZNC-Se@NC-LDH@rGO-NF. The as-prepared hierarchical ZNC-Se@NC-LDH@rGO-NF delivers remarkable specific capacity value along with outstanding cycle stability. The proposed ZNC-Se@NC-LDH@rGO-NF and MOFs derived open and hollow carbon structure (MDOHCS)-based hybrid device disclosed remarkable cyclic life and an energy/power density of 80.3 W h kg−1/15970.9 W kg−1.
