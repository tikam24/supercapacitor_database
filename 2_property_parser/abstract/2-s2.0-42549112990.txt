Commercial supercapacitors cells available at this time on the market reach a capacitance value as high as 5000 F at a rated voltage of 2.5 V, with specific power of about 2kW/kg(l) and specific energy of about 4Wh/kg(l). Advance in the supercapacitor manufacturing is needed for lower product price and further performance improvement. Short description of the manufacturing technology of supercapacitors based on carbon electrodes used at this time, and of recent research results and tendencies existing in the literature are presented. Initial results from research and development work on supercapacitors started in the country have been included in the paper. Â© 2006 IEEE.
