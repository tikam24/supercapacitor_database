In order to improve the safety of energy storage devices including supercapacitors and expand their practical application, this work proposes an intelligent yet efficient self-partition strategy for the most common problem of thermal runaway at this stage. Firstly, N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) and acrylamide (AM) are copolymerized by free radical polymerization to obtain a thermally responsive copolymer, which is dissolved in lithium chloride aqueous solution as the electrolyte. Self-partition supercapacitors are obtained by combining this as-prepared electrolyte with conductive polymer electrodes. Benefiting from the temperature-induced phase transition characteristics of thermally responsive electrolyte, the supercapacitors not only have efficient charge-discharge characteristics but also automatically cut off the ion transfer after the thermal runaway of the device with a self-partition efficiency of 88.1%, preventing the further deterioration of the device. In addition, the copolymer will shrink after the phase change caused by thermal runaway, which scatters the light and shows milky white with low transmittance, making it possible to troubleshoot the faulty devices with thermal runaway through color change. Therefore, the intelligent and high-safety supercapacitors prepared in this work will further provide a potential reference for the popularization and application of energy storage devices.
