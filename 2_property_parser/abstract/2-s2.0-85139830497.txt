In the present study, CuO/g-C3N4 nanocomposites were successfully synthesized using the one-step hydrothermal technique. The physicochemical properties (structural, morphological, and chemical state) of prepared electrode material were studied by using various analytical techniques. The CuO/g-C3N4 nanocomposites-based electrode material was used as anode material and it exhibited a high specific capacitance of 384F/g at the current density of 2 A/g. The cyclic stability of CuO/g-C3N4 nanocomposites showed a remarkable capacitance retertion of 98.02 % after 5000 charge–discharge (GCD) cycles at 10 A g−1.
