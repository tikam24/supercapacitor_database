Wood-derived carbon monoliths, in recent years, have attracted tremendous interest in the field of energy storage, but their electrochemical characteristics are still far from satisfactory. Here, we report a universal and efficient approach for the preparation of structure-engineered, heteroatom-functionalized and property-boosted wood carbons. A two-step ion-exchange process greatly enriches the nucleation sites of ZIF-8 on the inner wall of wood tracheids, hence leading to a unique carbon/carbon heterostructure after carbonizing and acid-washing. Particularly, the prepared NPCM-900 with a large specific surface area of 708.2 m2 g−1, a hierarchical porous architecture and a suitable N content of 2.3% delivers an ultrahigh area-normalized specific capacitance of 23.7 F cm−2 at 5 mA cm−2, which stands for a new capacitive record among the wood-based binder-free electrodes. The NPCM-900//NPCM-900 all-solid-state supercapacitor has an admirable energy density of 9.3 Wh m−2 at 24.9 W m−2 and a large power density of 248.3 W m−2 at 4.8 Wh m−2, while the NPCM-900 based Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitor (NPCM-900//Zn) exhibits a superior energy density of 12.7 Wh m−2. Furthermore, the NPCM-900//NPCM-900 and NPCM-900//Zn present great stabilities with capacitance retentions of 87% and 85%, respectively, after 5000 cycles. These parameters notably outperform those of most wood-based supercapacitors, endowing the NPCM-900 with extensive prospects for practical use.
