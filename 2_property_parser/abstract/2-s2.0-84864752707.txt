Co-Al layered double hydroxide was synthesized by a chemical co-precipitation method. The components of products were analyzed by FT-IR and the structure and morphology were characterized using X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy, respectively. The electrochemical performances were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and constant current charge/discharge techniques for Al-substituted α-Co(OH) 2 with Co/Al mole ratio 9:1, 8:2 and 7:3. The results showed that the Al-substituted α-Co(OH) 2 with Co/Al mole ratio 8: 2 has excellent electrochemical performances, and its specific capacitance as single electrode is up to 1180 F/g and remains at about 91% of the initial value after 500 cycles at current density of 1 A/g. It is a promising electrode material for supercapacitor.
