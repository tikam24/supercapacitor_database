In this work, Choline chloride-sugar (glucose, fructose, cane sugar) based sustainable electrolytes are prepared and effect of water on their electrochemical properties are analysed. The electrolytes are prepared by mixing the choline chloride and sugar and stirred on magnetic stirrer till a clear solution is obtained. The electrolytes are characterized using FTIR technique, cyclic voltammetry technique for electrochemical stability measurement and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy for ionic conductivity. The electrochemical stability window of electrolytes decreases from 1.8 V to 1.6 V and ionic conductivity increases on addition of water in electrolytes. The supercapacitor cells are fabricated using activated carbon as electrode material and prepared electrolytes. The supercapacitor cells are characterized using cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The highest specific capacitance value of 1.34 F/g@5mV/s is observed for choline chloride-glucose electrolyte based supercapacitor. The bulk resistance measured using nyquist plot of cells also decreases on addition of water into electrolytes.
