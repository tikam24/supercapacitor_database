Abstract: Pure and Fe-doped manganese oxide films were electrodeposited on stainless steel substrates through both potentiostatic and galvanostatic modes. The effect of deposition modes on resulting surface morphology and electrochemical properties of deposited films were investigated. The surface morphologies of the deposited films, as examined through image analysis of scanning electron micrographs, were found to be strongly influenced by the mode of electrodeposition. The specific capacitances of pure and Fe-doped MnO2 films deposited via both the modes were determined through galvanostatic charge-discharge characteristics, while the mechanism of super capacitive performance of the films was assessed through fractal analysis.
