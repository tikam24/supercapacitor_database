Interconnected graphene aerogels (IC:GA) and their composites with transition metal oxide nanoparticles are attracting increasing research interest for fabrication of supercapacitors. In this study, for the ﬁrst time, we have incorporated ytterbium oxide nanoparticles (Yb 2 O 3 NPs) to a nitrogen doped-interconnected graphene aerogels (N-IC:GA) matrix through a facial one-step hydrothermal method and by using p-phenylenediamine (PPD) as an interconnector and a source of nitrogen. In this porous network, graphene nanosheets are present with very low thickness of about 5–9 nm. The electrochemical performance of the nanocomposite was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and continuous cyclic voltammetry (CCV). The obtained Yb 2 O 3 /N-IC:GA nanocomposite was tested as a symmetric capacitor which exhibited a speciﬁc capacitance of 321 Fg −1 at a current density of 0.5 A g −1 , a high energy density of 25 Wh Kg −1 , an excellent cycle life for voltage values up to 1.5 V, and a capacitance retention of 98.4% after 4000 cycles in an environment-friendly aqueous electrolyte of 1 M Na 2 SO 4 . Moreover, Yb 2 O 3 /N-IC:GA proved to be highly capable because the delivered speciﬁc capacitance at a current density of 16 A g −1 retained 53.4% of its value at 0.5 A g −1 .
