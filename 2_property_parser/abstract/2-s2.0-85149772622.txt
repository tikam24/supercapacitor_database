Here, core-shell supercapacitor electrodes with high performance were prepared using electrospinning, carbonation, nitrogen-doping and chemical polymerization. The core of the electrode was a N-doped porous carbon nanofiber skeleton, its shell was a conductive polymer loaded on it. The effects of pore-forming agent content, N-doped amount, and polymerization temperature on the morphologies, structures and electrochemical performance of products in each stage were characterized, and the optimum parameters were obtained. As a freestanding electrode, the SC of core-shell composite reached 342.13 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, and its SC attenuation was only 4.6 % after 1000 cycles, indicating its good charge storage performance and cycle stability. Then a symmetric supercapacitor fabricated with the best electrode displayed an energy density of 3.10 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 50 W kg−1. Therefore, this paper proposed an effective method for developing multifunctional electrode materials of supercapacitors.
