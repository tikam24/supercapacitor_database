Graphene, an atom-thick two-dimensional (2D) sheet of graphite, has recently been attracting a lot of attention because of its excellent electrical conductivity, extremely high surface area, as well as perfect mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties. These remarkable characteristics of graphene, along with the inherent benefits of carbon materials, are envisioned to have wide applications in energy storage and conversion devices. This critical review provides an overview of the recent research progress in graphene-based materials as electrodes for electrochemical capacitors. A brief description of the methods for preparing graphene and its derivatives (graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide) via the "top-down" and "bottom-up" approaches is first introduced. We then summarize the research status of graphene-based electrode materials, including graphene and graphene-based composites, for electrochemical capacitors. Finally, we will discuss some key issues in the development of free-standing graphene-based electrodes for high-performance electrochemical capacitors.
