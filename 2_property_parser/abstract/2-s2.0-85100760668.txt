The functional properties of (1-x)CuCo2O4/(x)CuS nanocomposite as an improved supercapacitor electrode have been investigated. X-ray diffraction with Rietveld analysis, HRTEM, FESEM, and FTIR techniques were employed for the full structural characterization of the nanocomposites. The particle size and morphology, the phase composition and percentage, the lattice parameters, the cation distribution and the crystallite size were accurately determined for the prepared samples. The variation of the bandgap of the phases developed with the alloying parameter (x) was studied utilizing the UV diffuse spectrum. All samples exhibited a blue shift except the sample with x = 0.25, it revealed a redshift. The photoluminescence intensity and the color emitted were affected by CuCo2O4 and CuS alloying. The preliminary test of cyclic voltammetry (CV) proved that alloying of CuS nanoparticles with CuCo2O4 enhanced the electrochemical activities, and optimum performance achieved with allying ratio x = 0.25.
