Cubic structured pure and Fe-doped cobalt oxide thin film electrodes are successfully prepared by nebulizer spray pyrolysis technique. Single phase polycrystalline cubic structure with (220) plane orientation are observed in the XRD analysis for pure and Fe-doped cobalt oxide films. From the optical analysis, two bandgaps are observed in the range 1.366–1.713 eV and 2.846–2.925 eV for lower and higher energy regions respectively. HR-SEM images revealed the formation of well covered and spherical shaped particles in the formed films. The increase of electrical conductivity with Fe doping concentration has been confirmed at room temperature. The maximum specific capacitance value is observed in the 2.5 wt% of Fe doped Co3O4 thin film electrode at the scan rate of 2 mV/s.
