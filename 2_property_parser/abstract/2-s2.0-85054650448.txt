Composite materials (CMs) based on activated carbon fiber material (ACFM) modified with oxygen-containing transition metal compounds (MnO2, Ni(OH)2, and Co(OH)2) by using colloid electrophoresis are studied. All prepared CMs have higher capacitance than the individual parental materials, with the CM ACFM–Ni(OH)2 exhibiting the maximum capacitance (~380 F g–1). Changes in the capacitances of ACFM and prepared ACFM-based CMs induced by potential cycling, the time of exposure to electrolyte solution, and potential scan rate are investigated. The capacitances of all CMs are found to increase with the number of cycles, but tend to decrease at higher potential scan rates.
