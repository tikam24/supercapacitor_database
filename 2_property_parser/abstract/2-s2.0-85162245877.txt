Metal–organic frameworks are linked by different central organic ligands and metal-ion coordination bonds to form periodic pore structures and rich pore volumes. Because of their structural advantages, metal–organic frameworks are considered to be one of the most promising candidates for new energy storage materials. To better utilize their advantages, metal–organic frameworks can be combined with electrospinning technology to effectively adjust the porosity and mechanical strength of composite materials. This paper summarizes the combination of the latest metal–organic frameworks and classical spinning technology, starting from the structural design of electrode materials, and applying them to supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries, lithium–sulfur batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and potassium-ion batteries. Finally, the problems and challenges related to the preparation of metal–organic framework nanofibers are summarized, and future development trends are predicted.
