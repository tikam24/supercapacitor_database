Renewable energy source in isolated area, or mainly known as standalone system should be reliable and resilient in terms of power stability and power quality. In its intermittency characteristics, it is often forfeiting its energy storage lifespan due to significant charge and discharge amount of power to the energy storage. To resolve the problem, this research proposed an evaluation for a design of wind turbine penetration in standalone photovoltaic system using hybrid storage system (battery and supercapacitor), remembering the intermittency of its source has complementary characteristics in a remote area, when the solar is out of reach, the wind could give the peak contribution. This research provides the wind turbine penetration stability performance and the effect for the system. From the results, the characteristics obtained that after the penetration of wind turbine, the penetration affected the photovoltaic, in both current and power by the decrease of 2,357% and reached its steady state in 0,066 s and 0,034 s respectively. For the load, the penetration affected by increasing the power at 5,095% and back to its normal state at 0,049 s. Meanwhile for the supercapacitor and battery, the steady-state time after the penetration is 0,113 and 0,117 respectively, and also the energy storage proven to be the compensator for the oscillation effect after the penetration.
