The synthesis of dual-function molybdenum (Mo)-complex carbonous sponges is reported for elucidating their utilization as positive and negative electrodes in electrochemical devices and their applicability to the active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in electrocatalytic devices. Molybdenum (Mo)-coordinated polyvinyl alcohol gel is converted into a porous Mo-complex nitrogen-rich carbonous sponge (MNCS) via microwave and low-temperature-annealing processes as a positive electrode. This MNCS was further thermally treated at a higher temperature to prepare a more carbonized Mo-complex N-doped carbon sponge (cMNCS) as a negative electrode. Both sponges were lightweight and porous and exhibited excellent specific capacitances of 562 F g-1 as a positive MNCS electrode and 937 F g-1 as a negative cMNCS electrode. The asymmetric supercapacitor assembled using them reveals a power density of 887.5 W kg-1 at an energy density of 36 Wh kg-1, in addition to a retention rate of >95% after 5000 cycles. We furthermore demonstrate the electrocatalytic capabilities of these materials with overpotentials of -170 and -220 mV for the HER and 1.70 and 1.53 V for the OER at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 using a water-splitting electrocatalyzer.
