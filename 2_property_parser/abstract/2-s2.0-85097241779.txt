Two types of manganese dioxide (α-MnO2 and β-MnO2)were prepared by hydrothermal method. Polyaniline (PANI) nanomaterials were preparedby chemical oxidation polymerization in presence of homemade MnO2 or commercial MnO2 as oxidizing agent and sacrificial template. The microstructure and morphology of PANI were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) andthermogravimetric analysis (TG).With a symmetric redox supercapacitor assembled with PANI as active electrode material and 1.0 mol/L H2SO4 aqueous solutionas electrolyte, the electrochemical properties of PANI supercapacitors were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and constant current charge/discharge (GCD) tests. These results show that as-prepared α-MnO2 and β-MnO2 both presented single crystal phase with high yield, high purity and uniform particle size. B-PANI prepared by β-MnO2wasnanofibrous mixed with nanotubes with uniform dispersion and higher crystallinity.
