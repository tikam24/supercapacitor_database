This work demonstrates hierarchical 3D nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube-carbon fibre (N-CNT@CF) networks obtained via a two-step synthetic technique: electrospinning and chemical vapour deposition (CVD) methods. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) reveal randomly entangled networks structure. Raman spectroscopy show structural defects, X-ray Diffraction spectroscopy (XRD) confirm the purity of the materials, while BET analysis show increase in surface area after nitrogen doping. Electrochemistry reveals that nitrogen-doping transforms surface-confined to diffusion-confined energy-storage mechanism (i.e., high power) even at low cycling rate, significantly increasing the specific capacitance of the symmetric device (155 F/g), specific energy (5.5 Whkg−1), specific power (254 W kg−1) and capacitance retention of 93% even after 10,000 cycles at 10 Ag−1. The N-CNT@CF-based symmetric cell exhibits higher fo value (ca. 82 Hz, response time,τ, of 12 ms) than the CNT@CF-based cell (ca. 25.1 Hz, 40 ms). The excellent performance of N-CNT@CF hybrid material is attributed to the Faradaic charge contribution arising from synergistic interaction between the nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers, high conductivity, high surface area coupled with enough accessible active sites for electrochemical reactions. This work underscores the importance of defect engineering and decoration of the vacant sites by nitrogen for enhanced supercapacitance.
