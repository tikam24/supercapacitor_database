Nanostructured binary transition metal oxides are expected to possess better pseudocapacitive performance than that of mono-metal oxides. Herein, NiMn2O4 nanosheet arrays are grown on the Ni foam successfully with using the facile hydrothermal method and post-annealing. The surface morphology, composition and structure of as-synthesized products are investigated by Field emission scanning electron microscope, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The electrochemical performance is evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests. The results show that the thickness of nanosheets varied from 7 nm to 25 nm with changing the reaction temperature from 40 to 220°C, the density of nanosheets are also present the increasing trend, and through which the mass loading of as-synthesized nanostructurs is controlled. The NiMn2O4 electrodes fabricated at higher reactiontemperature exhibit better electrochemical performance due to the raising mass loading of active electrode materials with the temperature. Moreover, the electrodes achieved at 220°C offer a highest specific capacitance of 177.2 mF/cm2 at scan rate of 2 mV/s and good cycling stability with 89 % initial capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte.
