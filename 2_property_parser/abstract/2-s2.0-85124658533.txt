This paper reports the design, fabrication and characterization of a hybrid energy storage system, with a textile based rechargeable zinc-ion battery connected in parallel with a textile supercapacitor. The proposed devices were implemented on polyester-cotton textiles with a polymer separator integrated within the textile. The cathode and anode of the zinc-ion battery and the supercapacitors carbon electrodes were fabricated with low cost materials via spray deposition. The proposed hybrid energy storage system achieved an areal capacity of 46.6 Î¼Ah.cm-2 at 1 mA.cm-2 discharge current within the potential window of 1.9 V to 0.9 V.
