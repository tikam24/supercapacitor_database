Based on the pyrolysis of palm flower, self-doped multi-heteroatoms nanoarchitectonics of hierarchically porous carbon materials have been designed and synthesized. The derived materials which co-doped with N, O, and S, exhibit an ultra-high specific surface area of 3362.51 m2 g−1 and an extra-large pore volume of 2.34 cm3 g−1 with interconnected macro-, meso- and micro-pores. The as-synthesized material shows satisfactory electrochemical properties, including high specific capacitance of 391.05 F g−1 (at 1 A g−1), good rate capability (85.70 % capacitance retention at 10 A g−1) and superior cycling performance in alkaline electrolyte. The as-fabricated symmetric supercapacitor, at a stable working voltage of 3.5 V, shows a high energy density of 128.63 Wh kg−1 and excellent cycle life of 94.93 % after 10,000 cycles in ionic liquids electrolyte. The porous carbon materials derived from nature materials can be good candidate materials for fabricating energy storage devices.
