A three dimensional porous carbon nanomembrane (CNM), silica-supported CNM (SS-CNM), is developed by formation of a self-assembled monolayer of an enediyne compound on the surface of mesoporous silica (SBA-15) followed by Bergman cyclization and carbonization. The SS-CNM is applied as a conductive support for the electroactive material Co3O4 to fabricate advanced supercapacitors. A large fraction of Co3O4 clusters (66% of total weight) are impregnated in the SS-CNM host to form regularly packed nanorods with diameters of 7 nm. The specific capacitance of the supercapacitor electrode material reaches 1086 F g-1 (1645 F g-1 based on Co3O4) with aqueous electrolyte. This extraordinary high performance of the electrode material is attributed to the unique pore structure of the SS-CNM support that enhances the use of active material and shortens the transport path of ions and electrons.
