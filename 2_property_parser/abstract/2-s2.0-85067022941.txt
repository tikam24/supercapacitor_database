Graphene with a porous structure can provide low-resistant pathways and short ion diffusion channels for energy storage, and thus is expected to be an excellent electrode material. Here, a simple partial combustion route was used to synthesize porous graphene with controllable pore size as a high-performance electrode material for supercapacitors. The results indicated that the obtained porous graphene exhibits the highest specific capacitance in this study is 284 F/g at the current density of 0.2 A/g in 6 M KOH. Moreover, porous graphene showed good cycle durability over 83% at the current density of 1.0 A/g after 5000 cycles, and with columbic efficiency over 95%.
