We present the synthesis and characterization of a novel lithium iron polyphosphate LiFe2P3O10. Powders were prepared by wet-chemical technique from nitrate precursors followed by a series of thermal treatments. The crystal system is shown to be monoclinic (P2 1/m space group) and the refined cell parameters are a=4.596 Å, b=8.566 Å, c=9.051 Å and β=97.46°. LiFe2P 3O10 has a weak ferromagnetic ordering below the Néel temperature TN=19 K. Electrochemical measurements were carried out in lithium cells with LiPF6-EC-DEC electrolyte at 25°C. The material delivered a capacity 70 mAh/g in the voltage range 2.7-3.9 V. The resulting cyclic voltammogram indicates a stable structure with a good reversibility with the redox peaks at 3.26 and 3.13 V vs. Li 0/Li+. copyright The Electrochemical Society.
