Developing carbon materials featuring both high accessible surface area and high structure stability are desirable to boost the performance of constructed electrochemical electrodes and devices. Herein, we report a new type of microporous carbon (MPC) derived from biomass waste based on a simple high-temperature chemical activation procedure. The optimized MPC-900 possesses microporous structure, high surface area, partially graphitic structure, and particularly low impurity content, which are critical features for enhancing carbon-based electrochemical process. The constructed MPC-900 symmetric supercapacitor exhibits high performances in commercial organic electrolyte such as widened voltage window up to 3 V and thereby high energy/power densities (50.95 Wh kg −1 at 0.44 kW kg −1 ; 25.3 Wh kg −1 at 21.5 kW kg −1 ). Furthermore, a simple melt infiltration method has been employed to enclose SnO 2 nanocrystals onto the carbon matrix of MPC-900 as a high-performance lithium storage material. The obtained SnO 2 -MPC composite with ultrafine SnO 2 nanocrystals delivers high capacities (1115 mAh g −1 at 0.2 A g −1 ; 402 mAh g −1 at 10 A g −1 ) and high-rate cycling lifespan of over 2000 cycles. This work not only develops a microporous carbon with high carbon purity and high surface area, but also provides a general platform for combining electrochemically active materials.
