Relying on the combination of lithium phosphorous oxynitride (LiPON) as electrolyte and cobalt oxide (Co3O4) as electrode material it is possible to fabricate symmetric all-solid-state micro-supercapacitors (ASTSCaps) on rigid and flexible substrates. Due to the nanoscale active layer dimensions, the excellent performance of the component materials and the high nominal voltage of 2 V, an exceptionally high volumetric energy and power densities of up to 8 (±2) mW h/cm3 and 16 (±2) W/cm3, respectively, are obtained. These results are going far beyond the current state-of-the-art performance limits. The ASTSCaps are temperature stable up to 215 °C (for 1 V nominal voltage) and experience an endurance of more than 30,000 cycles. These ultra-thin all-solid-state micro-supercapacitors bring strong benefits for on-chip energy storage and open up interesting new avenues for autonomous and flexible electronic microsystems.
