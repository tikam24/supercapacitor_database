This paper reports on experimental results for a grid-connected hybrid wind/micro-hydro power system associated with a supercapacitor energy storage device (SCESD). It comprises a doubly-fed induction generator linked mechanically and electrically (through back-toback power electronic converters in the rotor circuit) to a permanent magnet synchronous machine, which may recover or supply the slip power. The SCESD is connected via a DC/DC converter between the two back-to-back power electronic converters. A fixed-speed wind generator driven by a squirrel-cage induction generator is also connected to the power grid. Â©2010 IEEE.
