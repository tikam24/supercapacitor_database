Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), an interesting class of functional inorganic materials, have recently emerged as suitable electrode materials or templates/precursors of electrode materials for supercapacitors (SCs). The key in utilizing MOF-based electrode materials is to address the low electronic conductivity and poor stability issues. Therefore, the rational design and fabrication of self-supported binder-free electrodes is considered the most promising strategy to address these challenges. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in the design and manufacture of self-supported MOF-based nanostructures and their use as binderless electrodes for SCs, especially over the last five years. The synthesis strategies for constructing pristine MOFs, MOF composites and MOF derivative arrays are overviewed. By highlighting the advantages and challenges of each class of electrode materials, we hope that this review will provide some insights into the rational design of MOF-based electrode materials to promote the future development of this highly exciting field.
