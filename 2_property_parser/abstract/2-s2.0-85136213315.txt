Renewable Energy Sources (RES) use at local scale reduces the environmental impact, maximizing the effect as production and consumption are carried out in the same place. Therefore, this limits the losses associated with distribution networks, and minimizes the impact on the landscape in areas of special interest, including touristic beaches and other natural sites, where there are high-value natural environments, and where the citizensâ€™ comfort must be considered. Implementation of an intra-urban transport ecosystem, based on fleets of light electric vehicles charged from RES, is proposed for these natural touristic areas. In this context, Urban Touristic Transport at Sustainable Environments (TTUES) project aims to promote the implementation of a transport ecosystem, using specifically designed and tested light and small-sized electric vehicles (EVs), and suitable charging stations based solely on RES. This paper presents a development of an Energy Storage System (ESS) based on Hybrid Supercapacitors (HSC) for their application in light EVs recharging points. It details the main equipment and capabilities of the testing facilities, and the tests performed by INTA, the Spanish National Institute for Aerospace Technology, in the framework of the project TTUES, as well as the experimental results validating the HSC system for its application.
