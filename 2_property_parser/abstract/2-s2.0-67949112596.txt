This communication demonstrates the first work on anodic composite deposition of oxide nanocomposites. Rutile TiO2 nanoflowers with an average petal size of ca. 10 nm in diameter and 100 nm in length were synthesized from a TiCl3 solution purged with air at 25 °C for 12 days prior to the composite deposition. Hydrous ruthenium oxide (RuO2·xH2O) and TiO2 nanoflowers were composite-deposited onto Ti substrates for supercapacitors. In comparing with RuO2·xH2O deposits, RuO2·xH2O-TiO2 nanocomposites with a highly porous nature exhibit the weakly mass-dependent specific capacitance and high-power capacitive characteristics. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.
