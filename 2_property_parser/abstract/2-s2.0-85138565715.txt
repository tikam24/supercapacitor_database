Binder-free two-dimensional mesh-like structure of nickel-zinc metal-organic framework on in-situ-coated carbon cloth (Ni−Zn MOF/CC) and Ni−Zn MOF powder were developed via a solvo-hydrothermal reaction for electrochemical storage application. The electrochemical properties of these electrodes show that the electrodes self-assembled on carbon cloth substrates exhibit remarkably excellent performance. The Ni−Zn MOF/CC electrode exhibited a capacitance of 653.54 F/g at 1 A/g through a capacity retaining of 87.65% after 10000 cycles. Furthermore, the Ni−Zn MOF//AC coin-cell asymmetric supercapacitor device (CASD) exhibited remarkable energy and power densities of 54.31 Wh/kg and 825 W/kg, respectively, with adequate capacitance retention up to 94.63% over 5000 cycles at 1.5 V. The CASD also exhibited a significant power density of 4950 W/kg at 19.67 W h/kg, which suggests that these in-situ developed MOF-based electrodes may discover application in energy storage devices.
