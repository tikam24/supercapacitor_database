Two-dimensional materials, such as graphene and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), can greatly increase the performance of electrochemical energy storage devices because of the combination of high surface area and electrical conductivity. Here, we have investigated the performance of solution exfoliated MoS2 thin flexible membranes as supercapacitor electrodes in a symmetrical coin cell arrangement using an aqueous electrolyte (Na2SO4). By adding highly conductive graphene to form nanocomposite membranes, it was possible to increase the specific capacitance by reducing the resistivity of the electrode and altering the morphology of the membrane. With continued charge/discharge cycles the performance of the membranes was found to increase significantly (up to 800%), because of partial re-exfoliation of the layered material with continued ion intercalation, as well as increasing the specific capacitance through intercalation pseudocapacitance. These results demonstrate a simple and scalable application of layered 2D materials toward electrochemical energy storage.
