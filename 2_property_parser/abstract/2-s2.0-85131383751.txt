Ternary transition metal sulfides have emerged as promising electrode materials for next-generation supercapacitors because of their potential ability to simultaneously ensure high conductivity and stability during electrochemical reactions. In the present investigation, MoS2 incorporated CuCo2S4 nanocomposites have been successfully synthesized using a hydrothermal technique. The structural, morphological, elemental and chemical properties of the prepared CuCo2S4-MoS2 nanocomposite were investigated extensively. High resolution transmission electron microscopy imaging demonstrated the successful synthesis of CuCo2S4-MoS2 nanocomposites. The electrochemical capacitor performance of the nanocomposite has been evaluated both in three-electrode and symmetric two-electrode systems. In the three-electrode cell, a specific capacitance of 820 F g−1 was achieved for the CuCo2S4-MoS2 electrode at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 which is considerably higher than that of the CuCo2S4 electrode (249 F g−1). We observed that the charge storage capacity, conductivity and stability of CuCo2S4 improved significantly due to the incorporation of MoS2. Finally, an asymmetric supercapacitor was fabricated by assembling the CuCo2S4-MoS2 electrode with an activated carbon electrode which demonstrated a large stable working potential window of 1.6 V. Excellent long-term cyclic stability of 89% retention after 1000 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles was evident. As a solid state device, it delivered a high energy density of 38.22 W h kg−1 at a power density of 400 W kg−1 and lit up one red LED for 170 s, indicating its superiority over the conventional Cu-Co based supercapacitors.
