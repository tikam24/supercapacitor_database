Ti/PbO2 electrode was prepared by means of electrochemical deposition. PbO2-AC super-capacitor was assembled by Pb PbO2 and active carbon (AC). Effects of different lead salts on the discharge capacity of electrodeposited PbO2 electrode were studied. The Pb PbO2 electrode prepared using sodium hydroxide solution containing Pb(CH3COO)2 had the largest capacity. Different samples of PbO2electrode were prepared in sodium hydroxide solutions with different concentration containing saturated lead acetate, and then were assembled with AC to conduct discharge test of PbO2-AC super-capacitor. Two PbO2 electrodes prepared by the optimized method were employed as anode, while AC and pasted lead electrode were employed as cathode, constructing the PbO2-AC super-capacitor and lead acid battery respectively. Then, the charge-discharge tests with large current were conducted, and results indicated that the performance of super-capacitor was far above the performance of lead acid battery.
