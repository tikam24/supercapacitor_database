In this study, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) electrolyte, which is frequently used in the literature, is compared with poly(hydridocarbyne)(PHC) electrolyte used in this field. Graphene oxide and multi-walled carbon nanotube are used as electrodes. The tests are performed by adding PVA and PHC as electrolytes between these electrodes. Electrodes and electrolytes are characterized by FTIR (Far-infrared spectroscopy), STEM (scanning electron microscope), EDX (Energy-dispersive X-ray), and XRD (X-ray diffraction) analysis. The capacitance properties of the produced supercapacitors are examined at 5-10-20 mV/s scanning speeds. At the lowest scanning speed of 5 mV/s, 217 F/g charges are stored in the supercapacitor with the PHC electrolyte. The charge stored in the supercapacitor containing PVA is 99 F/g. Accordingly, the supercapacitors produced with PHC store more charges.
