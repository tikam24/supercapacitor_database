This research work suggests a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) with an electric power train (EPT) that uses an interval type 2.0 fuzzy logic controller (IT-2.0 FLC). Due to their lack of fuel dependence and emission of harmful gases, EPTs will play a virtually integral part in transportation in both the present and the future. Battery, supercapacitor, and fuel cell storage devices for hybrid electric vehicles will be taken into consideration and a novel control topology with Type-l and IT-2.0 FLC will be used. Also the most efficient and popular Permanent Magnet Synchronous motor (PMSM) drive is used in this proposed work. Type-l and further IT-2.0 FLC for battery and fuel cell storage having a PI controller for supercapacitor storage has implemented as hybrid electric vehicle. Here, we first proposed solar PV-HESS electric vehicle based on Type-l FLC then Type-l FLC is replaced with IT-2.0 FLC as solar PV-HESS electric vehicle based on IT-2.0 FLC. A comparative analysis performed for both of the system, where EPT (PMSM drive) connected PV-HESS electric vehicle based on IT-2.0 FLC show superior performance in better torque production with very less speed variation and increased its kilo meter range (Mileage). The entire proposed scheme implemented with the help of MATLAB/Simulink 2018a software.
