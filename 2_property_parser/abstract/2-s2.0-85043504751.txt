The porous carbon material is obtained via pyrolysis and activation of fructus cannabis's shells, an easy-to-get biomass source, and is used as an active electrode material for supercapacitors. The obtained carbon exhibit a high specific surface area of 2389 m2 g-1. And the result of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) shows that the obtained porous carbon possess numerous oxygen groups, which can facilitate the wettability of the electrode. The prepared porous carbon also exhibit remarkable electrochemical properties, such as high specific capacitance of 357 F g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1 in 6 mol L-1 aqueous KOH electrolyte, good rate capability of 77% capacitance retention as the current density increase from 0.5 A g-1 to 10 A g-1. In addition, it also presents a superior cycling stability of 100% capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles at the current density of 1 A g-1.
