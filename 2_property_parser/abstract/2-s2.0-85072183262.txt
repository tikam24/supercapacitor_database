Supercapacitors are a new type of energy storage element that has been rapidly developed in recent years. The most important factor that determines the performance of supercapacitors is electrode materials. The development of low-cost, high-performance electrode materials is an important research direction for current supercapacitors. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of porous materials. The applications of MOFs in the supercapacitor have attracted more and more researchers due to their diverse composition and structure, large specific surface area, controllable structure and adjustable pore size. Recent researching application progress of pristine MOFs, MOFs-derived(porous carbon, metal oxides, porous carbon/metal oxides) and MOFs-composite materials for supercapacitors was summarized in this paper. The MOFs with different structural characteristics and their specific performance in the field of electrochemical energy storage were discussed. MOFs based supercapacitors are demonstrated to play an important role in the field of new energy storage and conversion. Finally, the current challenges, future trends and prospects of MOFs in the field of ultracapacitors were pointed out.
