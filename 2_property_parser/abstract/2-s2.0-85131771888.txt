The direct growth of sub-100 nm thin-film metal oxides has witnessed a sustained interest as a superlative approach for the fabrication of smart energy storage platforms. Herein, sub-100 nm Zr-doped orthorhombic Nb2O5 nanotube films are synthesized directly on the Nb-Zr substrate and tested as negative supercapacitor electrode materials. To boost the pseudocapacitive performance of the fabricated films, supplement Nb4+ active sites (defects) are subtly induced into the metal oxide lattice, resulting in 13% improvement in the diffusion current at 100 m V/s over that of the defect-free counterpart. The defective sub-100 nm film (H-NbZr) exhibits areal and volumetric capacitances of 6.8 mF/cm2 and 758.3 F/cm3, respectively. The presence of oxygen-deficient states enhances the intrinsic conductivity of the thin film, resulting in a reduction in the band gap energy from 3.25 to 2.5 eV. The assembled supercapacitor device made of nitrogen-doped activated carbon (N-AC) and H-NbZr (N-AC//H-NbZr) is able to retain 93, 83, 78, and 66% of its first cycle capacitance after 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4500 successive charge/discharge cycles, respectively. An eminent energy record of approximately 0.77 Î¼W h/cm2 at a power of 0.9 mW/cm2 is achieved at 1 mA/cm2 with superb capability.
