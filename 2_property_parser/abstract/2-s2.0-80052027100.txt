A series of Mn2O3/carbon aerogel microbead (Mn 2O3/CAMB) composites for supercapacitor electrodes have been synthesized by in situ encapsulation method. The structure and morphology of Mn2O3/CAMB are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Electrochemical performances of the synthesized composites are evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurement. All the composites with different Mn2O3 contents show higher specific capacitance than pure CAMB due to the pseudo-capacitance of the Mn2O3 particles dispersed on the surface of CAMB. The highest specific capacitance is up to 368.01 F g-1 when 10 wt% Mn2O3 is coated on the surface of CAMB. Besides, 10%-Mn2O3/CAMB supercapacitor exhibits excellent cyclic stability, the specific capacitance still retains 90% of initial capacitance over 5000 cycles. Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V.
