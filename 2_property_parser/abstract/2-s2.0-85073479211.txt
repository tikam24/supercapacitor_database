Core-shell CoSx@NiCo-LDH nanocubes were fabricated through two-step process of sulfuration and chemical precipitation. The design of CoSx@NiCo-LDH could integrate the merits of high-capacity NiCo-LDH and highly conductive CoSx. And CoSx@NiCo-LDH composite delivers high specific capacity (680.8 C g−1, 1 A g−1) together with outstanding cycling stability (80%, 3000th cycles, 10 A g−1). Additionally, the CoSx@NiCo-LDH//AC asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) achieves high energy density of 42.81 Wh kg−1 at 800.17 W kg−1 and excellent capacity retention (90%, 7000th cycles, 5 A g−1).
