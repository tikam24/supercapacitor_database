Phenolic resin based activated carbon cloths(ACCs) were prepared by steam activation treatment, and were used as electrodes of supercapacitors. The pore structure and the electrochemical properties of the resultant ACCs were investigated by means of N2 adsorption, AC impedance and constant current discharge techniques. The relationship of pore structure and the activated conditions, as well as the relationship between the pore structure and electrochemical performance in 1M (CH2CH3) 3CH3NBF4/PC were discussed in details. Results showed that the BET surface area, average pore width and mesoporous surface area dramatically increased with the increase of activation temperature and/or activation time. It was also found that the specific capacitance of ACCs increased with the increase of BET surface area, especially the specific capacitance of the sample activated under 950°C for 90 min reached 158F·g-1 at current density of 50mA·g-1. Besides, the capacitance retention of ACCs at high current density increased with the increase of mesoporous surface area, of which the capacitance retention (C500/C50) of the sample with the largest mesoporous specific surface area reached 91.1%. IR drop reduced sharply in the pores less than 2nm with the increase of average pore width.
