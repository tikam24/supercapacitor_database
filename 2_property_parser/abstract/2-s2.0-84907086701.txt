V2O5-doped α-Fe2O3 composite nanotubes have been successfully fabricated via a simple one-step electrospinning technique followed by calcination treatment. For the first time, we found that the magnetic properties of the as-prepared samples were significantly dependent on the contents of the dopant. In comparison with pristine α-Fe2O3, perfect reversibility, more excellent capacitance and better cycling stability were simultaneously observed for the hybrid metal oxide with an appropriate mass ratio of V2O 5 (VFNT1) when it was utilized for supercapacitor electrodes, indicating that the doped α-Fe2O3 tubular nanostructures are fairly promising for practical applications not only in magnetic recording but also in the energy storage field. © the Partner Organisations 2014.
