The design of structure and morphology is the key to improve the performance of supercapacitors. This work reports a facile method for the synthesis of MXene-NiCo2O4@NiCo-MOF/CC(M-NiCo2O4@NiCo-MOF/CC) materials by hydrothermal method and electrodeposition. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations illustrating the change in density of states (DOS) at the heterojunction demonstrate that the composite can improve electronic performance. M-NiCo2O4@NiCo-MOF/CC electrode can reach a high specific capacity of 1150.0 C g−1 (2091.0 F g−1) at 1 A g−1, with a retention of 90.3% after 6000 cycles, reflecting excellent electrochemical performance. In addition, the assembled M-NiCo2O4@NiCo-MOF/CC//AC device exhibits excellent performance, and can reach a high energy density of 56.7 Wh kg−1 at 750 W kg g−1, reflecting the broad application prospects.
