Biochar prepared from litchi seeds was investigated for the fabrication of supercapacitor electrodes. The specific capacitance of 190 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 current density was achieved in symmetric supercapacitor fabricated using biochar obtained at 700 °C. Upon activation using CO2, the capacitance was significantly enhanced, reaching up to 493 F g−1. Moreover, the charge-discharge cyclic stability of the activated biochar supercapacitor was well maintained with capacitance retention above 90% after 10,000 charge-discharge cycles in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The energy and power density of the aqueous symmetric supercapacitor prepared using activated biochar were 24.6 Wh kg−1 and 0.6 kW kg−1, respectively. Physicochemical analysis of activated biochar using BET, XRD, Raman, TEM, and XPS revealed a high surface area, hierarchical porous structure, and heteroatom rich functionalities responsible for its excellent charge storage behaviour.
