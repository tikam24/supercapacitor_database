Supercapacitor investigation due to the high capacitance, therefore long time constants, requires considerable modification and adaptation of classical electrochemical methods and instrumental techniques. This paper presents a mathematical analysis, which defines the parameters of the experimental methods, modified standard methods (galvanostatic, potentiostatic, ALSV), as well as new one - tilting current excitation. Firstly, the methods are tested on a specially constructed physical model - the electrical circuit with commercial super capacitor of 1.6 F, as well as the computer simulation. The measurements were performed on a specially developed measuring system based on PC and LabVIEW package. All the methods are applied in the development of a new type of supercapacitor based on natural copper minerals - chalcocite (Cu2S). Comparative methods analysis in terms of efficiency and accuracy is given in the paper.
