We report a novel rapid microwave synthesis of two-dimensional MoS2. Morphological and structural characterizations were performed by XRD and SEM, which showed that the obtained MoS2 was a sheet-like structure with good crystallization. The electrochemical performance illustrated that the MoS2 electrode prepared with 0.0300 mol Na2MoO4 has a higher specific capacitance is 83.4 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1, and favorable electrochemical durability up to 91.0 %, after 4000 cycles.
