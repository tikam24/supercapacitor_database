Object of this paper is the feasibility study, technical and economic, of an electric public transport service where fast charge stations are equipped with electrical energy storage composed by batteries and/or supercapacitor, with relative power electronics, management and control, in order to improve the technical- economical dimensioning, for different possible operating conditions. To this purpose, referring to a real case, a simulator of the charging station was made, including storage subsystems and converters. The final goal is optimizing the storage system necessary to guarantee the charging with a smoother, more levelled supply from the network.
