Pseudocapacitive materials encapsulated in conductive carbon matrix are of paramount importance to develop energy storage devices with high performance and long lifespan. Here, via simple laser-scribing, the Mn-based metal–organic framework [EG-MOF-74(Mn)] is transformed into pseudocapacitive hybrid MnO/Mn7C3 encapsulated in highly conductive graphitic carbon. It is revealed that the rapid carbothermic reduction of MnO (C + MnO → C′ + Mn7C3 + CO) leads to the formation of the intermediate pseudocapacitive MnO/Mn7C3 and the concurrent catalytic graphitization of disordered carbon. This reaction produces a new type of pseudocapacitive material in the form of MnO/Mn7C3 fully embedded in highly conductive graphitic carbon. Thanks to the synergistic effect of the MnO/Mn7C3 nanoparticles and the graphitic carbon, the composite exhibits a high specific capacitance of 403 F g−1 with excellent stability. Asymmetric coin-cell supercapacitors based on the composite demonstrate high energy (29.2 Wh kg−1) and power densities (8000 W kg−1) with a long lifespan. Prototypes of flexible paper-based supercapacitors made of the composite also show great potential toward applications of flexible electronics.
