Nickel-copper metallic foams were electrodeposited from an acidic electrolyte, using hydrogen bubble evolution as a dynamic template. Their morphology and chemical composition was studied by scanning electron microscopy and related to the deposition parameters (applied current density and deposition time). For high currents densities (above 1 A cm-2) the nickel-copper deposits have a three-dimensional foam-like morphology with randomly distributed nearly-circular pores whose walls present an open dendritic structure. The nickel-copper foams are crystalline and composed of pure nickel and a copper-rich phase containing nickel in solid solution. The electrochemical behaviour of the material was studied by cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry (charge-discharge curves) aiming at its application as a positive electrode for supercapacitors. Cyclic voltammograms showed that the Ni-Cu foams have a pseudocapacitive behaviour. The specific capacitance was calculated from charge-discharge data and the best value (105 F g-1 at 1 mA cm-2) was obtained for nickel-copper foams deposited at 1.8 A cm-2 for 180 s. Cycling stability of these foams was also assessed and they present a 90 % capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles at 10 mA cm-2. Â© 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.
