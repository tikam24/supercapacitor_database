According to the continuous development of portable devices and new-energy vehicles, electrochemistry is an efficient way to realize energy conversion and storage, such as lithium ion batteries and supercapacitors. Because of requirement, the portable power supply should have high power density and great specific capacity. In order to solve the low capacitance of carbon electrode which is only 550 F/g, agglomeration and low conductivity of metal oxides, the Fe/Mn bimetallic nanocomposite material preparing from MOFs precursor is designed. The structure that the metal oxides are embedded in the two-dimensional carbon nanosheet was prepared in the experiment, in which the transition metal oxides can increase the electrode capacitance; while the supporting carbon structure not only increases the electrical conductivity, but also avoids the agglomeration of metal oxides. Besides, the great capacity and rate capability were presented, because of its special porous structure. The pores on the two-dimensional carbon nanosheet facilitates the electrolyte to enter into the electrode material, which increase the contact area between the electrolyte and the electrode material, and improve the specific capacitance. Therefore a significant result found in the experiment is that the metal oxide loaded on the surface of the conductive carrier can improve the inherent low conductivity of the metal oxide and increases the specific capacity.
