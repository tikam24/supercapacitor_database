We demonstrate a simple and scalable strategy to obtain N, S and Si co-doped biocompatible graphene foams (GFs) with different shapes using egg albumen as the template. The unique porous structure and element doping endow the GFs with a high charge-discharge rate and good wettability, which largely improve the electrochemical performance of the electrodes, including ultrahigh specific capacitance (534 F g-1 at 1 A g-1), and excellent rate capability (308 F g-1 at 100 A g-1) and cycling performance (96.1% retention of the initial capacitance after 10000 cycles at a high current density of 10 A g-1). Besides, when used as an electrochemical sensor for dopamine, the GF exhibits a detection limit as low as 1.2 μM with a linear response up to 70 μM, due to the low equivalent series resistance. These reveal great potential for promoting the application of 3D graphene in energy storage and electrochemical sensors.
