This chapter provides a generalized overall picture about fundamental electrochemical properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and their recent applications in wide range of energy technologies (battery, supercapacitor, and water splitting). The high surface area, large number of active sites, and remarkable chemical stability offer TMDs with vast opportunities for utilizing as a promising electrocatalysts. However, inadequate electrical conductivity and other deficiencies foster considerable research efforts for further modification. The TMDs showed enhanced electrocatalytic performance through (1) site doping/modification, (2) phase modulation, (3) control of growth morphology, and (4) heterostructure formation. This chapter summarizes the recent demonstration of these methodologies in TMDs towards designing the efficient and benchmarking electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism of device functionality, materials challenges, and perspectives of TMD based electrocatalysts are also discussed in this chapter.
