In this paper, mixing effect of nanoporous carbon black (NCB) and graphene nanosheets (GNS) on surface morphology and electrochemical performance of prepared electrodes were investigated. 80:10:10 (NCB:GNS:PTFE) prepared electrodes show a maximum specific capacitance as high as 10.22 F g-1 in 3 M NaCl electrolyte. Addition of nanoporous carbon black increases outer to total charge stored (qO∗/qT∗) on the electrode from 0.024 to 0.037 which confirms the higher current response and higher voltage reversal at the end potentials.
