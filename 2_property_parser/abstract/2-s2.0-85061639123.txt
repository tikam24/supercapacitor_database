Porous mesh-like FeCo 2 S 4 nanosheet arrays on Ni foam (NF) have been prepared by a two-step hydrothermal approach and employed as electrodes for supercapacitors and efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting. FeCo 2 S 4 /NF exhibits ultrahigh areal capacitance of 7.37 F cm −2 at current density of 5 mA cm −2 and achieves good cycling stability retaining 92% capacitance after 3000 cycles at 10 mA cm −2 . Symmetric solid-state device of FeCo 2 S 4 /NF as positive and negative electrodes delivers a remarkable energy density of 19.12 W h kg −1 (434.61 W kg −1 ). Furthermore, FeCo 2 S 4 /NF electrode delivers a low overpotential of 155 mV at a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) current density of 10 mA cm −2 and shows no obvious attenuation after stability test for 100,000 s in 1 M KOH solution. While a low overpotential of 234 mV at 50 mA cm −2 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be demonstrated in alkaline environment as an anode electrocatalyst. FeCo 2 S 4 /NF shows excellent activity toward overall water splitting with 10 mA cm −2 by applying just 1.405 V across the two electrodes. Hence, the porous mesh-like FeCo 2 S 4 nanosheet arrays on Ni foam are promising electrode materials for supercapacitor application and water splitting.
