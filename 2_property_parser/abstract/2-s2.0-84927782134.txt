Nanohybrids consisting of both carbon and pseudocapacitive metal oxides are promising as high-performance electrodes to meet the key energy and power requirements of supercapacitors. However, the development of high-performance nanohybrids with controllable size, density, composition and morphology remains a formidable challenge. Here, we present a simple and robust approach to integrating manganese oxide (MnOx) nanoparticles onto flexible graphite paper using an ultrathin carbon nanotube/ reduced graphene oxide (CNT/RGO) supporting layer. Supercapacitor electrodes employing the MnOx/CNT/RGO nanohybrids without any conductive additives or binders yield a specific capacitance of 1070 F g-1 at 10 mV s-1, which is among the highest values reported for a range of hybrid structures and is close to the theoretical capacity of MnOx. Moreover, atmosphericpressure plasmas are used to functionalize the CNT/RGO supporting layer to improve the adhesion of MnOx nanoparticles, which results in theimproved cycling stability of the nanohybrid electrodes. These results provide information for the utilization of nanohybrids and plasma-related effects to synergistically enhance the performance of supercapacitors and may create new opportunities in areas such as catalysts, photosynthesis and electrochemical sensors.
