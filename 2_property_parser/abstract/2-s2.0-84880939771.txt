As a novel supercapacitor material, nickel sulfide/graphene oxide (NiS/GO) nanocomposite was synthesized by a hydrothermal process in the presence of graphene oxide. For the NiS/GO nanocomposite as-obtained, the characterization results show that the NiS particles (50 nm) distribute evenly on the GO sheets. The electrochemical property and impedance of the NiS/GO nanocomposite were studied by cyclic voltammetry and electron impedance spectroscopy analysis, respectively. The results show that the introduction of the GO enhanced the electrode conductivity, and then improved the supercapacitive behavior of the NiS/GO nanocomposite. The galvanostatic charge/discharge measurement results indicate that the NiS/GO nanocomposite has a high specific capacitance (800 F g -1 at 1 A g -1 ) and long cycle life (over 1000 cycles).
