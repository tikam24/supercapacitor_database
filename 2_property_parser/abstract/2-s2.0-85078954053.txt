In this work, a new type of hybrid energy storage device is constructed by combining the zinc-ion supercapacitor and zinc-air battery in mild electrolyte. Reduced graphene oxide with rich defects, large surface area, and abundant oxygen-containing functional groups is used as active material, which exhibits two kinds of charge storage mechanisms of capacitor and battery simultaneously. Apart from the physical adsorption/desorption of anions on the surface of graphene, the zinc ions in electrolyte will be electrochemically adsorbed/desorbed onto the oxygen-containing groups of graphene during the charge/discharge process, contributing extra capacitance to the device. Moreover, the defects in graphene will further improve the electrochemical performance of the energy storage device via catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction with exposure to air. Consequently, the synergistic effect leads to a record high capacitance of 370.8 F g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1, which is higher than that of zinc-ion supercapacitors reported previously. Furthermore, the hybrid device exhibits a superior cycling stability with 94.5% capacitance retention even after 10000 charge/discharge cycles at a high current density of 5 A g-1. Interestingly, the developed hybrid device can be self-charging automatically after the power is exhausted in the ambient atmosphere. Other electrode materials, such as carbon nanotube paper, are also used to build a hybrid device to verify the feasibility of this strategy. This facile, green, and convenient strategy provides new insight for developing a high performance storage device, showing great application prospect in other hybrid energy storage devices in mild electrolyte.
