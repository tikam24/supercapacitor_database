A novel estimation methodology is developed which can be used to evaluate the potential benefits of implementing a hybrid battery-supercapacitor system to improve battery life. This approach allows for a quick comparison of battery-only versus a hybrid battery-capacitor system in terms of maximizing battery efficiency without the need for complicated and detailed computer simulations. Experimental results are presented to validate this technique. Â© 2013 IEEE.
