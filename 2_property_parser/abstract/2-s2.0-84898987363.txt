Nanostructured poly(4-styrene sulphonic acid) and tantalum (IV) oxide-doped polyaniline nanocomposite were synthesised and their electro-conductive properties were determined. The oxide was synthesized using a modified sol-gel method and then dispersed in acidic media through sonication and entrapped in-situ into the polymeric matrix during the oxidative chemical polymerization of aniline doped with poly(4-styrene sulphonic acid). The oxides and novel polymeric nanocomposite were characterised with TEM, SEM, EDX, XRD, FTIR, UV-visible to ascertain elemental and phase composition, successful polymerization, doping, morphology and entrapment of the metal oxide nanoparticles. The electro-conductivity of the nanomaterial was interrogated using scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The material was then anchored on activated graphitic carbon and used in the design of an asymmetric supercapacitor cell using 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. Characteristically high specific capacitance values of 318.4 F/g with a corresponding energy and power densities of 1.57 kWh/kg and 0.435 kW/kg, respectively, were demonstrated. The cell also showed high coulombic efficiency of 94.9% with a long cycle life and good cycle stability making the nanomaterial suitable for constructing supercapacitor cell electrodes.
