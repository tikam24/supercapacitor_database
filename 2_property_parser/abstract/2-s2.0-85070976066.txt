In this study, a novel porous carbon (PC) is prepared from persimmon fruit via hydrothermal treatment at 140 °C, product freeze-drying and finally carbonization at 550 °C for 4 h under an inert atmosphere. A further porous carbon material containing magnetite nanoparticles (denoted as Fe3O4-PC) is also prepared from persimmon by introducing a microwave-assisted step into the PC synthesis. Characterization of the PC and Fe3O4-PC materials reveals that both materials have high specific surface areas and very porous structures, with the Fe3O4 nanoparticles in Fe3O4-PC possessing a yolk-shell structure. The energy storage performance of the PC and Fe3O4-PC products is evaluated by assembling a supercapacitor with Fe3O4-PC as the anode and the PC as the cathode. The results suggest that the PC hold a high areal capacitance of 816.8 mF/cm2 at 20 mV/s. The adsorption experiment also been performed to investigate the adsorption performance of prepared PC and Fe3O4-PC. The results suggest that 100% of As (V) in water and 98.3% of As (V) in mud can be removed with Fe3O4-PC as the absorbent.
