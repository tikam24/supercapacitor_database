In this work, CuFe2O4/CuO nanocomposites have been synthesized by galvanostatic cathodic electrodeposition. The obtained nanocomposites were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, Fourier Transform Infrared, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area analysis. The electrochemical properties of CuFe2O4/CuO nanocomposites were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in 1.0 M KOH. The CuFe2O4/CuO nanocomposites have shown the high specific capacitance of 322.49 F g−1 at the scan rate of 1 mV s−1. After 5000 cycles, 92% of this specific capacitance was retained. Although the prepared nanocomposite has shown a mediocre specific capacitance compared to other metal oxide-based materials, the low cost of the starting materials and the ease of preparation make this nanocomposite a good candidate for supercapacitor applications.
