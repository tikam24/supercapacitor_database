Various eggs shell membranes (ESMs) have been used as a separator for supercapacitor application. The separator was prepared from different membranes such as chicken eggs shell membrane (CESM), duck eggs shell membrane (DESM) and goose eggs shell membrane (GESM). The ESMs were tested as a separator in a two-electrode system, the sandwich-type supercapacitor cell consists of two activated carbon monoliths as electrodes, two stainless steel as current collectors and 1 M H2SO4 solution as an electrolyte. The electrochemical performance of the ESMs was characterized by an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, a cyclic voltammetry and a galvanostatic charge-discharge. The results of this study exhibit all of the ESMs as a good candidate for supercapacitor separator. However, the CESM was shown excellence electrochemical properties, such as low resistance, high energy density and power density. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) micrograph and X-ray diffraction analysis were also proved that the ESMs are a promising low-cost separator for supercapacitor application.
