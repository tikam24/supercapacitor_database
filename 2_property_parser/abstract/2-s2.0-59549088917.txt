A compact power design is being created by combining a flash LED controller with a supercapacitor, allowing the use of smaller, lighter, and less-expensive power sources with extending battery life in cell-phone cameras. This approach allows designers to reduce the system footprint by optimally sizing the battery and power circuitry to cover the average power consumption instead of peak levels. The supercapacitor needs to be recharged when the voltage drops below the operational limit of the LEDs. A 0.55-F 85-mÎ© supercapacitor delivers 9-W LED power bursts, while high light levels is achieved by driving the flash LEDs at currents between 1A and 2A. The size of the supercapacitor used in cell-phones is determined by the battery voltage, LED flash current, LED forward voltage, the efficiency of the AAT1282, and flash-pulse duration.
