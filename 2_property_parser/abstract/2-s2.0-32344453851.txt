The recent advances of high power low resistance for supercapacitor at home and abroad are reviewed. Supercapacitor is a new type of energy storage component, its properties are between conventional electrostatic capacitor and batteries, such as the high power density characterized by conventional capacitors, the high energy density characterized by batteries. Previous papers reported the development of researches on double layer capacitor with high power and low equal series resistance, analyzed different equivalent models of the double layer capacitor, and found that the most important factors are the choice of electrolyte, the manufacture of polarized electrode, the contact-resistance between polarized electrode and collector, and the packing techniques. This paper will enumerate the effective measures and methods to reduce the equal series resistance of double layer capacitor by the specialists and scholars of domestic and overseas.
