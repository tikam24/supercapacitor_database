Electrode design is of significant importance in the construction of enhanced electrochemical performance, and nanoarray is an attractive architecture for energy storage devices with a large specific surface area. Herein, we report the development of binary FeCo2O4@NiCo2S4 array tubes on Ni foam (Ni@FeCo2O4@NiCo2S4) as an efficient non-noble-metal electrode material for battery-supercapacitor hybrid device in alkaline electrolytes. Meanwhile, the unique 3D structure provides a desirable large electroactive area and rapid electron conductivity, resulting in remarkable electrochemical behavior in terms of high specific capacity (5.99 W cm-2 with a 260 mWh cm-2 of energy density for Ni@FeCo2O4@NiCo2S4). The long-term cycling stability of 76.9% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 50 mA cm-2 for Ni@FeCo2O4@NiCo2S4 could be obtained. These results demonstrate that the fabricated high-performance electrode materials can be a promising candidate for battery-supercapacitor hybrid devices.
