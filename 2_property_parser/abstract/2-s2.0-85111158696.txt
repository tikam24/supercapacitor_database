For decades, improvements in electrolytes and electrodes have driven the development of electrochemical energy storage devices. Generally, electrodes and electrolytes should not be developed separately due to the importance of the interaction at their interface. The energy storage ability and safety of energy storage devices are in fact determined by the arrangement of ions and electrons between the electrode and the electrolyte. In this paper, the physicochemical and electrochemical properties of lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors using ionic liquids (ILs) as an electrolyte are reviewed. Additionally, the energy storage device ILs developed over the last decade are introduced.
