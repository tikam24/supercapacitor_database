Conventional polymer electrolytes are generally limited in ionic conductivity and are short of extra functions, thereby precluding their usage in developing functional all-solid-state energy-related devices. Herein, we design a highly conductive polyelectrolyte (ionic conductivity up to 7.16 S m-1) based on polyacrylic acid cross-linked by methacrylated graphene oxide (MGO-PAA) with excellent stretchability (950% strain) and self-healing capability, enabling the direct fabrication of self-healing supercapacitors and stretchable supercapacitors of up to 300% deformation without the extra addition of other self-healing or stretchable materials. This work provides new insights into the synthesis of highly conductive and multifunctional polyelectrolytes and promotes the development of all-solid-state SCs with high energy densities for practical applications in flexible and wearable electronics.
