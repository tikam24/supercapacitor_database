In this work, hollow carbon spheres from wood (WHCS) were prepared by liquefaction, emulsification, half-curing, carbonization and activation steps. Then, Co-Ni layered double hydroxide nanosheets (CoNiLDHs) were grown on the surface of hollow carbon spheres, forming a CoNiLDHs/WHCS composite with a core–shell structure. Benefitting from the excellent electrochemical activity of CoNiLDHs and the high surface area of WHCS, CoNiLDHs/WHCS electrode exhibited a high specific capacitance and excellent stability. Compared with WHCS and CoNiLDHs, the specific capacitance of CoNiLDHs/WHCS (∼1205.24 Fg−1) composite exhibited a superior retention rate (∼71.09% at 10 Ag−1) and excellent cycling stability (87.5% after 5000 cycles at 10 Ag−1). The synthesized CoNiLDHs/WHCS composite is a promising electrode material for developing high-performance supercapacitors.
