Conducting polymers such as polypyrrole and polythiophene show good intrinsic conductivity and redox behavior, which make them interesting materials for low-cost energy storage devices. However, the specific capacitance values, potential ranges, long-term stabilities, and cycle lives of supercapacitors based on polymers have been shown to be rather moderate. In contrast to carbon-based double-layer capacitors, polymer supercapacitors have not reached a commercial state yet. This article outlines (1) conducting polymers for supercapacitors: pseudocapacitance of polymer films; (2) practical embodiments of polymer supercapacitors: patent survey; and (3) polymer and solid-state electrolytes for supercapacitors.
