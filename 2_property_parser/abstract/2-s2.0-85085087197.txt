It is very important to transform biomass-derived waste into useful materials with high performance. In this report, the N, O, P multiple heteroatom-doped activated porous carbon materials with enhanced electrochemical performance are prepared using durian shell-derived hydrochar. The as-prepared activated carbon materials show a characteristic of moderate specific surface area, micropore-dominant pore structure and multiple heteroatoms doping. As electrode in supercapacitor, the as-prepared N, O, P-doped porous carbon material can deliver a specific capacity of 184 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 in 1 M H2SO4 aqueous solution and shows excellent cycle stability with a retention rate of ~88% after 10000 cycles. In addition, in the redox electrolyte of H2SO4 and KI aqueous solution, N, O, P co-doped activated porous carbon can provide a capacitance of ~ 560 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 (corresponding to energy density of 12.4 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 318 W kg−1). This work provides a novel way to enhance the electrochemical performance of the biomass waste-derived carbon, helping to further boosting their application in energy storage field.
