Perovskite type rare earth manganates RMnO3 (LaMnO3, NdMnO3, SmMnO3, and EuMnO3) nanofibers were fabricated by a simple electrospinning process. LaMnO3 nanofibers showed rhombohedral structure, and NdMnO3, SmMnO3, and EuMnO3 nanofibers exhibited orthorhombic structure. The surface structure, phonon modes, optical property, morphology, and valence states of RMnO3 nanofibers were examined. The electrochemical behaviors of RMnO3 nanofibers as supercapacitor electrode materials were explicitly illustrated. It confirms the feasible applications of RMnO3 nanofibers as supercapacitor electrodes. In addition, the magnetic properties of RMnO3 nanofibers were investigated. At room temperature, RMnO3 nanofibers exhibited paramagnetic behaviors. At low temperature, LaMnO3 and NdMnO3 nanofibers presented magnetic transition to ferromagnetic state, while SmMnO3 and EuMnO3 nanofibers showed magnetic transition to antiferromagnetic state.
