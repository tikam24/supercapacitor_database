Nanoflake arrays of Ni nanoparticles were assembled by template-free methods, including metal hydroxide arrays grown in situ on Ni foams and the following non-contact Al-reduction processes. After electrochemical activation, they achieved superior specific capacitances and excellent rate capabilities, owing to their good electric conductivity and mass transport properties.
