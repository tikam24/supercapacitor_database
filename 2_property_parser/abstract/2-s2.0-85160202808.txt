Stability is the primary goal in standalone power systems due to the high penetration and uncertainties of renewable energy resources, so the system reliability is affected, and the hybrid energy storage system (HESS) and diesel generator (DG) compensate for renewables' failures. This study contributes to managing and controlling DC-coupled multi-Microgrids fed by Photovoltaic, HESS, and DG resources and subjected to pulsed loading and uncertain PV outputs, besides battery SOCs and DG fuel constraints. The Dual-loop control structure compares classical Proportional Integral (CPI), Super-Twisting-Sliding-Mode-Control (ST-SMC), and Linear Quadratic Regulator with Integral Action (LQR-I) to evaluate the robustness and control performance of the HESS. For the supercapacitor (SC), a hysteresis current control (HCC) tracks its setpoint currents using a frequency decoupling-based power-split control. Matlab simulations confirmed system reliability by combining controllers with different Key Performance Indicators, where adopting the LQR-I for bus voltage regulation and the ST-SMC for HESS current control outperformed the other combinations and revealed superior system performance, improving Bus voltage regulation, DG current tracking, overall system efficiency, and loading convergence by 67.63(%), 83.63(%), 77.92(%), and 2.72(%), respectively. Instead, the basic CPI enhanced battery and SC current control with 51.55 and 63.94 (%) compared to the winner scenario.
