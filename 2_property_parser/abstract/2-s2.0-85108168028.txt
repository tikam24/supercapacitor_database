Under the local shadow condition, the power output characteristics of occluded devices and unoccluded devices in the SCSD(Solar Cell-Supercapacitor Device) array are inconsistent, which leads to the existence of multiple peak values in the output power curve of SCSD array. It is necessary to establish a mathematical model of SCSD array under local shadow and solve the problem of multiple power peaks caused by local shadow. Therefore, the mathematical models of SCSD array under normal uniform illumination, local light shadow and local severe shadow are established, and the output characteristics of SCSD array under different shadow conditions are described in detail. On this basis, a method is proposed to control the charging and discharging of supercapacitor in SCSD array to compensate the missing current of occluded devices. MATLAB simulative results and laboratory experimental results show that the mathematical model of SCSD array under local shadow can be accurately described by piecewise function. The proposed supercapacitor current compensation method can not only restore the output power of SCSD array under local shadow to single peak value, but also effectively improve the total output power of SCSD array.
