Herein, we report the use of Cu2O nanosheets decorated CuMnO2 electrodeposited over copper foil as a supercapacitor electrode material and compared with their individual counterpart. The morphology of the prepared electrodes is characterized using scanning electron microscopy and the structural features are evaluated from the XRD pattern. The charge storing performances of the electrodes are assessed by carrying out cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic studies. In contrast to the individual metal oxide systems, the layered system exhibits a very high capacitance of 257 F g-1 at a scan rate of 5 mVsâˆ’1. Further, the cyclic retention ability of the system is 90% measured by running 10,000 cycles. Further, a prototype super-capacitor is fabricated and evaluated its charge-discharge characteristics which reveals that the obtained system may serve as an efficient electrode material for fabricating supercapacitor.
