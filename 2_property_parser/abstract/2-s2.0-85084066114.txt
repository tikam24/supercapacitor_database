In this paper, supercapacitors and grid-tie inverters are compared as means of integrating regenerative braking functionality into elevator systems. In dynamic braking, a conventional motor drive is unable to utilize energy during braking periods because it is powered by a rectifier in which energy flows in only one direction. Typically, braking resistors are used to dissipate any excess energy generated that can result in a breakdown of the device if left uncontrolled. Alternatively, supercapacitors or grid-tie inverters can be installed to the DC-link and the energy either stored for future use or fed to the power grid, thus preventing energy waste. Models for these two regenerative braking methods are constructed and simulated in the Simulink environment in order to compare their energy efficiencies under several unique elevator usage patterns. In usage patterns that allow the motor to generate energy within a long duration, the simulation results show the supercapacitor option is less of an improvement in energy efficiency than the grid-tie method due to energy flowing through two energy conversion devices. On the contrary, in usage patterns that limit regeneration within short bursts, the grid-tie inverter option is less efficient than the supercapacitor method due to output current limitations.
