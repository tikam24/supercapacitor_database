Novel composites of nickel silicate core–shell microspheres hybridized with graphene are fabricated through a facile hydrothermal method. The core–shell microspheres display hierarchical shells assemblied with Ni3Si2O5(OH)4 nanosheets yielding high specific areas, rough and porous surface. Electrochemical performance exhibits high specific capacitance of 405 F/g at 0.5 A/g together with good rate capability. This is attributed to the combination of the abundant electroactive sites resulted from hierarchical structure and the high electrical conductivity ascribed to reduced graphene. In addition, the good capacitance retention rate of 98.3% is achieved after 5000 cycles at 5 A/g.
