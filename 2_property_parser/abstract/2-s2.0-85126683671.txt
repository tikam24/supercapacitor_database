In the recent days the demand of portable, thin and flexible electronics such as roll-up display, touch screen, smart electronics and wearable sensors, are drawing a great interest in the daily life of human being because of advancement in materials and technology. In order to simplify this growing electronic demand, super capacitor is fascinating as a favourable energy storage devices. Supercapacitor has more power density, faster charge-discharge cycle and higher energy storage capacity with compare to Li-ion batteries. Recently, flexible super capacitor is the main focus in the flexible electronics due to its higher flexibility, high power density and high capacitance performance. Conducting polymers based supercapacitor is more promising candidate compare to other materials in terms of their flexibility, high redox active specific capacitance and essential elastic nature. In this chapter different conducting polymer (CPs) based super capacitor have been explained.
