Highly ordered polyaniline nanocone arrays were synthesized on three-dimensional graphene network by template-free electrodeposition method. The morphology of the material was characterized by scanning electron microscopy. The structural features were analyzed by using Raman spectroscopy. Polyaniline nanocones align vertically on the surface of three-dimensional graphene network. Such morphology provides unblocked diffusion path for electrolyte ions, and increases the specific area of the material. The material possesses specific capacitance of 751.3 F g-1 in 1 M HClO4 within the potential window of 0-0.7 V, and has high rate capability as well as good cycling stability. At a current density of 10 A g-1, its capacitance is 88.5% of that at a current density of 1 A g-1. Furthermore, the material remains 93.2% of initial capacitance after 1000 cycles of charging-discharging test.
