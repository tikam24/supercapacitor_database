This paper describes the hydrothermal synthesis of Ni3V2O8 nanoparticles for supercapacitor and hydrogen evolution study. The surface microstructure of Ni3V2O8 nanoparticles reveals an excellent areal-specific capacitance of 1.09 F cm−2 at a current density of 1 mA cm−2 and an energy density of 24 mWh cm−2 at a power density of 200 mW cm−2. In addition to supercapacitor performance, the Ni3V2O8 electrode revels well in hydrogen evolution reaction in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The Ni3V2O8 electrode exhibits a 175 mV over potential at 10 mA cm−2 current density and a 154 deg/mV Tafel slope before stabilization. According to the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, the series resistance (Rs) is 3.89 Ω and the charge transfer resistance (Rct) is 5.62 Ω. The series resistance of the Ni3V2O8 electrode is the same, but Rct climbs to 6.45 Ω after 5 h of stability.
