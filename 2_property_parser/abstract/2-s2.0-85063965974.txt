Micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) possessing the remarkable features of high electrochemical performance and relatively small volume are promising candidates for energy storage in micro-devices. Tremendous effort has been devoted in recent years to design and to fabricate MSCs with different active electrode materials, including carbon-based materials, conducting polymers, and graphene/metal oxide composites. Moreover, various methods have been developed to prepare MSCs, such as photolithography, laser direct writing, printing methods. This review presents a summary of the recent developments in MSC technology, including electrode materials, fabrication methods, and patterning. Finally, future developments, perspectives, and challenges in the MSC industry are also discussed.
