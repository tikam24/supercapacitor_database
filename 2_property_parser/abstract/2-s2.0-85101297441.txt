In recent years, graphene has attracted a lot of interest and research in the fields of chemistry, mechanics and electricity due to its unique properties. As an excellent graphene material, 3D porous graphene has been widely applied in electronic devices due to its unique porous structure, which enables the material to maintain high enough electron mobility and mechanical stability while having a large specific surface area. The laser-induced graphene is a three-dimensional reticular graphene material directly prepared by one-step method. The 3D reticular graphene could be further modified by doping other elements, which can signifi- cantly improve the energy storage capacity of the device. This preparation method combines the preparation and patterning of 3D graphene, eliminates the need for wet chemical reaction treatment, makes it easier to make and has better material properties. At the same time, the special properties of laser-induced graphene, such as porous micro-nano structure and large specific surface area, make it have high application value in the fields of supercapacitors and sensors.
