This study aims to increase the knowledge on the interactions that occur at the electrode/electrolyte interface in carbon-based electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) when solvent-free ionic liquids are used as electrolytes. Many previous studies found in the literature are conducted using theoretical approaches, and they are unable to model all the variables and the complexity of an actual device with a complex carbon surface and an ionic liquid (IL). Here, the compatibility between imidazolium ionic liquids and different carbon materials-an activated carbon (AC), a mesoporous carbon (MES), multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), and reduced graphene oxide (RGO)-is empirically investigated applying synchronous chronopotentiometric tests to various symmetrical EDLCs. The study of the simultaneous evolution of the cell and electrode potentials of the various carbon/ILs cells, monitoring the evolution of specific capacitances and electrical resistances for each independent electrode, allows inferring about the ion-electrode compatibility, the limiting factors for charge accumulation, and its impacts on the performance of the global cell. The results indicate that the sp2 structures of MWCNTs and RGO favor interactions with the EMI+ cation on the negative electrode. In the positive electrodes, MES and AC favor interactions with the BF4- and TFSI- anions, respectively, yielding a higher specific capacitance and lower resistance.
