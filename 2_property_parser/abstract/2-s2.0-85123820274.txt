Preparation of natural polymer-based highly conductive hydrogels with tunable mechanical properties for applications in flexible electronics is still challenging. Herein, we report a facile method to prepare lignin-based Fe3+-rich, high-conductivity hydrogels via the following two-step process: (1) lignin hydrogels are prepared by cross-linking sulfonated lignin with poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether (PEGDGE) and (2) Fe3+ions are impregnated into the lignin hydrogel by simply soaking in FeCl3. Benefiting from Fe3+ion complexation with catechol groups and other functional groups in lignin, the resultant hydrogels exhibit unique properties, such as high conductivity (as high as 6.69 S路m-1) and excellent mechanical and hydrophobic properties. As a strain sensor, the as-prepared lignin hydrogel shows high sensitivity when detecting various human motions. With the flow of moist air, the Fe3+-rich lignin hydrogel generates an output voltage of 162.8 mV. The assembled supercapacitor of the hydrogel electrolyte demonstrates a high specific capacitance of 301.8 F路g-1, with a maximum energy density of 26.73 Wh路kg-1, a power density of 2.38 kW路kg-1, and a capacitance retention of 94.1% after 10000 consecutive charge-discharge cycles. These results support the conclusion that lignin-based Fe3+-rich, high-conductivity hydrogels have promising applications in different fields, including sensors and supercapacitors, rendering a new platform for the value-added utilization of lignin.
