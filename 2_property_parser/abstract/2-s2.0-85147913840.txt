This book chapter gives an overview of the research that has been done on how to use smart textiles, especially those made from silk fibroin, to harvest energy from renewable sources in the human body and in its environment. We start with a short explanation of how important smart textiles are in the coming energy crisis, pollution of the environment and the need for small-scale energy devices to be made for public health. We examine smart textiles in terms of their ability to produce energy in various forms like biomechanical, body heat, biochemical and solar energy, along with the hybrid forms. We discuss the variety of forms of energy generation technologies like triboelectric generators, piezoelectric generators and thermoelectric energy conversion gazettes. Since the storage of energy has equal importance as that of energy generation, we have discussed in depth the application of silk fibroin in the supercapacitors. Finally, we offer a critical examination of smart fabrics, as well as insights into future difficulties and prospects. The improvements in chemistry and materials mentioned in this book chapter will push the boundaries of smart textiles, which will soon alter our lives in the Internet of Things age, with global efforts.
