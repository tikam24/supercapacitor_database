The use of matoa fruit peel waste-based activated carbon as electrode materials for supercapacitor devices is described in this paper. The chemical and CO2activation were used to prepared the activated carbon. In the chemical activation process, zinc chloride 0.1 M was used as a chemical reagent. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) measurements are used to assess the electrochemical performance of as-prepared electrode materials. After CO2activation process, the density of the MFP samples have been decreased. From the CV and GCD data, the MFP-0.1 sample has optimum specific capacitance are 158 F g-1and 187 F g-1, respectively. The electrochemical results demonstrated that the MFP sample is a potential choice for supercapacitor electrode materials.
