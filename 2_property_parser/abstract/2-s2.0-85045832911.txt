This work synthesizes the hybrid 1T/2H phase MoS2 nanosheets array on reduced graphene oxide for high-performance supercapacitors under extreme environmental temperature via oxygen incorporation and polyaniline intercalation method. The oxygen incorporation, which leads to the formation of MoS2 with hybrid phase of 1T and 2H structure, and polyaniline intercalation provide excellent conductivity and expand the interlayer distance of MoS2. Meanwhile, the sandwiched oxygen-incorporated MoS2/polyaniline nanosheet array aligns on reduced graphene oxide, creating sufficient heterointerface among polyaniline, MoS2, and reduced graphene oxide, which constructs a conducting network that is beneficial for charge transfer and structure stability. The obtained oxygen-incorporated MoS2/polyaniline/reduced graphene oxide hierarchical nanosheets exhibit a capacitance of 752.0 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 in 1 M H2SO4 in a three-electrode system. When cycles at 50 A g-1 for 50 000 cycles, it has a capacitance retention of 80.4 % for the initial cycle (282.3 F g-1). The material shows excellent performance in an extremely wide range of temperatures. The symmetric cell has capacitances of 79.6, 100.1, and 122.0 F g-1 at 2 A g-1 at 0 °C, room temperature, and 50 °C and maintains about 89.9, 86.1, and 73.9% of the initial capacitance, respectively, after 30 000 cycles.
