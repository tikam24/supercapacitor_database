Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) were synthesized by pyrolysis of polyarylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers that were prepared by dissolving of PAN in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution followed by electrospinning and drying. The obtained CNFs were further treated via a CO2 activation process. The morphology and porous structures of the obtained nanofibers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and N2 sorption measurements. Effects of polymer solution concentration and static voltage during the electrospinning process on the morphology and diameter of nanofibers were studied. Their unique microstructural features enable the CNFs to present outstanding high specific capacitance in aqueous, non-aqueous and novel ionic liquid electrolytes. Moreover, the CO2 activated carbon nanofibers (ACNFs) exhibit a high specific area (2866 m2â€¢g-1) and pore volume which is almost three times higher than that of the raw carbon nanofibers. Overall, combinations of the high surface areas and outstanding electrical conductivity make the activated carbon nanofibers have a further application in supercapacitor electrode materials.
