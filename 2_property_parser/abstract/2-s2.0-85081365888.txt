In this paper, the principle, preparation and influencing factors of bamboo-based super capacitor materials are mainly introduced, as well as the research progress in the structural design and technical studies. Comparing to the single activated bamboo-carbon, bamboo-based carbon composites, taking bamboo-carbon as the template for the growth/fitting of pseudo-capacitance materials, are emphatically discussed. The redox reaction at the interface between the pseudo-capacitance material and the electrolyte results in the additional pseudo-capacitance, significantly improving the electrical performance of bamboo-based carbon materials and then extending the area of its applications. Finally, the perspective of the abundant bamboo resources in the field of super capacitors is prospected, basing on the summary of current research progress and facing problems.
