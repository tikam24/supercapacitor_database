Mesophase pitch was separated into different pitch fractions to investigate the effect of pitch fractions on the properties of their nanofibers prepared by electrospinning. The evolution of different pitch fractions-derived nanofibers during stabilization and carbonization were explored, and the properties of the resultant carbon nanofibers (CNFs) as electrode materials for supercapacitor were compared. Results indicated that the hexane insoluble-toluene soluble (HI-TS) and toluene insoluble-tetrahydrofuran (THF) soluble (TI-THFS) fractions had good spinnability due to their narrow molecular weight distribution. Moreover, compared with HI-TS and THF insoluble (THFI), TI-THFS consisted of appropriate aromaticity and branched alkyl groups which promoted the stabilization and carbonization behaviors of its nanofibers, resulting in maintaining ideal fiber morphology of TI-THFS-derived nanofiber due to the mitigation of their exothermic reactions. Meanwhile, the TI-THFS-derived CNFs presented the highest surface area of 543 m2 g−1 and exhibited an excellent specific capacitance of 167 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte.
