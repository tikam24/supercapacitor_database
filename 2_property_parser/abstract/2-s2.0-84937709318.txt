Spray pyrolytic deposition of ruthenium incorporated cobalt oxide thin film electrodes was carried out via methanolic route at 623 ± 2 K. Structural, morphological, optical, compositional and electrochemical study was made using XRD, SAED, SEM, TEM, UV-vis, EDX, XPS and electrochemical work station. Deposited samples shows face centered cubic crystal structure for Co 3 O 4 and tetragonal for RuO 2 having crystalline nature was confirmed form SAED. Mixed oxide samples having porous nano-grain morphology and mixed microstructure as observed form SEM and TEM. Cyclic voltammogram study reveals double-pseudo-capacitive nature with optimum specific capacitance (SC) 628.33 F/g at the scan rate 1 mV/s in 1 M KOH with good stability. Charge-discharge behavior was studied to calculate electric parameters such as specific energy (SE), specific power (SP) and columbic efficiency (η). The calculated maximum values are SE 19.94 W h/kg, SP 5.33 kW/kg and η 99.43%. Electrochemical impedance study was made in the frequency range 1 mHz to 1 MHz to see the internal resistance and capacitive behavior of the optimized sample. The randles equivalent circuit and its parameters are reported in the text.
