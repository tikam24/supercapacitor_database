A multifunctional antifreezing mechanically tough conductive organogel polyelectrolyte was designed and prepared by simultaneously introducing poly(vinyl alcohol), tripentaerythritol, and H2O/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) binary solvent. Based on the outstanding freeze resistance of the H2O/DMSO binary solvent, this organogel showed good mechanical properties and long-term stability in the temperature range of −20 to 20 °C. Meanwhile, the as-prepared flexible supercapacitor exhibits superior electrode specific capacitance (140 F g-1), high ionic conductivity (18.9 mS cm-1), outstanding cycling stability (only 5% capacitance decay over 2000 cycles), and excellent durability (85% weight retention after storing for 10 days) even at a low temperature of −20 °C. In addition, the prepared organogel exhibits tunable optical performances in diverse polar solvents and could act as information storage installations for recording and wiping.
