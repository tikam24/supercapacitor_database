Considering the atomic size mismatch between Mo and W, a large compressive microstrain is introduced and phase engineering may be achieved in MoS2. A simple one-step hydrothermal method as a facile method is employed to synthesize 1T-Mo0.71W0.29S2. 1T-Mo0.71W0.29S2 doping Co element and then growing on carbon cloth are the effective way to improve the supercapacitor performance. Benefitting from the outstanding conductivity of 1T-Mo0.71W0.29S2 and carbon cloth, the more active sites by doping Co, the electrode of Co-(1T-Mo0.71W0.29S2)-1% on carbon cloth exhibits high specific capacity of 1235 mF cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2. Flexible symmetric supercapacitors constructed by Co-(1T-Mo0.71W0.29S2)-1% on carbon cloth show high energy density (22.7 μWh cm−2), strong flexibility and stability (88.7% at 20 mA cm−2). The simple strategy provides a facile route for easy phase engineering and improvement on performance of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs).
