Layered titanate H2Ti3O7 nanotubes were synthesized and firstly used as a supercapacitor electrode in a non-aqueous electrolyte. They exhibited the specific capacitances as high as 414 and 306 F g−1 at 0.5 and 10 A g−1, respectively, and 82% of the specific capacitance at the 10th cycle can be retained after 1000 cycles. © 2014 The Partner Organisations.
