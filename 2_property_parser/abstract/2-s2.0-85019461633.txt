Here we demonstrate the effect of the concentration of hydrogen peroxide solution on the generation of various kinds of oxygen ions, mainly peroxide (O2 2−) and superoxide (O2 −) ions, on the surface of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) nanobelts. Due to O2 2− and O2 − ions, the mechanism of charge storage shows an interplay between surface-controlled and diffusion-controlled redox reactions. The concentration of H2O2 is indicative of the strength of hydrogen bonding, which significantly affects the concentration or coordination of the surface species (O2 −, O2 2−, Mo5+ and Mo6+) that are available to interact with the electrolyte ions. By altering the concentration of the surface species (IO2 −/IO2 2−, IMo 5+/IMo 6+), a specific capacitance as high as 210 F g−1 is achieved for MoO3 nanobelts at an applied current density of 0.5 A g−1, with relatively good cycling stability (≈85 %) after 2000 cycles.
