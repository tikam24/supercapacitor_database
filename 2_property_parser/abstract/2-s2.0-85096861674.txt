Electrode materials are crucial for the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors. Thus, it is urgent to develop a satisfactory electrode material with excellent energy storage properties. Binary metal hydroxides are competitive candidates for supercapacitors. Herein, we prepared honeycomb-like NiCo(OH)2 nanosheet arrays grown on nickel foam by a facile one-step solvothermal method. The electrochemical performance of as-prepared honeycomb-like NiCo(OH)2 nanosheet arrays as electrode materials for supercapacitor have been evaluated. The NiCo(OH)2 electrode exhibits higher areal capacity (267 mF cm−2) compared with Ni(OH)2 (31.2 mF cm−2) and Co(OH)2 (87.73 mF cm−2) at the current density of 20 mA cm−2. The capacity retention can up to 83.8% after 5000 cycles. Such intriguing electrochemical performance enables it to be a potential electrode material for supercapacitors.
