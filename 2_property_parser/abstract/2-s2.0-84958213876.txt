Manganese oxide (MnOx) thin films were prepared on stainless steel (SS) 304 by galvanostatic (GS) mode of electrodeposition technique using different precursors; 0.1 M potassium permanganate (KMnO4) and 0.1 M manganese sulfate (MnSO4) solutions. The electrodeposition condition was set at a constant current of 1 mA/cm2. Different precursors provide MnOx thin films with different morphologies. Using KMnO4 as a precursor, the MnOx thin film was deposited (MnOx-K), while using MnSO4 as a precursor, the MnOx nanosheets with a thickness of approximately 40 nm were formed (MnOx-S). XPS results evidence the formation of manganese oxide with different oxidation states composition by different precursors. Electrochemical measurements were carried out in a three-electrode setup using Pt and Ag/AgCl electrodes as counting and reference electrodes, respectively and 1M Na2SO4 aqueous solution as electrolyte. MnOx-K at a deposition time of 10 min shows the highest specific capacitance of 233.55Â±19.01 F/g. The specific capacitance improvement of MnOx-K may be attributed to MnOx nanosheet structure which increases surface area of electrode.
