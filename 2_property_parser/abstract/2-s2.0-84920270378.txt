In order to improve the disadvantage that traditional carbon-supercapacitor can not obtain simplification and accuracy simultaneously, a new method is put forward to solve the problems of parameter identification in the circuit model of carbon-supercapacitor. A kind of circuit model which can adequately describe the work characteristic of the supercapacitor is established, and recursive least squares algorithm with forgetting factor is used in identifying the circuit parameters to finish the process of parameter identification. The actual current and voltage in the charging process are measured and compared through constant current charging experiments and simulating methods. The results of experiments and simulation show that this circuit can overcome the defect of data saturation in traditional Recursive Least-squares algorithm and obtain more accurate model identification parameters.
