Based on their ability to self-assemble and mimic strategies that occur in nature, peptide nanomaterials offer a variety of potential applications in environmentally friendly energy storage technologies. Herein, we report the experimental investigations into an elaborate self-assembled dipeptide Fmoc-EF-NH2, which displayed good performance as an electrode material in a supercapacitor. In order to protect the peptide electrode from electrolyte dissolution, a thin layer of TiO2 was coated on the peptide film by atomic layer deposition. The as-prepared peptide electrodes achieved an outstanding mass-specific capacitance of 125 F g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 current density and an areal capacitance of 8.6 mF cm-2. Furthermore, the capacitor exhibits excellent stability, in that 95% of the capacitance was retained after 5000 cycles. Additionally, the fabricated all-solid-state SCs possess excellent mechanical flexibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation that comprehensively assessed the electrochemical performance of peptide materials.
