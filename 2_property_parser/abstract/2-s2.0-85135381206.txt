Compared with most transition metal based electrode materials, 2D Mn+1XnTx has high conductivity and good solvent compatibility. However, its low energy density hinders its application as supercapacitior electrode for electrochemical energy storage applications. Herein, the interface-pillared of Fe-MOF (MIL-100(Fe)) onto Ti3C2Tx MXene layer, which provide rich electrochemical active sites, is achieved, and the MOF nanospheres with MXene nanosheets are subsequently converser into three dimensional multilayer porous nanostructures through the chemical bond couping. Therefore, the MOF nanospheres are anchored between the nansheets of MXene, enabling the fast ion transportation in the three dimensional nanostructures. Menanwhile, the MOF nanospheres prevent the aggregation of MXene nanosheets, and the laminar structure is maintained for more redox reaction sites within the hybrid electrodes through fast charge–discharge cycles. As a result, the MIL-100(Fe)/Ti3C2Tx MXene electrode displays superior energy density (85.53 Wh kg−1), which is much higher than the other MXene-based electrodes as far as we know. This design strategy of 2D hybrid electrodes opens up a new way for the commercial application of high perfermance supercapacitor.
