Ship electric propulsion system has great advantages in practical application. Single energy storage device is difficult to deal with power fluctuation of distributed generation units and the load fluctuation, which pose a great challenge to stable operation of the power grid. In this paper, a four-level linkage energy management system is designed by introducing logic link in coordinated control of the charging and discharging process for two kinds of energy storage devices. Based on MATLAB/Simulink, an energy management system model of solar airboat electric propulsion system and hybrid energy storage device is established. Charging and discharging power response, internal power distribution and state parameter control process of the hybrid energy storage device are analyzed respectively. The results show that the maximum overshoot of the charge and discharge control is less than 30%, the maximum adjustment response time of the hybrid energy storage device to the load fluctuation is less than 2.5 seconds, the continuous discharge output power fluctuation of the lithium battery is less than 5%, and the discharge voltage change rate is within 3.5%, the super capacitor can achieve transient response to high-frequency components of load power fluctuations.
