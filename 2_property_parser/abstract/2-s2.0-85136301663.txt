The growing demand for energy, coupled with the environmental pollution induced by traditional energy production, is pushing to find solutions for renewable energy storage. Herein, hierarchical porous carbon with a high specific surface area (2449.6 m2/g) has been synthesized from poplar wood chips by the molten salt activation. Simultaneously, a gel polymer electrolyte with excellent mechanical properties, thermal stability and biodegradability was prepared from Î±-cellulose. A simple all-solid-state supercapacitor was fabricated via hierarchical porous structure carbon electrodes and a gel polymer electrolyte, and the resultant device exhibited a high specific capacitance (133.0 F/g at 0.5 A/g) and an ideal capacitance retention rate (90.4% after 10,000 cycles). In addition, the device presented superior energy density (18.5 Wh/kg) and power density (500.0 W/kg) as compared with other supercapacitors. Interestingly, the gel polymer electrolyte showed a favorable natural degradation rate under aerobic sludge condition. Therefore, this fabricated electric double layer capacitor is expected to be used as a green and sustainable electronic device with amiable economic availability and environmental friendliness.
