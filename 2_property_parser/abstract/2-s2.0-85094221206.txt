Bottom-up-synthesized graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with excellent electronic properties are promising materials for energy storage systems. Herein, we report bottom-up-synthesized GNR films employed as electrode materials for micro-supercapacitors (MSCs). The micro-device delivers an excellent volumetric capacitance and an ultra-high power density. The electrochemical performance of MSCs could be correlated with the charge carrier mobility within the differently employed GNRs, as determined by pump-probe terahertz spectroscopy studies.
