Carbon hollow sphere encapsulated Ni3Se4 (Ni3Se4@CHS) nanocrystals are prepared using the Ni-soc-MOF by pyrolysis and further selenization. Ni3Se4@CHS exhibits a capacitance of 1720 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and a capacitance retention of 97% after 6000 cycles at 5 A g−1. Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitor of Ni3Se4@CHS//AC displays a wide potential window of 1.6 V, an energy density of 45.2 W h kg−1 at a power density of 800 W kg−1, and excellent cycling stability (89% capacitance retention) after 5000 cycles. Overall, this work establishes a significant step to synthesize a new carbon-based material with appreciable capacitance and long cycling durability for potential applications in energy storage and beyond.
