Graphene and its analog, two-dimensional (2D) layered molybdenum disulphide (MoS2), have been used for ‘clean energy’ applications in the last several years because of their remarkable electrochemical, optical, and magnetic properties. Their huge success and application potential in various fields has led to the investigation of new 2D nanomaterials which cross the boundaries of existing graphene-based devices. The combination of chemically inert graphene and redox-active MoS2 in a single electrode is providing new opportunities to improve the performance of energy devices and circumvent existing limitations. This article updates our previous review on advances in graphene-MoS2 hybrids for energy-oriented applications. In particular, a summary of recent developments in the synthesis of the graphene-MoS2 hybrids, with an emphasis on energy storage and hydrogen production, is provided. Future challenges and opportunities associated with the development of 2D hybrid materials, and their applications in energy storage systems, are discussed.
