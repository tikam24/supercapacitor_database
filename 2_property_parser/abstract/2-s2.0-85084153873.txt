In this study, graphite oxide was reduced into reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (rGO NSs) by microwave with metal acetate of nickel and palladium to form the rGO-carbon nanotubes (CNTs) containing palladium (Pd) and nickel oxide (NiO) nanocomposite (Pd/NiO@rGO/CNTs nanocomposite). The synthesized nanocomposite presents remarkable performance for supercapacitor application especially in stability, exhibiting specific capacitance of 24 F/g at scan rate of 10 mV/s and excellent capacitance retention of 95% after 500 consecutive CV cycles at scan rate of 100 mV/s.
