One-dimensional core-shell sepiolite/polypyrrole (SEP/PPy) nanocomposites were fabricated by in situ chemical oxidation polymerization. The coating PPy layer on organic modified sepiolite (OSEP) is more homogeneous comparing to SEP. The fabrication mechanisms have also been investigated in detail. The interactions between the radical species (N+) of PPy and the silanol groups (Si-OH) on SEP fiber had been confirmed by Fourier transform infrared and UV-vis spectroscpies. When OSEP/PPy nanocomposites were utilized as supercapacitor electrode material, the maximum specific capacitance of 164.9 F/g could be achieved. Furthermore, the rectangle-like shape of cyclic voltammetry curves revealed that the OSEP/PPy nanocomposites had electrical double-layer capacitance property. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy indicated that OSEP/PPy nanocomposites have smaller resistance which is favor for the charge transfer. Â© 2013 American Chemical Society.
