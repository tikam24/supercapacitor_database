Porous Co(OH)2 nano-flake thin films were prepared by a potential-controlled electro-deposition technique at various deposition voltage (-0.75, -1.0, -1.2, and -1.4 V) on Ti-mesh substrates for supercapacitor application. The potential of electrode was controlled to regulate the film thickness and the amount of Co(OH)2 nano-flake on the titanium substrate. The film thickness was shown to reach the maximum value of 34 Î¼m at -1.4 V of electrode potential, where 17.2 g of Co(OH)2 was deposited on the substrate. The specific discharge capacitances were measured to be 226, 370, 720, and 1008 mF cm-2 in the 1st cycle corresponding to the films which were formed at -0.75, -1.0, -1.2, and -1.4 V of electrode potentials, respectively. Then the discharge capacities were decreased to be 206, 349, 586 and 866 mF/cm2, where the persistency rates were 91, 94, 81, and 86%, respectively.
