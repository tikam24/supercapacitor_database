RGO/FeS composites on Fe foil were successfully prepared via a facile one-pot hydrothermal method, in which Fe foil acted as Fe source of FeS, reductant of GO and subsequent current collector. As-prepared RGO/FeS was directly served as the electrode of supercapacitor which exhibited a high specific capacitance of 900 mF cm−2 (300 F g−1) and a superior cyclability of 97.5% maximum capacity retention after 2000 cycles. Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was assembled using Ni(OH)2 as the positive electrode and RGO/FeS as the negative electrode. This ASC delivered a high power density of 20930.4 W kg−1 with an energy density of 11.63 Wh kg−1, or a high energy density of 27.91 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 2093.18 W kg−1, indicating RGO/FeS is a promising negative electrode of supercapacitor.
