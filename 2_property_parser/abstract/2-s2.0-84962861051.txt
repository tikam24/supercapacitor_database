Three-dimensional (3D) electrodes hold great potential for supercapacitors (SCs) due to their unique architectures and prominent electrochemical properties. Herein, a kind of 3D FeOOH/reduced graphene oxide/Ni foam (FeOOH/rGO/NF) electrode with remarkable capacitive performance has been developed as a new anode for asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs). Benefiting from the improved conductivity and increased surface area, the as-prepared 3D FeOOH/rGO/NF electrode exhibits a high areal capacitance of 406.5 mF cm-2 at 10 mV s-1. Moreover, when using the as-prepared 3D FeOOH/rGO/NF electrode as anode, a high-performance ASC device with a maximum volumetric energy density of 0.48 mWh cm-3 and excellent cycling stability is achieved.
