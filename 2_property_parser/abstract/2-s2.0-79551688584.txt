Carbon aerogels were prepared by polycondensation of resorcinol with formaldehyde in ambient conditions. The effect of resorcinol-to-catalyst ratio (R/C ratio) on volume shrinkage, BET surface area, and electrochemical property was investigated by changing R/C ratio from 50 to 2000. Carbon aerogel prepared at R/C ratio of 500 showed less than 2% of volume shrinkage and the highest BET surface area (706 m2/g). Specific capacitance of carbon aerogel prepared at R/C ratio of 500 was found to be 81 F/g in 1M H2SO4 electrolyte. Cobalt-doped carbon aerogels were then prepared by an impregnation method with a variation of cobalt content, and their performance was investigated. Among the samples prepared, 7 wt% cobalt-doped carbon aerogel showed the highest capacitance (100 F/g) and the most stable cyclability. The enhanced capacitance of cobalt-doped carbon aerogel was attributed to the faradaic redox reactions of cobalt oxide. Â© 2010 Korean Institute of Chemical Engineers, Seoul, Korea.
