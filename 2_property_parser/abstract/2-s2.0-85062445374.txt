Ternary nanocomposites of Cu x Zn y Sn z S (x+y+z) are considered as an emerging potential candidate as electrode materials for energy storage devices due to the considerable interlayer spaces and tunnels in its crystal structures with excellent conducting ability. Recently, this nanocomposite used as anode material for Li-ion battery has been reported, but there is limited research on its application in supercapacitors which is considered a complementary energy storage device to battery. In this work, flower-like Cu 5 Sn 2 S 7 /ZnS and pristine Cu 5 Sn 2 S 7 nanocomposite were prepared via a facile hydrothermal method. The electrochemical tests showed that the Cu 5 Sn 2 S 7 /ZnS nanocomposite exhibited better performance than pristine Cu 5 Zn 2 S 7 , suggesting that the existence of ZnS could significantly enhance the electrochemical performance of Cu 5 Sn 2 S 7 , with the good capacitance of 200 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g. Furthermore 170 F/g was obtained at the large current density of 10 A/g. Supercapacitors demonstrated energy density of 11.08 Wh/kg with power density 461 W/kg or 9.67 Wh/kg at power density of 4615 W/kg.
