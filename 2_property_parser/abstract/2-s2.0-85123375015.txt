Graphitized carbon nanofibers (CNFs) are the allotropic forms of carbon that offer exceptional electrical conductivity, high aspect ratio, large surface-to-volume ratio, flexibility, mechanical robustness, and structural stability. These properties render CNFs as useful materials in energy applications, including water electrocatalysis and electrochemical energy storage devices (EESDs). Graphitized CNFs manifest huge versatility in EESDs and have been employed as electrode materials, as supports for other electrode materials, and conductive additives. This perspective summarizes the production methods, structural aspects, and energy applications of graphitized CNFs. Different design strategies have been employed to produce CNFs with diverse and distinct morphologies and structures. Their fabrication methods, along with precursors and dopants or cocatalysts, impact the overall structural, functional, and topographical properties. Recent developments on the state-of-the-art interests of graphitic CNFs in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries, vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs), supercapacitors, and water splitting have explored the many possibilities in energy sectors. The assembly and functioning of CNFs in water splitting and EESDs as well as primary challenges are discussed in this perspective.
