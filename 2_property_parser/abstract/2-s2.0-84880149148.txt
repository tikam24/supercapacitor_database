Mesoporous nanostructured α-manganese dioxide (MN-α-MnO 2) powders in a sponge-like three-dimensional network have been successfully synthesized in high yields in a simple, template-free manner at room temperature. Its unique structure has been found to be related to the glucose solution rather than to the KMnO4 solution. A possible mechanism for the formation of MN-α-MnO2 by the oxidation of MnO2 precursors cross-linked by glucose networks is proposed that is supported by experimental results. The electrochemical studies showed that MN-α-MnO2 exhibits good electrochemical properties in 1 M Na2SO4 due to its high specific surface area (ca. 220 m2 g-1) and proper pore size distributions (ca. 5 nm), which indicates that it has potential for use as a high-performance supercapacitor due to its good electrochemical performance, low cost and environmental friendliness. Three-dimensional network mesoporous nanostructured α-MnO2 with a high specific surface area and narrow pore size distribution has been fabricated in high yields without a template at room temperature.
