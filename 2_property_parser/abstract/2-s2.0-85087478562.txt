With the development of distributed power generation, power distribution and control strategies of distribution networks have become hotspots of research. In order to suppress the system power fluctuations caused by distributed generation, hybrid energy storage solutions using energy storage units (ESs) with different power characteristics are adopted to stabilize DC bus voltage fluctuations and optimize the operation status of batteries and super capacitors Distributed control strategy for hybrid energy storage system (HESS), in which the battery unit and super capacitor battery unit are set as slack terminals for droop control. Different types of energy storage units choose different sag coefficients. Aiming at the problem of SOC equilibrium during the operation of multi-battery energy storage units, a variable droop coefficient control strategy based on SOC was designed to adjust the power allocation twice. In order to verify the proposed method, a MATLAB / Simulink model is established, and simulation results verify that compared with traditional droop control, the improved variable droop coefficient control strategy can achieve multi-cell SOC equalization and super capacitor SOC fast recovery.
