RGO/TiO2NTs/Ti electrodes with high surface area and good capacitive characteristics were prepared by simple electrochemical reduction of graphene oxide (GO) onto the previously formed TiO2 nanotubes. Microstructure studies show that reduced graphene oxide (RGO) having high surface area has been deposited onto the TiO2NT arrays. The electrochemical capacitive behaviors of the obtained electrodes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge studies, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 1 M H2SO4 solution. The electrochemical data demonstrated that the electrodes displayed specific capacitance of 410 F g−1 at the current density of 50 A g−1 and specific capacitance retention of ca. 85 % after 10 days of being used in electrochemical experiments, indicating to be promising electroactive materials for supercapacitors.
