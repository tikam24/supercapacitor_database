Molybdenum nickel-cobalt sulfide (MoNiCoS) microspheres have been electrodeposited on the Ni foam (MoNiCoS@NF) under different concentrations for evaluating its effect on the morphology and capacitance of the composites. The microstructure of the obtained microspheres has been investigated using XRD, SEM, TEM, and XPS. The as-obtained MoNiCoS microspheres exhibit a high specific capacitance of 1,472 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 along with excellent cycling stability of 98% after 5,000 cycles. An asymmetric supercapacitor device using MoNiCoS@NF as the positive electrode and AC/rGO as the negative electrode shows high specific energy of 146.8 Wh kg−1 at a specific power of 482.2 W kg−1.
