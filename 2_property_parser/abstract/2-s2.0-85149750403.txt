It is necessary to develop hierarchical structured materials with excellent electrochemical characteristics and stability for energy storage. In this work, we synthesize a novel structure of ZnCo2O4/Ti3C2 on Ni foam by a simple hydrothermal method. The frameworks accelerates the kinetic of the electrochemical reaction and promotes the transfer of electrons. The cycling stability of the device maintains 108.2% after 4000 cycles. The result indicates that the prepared sample is an excellent candidate material for energy storage.
