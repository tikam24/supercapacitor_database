Polymer electrolyte(PE)s have been playing a major role in almost all modern electrochemical devices. Since their introduction, a great deal of research work has been done to uplift their performance and as a result, there are several milestones in the history of PEs. This review paper is mainly targeting the PEs based on ionic liquids (ILs). The main reason for the emergence of IL based PE is the ever increasing focus on safety issues as well as low ambient temperature of PEs. Desired electrochemical properties, less toxicity and the sound cooperativeness are some features of attraction towards these ILs. With the enormous amount of research work done on the area, it is an absolute necessity to summarize the outcomes and the trends to understand basics of the IL-PEs. In this paper, an introduction on setting up of background for PEs and IL based PEs is presented in section 1 and section 2 is dedicated to the history of PEs. Sections 3 and 4 will address the IL based PEs and their preparation techniques respectively. Properties and their characterization techniques are presented in section 5. Section 6 describes the optimization methods followed by applications and novel approaches in section 7.
