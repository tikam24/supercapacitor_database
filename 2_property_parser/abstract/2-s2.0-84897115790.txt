Porous α-Fe2O3 nanostructures have been synthesized by sol-gel route. The effect of preparation temperature on the morphology, structure, and electrochemical stability upon cycling has been studied for supercapacitor application. The discharge capacitance of α-Fe2O3 prepared at 300°C is 193 F g -1, when the electrodes are cycled in 0.5 M Na2SO 3 at a specific current of 1 A g-1. The capacitance retention after 1,000 cycles is about 92 % of the initial capacitance at a current density of 2 A g-1. The high discharge capacitance as well as stability of α-Fe2O3 electrodes is attributed to large surface area and porosity of the material. There is a decrease in specific capacitance (SC) on increasing the preparation temperature. As iron oxides are inexpensive, the synthetic route adopted for α-Fe2O3 in the present study is convenient and the SC is high with good cycling stability, the porous α-Fe2O3 is a potential material for supercapacitors. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
