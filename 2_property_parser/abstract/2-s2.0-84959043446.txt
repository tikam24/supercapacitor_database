In this paper authors present a novel voltage measuring system that allows to measure the voltage of each cell for series connected supercapacitors (SCs). Proposed system is based on isolated DC/DC converter with multiple outputs that have equal voltages, which serve as reference voltage for each series connected supercapacitor. Two operation modes of the system are analyzed. Functionality of the system is verified with its prototype, which allows to measure voltage for series connected 8 SCs.
