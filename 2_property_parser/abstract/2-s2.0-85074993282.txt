This paper presents an overview of unique carbon nanostructure graphene nanoribbon (GNR). GNR is a thin elongated strip of sp2-bonded carbon atoms with a narrow width of â‰¤10 nm. The electronic, mechanical, thermal, chemical, and magnetic properties of GNR make it an attractive nanofiller in polymeric nanocomposite. Polyaniline, poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(vinylidene fluoride), poly(vinyl alcohol), polystyrene, polyethylene, epoxy, and polyamide have been explored with GNR so far. Despite of outstanding potential of polymer/GNR nanocomposite, not much research is found in this area. Few application areas of polymer/GNR nanocomposite discovered till now are related to sensor, supercapacitor, fuel cell, and electromagnetic interference shielding materials.
