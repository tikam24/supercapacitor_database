Herein, we report the fabrication of α-Fe2O3/TiO2 hybrid structures in the form of microrods, microtubes and nanorods by co-precipitation method and via wet chemical method. The combination of α-Fe2O3 and mixed phase (anatase and rutile) TiO2 as hybrid structure not only enhances the light absorption ability but also facilitates charge separation resulting effective dye degradation. The detailed studies of photocatalytic dye degradation on α-Fe2O3/TiO2 system were carried out to understand the mechanism. The α-Fe2O3/TiO2 hybrid nanorods exhibited the best performances as photocatalyst as well as supercapacitor electrode with excellent stability in both cases. The α-Fe2O3/TiO2 hybrid nanorods exhibited efficient 88% dye degradation after 120 min as photocatalyst and a specific capacitance value of 478.40 F g−1 was achieved at current density of 1 A g−1 with a capacity retention value of 92% at 2 A g−1 after 1000 cycles. It is anticipated that the anisotropic structure as well as the synergistic effect of α-Fe2O3 and TiO2 make the hybrid material a promising photocatalyst as well as potential electrode for supercapacitor.
