Take the msp430f5529 single chip of TI company as the control chip and the wireless charging device as the core to coordinate the other modules. The system consists of transmitting module, receiving module, energy storage module, motor driving module, and sampling module. The transmission module adopts voltage type single-phase half bridge inverter circuit, and uses Faraday electromagnetic induction law at the output end to transfer the energy to the secondary coil, and generates series resonance by adjusting PWM wave frequency; the induction current generated by the secondary coil changes into DC through the rectifier circuit to charge the supercapacitor, and the capacitor connects the tps63020 voltage stabilizing module to supply power to the motor; through msp430f5529 the single chip microcomputer samples the voltage to decide whether to control the car to start moving.
