Efficient and sustainable thermal management systems are crucial to ensure thermal stability and a long lifespan of supercapacitors. In this work, an entropy generation analysis based on an improved coupled model is implemented for the first time, with the aim to facilitate the design and optimization of the supercapacitor thermal management systems. Entropy generation analysis accurately quantifies the irreversibilities due to heat transfer and fluid friction of the supercapacitor module, allowing for direct identification of the causes of inefficiency that cannot be achieved by the conventional energy analysis. The improved coupled model incorporates a one-dimensional electrochemical model and three-dimensional thermal models at cell and module levels. The optimal thermal management scheme of the supercapacitor module is obtained by the multiparametric optimization based on four evaluation criteria derived from the coupled energy and entropy generation analyses. Results indicate that the supercapacitor module with lower entropy generation and higher heat transfer rate can be achieved with the geometry of transverse pitch equal to longitudinal pitch twice the diameter with the 293.15 K cooling water. This work provides the advanced fundamental and computational frameworks for the development of next-generation, energy-smart thermal management systems for clean and renewable energy conversion and storage modules.
