The micro mulberry leaf-like CoO@Ni3S2 was prepared by hydrothermal and electrodeposition methods. CoO nanorods as a framework can enhance conductivity and improve rate retention during charge/discharge process. Ni3S2 nanosheets as a secondary structure can provide abundant active sites to increase specific capacitance. The overall mulberry leaf-like construction can accelerate ions transport in electrolyte, increase contact area between electrolyte and electrode, and utilize active sites. CoO@Ni3S2 can integrate advantages of binary compounds and dimensional structure to achieve effective electron transfer and electrolyte diffusion. CoO@Ni3S2 supercapacitor can gain specific capacitance of 2325 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with capacity retention rate of 88%.
