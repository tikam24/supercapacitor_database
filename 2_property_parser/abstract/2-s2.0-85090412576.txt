In this introductory report, composites and copolymers combining intrinsically conducting polymers and redox-active organic molecules, suggested as active masses without additional binder and conducting agents for supercapacitor electrodes, possibly using the advantageous properties of both constituents, are presented. A brief overview of the few reported examples of the use of such copolymers, composites, and comparable combinations of organic molecules and carbon supports is given. For comparison a few related reports on similar materials without intrinsically conducting polymers are included.
