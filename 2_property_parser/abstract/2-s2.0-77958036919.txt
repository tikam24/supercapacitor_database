Vertically Aligned Carbon Nanotube (VACNT) - based electrochemical double layer capacitors, called "supercapacitors" are intermediate systems that can potentially bridge the power/energy gap between traditional dielectric capacitors (high power) and batteries (high power density). However, their future is uncertain because of technical stumbling block in their fabrication related to the post-growth manipulations of VACNTs. This problem was addressed in the current work through design of synthesis process capable of depositing VACNTs on conducting metal oxide surface at reduced growth temperature by controlling the graphene layer formation and the catalyst deactivation via catalytic oxidation.
