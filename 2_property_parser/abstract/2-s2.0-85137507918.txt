Spherical-shaped zinc cobaltite (ZnCo2O4) nanostructures have been formed by a simple sol–gel method using citric acid as a chelating agent. As-prepared samples annealed at different temperature ranges (200–900 °C) with various morphologies, crystalline nature, vibrational, as well as different physicochemical properties and surface area are effectively analysed. Amongst them, two zinc cobaltite samples annealed at 600 °C (ZCO-6) and 900 °C (ZCO-9) were examined for electrochemical behaviours, such as CV, GCD and EIS, using the prepared working electrodes. At high annealed temperature entirely removes organic residue in ZCO and then increases of Zn2+ ions atomic ratios are effective in morphology and crystalline. ZCO-9 exhibits a high specific capacitance of 255.22 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in CV and the capacitance retention value is 90.56% after 2500 cycles of charge–discharge at the current density of 4 A g−1. The study results conclude that ZCO-9 electrode can be utilised as a suitable electrode in supercapacitors.
