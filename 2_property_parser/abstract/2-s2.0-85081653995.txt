This article presents an influence of using an energy storage device in order to reduce the oscillation of voltage and power of the underground traction substation and to limit the peak value of power consumed from it. Using the accumulator has an indirect beneficial influence on the environment because of the efficient energy use. In the work a simulation research of the underground traction substation and a substation equipped with supercapacitors was conducted in the communications peak and beyond it. Simulation studies were performed in toolbox Simscape Electrical formerly called SimPowerSystems and SimElectronics from Simulink products family.
