The research results of the supercapacitors influence on the voltage dip magnitude and duration in DC auxiliary power systems of substations were presented. The several variants of the supercapacitors' placement in DC network were discussed. The estimation of the fulfillment of the electromagnetic compatibility requirements with the consideration of voltage dips in DC network of substations during the short-circuit faults was made. The recommendations of the supercapacitors application for the enhancing of the operational reliability of substations' DC auxiliaries were proposed.
