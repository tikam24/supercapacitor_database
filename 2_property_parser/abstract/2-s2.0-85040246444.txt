Successful modification of surface properties of a nanocomposite electrode is prerequisite to enhancing the overall performance of electrochemical supercapacitors. The present study was designed to describe the microstructural and electrochemical characteristics of a new composite electrode assembled by activated carbon (AC) powder (as a host) and copper precursor (as a guest) using liquid phase plasma. The fabrication processes were conducted by changing plasma discharge time from 30 to 90 min in the presence and absence of (thermal) oxidation. We observed that merging plasma and oxidation treatments raised the content of copper oxide nanoparticles precipitated (evenly) on the AC surface, along with oxygen. A mixed valence state of copper oxides (in the forms of Cuo, Cu2O, and CuO) was found in different composites with and without oxidation, where CuO and Cuo affected a specific capacitance in positive and negative ways, respectively. This led to the difference of electrochemical stability and resistance among the assembled composites. For instance, the best cycling performance was observed in the plasma-treated composite for 90 min with oxidation, whereas that of 60 min without oxidation recorded the lowest resistance. Therefore, a proper balance between the capacitance and resistance appears to be required for effective fabrication of the supercapacitor electrode, specifically in cases involving copper oxides.
