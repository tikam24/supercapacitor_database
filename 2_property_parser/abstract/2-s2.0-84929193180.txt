Electrochemically synthesized tin ion (Sn2+) doped poly(3-methylthiophene) (P3MeT:Sn) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT:Sn) on pencil graphite electrode (PGE) were prepared to utilize as the electrode materials for supercapacitor applications. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) method was employed for the preparation of the electrodes (PGE/P3MeT:Sn and PGE/PEDOT:Sn). The morphologies of the electrodes were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Electrochemical properties of the electrodes were examined by CV, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) and repeating chronopotentiometry (RCP) in acetonitrile (ACN) solution containing 0.10 M lithium perchlorate (LiClO4). PGE/P3MeT:Sn has better electrochemical performance than PGE/PEDOT:Sn. Maximum capacitances of PGE/P3MeT:Sn and PGE/PEDOT:Sn are 181.41 and 137.89 F g-1 at a scan rate of 10 m V s-1, respectively. Additionally, PGE/P3MeT:Sn and PGE/PEDOT:Sn show good charge/discharge stability with the retention of 92 and 83% in electrochemical performance, respectively.
