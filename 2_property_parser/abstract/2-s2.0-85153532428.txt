In order to study the effect of topological structure of electrodes material on their supercapacitive performance, the different ratio of hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties were designed in the redox-active triblock copolymers PFcn-b-PEG-b-PFcn (n = 10, 17, 28). And then, PFcn-b-PEG-b-PFcn coated on Ni foam (PFcn-b-PEG-b-PFcn/Ni, n = 10, 17, 28) was applied as electrode materials for supercapacitors. Result displaying that with the value n increased from 10 to 28, the specific capacitances of PFcn-b-PEG-b-PFcn increased. That is to say, the capacitive behaviors of PFcn-b-PEG-b-PFcn could be greatly regulated by topological structure. Among the three copolymers, the as-prepared PFc28-b-PEG-b-PFc28 possessed a specific capacitance up to 358 F g−1 calculated from discharge curve with current density 1 A g−1. Further, the cycle stability test for PFc28-b-PEG-b-PFc28 was performed and the results show that the capacitance decay is only 5% over 2000 cycles, indicating its long cycle life. The reasons for the high capacitance performance of PFc28-b-PEG-b-PFc28 are due to the ferrocenyl groups with a favorable redox environment and faster electron transport and better ion diffusion, which make the material fully utilized. Furthermore, PFc28-b-PEG-b-PFc28 was successfully used to assemble a simple asymmetric solid-state supercapacitor. In summary, the topological structure of the PFcn-b-PEG-b-PFcn effect on their supercapacitive performance, that is, with the value n increasing, their specific capacitances increase. Can be looked forward to, the PFcn-b-PEG-b-PFcn could be as promising candidates towards high performance electrodes for pseudocapacitive supercapacitors.
