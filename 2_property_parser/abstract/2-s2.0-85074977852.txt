This paper reports for the first time the experimental demonstration of a wireless sensor node only powered by an aeroacoustic energy-harvesting device, meant to be installed on an aircraft outside skin. Aeroacoustic noise is generated on purpose to serve as a means of converting mechanical energy from high velocity airflow into electrical energy. Results related to the physical characterization of the energy conversion process are presented. The proposed aeroacoustic transducer prototype, consisting in a rectangular cavity fitted with a piezoelectric membrane, is shown to deliver up to 2 mW AC power under Mach 0.5 airflow. Optimized power management electronics has been designed to interface with the transducer, including a self-powered Synchronized Switch Harvesting on Inductor (SSHI) interface circuit and an efficient buck-boost DC/DC converter. The design of micropower auxiliary circuits adds functionality while preserving high efficiency. This circuit stores energy in supercapacitors and is able to deliver a net output DC power close to 1 mW. A fully autonomous system has been implemented and tested, successfully demonstrating aeroacoustic power generation by supplying a battery-free wireless datalogger in conditions representative of an actual flight.
