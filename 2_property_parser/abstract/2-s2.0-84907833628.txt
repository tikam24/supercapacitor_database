Driven by the environmental problems and energy crisis, the development of clean and renewable energy materials as well as their devices is urgently demanded. Supercapacitors, also called electrochemical capacitors, which store energy using either ion adsorption or fast surface redox reactions, are supposed to be a promising candidate for alternative electrical energy storage devices due to their high power density, exceptional cycle life, and low maintenance cost. The performance of supercapacitors is highly dependent on the properties of electrode materials. Graphene based materials exhibit great potential application for supercapacitors because of their unique structure and excellent intrinsic physical properties. Introducing porous structures to graphene is an effective strategy to obtain high surface area and high specific capacitance. In this review, we provide a brief summary of the recent developments about the synthesis and application of porous graphene materials for supercapacitors.
