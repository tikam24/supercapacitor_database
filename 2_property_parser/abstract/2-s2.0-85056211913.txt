A Graphene/Carbon Nanotube/Bacterial Cellulose (RGO/CNT/BC) architecture with excellent flexibility and high conductivity is designed as substrate for loading polypyrrole (PPy), which brings good electrochemical and mechanical properties. The resultant PPy/RGO/CNT/BC, fabricated by vacuum filtration and electropolymerization, performs favorable areal capacitance (715 mF cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2), good rate performance (495 mF cm−2 at 30 mA cm−2), acceptable cycle stability (remained 86.85% after 5000 charge/discharge cycles) and remarkable mechanical strength (57.7 MPa). Furthermore, the flexible symmetric supercapacitor assembled by PPy/RGO/CNT/BC exhibits energy density (0.0328 mW h cm−2) and power density (12 mW cm−2). The assembled supercapacitor under bending condition behaves stable electrochemical performance. The RGO/CNT/BC structure is substantiated to be promising for wearable electronics.
