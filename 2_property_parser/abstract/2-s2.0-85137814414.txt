Developing an energy management strategy (EMS) is an important requirement to satisfy the load power demand for a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) hybrid system under different working conditions. For this objective, this paper proposes an EMS to control the power distribution between the PEMFC, battery (BAT), and supercapacitor (SC) and regulate the DC bus voltage for matching the load power demand. In this strategy, fuzzy logic rules (FLRs) and low-pass filters (LPFs) are utilized to determine the reference currents for energy sources based on their dynamic response. In addition, current and voltage control loops are designed to provide the appropriate gains for compensators that can maintain a stable voltage on the DC bus. Finally, simulations are conducted in the MATLAB/Simulink environment to validate and compare the effectiveness of the proposed strategy with others. The simulation results present that the proposed EMS achieves the highest distributed power accuracy with an error of (Formula presented.) W, while reducing the DC bus voltage ripple by 1% under various load working conditions in comparison to the other approaches.
