In pursuing higher energy density, without compromising the power density of supercapacitor platforms, the application of an advanced 2D nanomaterial is utilized to maximize performance. Antimonene, for the first time, is characterized as a material for applications in energy storage, being applied as an electrode material as the basis of a supercapacitor. Antimonene is shown to significantly improve the energy storage capabilities of a carbon electrode in both cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charging. Antimonene demonstrates remarkable performance with a capacitance of 1578 F g−1, with a high charging current density of 14 A g−1. Hence, antimonene is shown to be a highly promising material for energy storage applications. The system also demonstrates a highly competitive energy and power densities of 20 mW h kg−1 and 4.8 kW kg−1, respectively. In addition to the excellent charge storing abilities, antimonene shows good cycling capabilities.
