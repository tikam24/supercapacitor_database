Redox-active graphene/polypyrrole composite aerogel with well-defined 3D porous structure are prepared by one-step hydrothermal method using p-benzoquinone (BQ) and humic acid (HA) as redox-active agent and dopant. The synergistic effect of BQ and HA enables the successful ordered polymerization of pyrrole, the reduction of graphene oxide and the effective doping effect of the composite aerogel. The constructed well-defined 3D porous structure decorated by redox-active assembly of BQ and HA is able to boost the fast ion diffusion rate and faradaic reaction at the surface of the composite aerogel electrode. The prepared GBAP-2 (mass ratio of HA:BQ ≈ 1.6) aerogel exhibits superior specific capacitance of 528 F/g at 1A/g and good rate capability. The assembled hybrid device demonstrated maximum energy of 67.75 Wh kg−1 at 900 W kg−1 and good cyclic and flexible stability, suggesting a good candidate for use in flexible electronics.
