Keeping the wind power constant is essential for the large-scale integration of wind power into electric power system. In this study, we classify the wind power fluctuation and propose a method of suppressing the fluctuant wind power by an Active-Parallel Hybrid Energy Storage System (APHESS). The APHESS consists of a battery, a supercapacitor and two charge-discharge controllers. By designing the configuration logically, the APHESS obtains the enhanced energy storage performance and the low investment cost. In order to realize the wind power suppression, the method of controlling the APHESS to exchange power precisely with the wind power system is developed in this study. For the purpose of making the battery and supercapacitor balance, respectively different kinds of fluctuation classified in this study, the power within APHESS is allocated reasonably between the battery and the supercapacitor. By the method proposed in this study, the fluctuant wind power can be balanced effectively and the service life of energy storage system can be prolonged.
