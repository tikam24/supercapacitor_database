In this manuscript, we are reporting for the first time one dimensional (1D) cerium hydrogen phosphate (Ce(HPO4)2.xH2O) electrode material for supercapacitor application. In short, a simple hydrothermal technique was employed to prepare Ce(HPO4)2.xH2O. The maximum surface area of 82 m2 g−1 was obtained from nitrogen sorption isotherm. SEM images revealed Ce(HPO4)2.xH2O exhibited a nanorod-like structure along with particles and clusters. The maximum specific capacitance of 114 F g−1 was achieved at 0.2 A g−1 current density for Ce(HPO4)/NF electrode material in a three-electrode configuration. Furthermore, the fabricated symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) based on Ce(HPO4)2.xH2O//Ce(HPO4)2.xH2O demonstrates reasonable specific energy (2.08 Wh kg−1), moderate specific power (499.88 W kg−1), and outstanding cyclic durability (retains 92.7% of its initial specific capacitance after 5000 GCD cycles).
