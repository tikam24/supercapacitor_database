The supercapacitor and batteries have different constituent chemistry and follow different mechanisms for their operation. But both of them have nearly similar manufacturing and cell construction processes (Conway in Electrochemical Supercapacitors. Springer, US, 1999). Likewise batteries, the supercapacitor comprises (i) a pair of electrodes containing active electrode materials adhered to a suitable current collector with terminal for connections to the electronic circuit, (ii) a porous membrane that physically and electrically separates both the electrode preventing from electrical shorting, (iii) electrolytes containing the charged ions generally soaked with the membrane separator, and (iv) packaging components that make to place all the above components at their respective positions in a single cell avoiding leakage (Samantara and Ratha in materials development for active/passive components of a supercapacitor. Springer, 2018).
