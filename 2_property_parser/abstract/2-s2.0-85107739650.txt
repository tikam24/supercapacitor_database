The electrochemical performance of the Faradaic battery-type binary metal oxide electrodes is dependent on the desirable architecture and the optimal cationic ratio. Herein, we report one-dimensional nanowire-like bimetallic spinel NixCo3-xO4 (NCO) electrode materials for high performance hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) applications. This unique nanowire architecture is beneficial for providing abundant exposed active sites onto the large accessible surface area, which results in facilitating ion transporting pathways. Remarkably, the optimal NCO electrode with the ratio of Ni/Co of 1 to 1 (NCO11) achieves the maximum specific capacitance of 1033 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and the excellent rate capability of 74.55% at 30 A g−1, far exceeding those of their single counterparts. Furthermore, the as-assembled HSCs integrating NCO11 and AC electrodes deliver large energy and power densities of 41.54 W h kg−1 and 44.95 kW kg−1 with excellent cyclic retention (96.12%).
