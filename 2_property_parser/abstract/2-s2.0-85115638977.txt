A novel supercapacitor based on cerium sulfide and graphene oxide nanocomposite was synthesized with high power density by hydrothermal method in the existence (presence) of Graphene oxide (GO). The Graphene based materials have been assumed to be auspicious candidate for renewable energy applications as due to its unique monolayer bonding configuration of graphene oxide it provides large surface area to metal oxide or metal sulfides that enhance the capacitance of composite of GO/metal sulfide. Characterization of the prepared GO/Ce2S3 composite samples was done by XRD, SEM, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy. Cyclic volumetric (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and the electrochemical impedance were performed in 2 M KOH solution to investigate electrochemical measurements. Electrochemical characterization of composite revealed that by introducing the rare earth sulfide in GO, the power density of material increases more than 3 times at a current density of 0.3Agâˆ’1using GCD graph. The specific capacitance of composite at scan rate of 10 mV/s is 53 F/g which is comparable to GO (59 F/g) but on the other hand the power density of composite is 9 times greater than power density of GO. The above mentioned characteristics make this fabricated composite to be more compatible candidate for electrochemical application with high power and energy density.
