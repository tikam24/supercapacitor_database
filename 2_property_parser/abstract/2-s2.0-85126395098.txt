This paper presents a novel silicon material, two-dimensional (2D) siloxene sheets intercalated with 2D-MoS2 based solid-state symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) for an energy harvester-storage system. The 2D/2D intercalated heterostructure with controllable interlayer distance has achieved superior charge storage ability for the inertial rotary energy harvester. The designed energy storage system exhibited excellent performance with a maximum device-specific capacitance of 133.5 F g-1, whose energy has been successfully used for powering 258 green LEDs. The siloxene-based composites have shown promising application towards the future energy harvester-storage system.
