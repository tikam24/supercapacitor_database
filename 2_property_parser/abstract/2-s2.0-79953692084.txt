Poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and graphite oxide (GO)/PEDOT composites (GPTs) doped with poly(sodium styrene sulfate) (PSS) were synthesized by in situ polymerization in aqueous media. The electrochemical capacitance performances of GO, PEDOT-PSS, and GPTs as electrode materials were investigated. The GPTs had a higher specific capacitance of 108 F/g than either composite constituent (11 F/g for GO and 87 F/g for PEDOT-PSS); this was attributable to its high electrical conductivity and the layer-within/on-layer composite structure. Such an increase demonstrated that the synergistic combination of GO and PEDOT-PSS had advantages over the sum of the individual components. On the basis of cycle-life tests, the capacitance retention of about 78% for the GPTs compared with that of 66% for PEDOT-PSS after 1200 cycles suggested a high cycle stability of the GPTs and its potential as an electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
