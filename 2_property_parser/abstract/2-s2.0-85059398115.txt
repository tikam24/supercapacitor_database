Activated carbon electrodes from cornstalk core waste have been produced using combination of chemical and physical activation for supercapacitor application. Cornstalk was processed into self-adhesive carbon grains. The chemical activation of self-adhesive carbon grains was conducted using 0.4 M KOH at room temperature, and simultaneously followed by carbonized at 600°C in N 2 environment, and physical activation in the CO 2 environment with difference temperature of 600, 700 and 800°C using a multi-step heating profile. The physical properties of the cornstalk based activated carbon electrode which involve microstructure, functional groups and porosity parameter were evaluated using X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared analysis, and N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherm at 77K, respectively. The electrochemical measurement of supercapacitor cells was conducted using cyclic voltammetry technique. The activation temperature of 700°C resulted cornstalk based activated carbon electrode with a higher BET surface area of 826 m 2 /g and stack diameter of 1.0461 nm, corresponding to higher of specific capacitance of 109 F/g.
