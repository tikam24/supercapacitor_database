Zero-strain insertion material of lithium titanium oxide (Li[Li 1/3Ti 5/3]O 4) is used as a negative electrode in lithium-ion batteries and as a positive electrode in lithium batteries. It is crystallized as a defect spinel structure having space group symmetry of Fd3-m (a=8.36 Ã…). The material is topotactically reduced to Li 2[Li 1/3Ti 5/3]O 4, and it is oxidized to Li[Li 1/3Ti 5/3]O 4 at 1.55 V against a lithium electrode in nonaqueous lithium cells. The lattice dimension is virtually unchanged during the reaction, and therefore the material is ideal for long-life lithium-ion battery application. Some trials for modification of Li[Li 1/3Ti 5/3]O 4 are also described, and recent application of the material to backup memory in solar cells for digital watches, solid-state batteries, asymmetric hybrid supercapacitors, and 'lead-free' accumulators is also highlighted.
