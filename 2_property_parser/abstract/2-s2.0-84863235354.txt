Some binary RuO 2-SnO 2 oxides coated on Ti were synthesed by the thermal decoposion method. A remarkable behaviour of pseudo-capacitance has been shown on the cyclic voltmmograms of the prepared samples. It is concluded that the poor specific capacitance has been found for both RuO 2-enriched and SnO 2-enriched binary oxides. The maximum specific capacitance occurs at the composition of 40 mol% SnO 2 and reaches the value of 1080Fg -1 when this electrode was annealed at the temperature of 260°C. The addition of Sn into the binary oxide coating can help improve the electrode capacitancee and do no harm to the electro-catalytic properties. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.
