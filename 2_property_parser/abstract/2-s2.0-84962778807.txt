In order to improve the fault ride-though (FRT) capability of PMSG-based wind turbine generation system, an energy storage system composed of ultracapacitor (UC) and bidirectional Buck-Boost converter (BDBBC) paralleled to the DC-link of the dual PWM converter is used in this paper. The integrated control strategy for both grid-side converter (GSC) and BDBBC has been presented, which has two working modes. Under normal grid operation, it works in normal mode where the grid voltage orientation control (VOC) for gird-side converter and power control for BDBBC are applied. During the grid failures, it automatically switches to mode fault, where power control for GSC and voltage control for BDBBC are developed. Simulation results in MATLAB/SIMULINK verified the correctness and feasibility of the integrated control strategy.
