Multifunctional and flexible micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) have attractive prospects in integrated micro electronic systems fields owing to its high power density, fast charge/discharge rates and small volume feature. Here, a flexible MSC functional electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding is designed based on Mn ion-intercalated Ti3C2Tx MXene, presenting a high areal capacitance of 87 mF cm−2 at 2 mV s−1, remarkable energy density of 11.8 mWh cm−3 and outstanding shielding effectiveness of 44 dB. By density functional theory (DFT) calculation, the interaction between Mn ions and surface terminal (-F, –O, and –OH) of Ti3C2Tx is emphatically discussed, finding that the intercalated Mn ions are inclined to be bonding with O-contained groups with the orbital hybridization of Mn 3d and O 2p. It is intriguing to provide enhanced electrochemical performance in energy storage and additive interlayer EM waves absorption in EMI shielding. The present work can offer new insights about underlying mechanism of cation intercalation in Ti3C2Tx MXene and multiple functional devices application in integrated micro electronics systems field.
