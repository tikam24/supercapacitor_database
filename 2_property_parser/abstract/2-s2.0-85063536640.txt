Due to very intermittent properties of lightning strike and also hazards involved within it, very limited research has been conducted in Lightning energy harnessing area worldwide. However, the lightning causing clouds have very high charge density. So, an experimental study in numerical computational environment has been experimented for measuring the response characteristics of lightning spark to store the energy by real time environmental data collected from various meteorological center. The single stage two level spark generator circuit has been used to simulate the presented system. Also, this paper presents an analytical and experimental response of five level inverter integrated with supercapacitor to store lightning energy within supercapacitor and to convert it into AC voltage for various loads. Through this presented paper an imitated response has been shown of PMSM and Grid Load connected with storage and conversion system.
