The present work explored a novel, simple and low cost 'dipping and drying' process followed by a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method for the synthesis of cobalt oxide anchored multiwalled carbon nanotubes (Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>/MWNTs). Initially, MWNTs have been coated on a stainless steel substrate by a simple 'dip and dry' method, on which further deposition of cobalt oxide nanoparticles was carried out by the SILAR method. Our results confirm the uniform coating of Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> nanoparticles having sizes less than 15 nm on the surface of MWNTs. Later, the electrochemical performance shows that, the Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>/MWNTs films exhibit a maximum specific capacitance of 685 F g<sup>-1</sup> in a 2 M KOH electrolyte at a scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup> with high cycle stability of 73% over 5000 cycles. Moreover, lower electrochemical equivalent series resistance (11.25 mÎ©) give rise to the superior performance. These results show, the potential of Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>/MWNTs composite electrodes in electrochemical supercapacitors.
