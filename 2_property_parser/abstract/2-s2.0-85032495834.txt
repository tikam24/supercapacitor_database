A nitrogen-doped MWCNT/GO/cellulose hybrid composite was prepared via an in situ hydrothermal process, and its electrochemical performance was evaluated by conducting cyclic voltammetry (CV). The synthesized ternary hybrid nanocomposite was characterized using Raman, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field emission transmission electron microscope (FE-TEM), and thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis. The structural and morphological properties of the hybrid composite show it is possible to control the morphology and achieve thermal stability for hybrid nanocomposites. The electrochemical characteristics of the hybrid composites were investigated via cyclic voltammetry, Galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The hybrid composites were capable of delivering a high specific capacitance of âˆ¼264 F g-1 at a current density of 6 A g-1, and this increases the energy density with an excellent cycling stability (98%) after 10000 continuous charge-discharge cycles, this shows that the hybrid composites can be promising electrode materials to achieve high-performance supercapacitors.
