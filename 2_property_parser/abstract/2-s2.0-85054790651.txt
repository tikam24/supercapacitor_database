Here, the porous ruthenium oxide/multi-walled carbon nanocomposite (RuO 2 /MWCNT) was prepared using a facile precipitation method. The RuO 2 /MWCNT showed high specific capacity, outstanding rate performance and long cycling stability under a Li-ion organic electrolyte. Thus, advanced Li-ion hybrid capacitors (LIHCs) were successfully constructed with RuO 2 /MWCNT anode and activated ployaniline derived carbon (APDC) cathode under a Li-ion organic electrolyte. The LIHCs exhibited a highest energy density of 146 Wh kg −1 and a highest power densities of 33 kW kg −1 , with excellent cyclic stability (∼100% at 2.0 A g −1 after 15,000 cycles), which exhibited better performance than other LIHCs systems.
