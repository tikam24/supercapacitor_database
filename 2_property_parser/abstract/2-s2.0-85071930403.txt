Human-computer interaction is a bridge connecting humans and intelligent robots. Signal sensing and feedback are the key links. In this paper, a reinforced flexible hybrid nanogenerator (NG) based on PVDF/ZnO is designed. In the hybrid mode, the open circuit voltage can reach 70 V, the short circuit current can reach 12 μA, and the output performance can be increased by 25%. In this experiment, the charge density of the PVDF/ZnO surface was 12.79 μC/m2, the power density was 1.22 μW/cm2, and a 500 μF supercapacitor could be filled in 100 s. Through finite element analysis and experimental tests, it is proved that it is a more sensitive self-powered flexible hybrid sensor, which can accurately record the amplitude and frequency of human motion. Through pressure-friction hybrid sensing, intelligent robots can realize gesture recognition and tracking of human.
