Herein, ZIF-8 pre-grown on carbon cloth (CC) leads to preferential and homogenizing Zn deposition to accelerate Zn-ion diffusion. CC with uniform Zn deposits induced from ZIF-8 promotes rapid Zn plating, resulting in balanced kinetics between electrodes. The as-assembled ZICs show a high specific capacitance of 302 F g−1at 0.5 A g−1, an outstanding rate performance of 188 F g−1at 20 A g−1and 100% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles.
