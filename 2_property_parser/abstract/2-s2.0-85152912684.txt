Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZSC) have shown great potential as energy storage devices as they incorporate the merits of rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors. However, the poor bendability, unsatisfied energy density and cycling stability are still challenging the practical application of ZSC. Herein, Zn-doped MnO2 nanowires (Zn-MnO2) binder-free cathodes is synthesized with the aid of a one-step hydrothermal approach, which improves the lattice distortion caused by Zn hydrate ions and provided rich ion transport path. The Zn-MnO2 cathode was assembled with the active carbon (AC) anode into an axial ZSC, achieving a surface capacitance of 1300 mF cm−2 and an energy density of 722.2 μWh cm−2 at power density of 1.99 mW cm−2. After 20,000 charge/discharge cycles, a capacity retention rate of 83.75% and a coulombic efficiency of 100% were achieved, indicating excellent cycle stability of present device. In addition, this axial ZSC reveals exquisite mechanical flexibility and electrochemical stability, enabling continuously power smartphones under bending conditions. Present work suggests that ZSC devices based on Zn-MnO2 have excellent doable for business energy storage devices.
