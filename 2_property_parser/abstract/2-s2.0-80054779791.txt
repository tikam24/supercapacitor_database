A simple approach to decorate multiwalled carbon nanotubes with MnO2 has been developed. In this method, MnCl2 solution was directly transformed into MnO2 by microwave irradiation, and the produced MnO2 deposited on MWCNTs. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) result showed that MnO2 nanoparticles had the uniform size distribution. Field emission scan electron microscopy(FE-SEM) result showed that MnO2 nanoparticles cross-linked MWCNTs in a quasi three-dimensional network. Energy dispersive X-rays (EDX) spectra elucidated the presence of manganese oxide in the as-prepared composites. Cyclic voltammetry result demonstrated that a specific capacitance of deposited manganese oxide electrode was significantly greater than that of the pristine MWCNTs electrode in the same medium.
