A nanoporous manganese oxide (MnO 2) film was fabricated via a polystyrene templated electrodeposition in the solution containing MnSO 4. The nanoporous MnO 2 film obtained has been characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic charge/discharge methods. The specific capacitance of 1018 F g -1 was observed at a low current density of 500 mA g -1. When the current density increased to 30.0 A g -1, the specific capacitance of 277 F g -1 remained. The high capacitance retention at high rates makes the prepared MnO 2 a promising candidate for supercapacitor applications. Â© 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
