The capacitive mixing procedure for energy extraction based on double layer expansion (CDLE) belongs to the group of so-called capmix techniques. CDLE takes advantage of the voltage rise that occurs when seawater is exchanged for river water by simply using a pair of porous electrodes that jointly behave as an electrical double layer supercapacitor. Despite being an approach that is easy to implement, there are still some experimental aspects that appear essential for optimizing the extracted energy that have not yet been analyzed in sufficient detail, for example, the value of the optimum working potential, the influence of the temperature and salinity of the solutions in the cycle performance, the porosity or hydrophilicity of the carbon, and the possibility of stacking individual cells in order to increase the amount of energy. In this chapter, we deal with all these experimental aspects in order to achieve a fruitful implementation that will help in succeeding in a future CDLE device.
