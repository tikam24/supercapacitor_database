Herein, we report a microwave-assisted ultra-high temperature solvothermal method for fabricating a nitrogen and phosphorus co-doped nest-like mesoporous carbon under ambient atmosphere. The reported method exhibits high energy efficiency, ultra-fast carbonization rate, and inert atmosphere protection free fabrication process. The carbonization process of precursor completes in 5∼10 min, and no apparent increase for surface oxygen content is observed for the obtained material even it is fabricated under oxygen-riched ambient atmosphere. The obtained material fabricated by the reported method exhibits a nest-like mesoporous morphology and high specific surface area (up to 922 m2 g−1), which nitrogen and phosphorus doping content reaches up to 3.45 and 1.26 at.%, respectively. When used as an electrode material for supercapacitor, the obtained material exhibits good capacitive performance, which specific capacitance reaches up to 171 F g−1, and more than 89.9% of initial capacitance is retained even under a high current density of 20 A g−1, the capacitance retention rate reaches up to 96.2% after 5000 charge/discharge cycles.
