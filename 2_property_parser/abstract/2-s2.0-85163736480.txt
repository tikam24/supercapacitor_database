Aqueous supercapacitors are promising electrochemical energy storage devices for research nowadays due to their intrinsic high safety, low cost and high power density. However, the freezing of water at low temperatures limits the scope of application of aqueous devices. Here, we report a dilute hybrid electrolyte with low-temperature performance by introducing ethylene glycol (EG) as an organic additive for mixed electrolysis at a low concentration of 1 m (mol kg−1) Mg(ClO4)2. The results show that EG can break the hydrogen bonding between water molecules to prevent the electrolyte from solidifying at low temperatures. The optimized electrolyte has a low freezing point below -50 ℃, which allows the assembled supercapacitor being able to operate at extreme low temperature environments. And it was worth mentioned that the addition of EG could effectively enhance the long-cycle performance of the devices and the assembled supercapacitor can operate stably for more than 30,000 cycles at -30 ℃ and delivered a capacitance of 22.5 F g−1 with a capacitance retention rate of 89% after completion of the cycling.
