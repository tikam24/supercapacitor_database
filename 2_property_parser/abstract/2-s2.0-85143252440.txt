Hierarchically porous carbon materials (HPCMs) with large specific surface area (SSA) and interconnected hierarchical pore structures were prepared from 2-hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) via eco-friendly ice-templating and KCl-assisted carbonization. Morphological assessments revealed that the HPCMs had sponge-like porous structures with thin carbon sheets and interconnected pores. With increasing amounts of KCl, the SSA and pore volume of the HPCMs increased to 1095.74 m2 g−1 and 1.23 cm3 g−1, respectively. In a three-electrode system, the HPCM-based electrode exhibited a high specific capacitance of 278.09 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in a 6.0 M KOH electrolyte. In a two-electrode system, a symmetric capacitor device exhibited a high specific capacitance of 67.23 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with a capacitance retention of ∼80% at 30 A g−1, and an excellent cycling ability of ∼100% after 10,000 cycles at 10 A g−1. Additionally, a symmetric device showed a high-power and high-energy density of 15,000 W kg−1 and 9.34 Wh kg−1, respectively. These results reveal that HPCMs prepared from HEC with KCl can be a potential electrode material for high-performance green supercapacitors.
