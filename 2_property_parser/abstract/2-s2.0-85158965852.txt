Research and development on electrochemical energy storage and conversion (EESC) devices, viz. fuel cells, supercapacitors and batteries, are highly significant in realizing carbon neutrality and a sustainable energy economy. Component corrosion/degradation remains a major threat to EESC device‘s long-term durability. Here, we provide a comprehensive account of the EESC device‘s corrosion and degradation issues. Discussions are mainly on polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells, metal-ion and metal-air batteries and supercapacitors. Corrosion of bipolar plates/current collectors, carbon corrosion, electrode/electrocatalyst degradation, and various mitigation approaches are detailed. The collective information provided could help develop EESC devices with better durability.
