Lithium insertion in carbon microspheres takes place by irreversible attachment to the border of graphene layers and/or in the vicinity of hydrogen-carbon bonds, reversible intercalation between disorderly-stacked graphene layers, and lithium adsorption on the pore surfaces. As compared with lithium, the lower stability of the passivating films and sodium-carbon compounds usually leads a poorer reversible insertion of sodium. Surface modification of carbon microspheres with citric acid improves reversible insertion by the loss of porosity (up to ca. 300 mAhg-1 for sodium insertion). Impregnation with tin oxide leads to higher insertion capacities penalized by a poorer retention. copyright The Electrochemical Society.
