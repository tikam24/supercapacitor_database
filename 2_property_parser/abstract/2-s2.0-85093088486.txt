Nitrogen-doped porous carbon materials have been the outstanding candidates in supercapacitor applications due to their low cost, high surface area, abundant pore structure, suitable nitrogen doping content etc. Herein, nitrogen-doped porous carbon materials (NPC) were prepared via simple solid grinding using silica spheres as pore-forming agent and nitrogen-rich aniline as carbon/nitrogen precursor. The silica spheres create crossed macroporous structure that contributes to the transfer and storage of charge. NPC is continuously activated to give NPC-K, (where the K presents potassium hydroxide), further increasing its surface area and pore volume. The resulting NPC-K has hierarchical porous structures, high specific surface area, large pore volume, and suitable nitrogen doping. When used as an electrode material for supercapacitors, it has a good capacitance, rate performance, and cycle stability, demonstrating good electrochemical performance.
