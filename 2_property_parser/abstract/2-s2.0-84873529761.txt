One-dimensional CoxNi1-xMoO4.nH2O (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) nanorods have been successfully synthesized by a mild hydrothermal method. The chemical composition of nanorods was varied. Structures and morphologies of samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), and the specific surface area of samples has also been studied by using the Brunauer-Emmet-Teller isotherm. More importantly, the supercapacitive performances of CoxNi1-xMoO4.nH2O nanorods were also studied by using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods in 1.0 M KOH solution. The electrochemical measurements showed thatCoxNi1-xMoO4.nH2O electrodes exhibited good supercapacitive activity in KOH electrolyte. The specific capacitance has been effected by the ratio of Co/Ni, when the x value is 0.5, the specific capacitance of Cox.5Ni1-x.5MoO4.nH2O electrode can achieve the largest one, 1040.7 F g-1 at the current density of 0.625 A g-1 under our experiment condition, and after 400 charge-discharge cycles at 0.625 A g-1 the specific capacitance of Cox.5Ni1-x.5MoO4.nH2O electrode has maintained 98.3% of the initial value. This enhanced electrochemical performance of Cox.5Ni1-x.5MoO4nH2O nanorods might be ascribed to efficient surface area and electron transport path, which were facilitated by one-dimensional nanostructure.
