This paper proposes a new bidirectional hybrid DC-DC converter which uses a combination of a switched-capacitor and switched-inductor structure. The hybrid structure, based on the switched inductor and capacitor cells, helps achieve multiple advantages such as higher voltage conversion ratio, passive component size reduction, and active switch stress reduction. The mathematical analysis of the new converter is performed, addressing its control and stability through small-signal analysis modeling, and simulation results are used to confirm the theoretical considerations.
