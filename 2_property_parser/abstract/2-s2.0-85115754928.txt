Silver phosphate (Ag3PO4) has been proved to be an excellent visible light catalyst. It also has a certain specific capacity, but if used as a supercapacitor anode material, its specific capacitance still needs to be further improved. To increase the specific capacity of Ag3PO4, a facile method is to dope it with nitrogen. In this work, the nitrogen-doped Ag3PO4 material (N-Ag3PO4) was synthesized via the reaction of AgNO3 with Na2HPO4 ⋅ 12H2O in the presence of urea at 80 °C by means of liquid precipitation. Electrochemical analyses of the as-synthesized N-Ag3PO4 composites were carried out in a three-electrode geometry system. Results revealed that the doping of nitrogen could significantly improve the specific capacity of Ag3PO4. The highest specific capacity of 1314.9 F g−1, which is more than twice that of the pure Ag3PO4 specimen (656.1 F g−1), was obtained at the current density of 1 A g−1. At a higher current density of 10 A g−1, it possess a specific capacity of 716.6 F g−1, showing an excellent charge/discharge performance, which could be attributed to the smaller particle size and the lower charge transfer resistance (0.41 Ω cm−2) of synthesized N-Ag3PO4 composites. These results suggest that the as-prepared N-Ag3PO4 composite has great promise as a super capacitor energy storage material.
