In this work, a dual-functional materials which can be used for both supercapacitors and dye degradation was prepared through simple one-pot solvothermal method using an environmentally friendly short-chain surfactant with special catechol structure. By adjusting the concentrations of the surfactant added, the crystal structures of the samples could be controlled during the solvothermal process. The sizes of spherical copper ferrite sub-micron sized particles were controlled through the interactions between the metal ion and the catechol-like structure of the ligand. Further investigation of the performance indicated that the magnetic copper ferrite particles which were prepared with 1 mmol·L−1 of the surfactant displayed specific capacitance (up to 960.73 F·g−1) at a current density of 1A·g−1. And after cycling 1000 times at a current density of 10 A·g−1, the initial capacitance retention rate is 57.1%. In addition, the electrode was used to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to achieve rapid and efficient degradation of Malachite green (MG) contaminants and the degradation efficiency was as high as 96% within 20 min.
