In this study, nanostructured cadmium oxide and silver phosphate (CdO/Ag3PO 4) nanocomposites are synthesized and studied for their electrochemical properties as well as photocatalytic potential of these composites is also investigated. The specific capacitance of pristine CdO is found to be 416.52 F/g and the enhanced capacitance up to 1012.06 F/g is obtained for the composite material with weight ratio of 80/20 for CdO/Ag3PO4 nanocomposite. The Galvanic chargeâ€“discharge (GCD) study highlights the excellent charging and discharging performance and we conclude that our material is highly stable during the 5000 cycles so could be an appealing candidate for commercial devices. The photocatalysis study is used for the degradation of methyl blue dye. The sample with weight ratio 80/20 has the best photocatalytic activity and degraded the 99.9% of the dye in 120 min. Experimental results suggest that CdO/Ag3PO4 has an outstanding potential for use in energy storage devices as an electrode material for supercapacitors and simultaneously could also be a potential candidate for waste water treatment technologies as compared to pristine counterparts.
