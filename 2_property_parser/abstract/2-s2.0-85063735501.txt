We introduce a facile way to improve the performance of NiCo 2 O 4 electrode by including a Ni seed layer. The seed layer deposited on Ni foam electrode (NiCo 2 O 4 /Ni@NF)shows the superior specific capacity of 1142 C g −1 at 1 A g −1 with the excellent cycle stability of ∼96% even after 5000 cycles at a higher current density of 5 A g −1 . These values are about 3.7 times higher than that of the electrode (NiCo 2 O 4 @NF)without a seed layer, which shows the specific capacity of 305 C g −1 @1 A g −1 with cycle stability of 84% even at a lower current density of 1 A g −1 . The enhanced performance of the NiCo 2 O 4 /Ni@NF electrode may be attributed to lower interface resistance, fast redox reversible reaction, and improved surface active sites. Further, the asymmetric solid-state supercapacitor device is fabricated by using the NiCo 2 O 4 /Ni@NF electrode as a positive and reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-Fe 2 O 3 nanograin as a negative electrode with PVA-KOH gel electrolyte, and the NiCo 2 O 4 /Ni20@NF//rGO-Fe 2 O 3 @NF asymmetric solid state device delivers an areal capacitance of 446 mF cm −2 with a low capacitance loss of 18% even after 10000 cycles. Further, the fabricated asymmetric solid state device shows a maximum energy density of 124.3 Wh cm −2 (at 3.58 kW cm −2 )and power density of 14.88 kW cm −2 (at 31.41 Wh cm −2 ).
