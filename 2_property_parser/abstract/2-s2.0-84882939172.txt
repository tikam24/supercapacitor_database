Aqueous suspensions of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) in dilute H 2SO4 were sprayed onto both sides of a Nafion membrane and dried to fabricate flexible solid-state supercapacitors. A single cell with MWNT-only electrodes had a capacitance of 57 F g-1 per electrode at 2 mV s-1 and 44 F g-1 at 150 mV s-1 but with low H+ mobility. Cells with MWNT + ionomer hybrid electrodes showed higher H+ mobility, and the electric double layer (EDL) capacitance increased to 145 F g-1 at 2 mV s-1 and 91 F g-1 at 150 mV s-1. The energy and power densities of one electrode charged to 1 V at 1 A g-1 were 12.9 Wh kg-1 and 3.3 kW kg-1 respectively. Three solid-state supercapacitor cells connected in series charged to 3 V at 1 and 2 A g-1 provided a device power density of 8.9 kW kg-1 at 1 A g-1 and 9.4 kW kg -1 at 2 A g-1, the highest for all-solid-state EDL supercapacitors.
