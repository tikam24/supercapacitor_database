The tertiary hybrid supercapacitor consisting of PEDOT:PSS wrapped reduced graphene oxide/Ni0.5Co0.5Fe2O4 (PGNC) was developed and its supercapacitance performance has been compared with that of the reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/Ni0.5Co0.5Fe2O4 (GNC), carbon nanotube (CNT)/Ni0.5Co0.5Fe2O4 (CNC) and carbon nanotube/reduced graphene oxide/Ni0.5Co0.5Fe2O4 (CGNC). Among all, PGNC exhibits an excellent specific capacitance of 1286 Fg−1 with a capacitance retention of 95% over 6000 cycles at a current density of 0.5 Ag−1. The synergetic effects between rGO, Ni0.5Co0.5Fe2O4 and the PEDOT:PSS polymer result in an increase in the specific surface area and the pore volume, making PGNC an excellent hybrid supercapacitor for energy storage. The enhancement in the specific capacitance of the PGNC nanocomposite is further validated through first-principles density functional theory calculations, which predict an increment in the density of states at the Fermi level of the GNC and CNC nanocomposites compared to the isolated Ni0.5Co0.5Fe2O4 material. The supercapacitance performance of the PGNC nanocomposite is reported for different electrolytes, different stoichiometric ratios of Ni and Co in NixCo1-xFe2O4 and on different substrates.
