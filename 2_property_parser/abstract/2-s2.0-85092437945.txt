Synthesis of bisoxalatoborate spiro cyclic quaternary ammonium salt (BSQA) from 8-oxa-5-azonia- spiro [4,5]decane bromide(ASB), oxalate dihydrate(OD) and boric acid (BA) was by means of ion exchange. Its structure was verified by 13C NMR and LC-MS. Synthesis of BSQA was optimized by using orthogonal test. The optimized conditions were as follows: molar ratio of nASB:nBA was 2.8:1, reaction time was 4 h and reaction temperature was 90℃. Finally, the conversion rate of ASB was 90.2% in this optimized condition. Two kinds of electrolyte that made from BSQA, ET4NBF4 with acetonitrile separately were applied in simulated supercapacitor to test the electrochemical performance. The result showed that the operating voltage can be 3.0V with charge/discharge efficiency of 94.89% and the energy density of 11.63 W·h·kg-1. The product was better than ET4NBF4 which was usually used as organic electrolyte in the electrochemical performance with a higher operating voltage.
