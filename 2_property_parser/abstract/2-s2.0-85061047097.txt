3D sponge nitrogen doped graphene (NG) was prepared economically from waste polyethylene-terephthalate (PET) bottles mixed with urea at different temperatures using green approach via a novel one-step method. The effect of temperature and the amount of urea on the formation of NG was investigated. Cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy measurements, revealed that nitrogen fixation, which affects the structure and morphology of prepared materials improve the charge propagation and ion diffusion. The prepared materials show outstanding performance as a supercapacitor electrode material, with the specific capacitance going up to 405 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. An energy density of 68.1 W h kg−1 and a high maximum power density of 558.5 W kg−1 in 6 M KOH electrolytes were recorded for the optimum sample. The NG samples showed an appropriate cyclic stability with capacitance retention of 87.7% after 5000 cycles at 4 A g−1 with high charge/discharge duration. Thus, the prepared NG herein is considered to be promising, cheap material used in energy storage applications and the method used is cost-effective and environmentally friendly method for mass production of NG in addition to opening up opportunities to process waste materials for a wide range of applications.
