Hydrogels are usually utilized as materials to fabricate multiresponsive sensors, triboelectric nanogenerators, and supercapacitors, respectively, in wearable devices applications. In order to develop an organohydrogel-based multiresponsive sensor for a triboelectric nanogenerator and supercapacitor, a tough organohydrogel with a triple-network structure was fabricated from poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), sodium alginate (SA), and cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs). Due to its unique structure, the hydrogel exhibited a high toughness of 24.5 kJ m−2. Conductive MXene (MX) nanosheets were functionalized by graphene oxide (GO) to form stable and homogeneous nanocomposites, which were introduced into the organohydrogel matrix as conductive fillers. The MX-GO nanocomposites imparted a high gauge factor (GF) of 2.77 and multiple sensing to the organohydrogel-based sensor such as direction recognition tensile strain sensing, ultra-sensitive pressure strain sensing, and temperature sensing. Meanwhile, the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and supercapacitor were assembled separately with the MX-GO organohydrogel. The short-circuit current (ISC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), and short-circuit charge quantity (QSC) of the organohydrogel-based TENG in a single-electrode mode achieved 8.7 μA, 145 V, and 42.9 nC, respectively. The organohydrogel-based supercapacitor also showed a high specific capacitance of 5.4 F g−1 and excellent cycling stability (98.2% capacitance retention after 1500 cycles). Therefore, this design approach for organohydrogel-based devices could open a new route for the development of next-generation wearable intelligent devices.
