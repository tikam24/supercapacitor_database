(Graph Presented) Three-dimensional individual S-doped porous red-blood-cell-like graphene (SRBCG) microspheres with double concave-surface morphology duplicated from a template-directed chemical vapor deposition process in a fluidized bed reactor not only exhibit high porosity, good structural stability, and strong anticompression properties but also present superior capacitive energy-storage abilities with respect to a symmetric supercapacitor (great compatibility at different rates) and a Li ion capacitor (no capacitance loss after 3500 cycles at 2 A g-1). The well-kept integrity of the electrode configuration after cycling benefits from the intrinsic robust scaffold which acts as a structural buffer for volume expansion to inhibit structure collapse. The unique individual microarchitecture with well-developed pore channels of SRBCG can effectively prevent the obtained graphene from aggregation or restacking, expanding the contact area between electrolyte ions and the electrode. The excellent capacitive behaviors of SRBCG are guaranteed by the unique robust microarchitecture accompanied by the good structural stability. Additionally, the fluidized bed technology is conducive to the realization of the homogeneous growth and scalable production of SRBCG.
