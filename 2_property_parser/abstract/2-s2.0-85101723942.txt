The configuration, modelling and control of several possible hybrid systems for the propulsion of the existing tramway in Cuenca-Ecuador are analysed. The system consists of novel renewable sources: Photovoltaic energy, hydrokinetic turbines and a biomass gasifier, which increases the reliability of the system and reduces CO2 emissions. In addition, a proton exchange fuel cell and a super capacitor thatsupply the necessary power for the tramway, as well as, a hydrogen tank that stores the excess energy. Energy management is done through renewable sources that recharge the super capacitor and the fuel cell at the charging stations along the tramway route. Different renewable hybrid systems have been analysed, which indicates that the most favourable case from a technical, environmental and economic point of view using data analysis and machine learning techniques is S4. Sensitivity analyses allow the study of variables such as CO2, net present cost and COE for different demand variations, as well as, for the minimum state of charge in the super capacitor. The results indicate the optimal net present cost is M$ 1.46 and 0.12 $ kWhâˆ’1 in cost of energy, validity of the proposed system in the round trip of the tramway.
