Transition metal oxides have applications into energy storage devices such as electrochemical supercapacitors. We deposited nickel oxide (NiO) thin films using electrodeposition under direct and pulse potentiometry. The effects of the pulse electrodeposition conditions are systematically investigated. The results show that the pulse time influences clearly the morphology of thin films deposited. The nanostructure thin film that has been deposited under 1-s on-time condition was proven to be a suitable electrode material since its 1000 Fg−1 at 0.5 Ag−1 specific capacitance is large enough to fulfill the needed requirement. In addition, the thin film at hand has shown 90.1% capacity retention during 800 galvanostatic charge–discharge cycles under 5 Ag−1 current density. Moreover, nanostructured NiO films prepared with pulse electrodeposition method demonstrate high power performance, excellent rate as well as long-term cycling stability, which make them promising electrode materials for supercapacitor applications.
