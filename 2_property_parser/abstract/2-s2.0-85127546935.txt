We describe the growth of graphene layers using the chemical vapor deposition technique. Source material benzene dissociated consist carbon flakes in the vapor phase. Vaporized carbon atoms facilitated a homogenous graphene layer at 800 Â°C temperature. It is utilized as a supercapacitor electrode with an outstanding volumetric capacitance of 1275 F cm-3 and 98% cyclic stability. The volumetric energy density and power density are 70.49 mWh cm-3 (at 0.01 A cm-2) and 7155.12 mW cm-3 (at 0.06 A cm-2), respectively.
