In this work, we have reported maximum specific capacity of novel activated carbon/graphene oxide/tin oxide (AC/GO/SnO2) and activated carbon/graphene oxide/titanium-zinc acetate dehydrate (AC/GO/TiO2-Zn) nanocomposites was synthesized by using hydrothermal method. The characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis.) absorption spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) were used to confirm the structural phase change, morphology, and microstructural arrangement in the AC/GO/SnO2 and AC/GO/TiO2-Zn nanocomposite. The symmetry supercapacitor electrode device was fabricated using the configuration of AC/GO/SnO2 and AC/GO/TiO2-Zn nanocomposite. The electrochemical properties of the fabricated nanocomposite electrodes and the fabricated supercapacitor was characterized using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charging-discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques with 3 M KOH gel electrolytes. The AC/GO/TiO2-Zn electrode showed a maximum specific capacity of 1491.6 Fg−1 at a current density of 2.5 Ag−1 and a cycle stability of the capacity retention of 61.80 % even after 10,000 cycles. This result shows that the AC/GO/TiO2-Zn is an electrode material with good electrochemical reversibility and cycle stability for supercapacitor applications.
