Graphene oxide was synthesized by microwave plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD) on the surface of Ni foam with methyl formate and hydrogen as raw materials. The synthesis temperature was 450â„ƒ. Then, graphene oxide was used as supercapacitor active material and its electrochemical properties were investigated under three-electrode system. The morphology, structure and electrochemical properties of the samples were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemical test. The results show that graphene oxide can be synthesized by MPCVD. No poisonous gas was produced during the synthetic process and the whole synthetic time was short. The morphology and structure of the graphene oxide synthesized by MPCVD are similar to those of the traditional chemical oxidation method. Electrochemical tests show that the specific capacitance of the graphene oxide is up to 197 F/g at 1 A/g. When the current density is raised to 100 A/g, its specific capacitance is still 134 F/g. The capacitance retention is 94% after 2 000 charge/discharge cycles at 5 A/g.
