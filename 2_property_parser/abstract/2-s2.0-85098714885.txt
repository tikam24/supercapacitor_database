Facile preparation of one-dimensional spinel material is highly attractive for their widespread usage in energy storage devices. Herein, we report uniform one-dimensional CoMn2O4 nanorods were prepared by cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) assisted hydrothermal technique followed by subsequent calcination process. The prepared materials were characterized to different types of physicochemical features to analyze the appropriateness of the material for the supercapacitor electrode application. The crystalline nature and bonding properties were examined by X-ray diffraction analysis and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopic analysis. The structural and morphological features of prepared materials were analyzed using field emission scanning electron microcopy which reveals the edge curved one-dimensional nanorod structure. Furthermore, cyclic voltammetric, chronopotentiometric and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic analyses were employed to evaluate the electrochemical properties of the freshly prepared CoMn2O4 materials. The cyclicvoltammetric studies provide the specific capacitance of 895 Fg−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, whereas chronopotentiometric curves provide the highest specific capacitance of 802 Fg−1 at current density of 1 Ag−1. The cyclic stability analysis shows the excellent cyclic stability which retains 87% of initial capacitance after the continuous 5000 CV cycles at a scan rate of 100 mVs−1. The outstanding electrochemical features unquestionably make CoMn2O4 as a good candidate for supercapacitor devices.
