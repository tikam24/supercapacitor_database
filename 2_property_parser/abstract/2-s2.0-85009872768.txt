Nanostructured MnO2/exfoliated graphite (EG) composites were prepared by an in-situ hydrothermal method, and were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and thermal gravimetric analysis. Their electrochemical performance was investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Results show that the nanostructured MnO2 is inserted between the EG layers, and their conductivity and electrochemical stability are significantly improved. The composites have an improved rate performance compared with the pure MnO2. The capacitance retention rate of the composites and pure MnO2 are 100 and 94.3% after 1000 cycles at a current density of 1 A/g, indicating that the stability of the composites is better than that of pure MnO2.
