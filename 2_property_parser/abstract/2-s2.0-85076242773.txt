Nanostructure construction and composition tuning are two effective methods to accelerate electrochemical reaction kinetics and increase electroactive sites of nickel cobalt selenides nanoarrays. Herein, we have successfully designed and fabricated the P-(Ni,Co)Se2 nanoarrays on activated carbon cloth with PBAs nanocubes anchored on the nanoflakes-nanowires by a facile hydrothermal method, followed precipitate reaction and phosphorization/selenylation treatment. The continuous hollow PBAs nanocubes and proper P incorporation in (Ni,Co)Se2 could greatly increase active surface area and enhance the ions diffusion and charge transfer. The resultant P-(Ni,Co)Se2 NAs electrode delivers a high areal capacity of 3.02C cm−2 (a specific capacity of 755C g−1) at 2 mA cm−2 and a good rate capability (2.61C cm−2 at 30 mA cm−2). Furthermore, the all-solid-state hybrid supercapacitor device is also constructed by using P-(Ni,Co)Se2 NAs and ZIF-8 derived carbon as positive electrode and negative electrode, respectively, which shows a high energy density of 45.0 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 446.3 W kg−1. This work offers new strategies to synthesize transition nickel cobalt selenides for high performance supercapacitor devices.
