Current collector has a major role in electrochemical performance and cycle stability of supercapacitor. It collects electrons and supports the electrode material. Conductivity and contact resistance with the electrode material of a current collector have a direct influence on the power density and capacitance of a supercapacitor. Current collector should have high electrical conductivity, high mechanical strength/modulus, lightweight, high thermal stability, high electrochemical stability and low cost. Metal foam and metal foil type current collector are used in general, in which metal foam provides the highest performance. For flexible supercapacitor, carbon fiber is generally used as the current collector.
