Energy management strategy (EMS) is a key issue for hybrid energy storage system (HESS) in electric vehicles. By innovatively introducing the current speed information, the vehicle speed optimized fuzzy energy management strategy (VSO-FEMS) for HESS is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the pruned fuzzy rules are formulated by the SOC change of battery and super-capacitor to preallocate the required power of vehicle. Then, the real-time vehicle speed is used to optimize the pre-allocated results based on the principle of vehicle dynamics, so as to realize the optimal allocation of required power. To validate the proposed VSO-FEMS strategy for HESS, simulations were done and compared with other EMSs under the typical urban cycle in China (CYC-CHINA). Results show that the final SOC of battery and super-capacitor are optimized in varying degrees, and the total energy consumption under the VSO-FEMS strategy is 2.43% less than rule-based strategy and 1.28% less than fuzzy control strategy, which verifies the effectiveness of the VSO-FEMS strategy.
