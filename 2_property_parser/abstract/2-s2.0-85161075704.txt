Research proposes an optimal power distribution approach for application of electric vehicle (EV) with use of hybrid energy storage system (HESS). HESS protection structure includes dual isolated-based soft-switching symmetrical coupling with half-bridge bidirectional converters to the system of battery and supercapacitors (SCs). The bidirectional converter properly controls the charging process of the battery and SC as well. Besides, spiral wound SCs of mesoporous electrode material have been used in EVs. In the drive cycle of EVs, the operation of SC relates to the functionality of the allocated scheme under "peak load transfer"at 2i sc âˆ¼3i bat current profile carried out. New energy allocation strategies under SOC control enable SC charging and discharging at peak currents of around 4i bat. The comparison of the mode of the battery system showed that the performance acceleration built under EVs has been improvised at a certain rate of 50% with a loss of energy minimised to 69%. As a result, the technique adapts different load curves, thus enhancing the utilisation of energy with reduced aging of the battery. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme meets the power demand of a typical driving cycle, for testing vehicle performance, and various energy management system have been assessed based on hydrogen consumption, overall efficiency, state of charge of SCs and batteries, stress on hybrid sources, and DC bus stability. The proposed strategy reduces hydrogen consumption by 8.7% compared to other strategies.
