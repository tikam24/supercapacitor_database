Sonication-supported hydrothermal process was used to synthesize nanoporous carbon composites of NiCo2S4@N−MWCNT and NiCo2S4@N−MWCNT/MOF67 for supercapacitor applications. The structural, morphological, and electrochemical properties of the synthesized composites were improved the use of the hydrothermal process. The composite electrodes were assembled via three-electrode configuration using 6 M KOH as electrolyte solution. The NiCo2S4@N−MWCNT and NiCo2S4@N−MWCNT/MOF-67 composites showed the specific capacitance of (254 and ∼455) F/g, respectively, at 1 A/g. Due to the incorporation of the metal organic framework nano porous structured composite, the increment of the specific capacitance was almost 1.78-fold. The electrode shows excellent capacitance retention of 98.43% and improved the cyclic stability in presence of 6 M KOH electrolyte.
