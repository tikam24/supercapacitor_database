The rapid increment of integrated electronics and the boom in miniaturized and portable devices have developed the requirement for miniaturized and carriable energy storage cell. However, recently energy storage units still subject to manifold limiting their practical application, such as short lifetime, low power density, low rate stability and complex architecture. Here, the focus is on new strategy to design cladding nanostructured electrode AgNWs-MoS2 material and the material engineering of transparent electrode and in-plane micro-supercapacitors. The integrated cladding AgNWs-MoS2 materials based micro-supercapacitor with high transparency of 77.5% showed a high rate stability (specific areal capacitance of 27.6 mF cm−2 and 16.9 mF cm−2 at high rate of 0.2 and 3 V s−1 receptively), long-life cycling (96.4% retention after 10, 000 cycles) and bending stability (under 180-degree bend for 100 times, only 1.4% loss at a high rate of 8 V s−1). We trust this strategy may be extended to the syntheses of other cladding hybrid materials with such fascinating nanostructure for in-plane architectures micro-supercapacitors. It is also expected that the advances in such energy storage will offer more opportunities for the miniaturization and integration of energy-storage units for portable devices.
