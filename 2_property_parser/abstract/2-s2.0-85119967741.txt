In this work, nanosphere shaped MnCo2O4.5 specimens were prepared through CTAB-assisted precipitation synthetic technique followed by subsequent calcinations process, aiming to recognize a high capacitance advance electrode material in the field of supercapacitors. It is demonstrated that the nanosphere shaped MnCo2O4.5 exhibit the highest specific capacity of 153 mAh g−1 at 5 mVs−1 and excellent rate performance which governed by cyclic voltammetric curves. The galvanostatic charge/discharge analysis offer the specific capacity of 290 mAh g−1 at 1 Ag−1. The cycling stability studies was analyzed using continuous 3000 cyclic voltammetric cycles at 100 mVs−1, which offer 91% stability till 3000 cycles.
