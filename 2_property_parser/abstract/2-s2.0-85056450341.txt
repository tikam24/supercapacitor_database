A new kind of metal-organic framework (MOF) was firstly explored to successfully derive the carbon nanotubes material. The in-situ growth carbon nanotubes deriving from MOFs were used as an all-solid-state supercapacitor for the first time and exhibited a high electrochemical performance. High specific capacitances of 272 and 168 mFcm−2 can be achieved at 0.5 and 10 mAcm−2, respectively. A high retention value of 100% was kept even after 5000 charge and discharge cycles. Such a high electrochemical performance may be due to the intrinsic properties of the MOF-derived carbon materials, such as high surface area, uniformly porous structure and high electronic conductivity. The present study provided a new kind of MOF precursor to generate the carbon nanotubes material and demonstrated that the MOF-derived carbon nanotubes material may be a promising candidate for all-solid-state supercapacitors in future.
