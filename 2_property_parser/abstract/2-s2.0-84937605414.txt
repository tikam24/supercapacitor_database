Abstract A significant improvement of up to 94% in mesopore area of hydrochar-derived activated carbons (ACs) has been achieved using optimal concentrations of biomass (coconut shell) and chemical activating agent (ZnCl<inf>2</inf>) during hydrothermal pre-treatment. For the first time, we have demonstrated that stoichiometry can influence hydrochar properties and availability of ZnCl<inf>2</inf> for activation which has significant impact on the textural properties of mesoporous activated carbons. Tuning of key process parameters and hydrothermal treatment conditions (ZnCl<inf>2</inf>:biomass ratios and biomass & ZnCl<inf>2</inf> concentrations), together with hydrothermal pre-treatment with H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, resulted in BET and mesopore areas up to 2440 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> and 1121 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. When the mesoporous carbon was employed as an electrode material in supercapacitors, stable energy density at 7.6 W h kg<sup>-1</sup> was observed (90% of 8.5 W h kg<sup>-1</sup> @ 0.22 kW kg<sup>-1</sup>) at a high power density of âˆ¼4.5 kW kg<sup>-1</sup>, which is one the best performance observed thus far in biomass-derived activated carbons.
