Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) is widely used as supercapacitor electrode material. However, the specific capacitance of MWCNTs cannot achieve optimum value to facilitate required demand. Conducting polymers have been introduced to achieve optimum energy density and power density of supercapacitor electrode material. Previous work had demonstrated the effects of adding conducting polymer into carbon base material to get pseudocapacitance effect. Nevertheless the effects specifically of polyaniline (PANi) to MWCNTs were significantly low. This work describes the effect of PANi adding on MWCNTs film prepared by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique in order to increase the specific capacitance of MWCNTs. The commercial MWCNTs is dispersed in deionized water by using crystal violet. The admixtures without PANi (sample A), 5wt.% of PANi (sample B) and 10wt.% of PANi (sample C) have been prepared by ex-situ polymerization. The voltage supplied for film deposition is 8 V for 5 minutes. The morphology, functional group and electrochemical properties of MWCNTs due to the presence of PANi had been studied. From FESEM analysis, the presence of PANi can be clearly observed for sample B and sample C while FTIR analysis, proves PANi structure on MWCNTs with its functional group presence in sample B and sample C through the absorbtion band which obviously shifted to higher value compare to sample A. Cyclic voltammogram (CV) analysis shown redox activity occurred in sample B and sample C with identical anodic and cathodic peaks. Sample B hold the higher specific capacitance and higher energy density compared than sample A and sample B. From galvanostatic charge-discharge (CD) measurement, the charge and discharge process for sample B is longer than sample A and sample C which consequently lower its power density. The presence of PANi at 5wt.% is able to increase specific capacitance as well as energy density to optimum value.
