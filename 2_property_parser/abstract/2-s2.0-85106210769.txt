The study deals with synthesis of ZnCo2O4 electrode material via a hydrothermal route on a stainless steel substrate and its supercapacitive properties. The morphology of ZnCo2O4 electrode material was obtained as microspheres consisting of crumbled nanosheets like structures. The specific capacitance of ZnCo2O4 is obtained as 593 F/g at 10 mV/s. The internal resistance of the material is 1.2 Î©. The Columbic efficiency of zinc cobaltite electrode material is 96.50%. The results obtained indicate that zinc cobaltite microspheres have extensive potential to be used as a competent supercapacitive electrode material with superior specific capacitance and greater cyclic stability.
