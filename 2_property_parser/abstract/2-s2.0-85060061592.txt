Renewable Energy Sources (RES) can be a solution to help in slowing down or mitigating the global climate changes affecting worldwide. Intermittent nature of those RES and the variability of its generated energy, can create some power quality issues, as well as problems related to reliability and stability when RES are connected to utility. One of the solutions to help mitigating those problems can be the integration of Energy Storage Systems (ESS) with renewable energy sources such as solar and/or wind. An efficient and safe control algorithm and an Energy Management System (EMS) are required to share energy from the ESS technology and the RES to the electric power system. In this paper, a brief review of some of the main EMS techniques which will be extensively reviewed and discussed from related papers. Typical applications and their classification are reviewed, as well as a comparative analysis and the selection of an EMS technique, considering several approaches, is presented.
