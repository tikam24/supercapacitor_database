The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of the use of high density pulsed current (using supercapacitor) on the fatigue life of the tested specimens. For this purpose, experimental analyses were carried out for a two group of samples: without current pulsation and after current exposure. The results of the study for AISI 304 steel (0.04% C, 1.2% Mn, 18.16% Cr, 8% Ni, 0.335% Mo, 0.041% Si) for fatigue strength were presented. The experiments were performed on single edge notched tensile specimen (SENT) with U-shaped electro-drilling (W = 15mm, t = 0.5mm, a 0 = 2.5mm). Positive current pulses with different durations and frequencies were used. The tests were carried out on a hydraulic pulsator MTS 810, controlled by a constant force amplitude F max = 1100N.
