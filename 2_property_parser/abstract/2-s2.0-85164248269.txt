Transition metal selenides (TMSs) are viewed as a prospective high-capacity electrode material for asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs). However, the inability to expose sufficient active sites due to the limitation of the area involved in the electrochemical reaction severely limits their inherent supercapacitive properties. Herein, a self-sacrificing template strategy is developed to prepare self-supported CuCoSe (CuCoSe@rGO-NF) nanosheet arrays by in situ construction of copper-cobalt bimetallic organic framework (CuCo-MOF) on rGO-modified nickel foam (rGO-NF) and rational design of Se2- exchange process. Nanosheet arrays with high specific surface area are considered to be ideal platforms for accelerating electrolyte penetration and exposing rich electrochemical active sites. As a result, the CuCoSe@rGO-NF electrode delivers a high specific capacitance of 1521.6 F/g at 1 A/g, good rate performance and an excellent capacitance retention of 99.5% after 6000 cycles. The assembled ASC device has a high energy density of 19.8 Wh kg−1 at 750 W kg−1 and an ideal capacitance retention of 86.2% after 6000 cycles. This proposed strategy offers a viable strategy for designing and constructing electrode materials with superior energy storage performance.
