Nickel-doped cerium oxide nanoparticles were decorated on delaminated Titanium carbonitride MXene described as (d-Ti3CN@NiCeO2) through one step in-situ hydrothermal method. The nanocomposites were characterized through several techniques (XRD, XPS, SEM, and STEM). d-Ti3CN MXene as well as d-Ti3CN@NiCeO2 was fabricated and as an electrode material for supercapacitor applications and their performance was evaluated using cyclic volatmmetery, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Results showed that the synergistic effect of d-Ti3CN MXene and NiCeO2 nanoparticles in d-Ti3CN@NiCeO2 electrode material were responsible for better capacitance and stability. This novel material exhibited outstanding specific capacitance (444 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1), low internal resistance, and outstanding cyclic stability (79% after 8000 cycles). d-Ti3CN@NiCeO2 displayed exceptional specific capacitance (41 F g−1 at 10 A g−1) as compared to that of d-Ti3CN MXene (28 F g−1), as well as high energy density (5.7 Wh kg−1). The results demonstrate that d-Ti3CN@NiCeO2 is an efficient electrode material with superior electrochemical performance and can be potentially applied for fabrication of symmetric supercapacitors.
