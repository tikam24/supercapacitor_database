Supercapacitors (SCs) have been considered as the most promising energy storage device due to high power density, long cycle life, and fast energy storage and efficient delivery. The excellent electrode materials of SCs generally have based on large porous structure, excellent conductivity, and heteroatom doping for charge transfer. Among various electrode materials, biomass-derived carbon materials have received widespread attention owing to excellent performances, environmental friendliness, low-cost and renewability. Additionally, composites materials based on biomass-derived carbon and transition metal-based material can obtain more advantages of structural and performance than single component, which opens up a new way for the fabrication of high-performance SC electrode materials. Therefore, this review aims to the recent progress on the design and fabrication of biomass-derived carbons/transition metal-based composites in supercapacitor application. Finally, the development trends and challenges of biomass-derived electrode materials have been discussed and prospected. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
