Today during sports activities and in health rehabilitation, various electronic monitoring tools are in use quite commonly. Sports persons and patients often are embedded into a personal body sensor network, which traces different parameters of their physiological activity. Heart rate sensors are the most typical devices, but all kinds of meters, e.g., for counting foot steps and pedal turning are often also used in parallel. Concerning power supply, it has commonly established that these sensor devices are autonomously operated as very tiny computer systems from lithium battery cells. Exchanging such sensor batteries from time to time is expensive, the mechanical handling of this step is not very easy due to the small sensor housings, and it has to be regarded that using throwaway batteries represents a waste of resources. In this work an alternative power cell for sport sensors is investigated, which bases on the use of so-called supercapacitors. Advantages of this approach and its possible application range are discussed, while the study is founded on practical experiments from endurance sports. Finally, the study is complemented with concepts for sensor charging including possible smartphone app guidance of its user handling and future self-harvesting of electrical energy by sensors themselves.
