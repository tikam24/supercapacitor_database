Energy is ultimate need for mankind activity and for fruitful and social invention but due to rise in population linked with global warming and faster observance of fossil fuel resources, human being is in desirous need of alternative technologies based on Renewable Energy Sources(RES). The grid integration of RES is most promising technology nowadays. It will reduce the load on the grid. On the contorory, this integration introduces issues in the grid system. The integration of RES has an impact on Power Quality, Stability, Voltage Ride Through(VRT), Active and Reactive Power Control of Grid. This paper analyse the impact on power quality of grid when integrated with RES. This paper discusses the challenges of grid integration of large scale RES. Moreover, it reviews the various mitigation techniques of power quality issues. The Energy Storage System(ESS) is one method to damps out power quality issues. The ESS consists various type of Batteries, Supercapacitor, Superconducting Magnetic Energy System(SMES), Flywheel, etc. Hybrid Energy Storage System(HESS) is noval concept which is reviewd in this paper.
