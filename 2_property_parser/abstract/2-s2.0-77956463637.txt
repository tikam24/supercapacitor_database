Manganese-vanadium oxide had been synthe-sized by a novel simple precipitation technique. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, thermogravimetric analysis/differential scanning calorimetry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to characterize Mn-V binary oxide and δ-MnO 2. Electrochemical capacitive behavior of the synthesized Mn-V binary oxide and δ-MnO 2 was investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostic charge-discharge curve, and electrochemical impedance spectroscope methods. The results showed that, by introducing V into δ-MnO 2, the specific surface area of the mixed oxide increased due to a formation of small grain size. The specific capacitance increased from 166 F g -1 estimated for MnO 2 to 251 F g -1 for Mn-V binary oxide, and the applied potential window extended to -0.2-1.0 V (vs. saturated calomel electrode). Through analysis, it is suggested that the capacitance performance of Mn-V binary oxide materials may be improved by changing the following three factors: (1) small grain and particle size and large activity surface area, (2) appropriate amount of lattice water, and (3) chemical state on the surface of MnO 2 material. © Springer-Verlag 2009.
