Herein, we report the fabrication of composite electrode (PyHCP-800/PANI) by two step method. Firstly, hypercross-linked polymer of pyrene (PyHCP) synthesized by a simple Friedel-Crafts alkylation method and subsequent carbonization at 800 °C to yield porous carbon of PyHCP (PyHCP-800). Secondly, polyaniline (PANI) was electrochemically grown on the surface of PyHCP-800. The synthesized PyHCP and PyHCP-800 was characterized by physicochemical characterization techniques. The composite shows excellent electrochemical behavior than pristine PyHCP-800 and PANI electrode. In three electrode system, PyHCP-800/PANI composite exhibits specific capacitance of 62.6 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1. Also, the fabricated symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) device (PyHCP-800/PANI || PyHCP-800/PANI) delivers outstanding cycle life with 90.67% retention for 2000 cycles.
