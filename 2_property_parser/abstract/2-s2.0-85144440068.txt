The low electrical conductivity of CeO2 hinders its gravimetric capacitance (CS) despite its good redox property. Therefore, this work aims to improve the gravimetric capacitance of CeO2, by compositing it with a suitable material. Here, the oxygen-incorporated 1T/2H hybrid MoS2 is composited with CeO2 (CeO2/O-MoS2), as it improves the electrical conductivity and CS. This is evident from the enhanced gravimetric capacitance value of 429.41 F/g at 0.5 A/g in 0.5 M of H2SO4 by the CeO2/O-MoS2 composite, compared to the low value of 87.76 F/g of pristine CeO2. The lower electrochemical impedance values of the composite concur with the enhanced gravimetric capacitance of the composite, compared to the pristine CeO2. The same composite in a symmetric two-electrode system at 0.5 A/g showed a gravimetric capacitance value of 167.37 F/g with 95.49% capacitance retention after 4000 cycles at 10 A/g in 0.5 M of H2SO4.
