Biomass-derived graphene-like material is a promising candidate for supercapacitor electrodes, while it is critical to controllably convert biomass into structure-tunable graphene. Herein, few-layer graphene-like biochar (FLGBS) was successfully fabricated from waste biomass in molten carbonate medium. Molten carbonate acted as the effective catalyst for graphitizing and the liquid medium for microcrystal relinking to achieve the rearrangement of carbon structure. It was found that the stacking of graphene layer and formation of porous structure were influenced by the volume of reaction medium and biomass pre‑carbonation. Namely, increasing the dosage of molten K2CO3 was in favor to form few layer-type graphene structure, but excess dosage could destroy the nanopore structure to expand the aperture. In addition, pre‑carbonation at high temperature impeded the exfoliation of graphene layers. When FLGBSs were applied to fabricate conductive additive-free electrode, they displayed a superior supercapacitor performance (up to 237.4 F g−1 at 0.5 Ag−1). This excellent performance should be attributed to the large specific surface area, hierarchical pore structure and graphene-like structure. In short, this work could help to get insights into the structural evolution of biomass carbon to graphene-like biochar in molten carbonate medium and achieve the tailoring of microstructure for further application in energy storage.
