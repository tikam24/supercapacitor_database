Thickness and specific surface area of the film electrode are critical parameters for supercapacitors. The relationship between the thickness and the specific surface area of the film directly affects the capacitance and electrochemical stability performance of super supercapacitors, which virtually affects the contact chance of ion in the electrolyte on the surface of electrode and the ion transport path of electrode. In this paper, the CrN thin films with a thickness of 200–3500 nm are prepared using direct current magnetron sputtering. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique is introduced to investigate the relationship between thickness and the specific surface area of the CrN films. The electrochemical performances of CrN electrode with the nanoporousper structure is analyzed in different electrolytes H2SO4, Na2SO4 and NaCl aquous solutions. The specific surface area of the film increases linearly with the film thickness increases. The areal capacitance is also linearly related to the specific surface area. The spurtted CrN film with a thickness of 3370 nm has a specific surface of up to 43.59 cm2 per cm2 footprint area. Its areal and volume capacitances reache to 53.92 mF cm−2 and 650 F cm−3 at 5 mV s−1, respectively. In addition, the areal capacitance of CrN film electrode with 655 nm possesses reaches to 40.53 mF cm−2 for 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, 32.69 mF cm−2 for 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution and 9.17 mF cm−2 for NaCl solution at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. Furthermore, the CrN film electrode exhibits excellent capacitance retention of 95.3%, 93.8% and 89.9% in H2SO4, Na2SO4 and NaCl electrolytes, respectively, after 2000 cycles. Therefore, the sputtered CrN thin film is an potential electrode material for electrochemical supercapacitors.
