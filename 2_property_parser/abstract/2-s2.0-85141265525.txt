Two-dimensional layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been considered as potential electrode materials due to their unique structures. Since most of TMDs exhibit inherently poor conductivity with limited electrochemical performance, the metallic group VB TMDs have attracted numerous attentions in energy storage applications. Herein, a systematic overview of the group VB TMDs used for electrochemical energy storage is presented. Their basic characteristics, such as crystal and electronic structures, charge density wave, and magnetic properties are introduced. The preparation methods of them are summarized, including top-down and bottom-up methods. Then their applications in alkali ion batteries (LIBs/NIBs/KIBs), multivalent ion batteries (ZIBs/MIBs/AIBs), and supercapacitors (SCs) are reviewed and discussed. Finally, the challenges, possible solutions, and prospects of them applied to electrochemical energy storage would be concluded.
