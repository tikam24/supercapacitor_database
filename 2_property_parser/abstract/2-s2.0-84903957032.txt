Graphite oxide (GO) powder was irradiated in a microwave oven and lightweight expanded graphite oxide (EGO) powder with high BET surface area 1316 m2/g was obtained. Activation of EGO was performed by impregnation in KOH solution and high temperature treatment under Ar flow, followed by annealing in vacuum (t-EGO). KOH acted more as a reducing agent diminishing the defects than as a surface modifier for high porosity. EGO and t-EGO were further decorated with Ag nanoparticles (âˆ¼40 nm) applying solar light irradiation. Along with Ag deposition the structural defects of the graphene were reduced upon photo-irradiation. It was established that among the bare graphenes the EGO exhibited the highest capacitance. From the Ag-containing composites, the KOH activated EGO acted as a supercapacitor, while the non-activated EGO as a resistant.
