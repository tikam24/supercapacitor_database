A single hybrid energy conversion and storage (HECS) cell of alpha-cobalt hydroxide (α-Co(OH)2) in ionic liquid was fabricated and operated under light illumination. The α-Co(OH)2, which is unstable in an aqueous electrolyte (i.e. KOH), is surprisingly stable in 1-butyl-1-methyl-pyrrolidinium dicyanamide ionic liquid. The as-fabricated HECS cell provides 100% coulombic efficiency and 99.99% capacity retention over 2000 cycles. Under a photo-charging condition, the dicyanamide anion of ionic liquid can react with a generated α-Co(OH)2 + hole at the positive electrode since the HOMO energy level of the anion is close to the valence band of α-Co(OH)2. The excited photoelectron will transfer to the current collector and move to the negative electrode. At the negative electrode, the 1-butyl-1-methyl-pyrrolidinium cations of ionic liquid do electrostatically adsorb on the surface and intercalate into the interlayer of active material stabilizing the whole cell. The HECS cell having both energy conversion (photovoltaic effect) and energy storage (supercapacitor) properties may be an ideal device for future renewable energy.
