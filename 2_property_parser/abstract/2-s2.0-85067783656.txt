For the first time, an all-pseudocapacitve supercapacitor based on Co and Fe nanospinel oxide coatings was developed for application in alkaline solution. The Co3O4 nanoflakes and the Fe3O4 nanospheres are coated on Ni foam by a simple autocombustion method without a binder. They exhibit pseudocapacitive behavior with high areal capacitances of 691 m F cm−2 and 404 m F cm−2, respectively that originates from multiple electron transfer reactions. Furthermore, systematic studies of the two electrodes during 4000 charge-discharge cycles by cyclic voltammetry, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveal high performance stability that are due to the multiple reversible redox reactions. Finally, the practical application of the electrodes was investigated in an asymmetric supercapacitor. The supercapacitor showed a capacitance of 191.6 m F cm−2, and average energy and power densities of 52.5 μWh cm−2 and 1.2 mW cm−2. This performance for a supercapacitor that is developed by a low-cost and sustainable process is highly appealing for practical applications.
