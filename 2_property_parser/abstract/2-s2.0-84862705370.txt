Electrolytes of 1 M blend salts (LiPF 6 and tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate, Et 4NBF 4) have been investigated in supercapacitor battery system with composite LiMn 2O 4 and activated carbon (AC) cathode, and Li 4Ti 5O 12 anode. The results obtained with the blend salts electrolytes are compared with those obtained with cells build using standard 1 M LiPF 6 dissolved in ethylene carbonate+dimethyl carbonate+ethyl (methyl) carbonate (EC+DMC+EMC, 1:1:1 wt.%) as electrolyte. It is found that the blend salts electrolyte performs better on both electrochemical and galvanostatic cycling stability, especially cycled at 4 C rate. When the concentration of LiPF 6 is 0.2 M and Et 4NBF 4 is 0.8 M, the capacity retention of the battery is 96.23% at 4 C rate after 5,000 cycles, much higher than that of the battery with standard 1 M LiPF 6 electrolyte, which is only 62.35%. These results demonstrate that the blend salts electrolyte can improve the galvanostatic cycling stability of the super-capacity battery. Electrolyte of 0.2 M LiPF 6+0.8 M Et 4NBF 4 in EC+DMC+EMC (1:1:1 wt.%) is a promising electrolyte for (LiMn 2O 4+AC)/Li 4Ti 5O 12. Â© 2011 Springer-Verlag.
