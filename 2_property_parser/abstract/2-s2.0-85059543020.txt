Significantly boosting the energy densities of supercapacitors without compromising their power densities is of paramount importance for practical applications, but still faces great challenges. Herein, we report an ultrahigh-energy-density solid-state supercapacitor enabled by synergistical design of a N, O co-doped honeycomb porous carbon (HPC) electrode and an ionogel electrolyte. HPC is synthesized through the co-assembly of melamine/formaldehyde with silica spheres, and shows an ultrahigh surface area (2379 m 2 g -1 ) coupled with a 3D interconnected macro-, meso- and microporous structure, and high-level redox-active N/O dopants (6.90 and 10.17 wt%). Benefiting from such merits, the HPC electrode yields an extremely high capacitance of 533 F g -1 at 0.5 A g -1 in an alkaline electrolyte, together with superior cycling stability with 92.1% capacitance retention after 20000 cycles at 5 A g -1 . HPC assembled supercapacitors deliver energy outputs of 12.8 and 26.6 W h kg -1 using KOH and Na 2 SO 4 electrolytes, respectively. More attractively, a HPC-fabricated all-solid-state symmetric device based on the use of a well-designed, polymer-gel supported ionic liquid electrolyte achieves an ultrahigh energy density of 94.1 W h kg -1 , which is the highest value among those of previously reported supercapacitors of the same type, and an excellent cycling stability (91.5% retention over 10000 cycles). This study highlights promising prospects of developing solid-state energy storage systems of high energy-power supply.
