We report a novel interpenetrating three-dimentional (3D) macroporous graphene aerogels (GAs) composite consisting of MnO2 wrapping for potential supercapacitor applications. In this article, the macroporous GAs holds abundant of interconnected macroporous and has excellent intrinsic high electrical conductivity resulting from the graphene. Therefore, employing the GAs as the substrates to combine with MnO2 will exhibit excellent electronic conductivity and effective ion-transport capability. The 3D macroporous MnO2/GAs composite has a specific capacitance of 200 F g-1. Thus, the corresponding 3D porous hierarchical GAs/MnO2 materials have a great potential to be used in the field of supercapacitors. This strategy could also be used for other materials to improve the performance of supercapacitors.
