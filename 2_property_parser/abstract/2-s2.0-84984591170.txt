A novel symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) consisting of urea combustion derived mesoporous Li2MnSiO4 (LMS) in aqueous electrolyte is investigated for the first time. The morphological and surface area analysis were conducted using FESEM and N2 adsorption/desorption measurements confirming the presence of mesopores with good surface area of nanocrystalline LMS. The electrochemical investigation of the SSC is examined using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) cycling, and the results are complimented with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 2 M KOH aqueous solution. SSC exhibits the specific capacitance (Cs) of 40(±2) F g-1 at 3 mV s-1 and 42(±2) F g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 in voltage window ranging from -0.65 V to +0.65 V. GCD analysis illustrates good capacity retention and cyclability up to 1000 cycles. This improved performance of LMS in terms of rate capability, cyclability is mainly attributed to its unique morphology where high surface area and mesoporosity enables facile and smooth transportation of foreign electrolytic ions, and thereby increase the participation of active material in device.
