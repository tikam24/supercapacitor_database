The multi-layered electrodeposition of polyaniline on stainless steel substrate was carried out using three electrochemical techniques such as potentiodynamic (PD), potentiostatic (PS), galvanostatic (GS) and three different dopants such as sulphuric acid (SA), p-toluene sulphonic acid (PTSA) and camphor-10-sulphonic acid (CSA). The structural properties of multi-layered polymer films were analysed by SEM, AFM and FTIR. The electrochemical properties of multi-layered films were analysed by cyclic voltammetry and AC impedance spectroscopy. The results showed that the highest specific capacitance of 468 F/g was obtained for those multi-layered electrode materials developed using potentiodynamic method. As per the highest specific capacitance value, potentiodynamic method was chosen for multi-layer deposition of polyaniline. Symmetrical supercapacitors were fabricated using multi-layered polyaniline, and the supercapacitive properties were analysed by galvanostatic charge-discharge technique.
