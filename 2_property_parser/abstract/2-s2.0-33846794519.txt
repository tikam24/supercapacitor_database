Novel internal PEM fuel cell/energy storage hybrid power systems were fabricated to improve the pulse power output of the system by incorporating supercapacitor element (Ru2OÂ·xH2O) and battery element (CeZrO2) into the catalyst layer of fuel cells. The continual power output of the internal PEM fuel cell/energy storage hybrid power system is similar to the conventional PEM fuel cell. However, the peak power output of the hybrid system was much higher than that of the conventional system. copyright The Electrochemical Society.
