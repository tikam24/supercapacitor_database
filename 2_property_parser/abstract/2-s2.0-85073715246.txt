The Cu(OH)2@Cd(OH)2 core-shell nanowire structure have been successfully synthesized by facile cation exchange reaction based on negative free energy of formation through topotactical transformation from their cadmium hydroxide to copper hydroxide. The encapsulation of the copper into the cadmium hydroxide nanowires was confirmed by X-ray diffraction studies, elemental analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Electrochemical study shows that Cu(OH)2@Cd(OH)2 core-shell nanowire structure possess high specific capacitance of 374 Fgâˆ’1 in an aqueous 1 M NaOH electrolyte. Present work demonstrates Cu(OH)2@Cd(OH)2 nanowires, synthesis and application as supercapacitive electrode.
