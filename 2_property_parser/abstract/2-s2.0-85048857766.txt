The rod-shaped CeO2@C architectures have been synthesized by novel and facile methods initially from metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). The MOF-derived material showed a pseudocapacitance of 1102 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 and 418 F g−1 at a high current density of 20 A g−1 and had excellent cyclic stability of about 2.3% decrease after 5000 cycles. Results revealed that favorable effects of dispersed partially graphitic carbon in the CeO2@C composite could improve electronic conductivity, which made this product be an alternative high-performance electrode for supercapacitors.
