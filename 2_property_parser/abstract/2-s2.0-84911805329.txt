The purpose of the studies described was to examine the influence of low-energy plasma modification of polyamide and polypropylene polymer nonwoven fabrics on the usable properties of supercapacitors when using these fabrics as the separator material. To achieve this goal the following investigations were carried out: testing the time required for electrolyte saturation of separators and the conductivity of the electrolyte contained in the separator, as well as electrochemical examinations of supercapacitor models in which the modified fabric separators were used. The tests conducted fully confirm the usability of this modification for cleaning the surface and improving the wettability of separators by the electrolyte, which in turn results in a significant decrease of the internal resistance of the supercapacitor, thus increasing the usable power of the device.
