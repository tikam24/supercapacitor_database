Nickel‐foam‐supported ZnxNi1−xS nanosheets are synthesized by a two‐step hydrothermal method. The ZnxNi1−xS nanosheets can be considered as the product of the partial substitution of Zn2+ ions by Ni2+ ions in the ZnS lattice. The resulting ZnxNi1−xS/Ni foam can be directly used as an electrode for supercapacitors. It can reach a specific capacitance of 1412 F g−1 at a current density of 1 Ag−1 with 68.0 % capacitance retention at 16 Ag−1. Control experiments show that the electrochemical performances of ZnxNi1−xS nanosheets are much better than those of ZnS and NiS prepared under the same conditions. Furthermore, a hybrid supercapacitor device was assembled by using the ZnxNi1−xS nanosheets as the positive electrode and porous carbon as the negative electrode; the device exhibited high power and energy densities. This study demonstrates that the construction of bimetal sulfides is a strategy to develop high‐performance supercapacitor electrode materials.
