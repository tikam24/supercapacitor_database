High-voltage DC-bus power quality is examined experimentally and by computer simulation during a short-circuit fault across the phase terminals of a five-phase, permanent magnet fault-tolerant generator. The DC-bus transients are seen to exceed the limits in MIL-STD-704F [1] and a control algorithm is proposed for a supercapacitor-based energy storage device that mitigates the transients. The controller performance is illustrated by computer simulations.
