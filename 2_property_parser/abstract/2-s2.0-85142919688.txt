In this research, symmetrical and inexpensive flexible electrodes were fabricated from Ethaline deep eutectic solvent (DES) on a graphite substrate. The growth potentials in DES and cycling performance of Fe- and Ni-based films in KOH were investigated. The modified electrodes had two redox peaks separated from each other due to the difference between the electroactive potential of Fe- and Ni-based reactions. Iron- and nickel-based redox reactions occur on the negative and positive sides, respectively. Furthermore, they do not affect each other when they are active in different potentials. Therefore, only one straightforward fabrication step can be applied to obtain electrodes which can be used as both positive and negative electrodes. The maximum areal capacitance of Fe–Ni alloy electrodes reached a maximum value of 79.6 mF cm−2. Charge–discharge curves and self-discharge performances of the films electrodeposited potentiostatically by the application of different deposition voltages were investigated.
