This work highlights the electrochemical properties of as-synthesized cobalt and manganese metal–organic frameworks. The electrochemical redox behavior of Co-MOF and Mn-MOF electrode was investigated in 0.1 M KOH solution by cyclic voltammetry. The rectangular CV curve obtained by the Mn-MOF electrode implies the pseudocapacitor act from the surface redox reaction of Mn. Well separated oxidation and reduction peaks achieved by the Co-MOF electrode implied the battery like behavior. For battery, the charge is represented as the capacity and the calculated capacity for the Co-MOF was 1064.3 mhAg−1 at 0.1 Ag−1. For pseudocapacitor, capacitance should be used, and achieved capacitance by Mn-MOF electrode was 483 Fg−1 at constant current density 1 Ag−1. With this delineation in mind, it should be clear that Co-MOF is suitable for battery purpose and Mn-MOF is suitable for pseudocapacitor application.
