Interesting findings on the application of NASICON structured fast ionic Li 1.3Al0.3Ti 1.7(PO4)3 (LATP) to solid-state supercapacitors have been reported. The LATP added with various solid polymer electrolytes exhibits high ionic conductivity of ∼10−4 Ω−1 cm−1 at 40 °C. The supercapacitors fabricated using these electrolyte membranes display an optimized voltage window of 0–2 V at 1 mA (1.43 Ag−1). These show high specific capacitance ∼100 Fg−1 with specific energy ∼14 Whkg−1, specific power ∼ 682 Wkg−1, and coulombic efficiency ≥97% with excellent stability at least up to ∼2500 charge-discharge cycles. A good correlation is seen between the solid electrolyte membrane conductivity and supercapacitor performance. The performance parameters are in range with many of the gel/liquid-based electric double layer supercapacitors reported earlier.
