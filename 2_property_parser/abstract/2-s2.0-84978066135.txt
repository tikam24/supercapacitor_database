In this work, a mechanism of catalytic graphitization of D-glucose derived carbon during NaOH activation process is disclosed. The catalytic graphitization is caused by sodium atom, which is produced in the reaction between NaOH and carbon. Due to the combined action of activation and catalytic graphitization resulting from the NaOH, the activated D-glucose derived carbon behaves as a hierarchical micro-and meso-porous structure and has high electrical conductivity. Electrochemical investigations demonstrate that the activated sample exhibits an outstanding rate capability (70% of capacity retention even at a scan rate of 2V s-1) and high specific capacitance (106F g-1) in 6M KOH aqueous electrolyte, which makes it a promising electrode material for high-power supercapacitors.
