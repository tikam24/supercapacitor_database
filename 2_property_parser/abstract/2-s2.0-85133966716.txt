The pristine silver metal-organic framework (Ag-MOF) is successfully synthesized by the one-pot synthesis method. It serves as the effective electrode material for supercapacitor application because of its excellent conductive frame network and electrochemical activities. The crystal structure, surface morphology, porosity, and chemical configuration of the Ag-MOF are studied and analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The electrochemical behavior of the electrode material is determined using galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The aggregated platelike morphology of Ag-MOF provides more electrochemical active sites and shortens the pathway for ion intercalation/deintercalation which results in outstanding electrochemical performance. The maximum specific capacity of 606.2 C g-1is achieved at a current density of 1 A g-1in the three-electrode system. The asymmetric supercapacitor device delivers the maximum energy density of 48.69 W h kg-1at a power density of 608.73 W kg-1. Furthermore, the fabricated device retains an attractive cyclic stability of 131.14% for 5000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g-1claimed as the novel electrode material in the area of energy storage.
