Mesoporous NiCo 2 O 4 @MnO 2 nanoneedle arrays as electrode materials for supercapacitor grown on a conductive nickel foam were prepared by a facile hydrothermal route. The interconnected mesoporous structure of the NiCo 2 O 4 nanoneedle arrays provides a large specific surface area for charge storage. The electrochemically active MnO 2 nanoparticles covered on the surface of NiCo 2 O 4 nanoneedle result in a favorable synergistic storage effect because of charge redistribution at the NiCo 2 O 4 |MnO 2 interface, which reduces the interfacial polarization and facilitates ion diffusion. The initial specific capacitance of NiCo 2 O 4 @MnO 2 (S2) is 1001 F g −1 at current density of 15 A g −1 . The capacity retention of S2 is about 87.4% after 4000 cycles, and the specific capacitance of S2 electrode only decreases from 1001 F g −1 to 736 F g −1 even after 10,000 cycles. The first-principles calculations show that a chemical bonding between the NiCo 2 O 4 and MnO 2 is not only helpful for stabilizing the composites but also leads to a charge redistribution at the interface, which may lead to a smaller interfacial polarization and thus beneficial for the interfacial capacity. The excellent electrochemical performance of NiCo 2 O 4 @MnO 2 composites (S2) can be ascribed to the high surface area, unique architecture, MnO 2 nanoparticle modification, reduced charge transfer resistance and stable interface between NiCo 2 O 4 and MnO 2 . The simple material synthesis and architectural design strategy provides new insights in opportunities to exhibit promising potential for practical application in energy storage.
