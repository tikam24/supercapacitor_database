Cobalt-nickel oxide/VGCF(vapor grown carbon fiber) composites were prepared by thermally decomposing cobalt and nickel nitrates directly onto the pore of nickel foam as a current collector and their electrochemical properties were investigated by means of cyclic voltammetry. Cyclic voltammetry for the cobalt-nickel oxide/VGCF composite electrode exhibited specific capacitance values of 1271 Fg-1 at a scan rate of 5 mVs-1 based on cobalt-nickel oxide. SEM images showed that the VGCFs were well-dispersed in the bulk matrix of the cobalt-nickel oxide to give electrical conductivity. It is concluded that the VGCF played the roles in reducing the interfacial resistance in the cobalt-nickel oxide to improve capacitance performance.
