Mn2O3 nanoflake type electrode for supercapacitor applications has been successfully electrodeposited on stainless steel (SS) current collector by potentiostatic way without using any binder or capping agent. Structural, morphological and compositional properties of the prepared Mn2O3 electrodes were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy techniques, respectively. The XRD study revealed Mn2O3 nanoparticles exhibiting body centered cubic (BCC) crystal structure confirmed using JCPDS no. 89-2809. The FESEM images show nanoflake, lamellar and porous morphology suitable for electrochemical applications. The formation of Mn2O3 was confirmed using FTIR spectra. The electrochemical performance of Mn2O3 electrode was investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in Na2SO4, NaOH and KCl electrolytes. It is revealed that the 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte is well suited for Mn2O3 nanoflake type electrode for supercapacitor applications exhibiting specific capacitance (Csp) of 508 Fgm -1 at a scan rate of 5 mVs -1. The better Csp values may be due to large active sites and rapid ionic transport across the Mn2O3 electrode's surface. Analysis of the electrochemical stability of the Mn2O3 electrode exhibits a capacity retention value of 83 % after 1000 cycles in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte at a scan rate of 100 mVs -1.
