In this paper we have shown enhanced supercapacitive property of electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) and manganese dioxide (MnO 2) based heterostructure over single MnO2 thin film grown by electrochemical deposition on indium tin oxide (ITO). ERGO improves the electrical conduction leading to decrease of the internal resistance of the heterostructure. Â© 2013 American Institute of Physics.
