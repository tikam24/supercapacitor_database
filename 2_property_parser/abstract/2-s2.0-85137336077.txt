An integrated system based on nine-switch converter is implemented in direct-drive wave linear generator with hybrid battery/supercapacitor energy storage system. Firstly, the connection mode of nine-switch converter, linear generator and hybrid energy storage is determined. Secondly, based on the analysis of the working state of the nine-switch converter, a special carrier based modulation method is adopted as the modulation principle. Then, the zero d-axis current control strategy is applied to linear generator, and the low-pass filter method based on voltage-current loop is used to stabilize dc bus voltage and distribute the current of battery and supercapacitor. Finally, the system simulation model is established in Matlab/Simulink, and the simulation results show that the nine-switch converter can be applied to the direct-drive wave energy storage system and can achieve the same operating characteristics as the conventional topology.
