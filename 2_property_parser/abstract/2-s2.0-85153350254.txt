This paper mainly studies the impact of different energy management strategies (EMS) on a fuel cell hybrid power system. The system contains fuel cell, battery and supercapacitors, which can be applied to the all-electric propulsion unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) through a simulation model. Considering the load demand of the UAV and the output energy state of the fuel cell under different operating conditions, this paper compares the output characteristics of the hybrid power system using state machine control strategy, traditional PI control strategy and equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS). Finally, suitable EMS can be provided for the actual operation of the UAV based on the comparisons results. Besides, the strategy can also be used to enhance the output characteristic performance and the fuel cell lifespan.
