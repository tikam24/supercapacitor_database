In this study, a quite simple method has been represented for the fabrication of polymeric crosslinked graphene nanocomposite and examined for supercapacitance properties. Since most of the azo dyes display the conjugated structures, their contribution to enhance the conductivity and capacitance of carbon containing compounds such as graphene could be an interesting area. Therefore, in the present work, chrysoidine (CHRYS) was polymerized in the presence of graphene oxide (GO) in which the produced polychrysoidine (PCHRYS) acted as a cross linker for GO nanosheets. The optimized components ratio of GO:PCHRYS forms the efficient porous graphene oxide-polychrysoidine (GO-PCHRYS) nanocomposite which easily stores charge and represents a rather high specific capacitance of 715.3 F g−1 at the current density of 0.5 A g−1. The electrode stability was determined after 10000 cycles via comparing initial and final capacitance and the results indicated that 89.8% of the initial capacitance had been maintained.
