LaxSr1-xCo0.1Mn0.9O3-δ (0.3 ≤ x ≤ 1) perovskite nanofibers (LNF-x) are firstly prepared by a simple electrospinning method. The microstructure, morphology and electrochemical properties of LaxSr1-xCo0.1Mn0.9O3-δ (0.3 ≤ x ≤ 1) are systematically studied through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area measurements and electrochemical analyzer etc. The results show that the nanofibers maintain the fibrous structure with perovskite phase after annealed at 700 °C. And with the increase of Sr content in LaxSr1-xCo0.1Mn0.9O3-δ (0.3 ≤ x ≤ 1), the diameter range of the samples tend to decrease and the roughness of surface enlarge as well. Furthermore, when 1 M KOH electrolyte is employed, a maximum capacitance of 485 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 is achieved for the LNF-0.7 as electrode material.
