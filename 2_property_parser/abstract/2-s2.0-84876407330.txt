Uniform nanostructures of cobalt hydroxide were successfully prepared by a low-temperature electrochemical method via galvanostatically deposition from a 0.005 M Co(NO 3 ) 3 bath at 10 °C. The XRD and FT-IR analyses showed that the prepared sample has a single crystalline hexagonal phase of the brucite-like Co(OH) 2 . Morphological characterization by SEM and TEM revealed that the prepared β-Co(OH) 2 was composed of uniform compact disc-like nanostructures with diameters of 40-50 nm. The electrochemical performance of the prepared β-Co(OH) 2 was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry and charge-discharge tests. A maximum specific capacitance of 736.5 F g -1 was obtained in aqueous 1 M KOH with the potential range of -0.2-0.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at the scan rate of 10 mV s -1 , suggesting the potential application of the prepared nanostructures as an electrode material in electrochemical supercapacitors. The results of this work showed that the low-temperature cathodic electrodeposition method can be recognized as a new and facile route for the synthesis of cobalt hydroxide nanodiscs as a promising candidate for the electrochemical supercapacitors. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.
