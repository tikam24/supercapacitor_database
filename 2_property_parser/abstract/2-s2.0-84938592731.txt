Ultra-thin hollow carbon nanospheres (UTH-CNs) are fabricated for use as anodes of asymmetric sodium ion pseudocapacitors. The âˆ¼3nm thick amorphous carbon walls obtained from regenerated silk proteins as a template exhibit a well-defined porous structure suitable for reversible sodium-ion storage. The UTH-CNs show remarkable electrochemical activity with sodium via a pseudocapacitive reaction, delivering a large reversible capacity as well as superior rate performance for more than 1000 cycles. The pseudocapacitors based on UTH-CNs exhibit a capacitance of 186Fg<sup>-1</sup>, a specific energy of 43Whkg<sup>-1</sup> and a power density of 10kWkg<sup>-1</sup>. This represents the highest value yet reported for asymmetric sodium-ion storage pseudocapacitors. Thin-skinned: Ultra-thin hollow carbon nanospheres (UTH-CNs) are fabricated as anodes for asymmetric sodium-ion storage pseudocapacitors. The pseudocapacitors based on UTH-CNs and commercially available porous carbon cathodes exhibit the most favorable performance metrics yet reported for asymmetric sodium-ion storage pseudocapacitors.
