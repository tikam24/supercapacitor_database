Abstract: In addition to obtaining necessary dynamic characteristics and broadly using modern solid-state traction converters, intensified electric rolling stock (ERS) traffic flow and increased travel speeds have a significant influence on the catenary system and cause voltage dips and surges. This article considers the possibility of stabilizing the voltage of a catenary system section by means of an automatic voltage stabilizer that uses the energy accumulated in an electricity storage device. This stabilizer is designed as a reversible solid-state converter used to charge and discharge the energy storage device. The proposed formulas are used to make up a mathematical model the main strength of which is the usage of real data collected from urban ERS traffic flows. The test results show that a voltage stabilizer using the energy of the storage device can reduce the influence of ERS on the catenary system voltage.
