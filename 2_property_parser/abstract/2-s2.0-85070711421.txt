NiCo2O4/rGO microspheres were synthesized by a hydrothermal reaction followed by a spray drying process. The existence of a rGO coating layer was responsible for a conductivity improvement and fast charge transport kinetics. Furthermore, an elastic matrix of rGO reinforced the structure stability and accommodated the volume expansion of the NiCo2O4 particles. Based on the above advantages, the NiCo2O4/rGO presented excellent electrochemical performance, such as an impressive specific capacitance (702 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1) and notable cycling stability, maintaining 98.3% of the initial specific capacitance after 10000 charge-discharge cycles at 0.5 A g−1. This simplified method is not only potentially beneficial for spinel-type hybrid electrode materials but also potentially suitable for mass production.
