Supercapacitors are a new technology that promises to be an electrical energy storage device in the future. Supercapacitor electrodes derived from activated carbon have high power and energy capabilities because they have a high surface area, high conductivity, and the ability of activated carbon to optimize the properties of supercapacitors. This paper also describes the manufacture of supercapacitor electrode materials by utilizing activated carbon from various biomass and supercapacitor performance compared to batteries. The effect of the activation method, type of activator, type of electrolyte, carbonation or pyrolysis process used will determine the energy and density of energy produced by the supercapacitor. In this case the process of forming an electric double layer on the surface of the electrode was also reviewed and the effect of the type of electrolyte used on the performance of supercapacitors. The use of organic electrolytes can improve the performance of supercapacitors but in the ecological terms the use of acetonitrile solvents is not good for the environment. In this paper we recommend the simplest and lowest-cost fabrication technology but has better performance than the technology of poets such as lithium and alkaline batteries.
