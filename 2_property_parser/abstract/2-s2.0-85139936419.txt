Stretchable and flexible supercapacitors with high energy and power densities are in demand for applications in wearable electronics. Here we report a highly stretchable and flexible supercapacitor based on electrospun PEDOT:SSEBS microfiber mats as the supercapacitor electrodes and a freeze-thawed PVA-H2SO4 hydrogel as the solid-state electrolyte. The electrodes are prepared by electrospinning of porous SSEBS microfiber mats and oxidative polymerisation of PEDOT on the mats, from a range of PEDOT solution concentrations. A full electrochemical analysis of the electrodes, including conductivity measurements, cyclic voltammometry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, is performed, as well as stress-strain mechanical analysis. The maximum areal capacitance of the electrodes, optimised in terms of PEDOT content, is 1296 mF cm−2. The stretchable supercapacitor devices retain 89.5% of the initial capacitance after being stretched to 500% with the electrodes made of 0.5 M PEDOT:SSEBS. The electrode prepared with 1.0 M PEDOT:SSEBS has a maximum areal capacitance of 996 mF cm−2 and retains 100% of its initial capacitance after bending to 180°. These outstanding performances can be attributed to the highly porous and interconnected voids in the electrospun fibers and their stable mechanical properties upon stretching and bending cycles.
