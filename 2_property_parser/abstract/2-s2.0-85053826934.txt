The carbonized graphene oxide(GO)/chitosan composites were prepared by atmosphere sintering in Ar atmosphere at 600℃, 700℃, 800℃ and 900℃. The carbonized GO/chitosan composites were characterized by XRD, SEM, FTIR and electrochemical station. The results indicate that the carbonized GO/chitosan composites exhibit the significant improvement (around 67%) in mechanical properties comparing with pristine chitosan. The specific capacitance of the carbonized GO/chitosan sample fabricated at 800℃ is about 131 F/g, the specific capacitance retention after 1 500 cycles is higher than 97%.
