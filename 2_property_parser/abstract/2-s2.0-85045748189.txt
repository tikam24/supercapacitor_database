In present manuscript, we synthesized the Nickel hydroxide as an electrode material or supercapacitor application, using hydrothermal method with nickel nitrate as nickel source and hexamethylenetetramine as a directing agent. The reaction was carried out at 160°C temperature for 18 hrs. The structural, morphological and electrochemical characterizations were studied by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and Galvanostatic Charge Discharge (GCD) respectively. Phase purity and crystalline nature of as prepared nickel hydroxide β-Ni(OH)2 was reveled from X-ray study. Using Debye Scherer's formula crystallite size of ∼15 nm was estimated for Nickel hydroxide. SEM reveals β-platelets like morphology of Ni(OH)2 average of platelets length of the order of 1 μm. Electrochemical studies (CV and GCD) were carried out in 2M KOH electrolyte solution. The maximum capacitance of 225 Fg-1 was observed for scan rate 5 mV within the potential window of 0.1 to 0.4 V.
