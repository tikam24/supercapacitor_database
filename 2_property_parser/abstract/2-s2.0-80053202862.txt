Synthesis of silicon carbide-derived carbon films with excellent supercapacitor characteristics is demonstrated by a process that is fully compatible with standard microfabrication technology. NiTi alloy deposited on nitrogen-doped polycrystalline SiC films is shown to result in the growth of a rough, porous, high conductivity, nanocrystalline graphitic carbon film upon rapid thermal annealing to 1050 C. Electrodes fabricated in this manner exhibit high charge/discharge rates with a time constant of about 0.062 s. Analysis shows that the incorporated nitrogen in the carbon electrode may induce pseudo-capacitance, and the electrodes exhibit the capacitance/area values comparable to those reported on carbon nanotube-based supercapacitors.
