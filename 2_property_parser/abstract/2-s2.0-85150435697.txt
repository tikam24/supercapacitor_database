The over-dependence of human society on fossil fuels for energy is exhausting the level of such non-renewable energy sources. Alternative energy storage systems have gained more popularity recently to counter this issue. In this context, we report the fabrication of N-doped carbon dot (N-CD)-decorated ZnO-based electrodes for supercapacitor applications. Due to the light-responsive nature of the N-CDs and ZnO, the electrode was also responsive under the influence of UV light. After the experimental tests, it was found that the areal capacitance value of the supercapacitor increased upto ∼58.9% when illuminated compared to that under the dark conditions. Moreover, the device showed a maximum areal capacitance of 2.6 mF/cm2 after photocharging and galvanostatically discharging at a current density value of 1.6 μA/cm2, which is quite comparable with the previously reported data. The doping of N-CDs with ZnO showed a significant improvement in the areal capacitance value under both illuminated (∼58.64%) and dark conditions (∼22.08%) compared to the case of pristine ZnO, which justifies the purpose of attaching N-CDs with ZnO. Therefore, in brief, we have fabricated a photoresponsive electrode material for supercapacitor application by combining N-CDs and ZnO. An explicit electrochemical characterization of the electrode was also done to identify the contribution from diffusion-controlled capacitance and double layer capacitance, and it was observed that the diffusion-controlled capacitance gets reduced from 59.1 to 33.6% when the scan rate is increased from 2 to 75 mV/s. Moreover, a detailed study has also been done to understand the reaction mechanism. It was confirmed that the defects in the electrode material played a vital role in the intercalation of K+ ions.
