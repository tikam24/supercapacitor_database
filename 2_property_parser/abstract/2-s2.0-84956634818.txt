A novel nitrogen-doped graphene (NG)/nickle oxide (NiO) nanocomposite was synthesized by a facile two-step method, where NiO particles were dispersed on the surface of NG. The NG/NiO nanocomposite is characterized by using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. The electrochemical properties of NG/NiO nanocomposite have been studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. Compared with the nitrogen-doped graphene, the electrode prepared by NG/NiO nanocomposite has a mass specific capacitance of 342 F g-1 at scan rate of 5 mV s-1, which is much higher than that of nitrogen-doped graphene (NG). The galvanostatic charge/discharge results show this new kind nanocomposite has high specific capacitance with 320 F g-1 in the range of 0.1-0.5 V at a current density of 1 A g-1. The enhanced supercapacitive performance of NG/NiO nanocomposite suggesting its promising potential in supercapacitors.
