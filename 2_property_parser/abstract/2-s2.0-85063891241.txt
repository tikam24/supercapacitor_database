We report a supercapacitor cable, which consists of three-dimensional (3D) porous graphene coated onto the surface of carbon thread. The 3D porous framework of graphene was constructed by microwave-activated process using a graphene oxide-coated carbon thread. The use of microwave irradiation enabled to convert graphene oxide into reduced graphene oxide without any reducing agents and activate graphene sheets into exfoliated and porous graphene sheets. Combining two wire electrodes with a polymer gel electrolyte successfully completed supercapacitor device in a form of cable construction. The supercapacitor cables were highly flexible, and thus can be transformed into various shapes of devices and be integrated into textile items. A high area-capacitance of 38.1 mF/cm was obtained at a scan rate of 10 mV/s. This capacitance was retained 88% of its original value at 500 mV/s. The cycle life was also demonstrated by repeating a charge/discharge process during 10,000 cycles even under bent states, showing a high capacitance retention of 96.5%.
