Copper (II) melamine supramolecular complex was synthesized by solvothermal method with copper acetate and melamine as raw materials. The CuO@nitrogen-doped porous carbon materials were prepared by one-step pyrolysis using supramolecular complex as precursors. The structure and morphology of the materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and specific surface analyzer. The results show that the CuO nanoparticles are uniformly loaded on the nitrogen-doped porous carbon after pyrolysis at 500 â„ƒ, and the composite show large porosity and specific surface area. The electrochemical test results show that the specific capacitance is 322.1 F/g at 1 A/g, and the capacity retention remained 91.1% after 1 000 cycles at 5 A/g. The CuO/nitrogen-doped porous carbon material exhibits good capacitance performance and excellent cycling stability.
