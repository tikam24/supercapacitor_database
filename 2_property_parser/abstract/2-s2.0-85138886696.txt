Development of sulfide-based electrodes for non-aqueous electrolytes is a promising research area in supercapacitor applications. In this present work a novel and safe non-aqueous electrolyte can increase the specific capacitance in a wider range of potential window for electrochemical double layer capacitance (EDLCs). Herein, pristine NiS, MnS, and ternary metal composites of NiMnS/rGO-0.05 wt%, NiMnS/rGO-0.1 wt% and NiMnS/rGO-0.15 wt% are synthesized via one-step hydrothermal route. The fabricated supercapacitor electrodes performance was assessed using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge and discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy with 1 M tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate in acetonitrile. The as-prepared NiMnS/rGO-0.15 wt% electrode achieves an excellent specific capacitance of 352 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1with capacitance retention of 82% through 10,000 successive cycles. Remarkably, the NiMnS/rGO-0.15 wt% composite indicates its superior electrochemical behavior as an electrode material in a non-aqueous electrolyte.
