The impurity level in carbon nanotubes is considered as a key factor for future applications, in particular electrochemical devices. The longer carbon nanotubes produced by proprietary continuous technique are reported to be investigated in both pristine and purified forms. The influemce of purirification on properties and especially supercapacitor application are significant. In particular, the electrochemical capacity jumps twice as a result of purification.
