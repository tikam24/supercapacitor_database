In this work, we synthesized amine functionalized graphene oxide called FGO-235 and FGO-178 by a chemical route. The prepared functionalized graphene oxide (FGOs) were characterized by different analytical methods including FT-IR, Raman spectroscopy, Thermal gravimetry (TG), Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-Ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). To improve the electrochemical properties of the poly ortho aminophenol (POAP), we prepared FGO-235/POAP and FGO-178/POAP films through electro-polymerization of POAP in the presence of synthesized FGO-178 and FGO-235 with a porous structure, serving as the active electrode for electrochemical supercapacitor. With regards to electrochemical methods, galvanostatic charge–discharge experiments, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were performed in order to investigate the performance of the system. The specific charges of 820 and 348 C g−1 were obtained for FGO-235/POAP and FGO-178/POAP, respectively. This work introduced one of the most efficient materials for electrochemical redox capacitors which enjoyed easy synthesis, high active surface area, and stability in an aqueous electrolyte.
