This paper comprehensively explores the Energy Management Strategy (EMS) of a Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) with battery, Fuel Cell (FC) and a supercapacitor (SC) for the application of Electric Vehicles (EV). Improving the efficiency and effective utilization of the battery system in safe operating conditions is the main concern of the industry. This demands for improvement in the operating conditions of the battery through efficient EMS. The life cycle of the battery is also a major responsibility to be achieved in the prevailing research domain. There are several approaches to achieve these objectives out of which Adaptive Fuzzy Logic Control Strategy, Grey Wolf Optimization Technique and Pontryagin's Minimum Principle are discussed in detail. The impact of different control methods on the functioning of energy storage systems is analyzed and evaluated for practical operating conditions.
