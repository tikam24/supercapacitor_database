Here, a fractional-order proportional–integral–derivative (FOPID) controller is implemented for frequency deviation control of a proposed hybrid fractional-order power generation and energy storage system. This control strategy is designed based on coordination control of fractional-order fuel cell and supercapacitor bank models in a hybrid renewable energy system with stand-alone application. The system performance is verified by using real weather data and under isolated loads in power frequency balance condition. Analyses show the validity of the control strategy in the proposed hybrid system and enhanced power quality.
