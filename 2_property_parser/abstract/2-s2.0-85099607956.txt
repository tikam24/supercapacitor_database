Hybrid storage systems require electrode materials with efficient capacitance and long cycle life. Their development is garnering increasing attention, with numerous efforts having been undertaken. Sodium titanate (Na2Ti3O7) has significant potential as an appropriate electrode material candidate for progressive energy storage. However, the application of Na2Ti3O7 is limited by its low electrical conductivity and cycling strength. Herein, a novel Na2Ti3O7/single-walled carbon nanotubes i.e NT/CNT nanostructure was fabricated via an in-situ hydrothermal method. Owing to the 1D/1D morphological features, high surface area, enriched interfacial conductivity, abundant active edge sites, and mesoporous nature of the Na2Ti3O7/SWCNTs nanostructure electrode, a remarkable capacity of 576.01 F g−1 at 0.8 A g−1 was obtained, with cycling stability featuring 91.43% retaining of capacitance after 5000 cycles. Importantly, a split-cell-type asymmetric supercapacitor was fabricated, demonstrating an energy density of 8.75 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 4500 W kg−1. A significant improvement in the electrochemical behavior of the novel 1D/1D NT/CNT nanostructure was primarily ascribed to the robust and intimate interfacial contact between the constituent Na2Ti3O7 and SWCNTs, acting as an optimal reservoir for electrolyte ions. These outcomes indicate that the NT/CNT nanostructure is a remarkable electrode material for electroactive energy storage devices.
