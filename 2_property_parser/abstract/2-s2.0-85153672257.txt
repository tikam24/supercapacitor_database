Carbonized bacteria are prepared on a nickel plate without any additives (binder, conductor, solvent) to examine the bacteria's own capacitance. The absence of any additives makes it suitable to investigate the capacitance of carbonized bacteria. The Gram-negative bacteria are used as a function of different electrode mass loading to analyze morphological properties and electrochemical properties. At a current density of 1 A∙g−1, the sample prepared showed specific capacitance of 37F∙g−1 after 5000 cycles. These results could prove the manufacture and electrochemical properties of the bacteria for energy storage devices and fundamental research in terms of bacteria-doped composites.
