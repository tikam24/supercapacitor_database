This paper proposes a novel modular equalization architecture for series-connected electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC) modules, each consisting of multiple cells connected in series. Cell voltages in a module are equalized by an inductive voltage divider (IVD)-voltage multiplier (VM)-based cell equalizer, while module voltages are unified by switched capacitor converters (SCCs). Square wave voltages generated at switching nodes of the IVD-VM-based cell equalizers are utilized to drive the SCC-based module equalizers, realizing the switchless topology of SCC-based module equalizers. The required switch count of the proposed system can be halved compared to conventional systems, allowing simplified circuit. An experimental equalization test for three EDLC modules, each consisting of six cells in series, was performed from an initially voltage-imbalanced condition. Module and cell voltages were equalized at different rates, and the equalization performance of the proposed modular equalization system was successfully demonstrated.
