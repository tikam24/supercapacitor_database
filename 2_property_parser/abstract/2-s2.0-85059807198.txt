Modeling of the electric field in electrolyte solutions may be relevant for electrical systems and electronics, for example, due to the widespread use of supercapacitors. Studies of the effect of an external static electric field on the properties of the electrolyte volume were carried out to a lesser extent. Since the model of diffuse DES is insufficient, the dense ion layer (specific adsorption) is also taken into account when calculating the electric field, which corresponds to a more perfect stern model. The system of equations describing the static electric field and diffusion in the final volume of aqueous solution is considered. The calculation of the electrostatic field in the volume of distilled and ordinary water is carried out. Into account such factors as the size of biological objects, convection, accounting for the volume occupied by the ions, the degree of hydration of the ions, the absorption of the plexiglass, the leakage currents, the possibility of breakdown, surface conductivity, diffusion of protons. The results of the research can also be used in the calculation of electrical devices with overlapping DES, for example, supercapacitors (ionistors), as well as in the study of bioreactors.
