In this paper a new approach is presented for improving grid inertia based on a Photo-Voltaic (PV) farm in conjunction with a fully active Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) comprising of battery and ultra-capacitor. The approach captures grid dynamics using the inverter voltage angle deviation and an error minimization based control is designed for frequency regulation. For this purpose, PV and HESS are integrated at a common DC link that feeds a three phase voltage source inverter (VSI). For demonstration and validation of the proposed approach, a modified IEEE 13 bus and modified IEEE 123 bus power distribution system models are used. It has been observed that the proposed architecture control the Rate of Change of Frequency (RoCoF) and primary frequency and secondary frequency response without the need of frequency-droop information of the system, there by ensuring grid stability that utilize renewable energy based resources.
