Silver incorporated Mn3O4/amorphous carbon (AC) nanocomposites are synthesized by a green chemistry method. X-ray diffraction studies revealed the structural changes in Mn3O4/AC nanocomposites attributable to the addition of silver. Cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge and ac-impedance studies indicated that the Ag-Mn3O4/AC-5 electrode was the most suitable candidate for supercapacitor applications. From the galvanostatic charge-discharge studies, a higher specific capacitance of 981 F g-1 at a specific current of 1 A g-1 was obtained. An Ag-Mn3O4/AC-symmetric supercapacitor consisting of an Ag-incorporated Mn3O4/AC composite as an anode as well as a cathode, and an asymmetric supercapacitor consisting of an Ag-incorporated Mn3O4/AC composite as a cathode and an activated carbon as an anode have been fabricated. The symmetric device exhibits a specific cell capacitance of 72 F g-1 at a specific current of 1 A g-1 whereas the asymmetric device delivers a specific cell capacitance of 180 F g-1 at a high current rate of 10 A g-1. The asymmetric supercapacitor device yields a high energy density of 81 W h kg-1. This is higher than that of lead acid batteries and comparable with that of nickel hydride batteries. This journal is
