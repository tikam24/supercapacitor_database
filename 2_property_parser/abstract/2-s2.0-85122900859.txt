The engraving of CO2 laser on polyimide Kapton sheet will directly generate porous graphene, which is suitable for supercapacitor applications. The possibility of a combination of biopolymer electrolytes with Laser-Induced Graphene (LIG) is investigated. The prepared LIG is characterized by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis and Raman spectroscopy techniques. The biopolymer electrolyte was prepared by solution casting method, and the conductivity of the film is analysed. The supercapacitor was fabricated using LIG as electrode and biopolymer-ionic liquid combination as electrolyte. The resulting capacitor has a specific capacitance of 54.28Fg-1. This particular combination of the LIG electrode-biopolymer electrolyte combination is suitable for supercapacitor applications.
