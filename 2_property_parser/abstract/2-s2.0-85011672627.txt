We report on the enhanced capacitive properties of a copper(I) oxide nanoparticle (Cu2O NP)-decorated multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) forest with nitrogen (N) doping. A careful in situ solid-state dewetting and plasma doping method was developed that ensured homogeneous decoration and contamination-free Cu2O NPs with N doping on the nanotube sidewalls. The morphology and structure of the hybrid materials were characterised by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy. The electrochemical performance of the hybrid materials was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The electrochemical tests demonstrated that the Cu2O NP/N-MWCNT electrode exhibits a specific capacitance up to 132.2 F g−1 at a current density of 2.5 A g−1, which is 30% higher than that of the pure MWCNT electrode. Furthermore, the electrode could retain the specific capacitance at 85% stability over 1000 cycles. These observations along with the simple assembly method for the hybrid materials suggest that the Cu2O NP/N-MWCNT could be a promising electrode for supercapacitor applications.
