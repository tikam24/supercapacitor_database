The increasing demand for ac and dc loads has emphasized the need for effective control and energy management scheme of a hybrid AC-DC microgrid. The control of Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) maintains a constant DC bus voltage with required power sharing among different sources and loads. The ac/dc microgrid comprises of a PV array, Battery storage system, supercapacitors and VSC (Voltage Source Converter) feeding DC and AC loads. The supercapacitor having high power density responds to the transients due to a sudden change in load or source power. The aim of the paper is to purge the switching of control to incur minimal transients in the microgrid. The system is simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK and its control hardware implementation is carried out on an FPGA based NI LabView PXI with SbRio interface to obtain the experimental results validating the proposed hybrid energy management control scheme.
