At present, in the situation that wind power penetration is increasing year by year, the use of a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) to smooth out wind power fluctuations becomes an effective method. However, the existing control strategy has the problem of inadequate utilization of fluctuating power. In this paper, we propose a control strategy for smoothing wind power fluctuations based on double Kalman filters with adaptive adjustment of the state of charge (SOC). Firstly, considering the wind power’s active power grid constraint, the parameters of the dual Kalman filter are adaptively adjusted according to the original output power to obtain the target grid power synchronously, and the total smoothing command of the energy storage system is determined with the goal of improving the SOC of the lithium battery. On this basis, the SOC of the supercapacitor is considered to be improved, and the adaptive low-pass filter is used for the secondary distribution of the energy storage power command to achieve fine-grained management of the output power of HESS. The final simulation results show that the obtained smoothed wind power satisfies the 1 min and 10 min fluctuation criteria, and the minimum capacity required for lithium batteries is reduced by 0.07 MW·h under the same initial conditions as in the proposed method in this paper; it can use the fluctuating power when the SOC crosses the limit, and has a regulating effect on the SOC of HESS to improve the wind power smoothing ability and realize the stable grid-connection requirement of wind power.
