Mesoporous carbon (MC) was prepared by carbonization of glucose at 620 Â°C for 4 h under N2 atmosphere. The pore size was adjusted by changing the N2 pressure from 0 to 0.1 MPa. The typical MC which was obtained at the N2 pressure of 0.05 MPa possessed the pore size distribution in the range of 2-4.5 nm. As an electrode material, the prepared MC exhibited a specific capacitance of 202 F g-1 and capacity retention of 90.6% after 3000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g-1.
