The new hybrid energy storages for effective power utilization is a necessity for hybrid energy storage system (HESS) in evolving distributed energy resources systems. One of the key functions of the EMS is to determine the power requirement from the available energy sources. Rule based EMS is having its advantages, like ease in control, easy to implement and real time implementable. This paper presents a fuzzy logic controller based modified EMS for controlling the indicators like dc link voltage, battery current rate, state-of-charge (SOC) of battery and ultracapacitor in HESS systems. A low pass filter (LPF) based EMS is selected for the comparative analysis purpose. The proposed power allocation technique provides stable ultracapacitor SOC performance. The dynamics improvement of the given system is attended by rate limiter controls of the battery current. The proposed EMS saves 10.20% of the battery energy as compared with battery only system and 4.2% of the battery energy as compared with LPF based EMS for a designed load profile. Fully active parallel converter topology in hybrid energy storage system presents advantages like less component count, simple and full control over the sources and complete utilization of the source energy.
