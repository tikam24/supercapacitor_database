The progress of flexible/wearable electronic devices with multi-functionality has stimulated the rapid development of the matching power supply devices. Flexible supercapacitors with high electrochemical performance and mechanical flexibility are considered as attractive technologies to power flexible electronics and have been studied intensively. Carbon nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotube, graphene, and their composites, possess unprecedented physical/chemical properties and exhibit great potential for use in flexible supercapacitors. In this review, the recent progress of state-of-the-art flexible supercapacitors using advanced carbon nanomaterials is expounded comprehensively and systematically, the topic covered the micro/nano-structure control, macroscopic morphologies design, property optimization and application of carbon nanomaterials. Based on the current advances, the challenges and prospects of carbon nanomaterials applied in flexible supercapacitors are outlined and highlighted. As last, the matching between the characters of carbon nanomaterials, construction of flexible supercapacitors and fabrication technologies are put forward.
