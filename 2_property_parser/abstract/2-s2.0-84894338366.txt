In this work we have deposited multlilayer films of polypyrrole (PPy) by galvanostatic method with three different dopants namely p-toluenesulphonic acid, benzene sulphonic acid, and sulfuric acid ions on graphene oxide (GO) layer. The better deposition of PPy films on GO is addressed by studying the influence of different electrolytes, concentrations and current densities. The multilayer films of GO/PPy exhibits greater capacitance compared to GO/PPy single layer. The morphology of the graphene oxide (GO)/multilayer nano PPy structures is carefully analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, FTIR and XPS spectrum. Specific capacitance of fabricated supercapacitor using multilayer electrodes is as high as 332 F g -1 at 10 mV s -1 and also compared with another supercapacitor made from single GO/PPy layer whose capacitance is 215 F g -1 . Galvanostatic charge-discharge studies show good performance and stability. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
