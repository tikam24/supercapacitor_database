A judicious combination of conducting materials with selected transition metal hydroxides to form core-shell nanostructures has attracted great attention owing to the underlying synergistic effect for energy storage. In this work, we fabricate a novel 3D nanostructure consisting of Ni(OH)2 ultrathin nanoflakes directly anchored on SnO2 nanowire arrays by a facile solution-based method, which utilizes the higher conductance of SnO2 nanowires as the supporting scaffold to deposit Ni(OH)2 for supercapacitor electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge methods have been conducted to understand the capacitive performance of the SnO2/Ni(OH)2 core-shell nanocomposites. A specific capacitance of as high as 1553 F g-1 is achieved at 0.5 A g-1 in 6 M KOH aqueous solution. At a large current density of 10 A g-1, the electrode retains a high capacitance value of 934 F g-1. The superior capacitive behavior suggests that the hierarchical SnO2@Ni(OH)2 hybrid nanostructure is a very promising electrode material for fabricating high-performance supercapacitors.
