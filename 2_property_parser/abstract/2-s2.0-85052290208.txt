In this research, we report a reusable multifunctional electrode, which can not only be used for supercapacitors, but can also act as the anode material for the degradation of bisphenol A (BPA) by the advanced electrochemical oxidization technology. This multifunctional electrode was prepared by growing MnO2 nanoflakes directly on a Ni foam substrate using a facile hydrothermal method. When substituted for the electrode in a supercapacitors, the specific capacitance was 846.1F/g at 5 mV/s. Furthermore, when used as anode material for degradation BPA in the advanced electrochemical oxidization process. The BPA removal rate is 99.7%, and this rate can be maintained at about 85.6% after 5 cycles. It is hoped that this electrode will provide new opportunities for the cooperation of energy and the environment in the future.
