Reduced graphene oxide (RGO) is synthesized and added in situ into the reaction system of polyaniline (PANI) electrodeposition using activated carbon cloth (ACC) as the substrate. The effect of RGO on the morphology, structure, and electrochemical properties of the ACC/PANI composite is investigated. A more compact and uniform layer of PANI film is observed via scanning electronic microscopy after the addition of RGO. Raman spectroscopy shows that RGO has been simultaneously deposited with PANI onto the surface of ACC. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that the sample with RGO exhibits a higher sulfur-to-nitrogen ratio. The reversibility of the redox reaction of PANI is improved, as confirmed via cyclic voltammetry. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data shows that the introduction of RGO lowers the charge-transfer resistance of ACC/PANI, meanwhile, improves the coverage percentage of PANI on the ACC surface to a significant extent, primarily because of the interactions between RGO, ACC, and PANI. The as-prepared composite with RGO shows improved rate performance and cyclability as a supercapacitor electrode. Graphical abstract: Highlights: Interfacial interaction of ACC/PANI is improved by the addition of RGO. Charge transfer property of ACC/PANI is improved by the addition of RGO. Compared to ACC/PANI, ACC/RGO/PANI shows better electrochemical properties. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
