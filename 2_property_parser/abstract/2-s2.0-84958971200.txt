A facile one-step microwave irradiation method is developed to synthesize a composite of graphene and zinc oxide, which is quick and environmentally friendly. The obtained nanostructured hybrid material was utilized for the fabrication of a supercapacitor electrode and the electrochemical performance was investigated intensively. The electrode with the as-prepared graphene/zinc oxide composite displayed a specific capacitance as high as 201 F g-1 in 1 M Na2SO4 at a current density of 1 A g-1, which is much higher than those of pure microwave reduction graphene oxide (77 F g-1) and zinc oxide (5 F g-1) at the same current density. In addition, the specific capacitance of the MRGO/ZnO electrode presented an outstanding cycling stability with capacitance retention of 93% even after 3000 cycles. This research provides a feasible method for low-cost manufacture of other graphene-based materials with high-performance applications in energy-storage.
