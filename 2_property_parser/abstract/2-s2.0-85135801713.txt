Hybrid supercapacitors are promising energy storage devices where high-power delivery is needed in continuous supply (such as e-vehicles, cranes, industrialized machines, etc.). Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are leading porous materials, and their pore size and shape can be easily modified by suitable incorporation of ligands and metal centers. The way to improve a supercapacitor's energy density is to engineer pores on electrode materials properly. For large-scale applications, a facile synthesis method is needed. Therefore, a porous crystal-structured novel nanosponge-like pristine Cu-MOF is synthesized in a facile one-pot synthesis method (a coprecipitation method) which has a 2D layered crystal structure containing diffusion channels. Cu-MOF exhibits a maximum specific capacity of 892 C g−1 at 1 A g−1, showing pseudocapacitive behavior. Its specific capacity is retained at 95.3% after 10 000 charge-discharge cycles at 10 A g−1. A hybrid supercapacitor device has been fabricated with a maximum energy density of 88.2 W h kg−1 and a maximum power density of 15.7 kW kg−1. And the as-fabricated device provides a rise in specific capacity of 120% even after 10 000 charge-discharge cycles at 10 A g−1
