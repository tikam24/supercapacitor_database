Utilizing solar energy is essential to having a clean and healthy Earth for generations to come. However, because solar power is intermittent, caused by weather changes such as clouds or temperature fluctuations, power distributers cannot rely on solar farms as a consistent power source. The solution is the integration of an energy storage system capable of absorbing and producing the necessary power to maintain a constant power for a specific amount of time, known as dispatching. This paper demonstrates a successful dispatching scheme of solar energy using a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) consisting of a battery energy storage system (BESS) and a supercapacitor energy storage system (SESS). The HESS utilizes the high energy density property (the ability to charge and discharge large amounts of energy, preferably at low frequency) of lead acid batteries and the high power density property (the ability to rapidly charge or discharge energy, at high frequency) of supercapacitors together to invoke a synergy of low-frequency and high-frequency energy storage components. The HESS is designed to increase the longevity of the traditional BESS while enabling the capability to dispatch the solar energy.
