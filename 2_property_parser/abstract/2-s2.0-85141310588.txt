To improve the electrochemical performance of the supercapacitor, three electrode nanocomposites, NiO, NiS and NiCo2S4, have been obtained by simple hydrothermal process and high temperature pyrolysis, and further, the impact of electrolytes of different concentrations on electrochemical performance of supercapacitor has been researched. During the research processing, synergistic effect of Ni, Co and S is considered to enhance the electrical conductivity, and promote electron transfer, ion diffusion and structural stability. The experiment results show that bimetallic sulfides display high electrical conductivity, shorter ion diffusion channels, and faster electron and ion transport rate with the feature of topping electrochemical properties of specific capacity, excellent cycling stability and high rate capability, and besides show that it can improve the electrochemical performance of the material by increasing the concentration of electrolyte. The transition-metal sulfides provide a new promising pathway for the expansion of high-performance electrode materials for supercapacitors.
