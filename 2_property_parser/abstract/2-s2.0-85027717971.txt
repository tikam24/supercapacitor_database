Performance modeling of electrochemical energy storage systems is gathering increasingly higher attention in recent years. With the ever increasing power demand of mobile applications, predicting voltage behavior under different load profiles is of utmost importance for communications, automotive and consumer electronics. The ideal modelling approach needs not only to accurately predict the response of the battery, but also be robust, easy to implement and have low computational complexity. We will present a new algorithm that is algebraically straightforward, that has no adjustable parameters and that can accurately predict the voltage response of batteries and supercapacitors. The approach works well in a variety of discharge profiles ranging from simple long DC discharge/charge profiles to pulse schemes based on drive schedules published by regulatory bodies. Our approach is based on Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy measurements done on the system to be predicted. The spectrum is used in the frequency domain without any further processing to predict the fast moving portion of the voltage in the frequency domain. DC response is added in through a straightforward lookup table. This widely applicable approach can predict the voltage of with less than 1% error, without any adjustable parameters to a large variety of discharge profiles.
