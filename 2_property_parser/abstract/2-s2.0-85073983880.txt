Pure, 1%, 3%, and 5% of cerium-doped vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) nanoparticles were synthesized by non-aqueous sol-gel route. Synthesized samples were employed to various characterizations such as structural, morphological, optical, and electrochemical studies using XRD, SEM, FTIR, RAMAN, and UV-Vis DRS and cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge, and cycle stability for supercapacitor applications. XRD analysis revealed the phase purity and crystallinity of the powder samples with a crystallite size 89–84 nm. SEM images show that the synthesized nanoparticles are highly monodispersed and homogenous in size. FTIR and RAMAN spectra ensured the presence of functional groups in synthesized V2O5. Then, the UV-Vis DRS spectra depict that the synthesized nanoparticles are red shifted. Ce(5%):V2O5 nanoparticles provided high specific capacitance about 555 Fg−1 at 1 Ag−1 and cycling stability up to 10,000 cycles with capacity retention up to 85% compared with pure, 1%, and 3% cerium-doped V2O5 nanoparticles. Thus, cerium-doped V2O5 nanoparticles were considered potential cathode materials for supercapacitor applications.
