Souped up! A hydrogen-insertion asymmetric supercapacitor is reported that couples a hydrogen-atom-insertion negative electrode and a double-layer, activated-carbon positive electrode (see figure). This unique asymmetric supercapacitor does not have an apparent capacity fading mechanism. There is an internal mechanism that prevents the accumulation of H 2, and thus the possible leakage of H 2, during overcharging conditions. Copyright Â© 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
