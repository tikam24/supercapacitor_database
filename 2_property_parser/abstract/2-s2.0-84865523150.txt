In this work, we have prepared activated carbon (AC)-based symmetric supercapacitor (SC) using Li 2SO 4 aqueous electrolyte instead of H 2SO 4 and KOH and obtained a device with an improved cell voltage window (CVW) of 0-1.6 V from 0 to 1.0 V. The SC using KOH electrolyte is also fabricated for comparison. The electrochemical characteristics of SCs such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cycle stability are investigated systematically. The possible redox reactions of electrodes that occurred in Li 2SO 4 and KOH electrolytes that restrict the CVWs are discussed. The results indicate that in the case of Li 2SO 4, the AC electrode can deliver a specific capacitance of 210 Fg -1 at a current density of 0.1 Ag -1, and the energy density of capacitor can be as high as 16.9 Wh kg -1 at 200 Wkg-1 (based on the total mass of active electrode materials), 80% higher than that in the case of KOH.
