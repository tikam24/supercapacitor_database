The most promising organic electrolyte for medium temperature range supercapacitors (SC) seems to be a solution of (C2H5)3CH3NBF4 in acetonitrile (AN), characterised by excellent conductivity, low viscosity and a relatively broad electrochemical stability window. However AN low boiling point means that the vapour pressure would be high in hot environments, thus, the high flammability and risk of explosion at higher temperatures, decreasing noticeably the safety issues for SC, are critical. Propylene carbonate was used as the most suitable solvent, based on a comprehensive consideration taking into account the good electrochemical stability, conductivity and performance at moderate temperature. The main aim of this paper is to study the electrochemical characteristics of propylene carbonate based electrical double layer capacitors using the microporous TiC-CDC electrodes within the wide region of temperature, i.e., from -45 °C to 100 °C.
