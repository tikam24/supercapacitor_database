The macroscopic nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide/SnO2 composite hydrogels were synthesized by one-step hydrothermal method using graphene oxide and SnCl2 as precursors and ammonia water as nitrogen source. The graphene oxides were reduced to graphene during the hydrothermal process at the same time SnCl2 was oxidized to SnO2 nanoparticles that were uniformly anchored onto the graphene sheets, resulting in the assembly of nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide/SnO2 composite hydrogels. The feed ratio of graphene oxide to SnCl2 played a key role in the formation of composite hydrogel. The unique structure and the synergistic effect between nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide and SnO2 in the composite architectures not only provided the large surface area but also facilitated the transportation of ion and electron through the three-dimensional network. Therefore, the nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide/SnO2 composite hydrogel exhibited an improved capacity and high cycling stability, suggesting the composite hydrogels could be promising candidates for energy storage.
