Herein, we have managed to conceive and fabricate a core-shell structured triangle-like array, where a selenylation-treated MOF array was grown in situ on a conducting substrate as a highly conductive framework to support a high loading of Mo-doped nickel-cobalt LDH nanoflakes. This hierarchical electrode integrates the advantages of a defect-rich electronic state, large active area and rich reaction sites, delivering a high areal capacity of 5.16 C cm-2 and a high rate capability.
