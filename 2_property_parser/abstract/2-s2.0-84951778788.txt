Electrode and electrolytes are always playing a key role in developing good efficient devices. This paper reports the synthesis, characterization and application of low viscosity ionic liquid (1-ethyl 3-methyl imidazolium dicyanamide) incorporated into polymer matrix (PVDF-HFP). The samples were characterized using various experimental tools. Complex impedance spectroscopy shows that conductivity of polymer host increases with increasing ionic liquid (IL) concentration attains maxima and then decreases. Optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) reveals the reduction of crystalline matrix of polymer host by adding IL. The primarily fabricated devices using maximum conductivity film affirms that this material is promising candidate for dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) and supercapacitor application.
