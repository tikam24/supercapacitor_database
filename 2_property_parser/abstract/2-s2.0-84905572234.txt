In this study, porous Ti/TiO2 network nanostructures with high surface areas were fabricated by electrochemical dealloying. TiO2 has been investigated as supercapacitor electrodes, while a major disadvantage of TiO2-based supercapacitors is their low specific stored energy. In this work, nanostructured Ti/TiO2 composites were fabricated, which could accumulate large quantity of electrons and energy for supercapacitor needs. Such porous nanostructures form a highly conductive metal network with bicontinuous open. Nanoporous Ti/TiO2 has enhanced charge/discharge behavior and a superior capacitance performance with specific capacitance of 35.5 F/g. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.
