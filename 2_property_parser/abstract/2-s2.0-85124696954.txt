Covalent triazine frameworks are a subtype of conjugated microporous polymers that show heteroatom impacts and have outstanding chemical/thermal stabilities and high surface areas. In this study, four pyridine-based covalent triazine frameworks (TPP-CTFs)—TPP-CTF-1, TPP-CTF-2, TPP-CTF-3, and TPP-CTF-4— were constructed by an ionothermal interaction between aromatic nitriles in the presence of various molar equivalents of ZnCl2. TPP-CTFs exhibited superior BET surface area up to 1760 m2 g−1 and extremely high thermal stability up to 75% char yield. When employed as supercapacitor electrodes, these TPP-CTFs showed considerable performance with a high specific capacitance of 231 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and outstanding cycling stability of 95.8% capacitance retention over 2000 cycles. In addition, TPP-CTFs displayed excellent adsorb CO2 over N2 with ideal selectivity CO2/N2 constants of 19–24 at 298 K. Such CTFs appear to offer a lot of potential for application as high-performance supercapacitor and gas-separator materials on a large scale.
