Fast-cure 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate-based ionogels have been realised for the first time. The influence of curing temperature on the structure of ionogels and their performance as the electrolyte for electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) has been investigated. Hybrid ionogels were synthesised via a non-hydrolytic sol-gel route and were fully gelled post heat-treating at 125, 150, 175 and 200 °C for 60 min with minimal shrinkage. Charge-transfer resistance (a rate-limiting parameter in cell kinetics during charge/discharge cycles) was reduced by ∼80% by increasing the heat-treatment temperature; this was partially attributed to the interlocking effect facilitated by high curing temperature. We report a maximum areal capacitance of 95 mF cm−2. Due to ∼40% increase in the penetrability coefficient of the ionic liquid, the electrode ‘full’ wetting time dropped from 48 to 5 h when the curing temperature was increased above 150 °C. These results were supported by SEM and Raman spectroscopy to characterise the effect of high temperature heat-treatment on the electrode-ionogel interface and the degree of electrode wetting by the ionic liquid. The fast-cure fabrication process for ionogels removes one of the major hurdles in their industrial application while the improved room temperature ion transport kinetics expands the potential application of ionic liquid-based electrochemical systems.
