The changes in the properties of the supercapacitor electrode material copper cobaltite, prepared by a simple hydrothermal procedure, were investigated upon doping with Mo with different ratios (CuCo1-xMoxO4, x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2). The effect of doping on the structural, microstructural parameters, cation distribution was studied using Rietveld analysis for x-ray diffraction patterns. Results evidenced the incorporation of Mo6+ ions substitutionally for Co3+ ions, which is confirmed by the vibrational bands obtained from Fourier transform infrared spectrometry and by the vibrating sample magnetometer measurements. The particle morphology and size distribution of the samples were investigated using high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) imaging. The influence of Mo-doping on the absorbance behavior of copper cobaltite was examined utilizing measured absorbance diffused spectra; the bandgap structure of doped samples was greatly affected. The changes that occurred in the optical band gap upon doping were explained using the Burstein-Moss shift effect. The photoluminescence intensity was affected by the amount of Mo doping. The samples emitted violet, blue, and yellow colors depending on the amount of doping.
