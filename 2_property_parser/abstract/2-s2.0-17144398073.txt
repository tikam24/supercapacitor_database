Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) were used as the conductive additive in the electrode materials. The electrochemical properties of supercapacitors based on LiNi0.8Co0.2O2/MWNTs composite and LiNi0.8Co0.2O2/acetylene black composite and MWNTs in 1.0 mol·L-1 LiClO4/EC+DEC [V(EC):V(DEC)=1:1] electrolyte were investigated by means of constant charge/discharge current tests, respectively. The experimental results show that the LiNi0.8Co0.2O2/MWNTs composite has better performance than that of others, and the maximum specific capacitance of the supercapacitor can reach 271.6 F·g-1, while the energy density is up to 339.5 Wh·kg-1. Furthermore, it is remarkable that the performance of MWNTs is better than that of acetylene black as the conductive additive.
