Graphitic carbon nitride (G-C3N4) was synthesized through the direct combustion of urea in the air. The CoS-Co2O3/G-C3N4 composite was synthesized via the hydrothermal method of G-C3N4 using cobalt salts. The morphological and chemical structures were determined through XRD, XPS, SEM, and TEM. XRD and XPS analyses confirmed the chemical structure, function groups, and elements percentage of the prepared nanocomposite. SEM measurements illustrated the formation of G-C3N4 sheets, as well as the flower shape of the CoS-Co2O3/G-C3N4 composite, evidenced through the formation of nano appendages over G-C3N4 sheets. TEM confirmed the 2D nanosheets of G-C3N4 with an average width and length of 80 nm and 170 nm, respectively. Two symmetric electrodes for the supercapacitor from the CoS-Co2O3/G-C3N4 composite. Electrochemical measurements were carried out to determine the charge/discharge, cyclic voltammetry, stability, and impedance of the prepared supercapacitor. The measurements were carried out under acid (0.5 M HCL) and basic (6.0 M NaOH) mediums. The charge and discharge lifetime values in the acid and base medium were 85 and 456 s, respectively. The cyclic voltammetry behavior was rectangular in a base medium for the pseudocapacitance feature. The supercapacitor had 100% stability retention up to 600 cycles; then, the stability decreased to 98.5% after 1000 cycles. The supercapacitor displayed a specific capacitance (CS) of 361 and 92 F/g, and an energy density equal to 28.7 and 30.2 W h kgâˆ’1 in the basic and acidic mediums, respectively. Our findings demonstrate the capabilities of supercapacitors to become an alternative solution to batteries, owing to their easy and low-cost manufacturing technique.
