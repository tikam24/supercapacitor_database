With growing consumption of nature resources and concerns about maintaining an environment capable of supporting human civilization, people have begun to look for some green preparation methods of environment⁃friendly materials to improve the high⁃quality utilization of green resources. As a new porous carbon⁃based material, woodce⁃ ramics is prepared from wood (and other biomass materials) and sintered at high temperature, which has attracted much attention because of its excellent performance. It is not only partly preserved the characteristics of multi⁃layer pore structure of biomass materials, but also has been given many new functions, which could keep the good thermol⁃ ogy, electromagnetism, tribology and electrochemical characteristics, and has a wide range of applications in many fields, such as electromagnetic shielding materials, ablation resistant materials, high temperature filter, catalyst carri⁃ er, solid friction materials, and supercapacitor electrode. In this paper, the current research achievements of woodce⁃ ramics are introduced in detail from the aspects of raw and auxiliary materials, adhesive, functional additives, molding method and sintering process, structural form and application prospect. The physical and chemical properties are summarized from the aspects of basic structure and micro morphology, pore size and distribution, mechanical properties and mechanical behavior, and the effects of 3D network structure, layered structure and fiber reinforced structure on the performance are emphatically discussed. At the same time, the basic theories of phase composition and microcrystalline structure evolution, metal ion doping mechanism and composite rules, structure enhancement mecha⁃ nism and interface structure model are discussed. Subsequently, the characteristics of absorption and electromagnetic shielding, electrochemistry and energy storage are compared and analyzed. And then, the influences of raw materials, basic structure, forming process, sintering temperature, rate of temperature increase, dwelling time and activation method on the basic properties of woodceramics are also summarized. In the end, some suggestions are put forward for the future study of woodceramics from deepening of the fundamental theory, improvement of preparation method, promotion of basic properties and extension of application, which can provide some references for further improving the properties of this new carbon⁃based multi⁃porous materials and extending its applications in fields of energy stor⁃ age, chemical synthesis, electronical appliances, aerospace, etc.
