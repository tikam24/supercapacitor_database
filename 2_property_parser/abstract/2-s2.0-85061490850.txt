In order to ameliorate the capacitance and energy density of supercapacitors in aqueous electrolytes, nitrogen- and phosphorus-codoped carbon microspheres/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites are obtained by hydrothermal treatment of graphite oxide and N,P-doped carbon microsphere. The as-prepared nanocomposites display a high specific surface area of 604.3 m 2 g −1 and hierarchical pore structure composed of micropores, mesopores, and macropores. N,P-codoped carbon microspheres/reduced graphene oxide are used as electrode materials in the redox electrolyte of H 2 SO 4 and KI aqueous solution, exhibiting a excellent capacitance performance of up to ~ 654 F g −1 at 2 A g −1 , corresponding to the energy density of 14.53 Wh kg −1 at power density of 402 W kg −1 . Even at a high current of 20 A g −1 , the electrode can keep a capacitance of 318 F g −1 , showing an energy density of 7 Wh kg −1 at power density of 3984 W kg −1 . This study indicates the potential of nitrogen- and phosphorus-codoped carbon microspheres/reduced graphene oxide in high energy density supercapacitor.
