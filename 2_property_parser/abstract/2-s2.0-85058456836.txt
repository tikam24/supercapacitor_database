Proper design and sizing of Energy Storage and management is a crucial factor in Electric Vehicle (EV). It will result into efficient energy storage with reduced cost, increase in lifetime and vehicle range extension. Design and sizing calculations presented in this paper is based on theoretical concepts for the selected vehicle. This article also presents power management between two different energy storage devices i.e dual energy device using the converter (Hybrid Energy Storage), a single energy storage device cannot fulfill all desirable characteristics. The main objective of Hybrid Energy Storage System and power management is to assist EV acceleration, capture regenerative braking. and the reduction of battery stress by maintaining battery current as constant as possible during transients and combining Supercapacitor (Ultracapacitor) to provide instantaneous current during transients respectively and also the recovery of power during deceleration. Performance of Hybrid Energy Storage System is analyzed by experimental setup. It is clearly observed that after implementing power management algorithm battery current is maintained as constant as possible during acceleration i.e only average current is supplied by battery and during acceleration instantaneous current is supplied by supercapacitor.
