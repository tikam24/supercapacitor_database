Carbon nanocoils (CNCs), prepared by the flame combustion of ethanol, were purified and activated sequentially with hydrochloric acid and KOH. The morphology and structure of CNCs were characterized by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and N2 adsorption. The results show that most of the catalyst particles could be removed by hydrochloric acid and the CNCs specific surface area enlarged while the morphologies changed little. Short tube length and rough tube walls were obtained by an activating treatment of CNCs using KOH as activating agent and the specific surface area enlarged remarkably. The electrochemical capacity of activated CNCs is 107 F/g, which is much higher than 40 F/g of pristine carbon nanocoils.
