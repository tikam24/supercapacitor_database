Three-dimensional N/S co-doped succulent-like hierarchical carbon (3D NS-SHC) is synthesized by carbonization of a supramolecular cluster. In this supramolecular process, potassium citrate can act as a reliable carbon source, while the thiourea as a N/S source and then, two molecules gradually tend to generate a giant “all-in-one” precursor via hydrogen bonding verified by Independent Gradient Model (IGM) calculation. TEM and SEM images show the N/S co-doped carbon holds a novel 3D succulent-like hierarchical structure. For NS-SHC-8:8 sample, element mapping images display the uniform N/S atoms distribution. These distinct features can be related to the supramolecular polymerization which promotes in-situ N/S co-doping homogenously and conduces to build 3D structure. Typically, NS-SHC-8:8 electrode exhibits prominent specific capacitance (258.5 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1) and excellent cycle stability (94.4% after 20000 cycles) in three-electrode system. Furthermore, an assembled quasi-solid state symmetric supercapacitor delivers good energy density (10.2 Wh kg−1 at 250 W kg−1) and steady cycle endurance (85.1% after 10000 cycles). These eximious behaviors of NS-SHC-8:8 are mainly attributed to (1) the uniform N/S atoms distribution and their synergistic effect, which brings extra Faradaic reaction to higher specific capacitance, (2) the charming 3D succulent-like hierarchical structure, which serves as a multifunctional reservoir that can accommodate the ion/charge and facilitate their migration to further promote the electrochemical performance. Above mentions suggest that this uniformly heteroatom-modified carbon material produced by supramolecular technique is promising for high-performance energy storage devices.
