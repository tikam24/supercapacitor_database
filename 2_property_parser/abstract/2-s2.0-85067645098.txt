A cobalt sulfide encapsulated within carbon nanotube-carbon nanofiber (Co9S8@CNT-CNF) nanohybrid electrode is designed and prepared. The physicochemical characterization such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron microscopy revealed the formation of Co9S8@CNT-CNF. The specific capacitance of Co9S8@CNT-CNF is 1656 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with good electrochemical cycle stability (92.6% up to 10,000 cycles). The Co9S8@CNT-CNF electrode exhibits a maximum power density of 8.83 kW kg−1 with an energy density of 65 Wh kg−1, while a maximum energy density of 175 Wh kg−1 is attained at a power density of 463 W kg−1. This impressive electrochemical performance of the Co9S8@CNT-CNF composite indicated significant potential for application in high-power and energy-storage devices.
