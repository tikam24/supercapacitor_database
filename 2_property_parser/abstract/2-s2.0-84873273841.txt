Highly capacitance-enhanced activated carbons used for supercapacitors were obtained by treatment of low-cost granular activated carbons. The preferred technical process involves pre-oxidation and acidic or alkaline activation treatment. It is shown with the combination of IR spectra and N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms that the pre-oxidation treatment is beneficial to opening closed pores and raises the effective pore capacity, but has few effects on the increase of carbon surface functional groups. The mixed acid (3H3PO4+H2SO4) or alkali (KOH) treatment evidently fertilizes electroactive functional groups at the carbon surface. Meanwhile, the specific surface area of activated carbon is greatly increased. The capacitive behavior of the treated activated carbon is investigated by a.c. impedance, cyclic voltammetry, and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements. The result shows that the pre-oxidation-activation treated activated carbon has low charge-transfer resistance, large electrochemical capacitance, and stable cycle life. Especially, the specific capacitance of the pre-oxidation-acidic activation treated activated activated carbon (POAC_A) and the pre-oxidation-alkaline activation treated activated activated carbon (POAC_B) at the charge-discharge current of 1.0 A/g reach 187 F/g and 206 F/g, respectively.
