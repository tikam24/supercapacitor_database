In this study, the performance of a Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA)-Borax-based polymer has been investigated as an electrode for high capacity, flexible and self-healing supercapacitors. Utilizing the it was presented in this study that at least threefold capacitance increase could be obtained by doping PVA-Borax polymer with Cobalt (Co) element. In addition, it was also demonstrated that this combination exhibits intrinsic self-healability which is also very significant for modern electronic technology. In order to characterize the samples, Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) along with structural and morphological techniques were employed. It was determined that PVA/Co/Borax samples, which were electrochemically characterized at 0–0.5, 0–1 and 0–2 Voltage (V) ranges, exhibit different redox behaviors and different capacitive performances. At the end of 1000 cycles, the highest discharge capacitance value was obtained with a value of 9.92 F/g in the 0–2 V range.
