A composite electrode material comprised of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and MnO2 was prepared by the method of refluxing the CNTs firstly, and then depositing MnO2 on the refluxed CNTs. The prepared material was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), infra-red spectra (IR), cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge. The effects of refluxing treatment and MnO2 depositing on the performance of CNTs supercapacitors were also studied. The results show that supercapacitors based on the composite electrode material are characterized by high specific capacitance, high energy density, excellent reversibility and long lifetime. The specific capacitance reaches to 134 F/g when the MnO2 mass fraction is 65%. The supercapacitors have good power performance when the MnO2 mass fraction is less than 50%. Through refluxing treatment, large quantities of electroactive functional groups are produced, and the inner surface of the CNTs can also be used to form the electric double-layer.
