The integration between energy-harvesting and energy-storage devices into a self-charging power unit is an effective approach to address the energy bottleneck of wearable/portable/wireless smart devices. Herein, we demonstrate a stretchable coplanar self-charging power textile (SCPT) with triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) and microsupercapacitors (MSCs) both fabricated through a resist-dyeing-analogous method. The textile electrodes maintain excellent conductivity at 600% and 200% tensile strain along course and wale directions, respectively. The fabric in-plane MSC with reduced graphene oxides as active materials reaches a maximum areal capacitance of 50.6 mF cm-2 at 0.01 V s-1 and shows no significant degradation at 50% of tensile strain. The stretchable fabric-based TENG can output 49 V open-circuit voltage and 94.5 mW m-2 peak power density. Finally, a stretchable coplanar SCPT with one-batch resist-dyeing fabrication is demonstrated for powering small electronics intermittently without extra recharging. Our approach is also compatible with conventional textile processing and suggests great potential in electronic textiles and wearable electronics.
