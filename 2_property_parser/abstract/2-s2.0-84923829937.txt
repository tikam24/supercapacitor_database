In this study, a hierarchical ZnCo2O4@MnO2 core-shell nanotube arrays electrode was developed by a facile two-step method. The electrode exhibits high specific capacitance of 1981 F g-1 (2.38 F cm-2) at a current density of 5 A g-1 and excellent cycling stability (5000 cycles). Furthermore, a low-cost, high-performance asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) with ZnCo2O4@MnO2 core-shell nanotube arrays on Ni foam (as positive electrode) and 3D porous α-Fe2O3 on Fe foil (as negative electrode) was successfully designed. The as-designed ASC device with an extended operating voltage window of 1.3 V achieved a specific capacitance of 161 F g-1 at 2.5 mA cm-2 with a maximum energy density of 37.8 W h kg-1 and excellent stability with a capacitance retention of 91% after 5000 cycles. Furthermore, after being charged for dozens of seconds, the ZnCo2O4@MnO2//α-Fe2O3-ASC can easily light up a LED. These fascinating performances indicate that the present ZnCo2O4@MnO2 core-shell nanotube arrays with remarkable electrochemical properties could be considered as potential electrode materials for next generation supercapacitors in high energy density storage systems.
