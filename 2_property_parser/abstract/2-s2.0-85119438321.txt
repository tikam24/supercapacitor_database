Cannabis sativa L., a low-cost, fast-growing herbaceous plant, is seeing a resurgence in widespread cultivation as a result of new policies and product drive. Its biodegradable and environmentally benign nature coupled with its high specific surface area and three-dimensional hierarchal structure makes it an excellent candidate for use as a biomass-derived carbon material for electrochemical power sources. It is proposed that this ‘wonder crop’ could have an important role in the energy transition by providing high-functioning carbon-based materials for electrochemistry. In this article, all instances of C. sativa usage in batteries, fuel cells and supercapacitors are discussed with a focus on highlighting the high capacity, rate capability, capacitance, current density and half-wave potential that can be achieved with its utilisation in the field.
