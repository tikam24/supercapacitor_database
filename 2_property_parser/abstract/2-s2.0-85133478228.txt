We have reported the fabrication of novel quasi one-dimensional nitrogen doped graphene nanobelts (quasi 1D NGNBs) by a simple and cost-effective method. The growth of such a unique structure was achieved by treating graphene with ammonia under hydrothermal conditions, followed by low temperature treatment with nitrogen liquid. After the removal of ice template by lyophilization, the synthesized quasi 1D NGNBs were obtained. The synthesized quasi 1D NGNBs were examined by SEM, TEM, Raman, XPS, BET and TGA. The prepared quasi 1D NGNBs exhibit higher surface area (718 m2 g−1), good structural stability, high electrical conductivity, less internal resistance (0.5 Ω), and many active sites than reduced graphene oxide. The electrochemical analysis reveals that quasi 1D NGNBs have a specific capacitance of 286 F g−1 at current density of 1.0 A g−1 that is greater as compared to 112 F g−1 for rGO and also exhibit enhanced cyclic stability with excellent retention above 79.03% after 20,000 times. So, this indicates that quasi 1D NGNBs possess high capacitance due to distinct folded structure of π-π stacking and can be used for high performance supercapacitors.
