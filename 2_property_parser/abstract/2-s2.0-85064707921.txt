Only battery-powered electric/hybrid electric vehicles have been suffering from driving range as well as peak power generation; in order to overcome those problems the size of the battery may be increased. But this solution again remains with some drawback like increased size, weight and cost of the vehicle. Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) has been developed by mixing battery with Ultracapacitor (UC). UC always supplies the peak power and battery is mending to supply the average power. In order to obtain the proper switching between the battery and UC, a new controller has been designed based on the speed of an electric motor. Four individual math functions are taken and programmed based on the speed of an electric motor for successful four modes of operation termed as Math Function Based (MFB) controller. The designed MFB controller has been implemented in all modes of electric motor operation in MATLAB/Simulation and results are plotted and discussed in Simulation and results section.
