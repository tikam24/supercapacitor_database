A simple but efficient route based on supramolecular approach for large scale synthesis of intercalated polyaniline graphene nanohybrid with three dimensional pillar structures is described. The selective removal of graphene surface modifier through dissolution from the nanohybrid has dramatically improved the electrochemical performance of the material through making the structure more porous. The formation of porous structure after removal of the graphene surface modifier is also evidenced from surface area and porosity measurement. The nanohybrid materials show the best capacitance value of 630 Fg-1 at current density 0.5 A/g with good electrochemical stability. The thermal stability of the coupled hybrid materials is significantly improved than the individual component. This synthesis strategy can also be further applied to fabricate large scale uniform flexible conducting films. The general nature of the synthesis and the resulting nanohybrid materials can offer potential applications like energy storage, electronic device, sensor and EMI shielding.
