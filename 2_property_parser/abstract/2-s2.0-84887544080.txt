A serials of nanostructured palygorskite modified polyaniline electrode materials for supercapacitors were prepared by in-situ polymerization. The structure and surface features of the composites were characterized, and the electrochemical performances of the composites were measured in 1.0 mol/L H2SO4 electrolyte. It was shown that the composites had smaller particle and higher disperse degree compared with individual polyaniline, while the specific capacitance increased and then decreased with increasing the content of palygorskite. The composites with 1.8% palygorskite had the maximum specific capacitance among those composites with different content of palygorskite. Compared with that of polyaniline (373 F/g), the specific capacitance increased to 485 F/g for composite with 1.8% palygorskite at current density of 1.0 A/g. At current density of 3.0 A/g, the capacitance retention of 75.4% was obtained after 1 000 cycles, which was higher than individual polyaniline (55.7%) under the same condition.
