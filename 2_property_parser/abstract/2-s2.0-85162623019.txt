As an important member of the field of new energy vehicles, electric buses are gradually becoming the object of vigorous development of green transportation in China. Due to the constraints of battery technology at this stage, electric vehicles with a single energy storage device still have certain limitations in terms of range and cycle life. As a newly developed energy storage equipment, the supercapacitor has the features of rapid charging, high energy density, rapid discharge, and long-term cycle lifetime. Combining with a battery to form a composite power supply can effectively make up for the defects of a single energy storage device and extend the service life of the battery. In this paper, an electric bus model is built in Matlab/Simulink, and fuzzy logic control is used to allocate the power system demand power. Results show that under one test work condition, the power battery capacity decay of the electric bus with supercapacitor composite energy storage is significantly slower.
