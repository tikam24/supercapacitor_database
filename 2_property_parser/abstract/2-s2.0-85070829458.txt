In this work, club-like glucose/copper cobalt sulfide (C@CuCo2S4) electrode material has been firstly synthesized via a hydrothermal method using glucose as a carbon source. The morphology and structure properties of the composite materials are investigated by SEM, TEM, XRD, XPS, and EDS. The galvanostatic charge-discharge test of C@CuCo2S4 shows a great specific capacitance of 854 F g−1 at a discharge current density of 1 A g−1, which is much higher than that of the precursor CuCo2S4. Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor using the C@CuCo2S4 electrode and activated carbon is assembled, which exhibits high energy density of 37.8 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 400 W kg−1 and excellent cycling stability with 96.5% capacitance retention after 7000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g−1. In addition, two asymmetric devices in a series have better practical application value.
