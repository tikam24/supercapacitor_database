This paper describes a stationary bench simulating the traction drive of electric transport vehicles in traction, freewheeling and braking modes which is planned to investigate the drive operation with and without a supercapacitor energy storage system. The bench contains two equal coupled AC motors simulating the traction drive of surface electric transport and the traction drive load. Before the physical realization of the bench it is necessary to design its virtual model for simulations in order to make sure that it functions as needed. The simulation of the drive operation modes is performed using Matlab/Simulink software.
