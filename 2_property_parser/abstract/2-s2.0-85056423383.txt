The 3D CoMoO4/rGO aerogel was synthesized using hydrothermal method and used as electrode for high- performance supercapacitors. Microstructure analysis showed that the CoMoO4/rGO hybrid composite is composed of one- dimensional CoMoO4 nanorods grown on reduced graphene oxide nanosheets, which exhibited higher specific capacitance than pure rGO, CoMoO4 nanorods with good rate capability. The composite retained 84.7 % of its original specific capacitance after 1000 charge-discharge cycles at a current density of 1 A g-1, which demonstrated that the long-term cycling stability of CoMoO4/rGO aerogel is outstanding.. Conductive graphene improves electron conductivity and enhances the Faradaic pseudo-capacitance of CoMoO4. The remarkable electrochemical performance makes the 3D CoMoO4/rGO aerogel one of the most competitive electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage, which provides a potential way to fabricate the all-solid-state and wearable energy storage devices.
