State-of-the-art energy storage devices are highly attractive for the ever-worsening energy depletion and environmental deterioration. Among various candidates, supercapacitors (SCs) have been considered among the most promising energy storage devices. As key factors for the development of SCs, the electrode materials have been widely exploited, and great achievements have been made. Among these materials, carbon-fiber materials, such as carbon nanofibers (CNFs), carbon cloths (CCs), and carbon fiber papers (CFPs), are considered as promising candidates for electrodes and supports/current collectors for other electrode materials, owing to their special physical/chemical properties and structures. This Minireview aims to provide an overview of recent advances and technologies to improve the electrochemical performance of these carbon-fiber materials and their composite electrodes. We also briefly outline the current challenges and perspectives for the development of these carbon-fiber materials and carbon-fiber-based composite electrode materials.
