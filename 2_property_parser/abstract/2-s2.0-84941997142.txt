At recent years, using hybrid energy storage systems has become a global solution to supply continuous, reliable and clean energy to power electronic devices. By using these technologies, many advantages of energy storage systems can be combined properly and an adequate energy supply for specific applications is achievable. In today's world, there is a continuous global need for more energy which, at the same time, has to be cleaner than the energy produced from the traditional generation technologies. This need has facilitated the increasing penetration of distributed generation technologies and primarily of renewable energy sources. In addition, by maturating renewable energy sources and technologies around it, providing a significant part of the total energy generation, requiring fewer costs with cleaner characteristics for environment, has become possible. The extensive use of such energy sources in today's electricity networks can indisputably minimize the threat of global warming and climate change. There are many advantages in using renewable energy sources alongside with the energy generated by fossil fuels which is discussed in this article. This work also discusses different types of energy storage devices and studies the advantages and disadvantages of these devices. Then different types of renewable energy sources and their role in in hybrid energy systems will be analyzed and noted. Some energy storage systems are modeled and simulated. Required power electronic circuits in hybrid storage systems will be introduced. At the end, some practical examples of hybrid energy systems (such as Battery-Supercapacitor) are presented, modeled and simulated.
