Hierarchical MoO3/MnO2 core-shell nanostructures were prepared by a hydrothermal process followed by in-situ oxidative polymerization as an integrated electrode material for supercapacitors. The core-shell MoO3/MnO2 nanocomposites exhibited excellent electrochemical properties with high specific capacitance of 352.4 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and desirable rate capability in 1 M NaOH solution. The superior electrochemical performances could be ascribed to the MoO3/MnO2 core-shell nanostructures which make two types of pseudocapacitive materials connected physically and significantly improve electrolyte diffusion efficiency and electron transport. These MoO3/MnO2 core-shell nanostructures with remarkable electrochemical performances could be considered as a prospective candidate for the application of supercapacitors.
