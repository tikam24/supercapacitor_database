Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are a promising material for use as a flexible electrode in wearable energy devices due to their electrical conductivity, soft mechanical properties, electrochemical activity, and large surface area. However, their electrical resistance is higher than that of metals, and deformations such as stretching can lead to deterioration of electrical performances. To address these issues, here a novel stretchable electrode based on laterally combed CNT networks is presented. The increased percolation between combed CNTs provides a high electrical conductivity even under mechanical deformations. Additional nickel electroplating and serpentine electrode designs increase conductivity and deformability further. The resulting stretchable electrode exhibits an excellent sheet resistance, which is comparable to conventional metal film electrodes. The resistance change is minimal even when stretched by â‰ˆ100%. Such high conductivity and deformability in addition to intrinsic electrochemically active property of CNTs enable high performance stretchable energy harvesting (wireless charging coil and triboelectric generator) and storage (lithium ion battery and supercapacitor) devices. Monolithic integration of these devices forms a wearable energy supply system, successfully demonstrating its potential as a novel soft power supply module for wearable electronics.
