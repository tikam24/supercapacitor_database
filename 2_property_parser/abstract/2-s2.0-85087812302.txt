Recently, the electrochemical efficiency of supercapacitors has experienced a dramatic rise, followed by a rapid developing rate on introducing promising electrode material, led to manufacture highly performance supercapacitors. In this work we synthesized Silsesquioxane -containing graphene oxide (SSQ-GO) and alkoxy substituted ammonium-based ionic liquid, (Tris[2-(2-methoxy ethoxy) ethyl]methyl ammonium Iodide (TMEMAI)) blended with conductive polymer, Poly ortho amino phenol (SSQ-GO- TMEMAI-POAP) used as an electrode in both three and two-electrode systems. The prepared material characterized by XPS, XRD, TEM, SEM, EDX, techniques and the attributed electrochemical tests carried out by cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry techniques. The incorporating of TMEMAI into GO surface with porous structure in the presence of conductive polymer exhibited high conductivity and decreased resistance through the efficient electron channels based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy test. The specific capacitance and energy density of SSQ-GO-TMEMAI-POAP were significantly improved, while retention capacity obtained ∼96% within 3000 charge-discharge cycles, with high durability. Concerning the two-electrode design, the specific capacitance calculated as 450 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, where the energy density at power density achieved of 22.5 W h kg−1, 300 W kg−1, respectively. The incorporation of ionic liquid and conductive polymer within SSQ-GO-TMEMAI-POAP nanocomposite indicated high electrochemical potential where used in energy storage devices.
