Composite material based supercapacitors have attracted interest as promising green and efficient candidates in energy storage application. In the present work, the copper oxide/nickel oxide (CuO/NiO) and its carbon composite with hetero atom (N) doped graphene (CuO/NiO/N-rGO) were successfully synthesized by probe sonication assisted solvothermal procedure and used as active electrodes in supercapacitor application. The CuO/NiO/N-rGO composite material was utilized as an electrode in supercapacitor and exhibited specific capacitance of ∼220 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. Significantly, capacitance retention of the electrode was found to be 97% even after 5000 charge-discharge cycles. The high electrochemical performance and cyclic stability of CuO/NiO/N-rGO indicated the composite to be a promising candidate for supercapacitor applications.
