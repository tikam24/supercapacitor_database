A hybrid energy storage system (HESS) consisting of battery and supercapacitor (SC) is proposed for use in a wind farm in order to achieve power dispatchability. In the designed scheme, the rate of charging/discharging powers of the battery is controlled while the faster wind power transients are diverted to the SC. This enhances the lifetime of the battery. Furthermore, by taking into consideration the random nature of the wind power, a statistical design method is developed to determine the capacities of the HESS needed to achieve specified confidence level in the power dispatch. The proposed approach is useful in the planning of the wind farm-HESS scheme and the coordination of the power flows between the battery and SC. Â© 2011 IEEE.
