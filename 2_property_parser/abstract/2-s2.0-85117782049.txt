Developing hierarchical nanostructures composed of transition-metal dichalcogenides and hollow carbon matrixes is one of the attractive avenues in energy storage and conversion field on account of their unique the synergistic effect and stable architecture. Herein, N, P-codoped hollow carbon nanocomposites combined with WSe2 nanosheets were fabricated via a robust strategy including a metal chelation coordination method and high-temperature selenization treatment. Such a typical hollow structure can offer numerous reaction sites and more diffusion paths to accelerate the transport of Li-ions. In addition, the carbon substrate is able to enhance electric conductivity and alleviate the aggregation of the WSe2 nanosheets. As a result, the as-prepared WSe2 nanosheets/N, P-codoped carbon nanocomposites deliver the rate capability of 477 mA h g-1 at 5.0 A g-1. This electrode demonstrates super-durable cyclability after 3000 cycles with the capability of 620 mA h g-1 at 1.0 A g-1. Moreover, the as-prepared sample displays a high-power density (4987.5 W kg-1), high-energy density (125.1 W h kg-1), and impressive cyclic durability, when assembled with activated carbon for hybrid Li-ion capacitors. This work proposes an effective approach to design advanced hierarchical nanostructures in various energy-related applications.
