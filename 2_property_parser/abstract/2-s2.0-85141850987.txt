In recent years, micro turbine technology has become a continuously reliable and viable distributed generation system. The application of distributed energy power generation sources, such as micro gas turbines (MGT), to charge electric vehicles offers numerous technical, economical benefits, and opportunities. MGT are considered as they are smaller than conventional heavy-duty gas turbines. They also are capable of accepting and operating with different fossil fuels in the range of low–high pressure levels as well as co-generation opportunities. The MGT could provide the fast and reliable output power guaranteed and needed for grid stability. This paper provides a mathematical representation, modelling, and simulation of a low-cost fast charging station based on a micro gas turbine and a super capacitor forming altogether a power generation system suitable for use especially as energy source in fast charging stations and dynamic power systems. All the micro gas turbine’s parameters are estimated according to available performance and operational data. The proposed system generates up to 30 kW output power assuming that it operates with natural gas. The developed model of the system is simulated in the environment of MATLAB/Simulink. Each part of the micro turbine generation system is represented by a mathematical model. On the basis of the developed model of the system, the minimum value of the supercapacitor was determined, which ensures the charging schedule of a selected electric vehicle.
