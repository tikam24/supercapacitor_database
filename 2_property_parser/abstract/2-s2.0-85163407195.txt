Currently, Electric Vehicles are purely based on battery storage. The battery is an expensive component of the vehicle and is subject to the transient and pulse current requirements of the vehicle. Researchers have shifted their focus to hybridizing high energy density batteries with high power density energy sources such as supercapacitors. Such systems are called hybrid energy storages and such vehicles are called xEVs. This paper reviews the recent developments in the field of hybrid energy storage technology with a focus on Battery/Supercapacitor systems. The state-of-the-art simulation methods, hybrid energy topologies and the energy management algorithms are discussed in this literature. This paper will provide key insights about Battery/Supercapacitor-based hybrid energy storage and would help researchers to quickly identify the relevant simulation strategy, energy storage topology and energy management algorithms according to their requirement.
