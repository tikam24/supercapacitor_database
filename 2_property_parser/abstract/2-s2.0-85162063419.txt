Nowadays, immense attention has been paid toward the rational design and synthesis of high-power density electrodes materials for high-power supercapattery applications. In the present work, ZnFe2O4 nanostructures with unique cauliflower-like morphology were deposited on a flexible nickel foam substrate using a simple, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly electrodeposition method. The synthesized nanostructures were thoroughly examined by using structural, morphological, and electrochemical characterization techniques. Electrochemical studies of cauliflower-like nanostructured ZnFe2O4 electrode show a deviation from normal behavior and favored a mixed supercapacitor-battery-type nature. The value of specific capacity is obtained as 513 C g−1 at a current density of 1 Ag−1. The cauliflower-like nanostructured ZnFe2O4 electrode exhibits remarkable energy density and power density of 8.72 Wh kg−1 and 306.25 W kg−1, respectively. Also, it shows long-term cyclic stability up to 5000 cycles with a maximum capacitance retention rate of 72%. These results signify that the high electrochemical performance and excellent stability of the cauliflower-like nanostructured ZnFe2O4 electrode material relate to their unique architecture, high energy, and power density for supercapattery devices.
