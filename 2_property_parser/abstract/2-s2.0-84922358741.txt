Electric public bus scheduling problem is studied for the service in Chulalongkorn university campus. This paper presents an integrated bus scheduling simulation combined with options of energy storage system with the target to minimize the wait time. The bus system is simulated by Arena software for the bus scheduling. The solution dictates the change of the bus schedule; the resulting change of wait time is then observed. Lead-acid equipped with supercapacitor and lithium-ion batteries were compared in this study to exhibit the improved performance. The supercapacitor hybrid and lithium-ion battery provides an improvement of 14% and 45.7% in discharge energy, respectively. The supercapacitor hybrid was shown to reduce battery stress as well as improved driving dynamics. The optimized lead-acid case can reduce the waiting time significantly and at the similar level to the supercapacitor hybrid. With much higher cost, the lithium-ion battery reduce the waiting time the most by 25% due to its superior energy efficiency as well as shorter charging period.
