Nanostructured Cu oxides/hydroxides are promising materials for supercapacitors because of their high theoretical capacitance, low cost and friendliness to environment. However, the development of commercially viable Cu oxides/hydroxides with superior capacitive performance is still challenging. Here, 3D binder-free Cu2O@Cu nanoneedle arrays electrode was developed via facile electrochemistry. The electrode exhibits a high capacitance of 862.4 F g-1 and excellent cycling stability (20 000 cycles). Furthermore, we have successfully constructed a Cu2O@Cu//AC asymmetric supercapacitor, which can achieve an energy density of 35.6 W h kg-1 at 0.9 kW kg-1 and excellent stability with a capacitance retention of 92% after 10 000 cycles. After being charged for dozens of seconds, the in-series Cu2O@Cu//AC supercapacitors can light up LED arrays and even charge a mobile phone. These fascinating performances reasonably indicate their potential in commercial applications for energy storage. This journal is
