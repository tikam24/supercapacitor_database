In this study, the Ni-Co LDH nanosheets on carbon fiber covered with ultrathin mesoporous NiMoO4 nanosheet (named Ni-Co LDH@NiMoO4)were successfully fabricated, and then graphene oxide layer was closely combined with Ni-Co LDH@NiMoO4 by physical adsorption (named Carbon fiber/Ni-Co LDH@NiMoO4/GO), forming a stable sandwiched electrode material, and thus exhibits good electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance of 2100 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. The specific capacitance still maintains 91% after 5000 cycles. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor was successfully assembled by using the synthesized Carbon fiber/Ni-Co LDH@NiMoO4/GO as the positive electrode and activate carbon as the negative electrode, and then, the asymmetric supercapacitor device exhibits high power density and energy density.
