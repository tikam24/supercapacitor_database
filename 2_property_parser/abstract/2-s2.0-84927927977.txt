Carbonization of milk-free coconut kernel pulp is carried out at low temperatures. The carbon samples are activated using KOH, and electrical double-layer capacitor (EDLC) properties are studied. Among the several samples prepared, activated carbon prepared at 600 °C has a large surface area (1,200 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>). There is a decrease in surface area with increasing temperature of preparation. Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge studies suggest that activated carbons derived from coconut kernel pulp are appropriate materials for EDLC studies in acidic, alkaline, and non-aqueous electrolytes. Specific capacitance of 173 F g<sup>-1</sup> is obtained in 1 M H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> electrolyte for the activated carbon prepared at 600°C. The supercapacitor properties of activated carbon sample prepared at 600°C are superior to the samples prepared at higher temperatures. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.
