In order to solve the problem of agglomeration and stacking between carbon nanotube (CNT) and graphene, achieve their uniform distribution and give full play to their good energy storage performance, a reduced graphene oxide (RGO)-CNT macroscopic body nanocomposite with a three-dimensional (3D) network structure was prepared in one step in this paper, which was carried out by a series of efficient bonding reactions between carboxylated CNT and graphene oxide in a hydrothermal environment. After being cut and pressed, the obtained macroscopic body composite could be directly assembled into the electrochemical supercapacitors for electrochemical performance testing. The obtained samples were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, Raman spectroscopy and N2 absorption and desorption. The research results show that the obtained RGO-CNT macroscopic body composite has an obvious 3D network structure and shows an excellent electrical conductivity. Its electrochemical discharge specific capacitance can be up to 157.05 F·g−1 in organic electrolyte, which is significantly higher than those of RGO or CNT. Moreover, the composite has a distinguished cycle performance.
