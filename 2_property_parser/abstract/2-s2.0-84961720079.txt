Co-WO3 and CoWO4 nanopowders have been successfully obtained from microwave mediated process. The characterization of the prepared nanopowders was carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy and Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy techniques. The XRD pattern confirms the formation of orthorhombic and monoclinic phase of the as-synthesized and calcined samples, respectively. Scanning electron microscopic examination of the resultant powders reveals the formation of nanoporous morphology. The electrochemical performance of the Co-WO3 and CoWO4 coated electrodes was also investigated. The maximum specific capacitance of 45 F/g was achieved for the Co-WO3 nanopowder.
