Inks printing is an innovative and practicable technology capable of fabricating the next generation of flexible functional systems with various designs and desired architectures. As a result, inks printing is extremely attractive in the development of printed wearables, including wearable sensors, micro supercapacitor (MSC) electrodes, electromagnetic shielding, and thin-film batteries. The discovery of Ti3C2Tx in 2011, a 2D material known as a MXene, which is a compound composed of layered nitrides, carbides, or carbonitrides of transition metals, has attracted significant interest within the research community because of its exceptional physical and chemical properties. MXene has high metallic conductivity of transition metal carbides combined with hydrophilic behavior due to its surface terminated functional groups, all of which make it an excellent candidate for promising inks printing applications. This paper reviews recent progress in the development of 2D MXene inks, including synthesis procedures, inks formulation and performance, and printing methods. Further, the review briefly provides an overview of future guidelines for the study of this new generation of 2D materials.
