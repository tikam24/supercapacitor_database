Graphene, a single atom thick carbon material with high surface area and electrical conductivity provides an ideal platform for designing high performance electrochemical devices. This paper reports the synthesis of phosphorous doped graphene from reduced graphene sheets, its characterization by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy and its use for supercapacitor applications. The specific capacitance was found to be 367 Fg-1 from electrochemical measurements. These samples show a high power density of 9 kW kg-1 and energy density of 59 Wh kg-1 in an aqueous electrolyte solution, which is much higher than other graphene-based supercapacitors. The phosphorus-doped graphene showed a high potential for use in low cost energy storage devices. Copyright Â© 2013 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.
