In this work, the commercial carbon paper was firstly peeled in K2CO3 solution and then was further treated in a KNO3 solution to form functional exfoliation graphene (FEG) on the commercial carbon paper. The FEG/carbon paper was characterized by Raman spectra and scanning electron microscopy, confirming that some typical layered fold graphenes were successfully peeled off and stood on the carbon paper matrix. Then, Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) were grown on the surface of FEG/carbon paper and the as-prepared Fe3O4 NPs/FEG/carbon paper was directly used as supercapacitor electrode. The specific capacitance of Fe3O4 NPs/FEG/carbon paper was about 316.07 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. Furthermore, the FEG/carbon papers were also functionalized by benzene carboxylic acid to form FFEG/carbon papers, and then the Fe3O4 NPs were grown on the surface of FFEG/carbon paper. The specific capacitance of Fe3O4 NPs/FFEG/carbon paper was 470 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, superior to some previous reported results. This work might provide a new strategy to prepare various nanostructures on FFEG/carbon papers for future applications.
