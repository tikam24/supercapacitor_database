Graphene oxide is an imperative modified form of graphene. Similar to graphene, graphene oxide has gained vast interest for the myriad of industrial applications. Conjugated polymers or conducting polymers are well known organic materials having conducting backbone. These polymers have semiconducting nature due to Ï€-conjugation along the main chain. Doping and modification have been used to enhance the electrical conductivity of the conjugated polymers. The nanocom-posites of the conjugated polymers have been reported with the nanocarbon nanofillers including graphene oxide. This review essentially presents the structure, properties, and advancements in the field of conducting polymer/graphene oxide nanocomposites. The facile synthesis, processability, and physical properties of the polymer/graphene oxide nanocomposites have been discussed. The conjugated polymer/graphene oxide nanocomposites have essential significance for the superca-pacitors, solar cells, and anti-corrosion materials. Nevertheless, the further advanced properties and technical applications of the conjugated polymer/graphene oxide nanocomposites need to be explored to overcome the challenges related to the high performance.
