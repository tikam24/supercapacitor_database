Currently, the demand of energy is being increased day-by-day and because of this, the energy crisis has been arisen. Thus, the evolution of new energy sources is being changed with every day, along with various energy-storing techniques, such as fuel cells, solar cells, rechargeable batteries, and capacitors. In this context, the supercapacitors have been emerged having potential for developing advances in energy storage where these are directed by the same basic mathematics and science as conventional capacitors. They are differing in terms of higher surface area and thinner dielectrics that leads to greater capacitances than those of conventional capacitors. These are recognized for their high efficiency in energy, power, and long life-cycle in the advancement of energy storage devices such as electrical vehicles and wearable or portable electronic products. So, a rapid growth has been seen in the research and development of energy storage devices that yield a noteworthy number of electrochemically active compounds or materials. Such capacitors with excellent electrochemical possessions, ecofriendly, safety, and environmental kindliness have come to the forefront in recent years. Therefore, the supercapacitors have become an emerging power solution, and being utilizing in a number of applications. In this context, this chapter focuses on the general introduction, mechanism, and development in the field of supercapacitor.
