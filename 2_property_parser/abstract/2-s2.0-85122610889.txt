The rational design of oxygen vacancies and electronic microstructures of electrode materials is crucial to promoting the energy storage performance. Herein, hierarchical urchin-like NiCoO2@N-C nanospheres assembled with mesoporous nanorods are reported as high-energy cathode materials to simultaneously satisfy the requirements of supercapacitors and zinc–ion batteries. Results show that the optimisation of annealing temperature in NiCoO2@N-C products can significantly adjust the composition, electronic structure and generate abundant oxygen vacancies. Benefiting from these merits, the as-synthesised NiCoO2@N-C electrode delivers excellent capacity (418 C g−1 at 1 A g−1) and long cycle performance (81% after 5000 cycles). Moreover, our fabricated NiCoO2@N-C//Zn battery presents an impressive specific capacity of 323 mAh g−1 and energy density of 226.1 Wh kg−1. The energy storage and conversion mechanisms are also explored using the X-ray Absorption Fine Structure, in-situ Raman spectroscopy and ex-situ X-ray diffraction, probing subtle structural evolution of electrode materials during charge and discharge processes. This work may open a new avenue to design the nanomaterials with adjustable surface defects to accelerate various electrochemical reactions.
