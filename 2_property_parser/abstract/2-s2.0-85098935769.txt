Different sulfur-doped content carbon is fabricated by the carbonization of SSNa modified PES, the pores and abundant heteroatoms endow the S-doped porous carbon (C-3) with a high capacity of 172 F/ g at 1 A/g and good cycling life (98.5 % retention after 6000 cycles). Moreover, typical dye of methylene blue adsorption results exhibited the maximum adsorption capacity of sulfur-doped carbon (C-3) was approximately 78 mg/g. The enhanced electrochemical performance of C-3 is ascribed to the sulfur-doping and ellipsoid structure. The results pave a new way to fabricate controlled heteroatom-doped content carbon material for supercapacitors and dyes adsorption through the cross linking heteroatom-containing polymer.
