Hollow δ-MnO2 nanospheres have been synthesized through an in situ redox etching reaction using MoS2 nanospheres as a sacrificial template in a KMnO4 aqueous solution. The formation mechanism for hollow δ-MnO2 nanospheres was investigated through designing the time-dependent experiments on the hydrothermal redox etching reaction. Based on the advantages of hollow structure, hollow δ-MnO2 nanospheres as an electrode for supercapacitors demonstrated a high specific capacitance of 394 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and good cycle stability with 95.2% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1. Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor device was assembled using hollow δ-MnO2 nanospheres as the positive electrode, which delivered an energy density of 24.4 W h kg−1 at a power density of 999 W kg−1. These findings suggest a great promise for hollow δ-MnO2 nanospheres in high-performance supercapacitors.
