Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have aroused great interest in energy storage applications due to the facile tunability of their structure, composition, morphology, and high theoretical capacitance. Moreover, due to its high resistance and ease of aggregation, LDH has been restricted to use in energy fields. To overcome these obstacles, combination with good conductivity and functional surface material is an efficient method for boosting energy storage. A simple and tunable strategy for engineering two-dimensional nanosheets of negatively charged MXene and positively charged cobalt tungsten (CoW) LDH obtained from zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) polyhedrons into three-dimensional network is described here. The electronic connection of CoW-LDH and MXene may enhance electron transfer and long-term cycling stability while also significantly increasing oxidation and reduction dynamics. The resulting self-assembled symmetric supercapacitor from CoW-LDH@MXene exhibits an outstanding capacitance of 478.5 Fg-1, exceptional cycle life (âˆ¼97% @ 6000 cycles), and significant energy densities (67 Wh/kg) and power density (64 kW/kg). This CoW LDH@MXene SSC may provide new insights into the synthesis of innovative multifunctional nanomaterials and promising candidates for commercial application.
