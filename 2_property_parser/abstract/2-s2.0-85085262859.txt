This article proposes a fault-tolerant control method for the battery-supercapacitor (SC) hybrid energy storage system (HESS) based on the cascaded multilevel converter during active dc-side failure (ADCF). When ADCF occurs, the magnitude of the output voltage will be seriously affected because of the decline of the dc-side voltage. Consequently, the system cannot operate normally. To tackle this problem, an auxiliary power loop, which uses the dual-frequency phase-shifted carrier pulsewidth modulation to transfer power between different energy storage units, is added into the HESS. The topology of the HESS and the principle of power transfer during failure operation are introduced. The requirement to the numbers of different types of cells: discharging, charging, and standby, is analyzed mathematically. The SC capacity and the control system designs are given. Finally, the simulation results obtained from MATLAB/Simulink as well as experiments based on a prototype are presented to verify the effectiveness of the HESS and the fault-tolerant control.
