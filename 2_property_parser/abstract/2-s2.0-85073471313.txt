Nanoscaled Ni(OH)2 was prepared with a new method involving separate nucleation and aging steps in a colloid mill with NaBH4 as the reducing agent. The as-synthesized Ni(OH)2 nanomaterials were investigated by power X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning Electron microscopy(SEM). The electrochemical behavior of Ni(OH)2 is further investigated as electrode materials for supercapacitors. We find that when the crystallization temperature is 90Â°C, the nanomaterials achieve the best electrochemical behavior.
