In this paper, a simple, low-cost and mild hydrothermal technology of growing vertically cross-linked ternary nickel cobalt sulfides nanosheets (CoNi2S4 NSs) with porous characteristics on SiC nanowires (SiC NWs) supporters with outstanding resistances to oxidation and corrosion, good conductivity and large specific surface area deposited directly on carbon cloth (CC) is successfully developed, forming a new family of free-standing advanced hybrid electrode for asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs). Such integrated electrode (SiC NWs@CoNi2S4 NSs) manifests intriguing electrochemical characteristics such as high specific capacity (231.1 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1) and rate capability due to the synergistic effect of SiC NWs and CoNi2S4 NSs with unique morphology. Additionally, an asymmetric supercapacitor is also assembled via using this special hybrid architectures as positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) on Ni foam (NF) as negative electrode, and it can yield a high energy density of 57.8 W h kg−1 with a power density of 1.6 kW kg−1 and long cycling lifespan. This study constitutes an emerging attractive strategy to reasonably design and fabricate novel SiC NWs-based nanostructured electrodes with enhanced capacity, which holds great potential to be the candidate of electrode materials for environmentally benign as well as high-performance energy storage devices.
