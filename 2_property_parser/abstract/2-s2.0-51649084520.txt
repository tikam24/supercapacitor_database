Equivalent moles of KMnO4 and Mn (CH3COO)2 were used to prepare a weak-crystalline α-MnO2 supercapacitor electrode material via a mechanochemical route. An assembled symmetrical supercapacitor was tested by galvanostatic charging-discharging within 1.2 V at 200 mA·g-1. The structure and electrochemical performances of the electrode material were identified by XRD, cyclic voltammetry and AC impedance both before and after charging-discharging. The slope of the charge-discharge curve was analyzed for the first time. It suggests that the supercapacitor exhibits both double-layer capability and pseudocapacitance property. Mn3O4, an electrochemical inert, has formed in the charging-discharging process. During cycling, redox peaks disappeared gradually in the cyclic voltammetry diagram, and the pseudocapacitance property disappeared in the discharge curve, then the discharge curve was closed to the ideal line of double-layer capacitance; the specific capacity and equivalent series resistance of the MnO2 supercapacitor changed accordingly, the maximum specific capacity of the MnO2 electrode reached as high as 416 F·g-1, and retained 220 F·g-1 after nearly 500 cycles.
