In this paper, we analyze the performance of a two-hop network in which a multiantenna source communicates with a single-antenna destination through a decode-and-forward single-antenna energy harvesting (EH) relay. We assume a novel practical system framework in which the EH relay has the option of augmenting the wireless energy harvested by drawing energy from a supplementary battery, thereby improving link performance. Assuming use of the time-switching relaying (TSR) EH protocol, the outage and throughput performance are analyzed. We optimize the fraction of time devoted to EH (the TSR parameter) so as to maximize throughput for fixed supplementary battery energy. We also optimize the TSR parameter to minimize supplementary battery energy consumption for target throughput performance. We further show that exploiting second-hop channel knowledge at the relay can dramatically reduce the energy drawn from the supplementary battery. These insights are of fundamental importance to system designers. Simulation results validate the derived analytical expressions and corroborate our findings.
