Supercapacitors are a different promising technique to satisfy the rising demand for energy storage systems. Introducing an economical and highly active electrocatalysts is crucial to exploit clean and environmental-friendly energy technology in the future. We have successfully manufactured a supercapacitor based on ordered mesoporous carbon/ molybdenum carbide (OMC/Mo2C) nanocomposite. OMC has been chosen as a substrate due to its conductivity, favorable physical strength, high flexibility, and light structure. The OMC/Mo2C nanocomposite electrode performed exceptionally well from electrochemical perspective, with a high capacity of 1718 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 current density. It was seen that the capacitance retention rate could still reach 90.3% after 5000 cycles, indicating that the OMC/Mo2C nanocomposite electrode has excellent stability. Moreover, the assembled OMC/Mo2C//AC asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits capacitance of 299.4 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, and a large energy density of 106.4 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 800 W kg−1, by exceptional cycling stability with 90% capacity maintenance after 5000 cycles. The research findings can be applied in the development of high-performance energy storage devices based on carbides of transition metals.
