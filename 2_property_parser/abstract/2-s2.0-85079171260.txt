The flexible supercapacitors have attracted tremendous attention, but challenges still remain in seeking suitable electrode materials to enhance the energy density and other aspects. To this end, a unique Polypyrrole (PPy)-reduced graphene oxide (rGO) Janus-faced film is prepared through a facile and scalable method consisting of the deposition of graphene film on the surface of copper foil via a Cu||GO electrochemical cell followed by the self-assembly of PPy at the heterogeneous interface. Such a distinctive structure, in which the PPy layer acts as the source of high pseudo-capacitance, while the graphene layer is employed as the “high way” for rapid electron transport and as well as the strong π-π coupling effect between graphene and polymer nanosheets, endows the resultant electrode ultra-high specific capacitances (1380 mF cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2) and excellent rate capability (65.1% capacitance retention with the current density increases to 20 mA cm−2). Furthermore, the assembled PPy-rGO//PPy-rGO symmetric supercapacitors deliver a maximum energy density of 31.95 Wh L−1, remarkable cyclic stability (89.7% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles) and superior mechanical property (82% capacitance retention after 8000 cycles under different bending conditions).
