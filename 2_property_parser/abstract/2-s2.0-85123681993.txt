In the present study, MnO2 nanoparticles were synthesized by simple facile hydrothermal method. The structural, morphological, and electrochemical behaviour of the synthesized nanoparticles were analyzed by XRD, SEM/EDX and CV. XRD confessed that the tetragonal structure of bare MnO2. The crystallite size of MnO2 nanoparticles obtained at MnCl2: KMnO4 (0.5: 0.4 M) was found to be 9.2 nm. The nanorod structures of the synthesised MnO2 nanoparticles were revealed by morphological studies. The electrochemical behaviour of nanorod like MnO2 nanoparticles showed a specific capacitance of 91 Fg-1 at lower scan rate of 10 mV s-1
