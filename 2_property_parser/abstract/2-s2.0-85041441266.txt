Novel FeS2/nitrogen-sulfur double doped graphene (NSG) flexible hybrids electrode materials have been successfully prepared via a rapid microwave method followed by tube furnace heating process. Small size nano-flower-like structure of FeS2 uniformly supported on multi-fold NSG, which promote electron transport and electrochemical reaction. The material shows good electrochemical performance in a three-electrode system, such as high specific capacitance (528.7 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1), excellent charge/discharge stability and long-term cycling life (89% of capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles at 10 A g−1). These results demonstrate great potential of FeS2/NSG flexible hybrid nanocomposites for supercapacitor application.
