In this work, we demonstrate the assembly of oxidised carbon nanohybrids (oCNHs) with a commercial cellulose membrane for solid-state supercapacitors. The oCNHs–cellulose membranes were prepared by filtering a water dispersion of oCNHs through the cellulose membrane. The oCNHs were derived from carbon nanotubes via a modified Hummer's method and contained both closed tubes and unzipped tubes, which indicated a hybrid geometrical structure. The solid-state supercapacitor based on the oCNHs–cellulose membranes showed a high areal capacitance of ~75 mF/cm2 at a low scan rate (5 mV/s) and excellent stability for 1,000 cycles.
