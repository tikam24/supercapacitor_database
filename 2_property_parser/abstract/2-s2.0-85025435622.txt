Differences of energy storage system control strategy between islanding operation state and islanding operation state were analyzed, and a new battery-super capacitor hybrid energy storage system control strategy was proposed for the islanding operation state.For traditional control strategy, it cannot stabilize bus voltage when the ultra capacitor reach the threshold and cannot function properly, moreover, its response speed is slow and is difficultly implemented due to its over many logic and digital filters.Thus, a double voltage closed-loop control strategy combined with the use of LC filter in bi-directional DC/DC converter was employed, which spared the digital filters.When the remaining battery of super capacitor reached the threshold, it can stabilize bus voltage without changing control mode, which developed the reliability of micro-grid.Finally, the correctness and feasibility of proposed control strategy was verified by frequency analysis, simulation analysis and experimental studies.
