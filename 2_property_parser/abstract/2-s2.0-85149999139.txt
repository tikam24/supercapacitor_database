Designing porous carbon materials with tailored architecture and appropriate compositions is essential for supercapacitor (SC) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, Nb/Co-modified dual-source porous carbon (Nb/Co-DSPC) with a honeycomb structure was obtained by introducing a secondary carbon source (Co/Zn-ZIF) and transition metal Nb into activated Typha carbon (ATC). The addition of a secondary carbon source and Nb resulted in superior specific surface area (1272.38 m2/g), excellent hydrophilicity (34.73°) and abundant bimetallic active sites (Nb/Co-Nx) in Nb/Co-DSPC, providing excellent charge storage capacity and electrocatalytic activity. The Nb/Co-DSPC electrode displayed an outstanding capacitance of 337 F/g at 0.5 A/g and showed excellent stability after 15,000 charge–discharge cycles. In addition, Nb/Co-DSPC shows an overpotential of 114 mV at 10 mA cm−2, better than those of Co-DSPC (139 mV) and ATC (162 mV) alone. This study offers a reliable strategy for advanced multifunctional porous carbon electrode materials preparations.
