Supercapacitors that are light weight and flexible, while occupying a low volume and demonstrating good mechanical properties are in demand for portable energy storage devices. Graphene composite fibers are supposed to be ideal electrodes for flexible fiber-shaped supercapacitors. Integration of MOFs-derived porous carbon into graphene fibers provides desirable electrochemical and mechanical properties. Herein, a general strategy is shown for the preparation of MOFs-derived porous carbon/reduced graphene oxide fibers. Close-packed and aligned graphene sheets along with porous MOFs-derived porous carbon can achieve outstanding mechanical properties through synergistic effects. Consequently, a large specific capacitance of 56.05 F cm-3, a good tensile property of 86.5 MPa and a high retention of 96.6% after 10 000 cycles can be achieved with the composite fibers. Moreover, a further deposition of polyaniline (PANI) and manganese dioxide (MnO2) by in situ growth on the fabricated composite fibers provide an improvement in specific capacitance with value of 74.21 F cm-3 and 65.08 F cm-3, respectively. The above results demonstrate the promising application of composite fibers as a flexible and stable electrode and substrate for energy storage devices.
