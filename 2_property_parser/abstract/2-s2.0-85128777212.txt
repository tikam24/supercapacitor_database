The current-voltage characteristic of a photovoltaic module shows a nonlinear relationship, and the photovoltaic module has one optimal operation point. However, photovoltaic modules are affected by clouds and dust, resulting in reduced output power generation and reduced quality and stability of the power supply due to the interrupted operation of the converter. To solve this problem, we propose the application of a supercapacitor that stores and releases electric energy to compensate for the energy shortage of the photovoltaic power generation system in shade. To test the photovoltaic module with the supercapacitor, we designed an experimental platform with a self-designed pyrheliometer to measure the luminous intensity. The experimental platform controlled the photovoltaic module by using the supercapacitor to compensate for the decreased power due to clouds and dust. The result indicated that the use of the supercapacitor enabled a constant power supply at the same workload. The comparison of the power supply with and without the supercapacitor under full (100%) and partial shade (20%) showed that the voltage of the photovoltaic module was effectively compensated to prevent system shutdown caused by an instantaneous voltage drop.
