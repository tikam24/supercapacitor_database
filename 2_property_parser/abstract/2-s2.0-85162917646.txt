Photo-supercapacitor is an alternative energy source made from a combination of supercapacitor and DSSC (Dye-Sensitized Solar Cell). The supercapacitor was made from BaTiO3, while the DSSC was made of TiO2 and ZnO nanoflower as the photoanode. In this study, the spray deposition method was used by varying the spray distance to determine its effect on the performance of photo supercapacitors. Based on the results of the XRD analysis, the longer the spray time, the smaller crystal size (nanoflower) was formed. The morphological characterization of the ZnO nanoflower was analyzed using SEM, which showed that the longer the spray distance, the more and clearer nanoflower was formed. The effect of ZnO nanoflower spray distance on photo-supercapacitor performance was investigated by UV-vis characterization. The results showed that the highest energy conversion efficiency was at the 15 cm spray distance. Based on the characterization results, the longer the ZnO nanoflower spray distance, the higher the efficiency of the supercapacitor in producing energy.
