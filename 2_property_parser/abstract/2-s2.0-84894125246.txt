Binary metal oxides with three-dimensional (3D) superstructure have been regarded as desirable electrode materials for the supercapacitor due to the combination of the improved electrical conductivity and effective porous structure. 3D hierarchical flower-shaped nickel cobaltite (NiCo 2O4) microspheres have been fabricated by a rapid and template-free microwave-assisted heating (MAH) reflux approach followed by pyrolysis of the as-prepared precursors. The flower-shaped NiCo 2O4 microspheres, composed of ultrathin nanopetals with thickness of about 15 nm, are endowed with large specific surface area (148.5 m2 g-1) and a narrow pore size distribution (5-10 nm). The as-fabricated porous flower-shaped NiCo2O4 microspheres as electrode materials for supercapacitor exhibited high specific capacitance of 1006 F g-1 at 1 A g-1, enhanced rate capability, and excellent electrochemical stability with 93.2% retention after 1000 continuous charge-discharge (CD) cycles even at a high current density of 8 A g -1. The desirable integrated performance enables it to be a promising electrode material for the electrochemical supercapacitor (EC). Â© 2014 American Chemical Society.
