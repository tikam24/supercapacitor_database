Carbon and graphite are key components in electrochemical power sources, such as primary (non-rechargeable) and secondary (rechargeable) batteries, supercapacitors, redox flow batteries, and fuel cells. Carbon materials are particularly interesting because of their conductivity, chemical stability, electrochemical stability, and availability in a wide range of different structures, textures, and morphologies. Carbons and graphite can be powders, fibers, felts, foams, foils, or composites ranging from nanometer to meter, and they can be very dense and compact or highly porous. Carbon and graphite materials are employed as active material, i.e. as components that actively store energy, or inactive material, such as conductive additive, current collector, conductive or protective coating, catalyst substrate, etc. This chapter introduces the most important power sources, explains their basic operation principles, and discusses the general requirements for materials used in these power sources. It presents typical carbon and graphite materials that can be used and provides information on their synthesis, properties, and key performance indicators.
