The composite hybrid with hollow microspheres structure composed of molybdenum disulfide/N-doped carbon/Manganese dioxide (MoS2/NC/MnO2) was synthesized via a facile template-assisted method, which shown excellent electrochemical performances for supercapacitors applications. The hollow MoS2 microspheres are assembled by layered MoS2 nanosheets, which provide substantial ion channels and large surface area for electrolyte ion transport. Polyaniline as the precursor of carbon materials is grown on the surface of the hollow MoS2 microspheres by oxidative polymerization. After carbonization, the composite material is obtained by hydrothermal method. The MoS2/NC/MnO2 hollow microspheres electrode possesses high specific capacitance of 882 F·g−1 at a scan rate of 0.5 A·g−1 and a capacitance retention rate of 85.4% at 1 A·g−1 after 2500 cycles charge–discharge, which keeps better cycle stability compared to MnO2 composite. The as-prepared MoS2/NC/MnO2 microspheres material has the potential to be a strong competitor in high performance supercapacitor electrode materials and has significant potential for supercapacitor applications.
