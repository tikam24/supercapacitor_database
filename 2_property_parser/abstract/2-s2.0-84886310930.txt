Graphene with different reduction degrees was prepared by fast thermally reduction of exfoliated graphite oxide (GO) at 200-700 °C. Structure and the electrochemical capacitive performance were characterized and measured. The results show that different thermal reduction temperatures can obtain reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with different reduction degrees and influence the electrochemical capacitive performance. The rGO-400 by thermal treat at 400 °C exhibits a significantly high specific capacitance of 407 F g-1 in 6.0 M KOH electrolyte at a current density of 0.4 A g-1 and outstanding cyclic stability with 96.1% of its origin specific capacitance maintained after 2000 cycles at the current density of 10 A g-1 in GCD test. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
