In this work, large scale WO3 nanorods are prepared successfully by a facile one-step hydrothermal method. The as-synthesized samples are used as the photocatalysts for photocatalytic degradation of several organic dye molecules. The results show WO3 nanorods possess superior photocatalytic performance. In addition, electrochemical experiments of the samples as the working electrode present specific capacitance of 319.26 F g−1 at current density of 0.7 A g−1. After 6000 cycles, 83.2% of its initial capacitance is still retained. The as-fabricated symmetric supercapacitor light up ten blue light emitting diode (LED) indicators for more than 8 min in the voltage range of 0–1.4 V. The as-synthesized WO3 nanorods could be used in wastewater purification and electrochemical energy storage devices.
