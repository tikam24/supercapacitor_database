The proceedings contain 7 papers. The topics discussed include: comparative study of using chlorine and hydrogen chloride for synthesis of titanium carbide derived carbon; diameter dependent doping of single-walled carbon nanotube used as electrical double layer capacitor electrode; nitrogen doped graphene as a high efficient electrode for next generation supercapacitors; dramatic improvements in electric double-layer capacitors by using polysaccharides; three dimentional graphene-CNTs foam architectures for electrochemical capacitors; temperature effects in activated carbon supercapacitors; gel-based activated carbon electrode for supercapacitors; cathodic synthesis of birnessite films for pseudocapacitor application; and polyaniline-MnO2 nanocomposite supercapacitor electrodes prepared by galvanic pulse polymerization.
