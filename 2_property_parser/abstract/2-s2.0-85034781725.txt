Ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of buckybowl corannulene-based oxa-norbornadiene monomer is shown to give rise to polymeric nanomaterials with an average pore size of about 1.4 nm and a surface area of 49.2 m2/g. Application in supercapacitor devices show that the corannulene-based nanomaterials exhibit a specific capacitance of 134 FÂ·g-1 (1.0 V voltage window) in a three-electrode cell configuration. Moreover, the electrode assembled from these materials in a symmetric configuration (1.6 V voltage window) exhibits long-term cyclability of 90% capacitance retention after undergoing 10000 cycles. This work demonstrates that ROMP is a valuable method in synthesizing nanostructured corannulene polymers, and that materials based on the nonplanar polycyclic aromatic motif represents an attractive active component for fabrication of devices targeted at electrochemical energy storage applications.
