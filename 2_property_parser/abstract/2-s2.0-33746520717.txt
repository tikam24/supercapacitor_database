A hybrid supercapacitor based on poly(3-methyl thiophene), activated carbon, and a gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) was fabricated and characterized. GPE was synthesized from poly(ethylene oxide)-tetra ethyl ammonium tetra fluoro borate (Et4NBF4)-propylene carbonate-ethylene carbonate-nanoclay. The supercapacitor was characterized by cyclic voltammetry, charging/discharging cycle, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Capacitance of 18.54 F/g was obtained from discharging curve of supercapacitor. The energy density and the power density of the supercapacitor were 10.2 Wh/kg and 96.2 W/kg, respectively, at a discharge current density of 16 A/m 2. The cycling studies showed a considerable decrease in capacitance during initial cycles followed by a slower decrease during later cycles. Â© 2006 The Electrochemical Society.
