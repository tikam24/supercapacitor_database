Activated carbon was fabricated by using phenolic resin as carbon source, PEG as organic template, KOH as activator. The samples were analyzed by N 2 adsorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge were used to characterize the electrochemical performance of the samples. The results showed that the specific surface area of the prepared sample (AC1) was 2469 m2/g, the pore size was mainly in the range of 1.0∼4.0 nm. At a current density of 7.5 mA/cm2, a specific capacitance of 327F/g was achieved, the equivalent series resistance (ESR) was 0.8Ω. Supercapacitors based on the sample have low ESR and excellent power property. For comparison, commercial AC (AC2) was also studied. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.
