The α-Fe2O3 films were deposited on mesh of stainless steel (SS) by liquid phase deposition (LPD) and symmetric flexible solid state supercapacitor device was fabricated. The performance of device was tested on two electrodes system. The cyclic voltammetry, charging-discharging and electrochemical impedance techniques were used for performance evaluation of fabricated device. The maximum specific capacitance was 1.6 Fg-1 at 5 mVs-1 from cyclic voltammetry and the maximum specific capacitance was 0.56 F g-1 at 0.2 mA from galvanostatic charging-discharging. Relaxation time constant and phase angle was determined from the Bode plot. The actual demonstration of the fabricated α-Fe2O3 symmetric device is also presented.
