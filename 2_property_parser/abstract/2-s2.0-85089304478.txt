In the class typical layered metal chalcogenide family, tin selenide (SnSe) has been explored resolutely as one of the significant binary IV-VI compounds for a wide range of energy storage applications. Two dimensional hexagonal tin selenide nanosheets have been synthesized using a one-pot colloidal method and tested as active electrode for supercapacitors without using any binder. The as-prepared SnSe electrode exhibits a capacitance of 617.9 F/g at a scan rate of 2 mV/s with a good electrochemical stability due to efficient ion transport between electrolyte to active electrode and charge transport between electrode and current collector. The high energy density of 28.5 Wh/kg along with high cyclic stability is due to the morphology assisted electrochemical activity of the electrode. The results indicate that the assembly of binder-free electrode by the proposed facile synthesis route has a promising application in producing high-performance energy storage devices.
