Chemical vapor deposition is used to prepare novel 3D graphene networks, with ethanol as the carbon source. These networks are used as templates for the construction of graphene/metal oxide composite-based supercapacitor electrodes. As a proof of concept, NiO is deposited on 3D graphene networks. The product exhibits a high specific capacitance of about 816 F g -1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s -1 and good cycling performance. Â© 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
