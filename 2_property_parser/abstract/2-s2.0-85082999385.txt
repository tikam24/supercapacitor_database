Stable metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with the required functions have unique advantages in practical applications. Herein, we studied the electrochemical property of a stable zirconium-based MOF, Zr6(μ3-O)4(μ3-OH)4(OH)6(H2O)6(HCHC) (PCN-136), which contains a hexacarboxylate linker with a π-conjugated nanographene moiety (HCHC ​= ​hexakis(4-carboxyphenyl)hexabenzocoronene). In light of the high chemical stability and π-conjugated nanographene moiety, PCN-136 exhibits a specific capacitance of 694 ​F ​g−1 at the current density of 0.5 ​A ​g−1 in a 6 ​M KOH aqueous solution. PCN-136 holds great potential as a high-performance capacitive material for electrochemical energy storage.
