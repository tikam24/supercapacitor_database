Sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) /polysulfone porous composite films are prepared by phase inversion process and electrospinning method, respectively. Morphology of them is observed by a scanning electron microscope. Compared to the porous films fabricated by phase inversion process, the nanofiber mats prepared by the electrospinning method exhibit high regularity, suitable hydrophobicity and certain flexibility. After doped by polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/sulfate gel, they are used to assembly electric double layer capacitors (EDLC). The EDLC with nanofiber mats and PVA/sulfate gel displays better initial specific capacitance, which is up to 117.1 F g-1. Furthermore, its specific capacitance can be retained above 97% after 1500 cycles.
