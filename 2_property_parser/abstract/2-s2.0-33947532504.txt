Nano-scaled SnO2-V2O5 mixed oxide is synthesized by a hydrothermal method in an autoclave. For comparative evaluation, V2O5 single oxide is prepared by a conventional process from ammonium vanadate. The capacitive behaviour of the following electrodes is studied by cyclic voltammetry in 0.1 M KCl solutions: carbon nano-tubes (CNT), V2O5, V2O5-CNT, and SnO2-V2O5-CNT. At a scan rate of 100 mV s-1, the SnO2-V2O5-CNT electrode provides the best performance, viz., 121.4 F g-1. The nano-scaled mixed oxide is characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectra. Â© 2006 Elsevier B.V.
