For increasing the power efficiency of electrical transport the on-board energy storage system can be used. In this article the applications of supercapacitor energy storage for regenerative energy saving in the vehicle braking mode and peak power shaping in the vehicle acceleration mode are described. The supercapacitor energy storage system practical operation is investigated on versatile DC motor test bench, which could be used for researching in various kinds of electric vehicle traction drives.
