In this paper a complete robust control synthesis is performed for a hybrid power generation structure composed by a Fuel Cell and a Supercapacitor. The control strategies are applied to the DC-DC boost power converters associated to each power source. Multivariable PI control with H∞ performance, H∞ full and reduced order controllers are designed and compared. The multivariable PI controller is designed through an optimization procedure based on solving some Linear Matrix Inequalities. A μ-analysis and frequency/time response performances results shows the advantages of the different proposed control strategies. © 2010 IFAC.
