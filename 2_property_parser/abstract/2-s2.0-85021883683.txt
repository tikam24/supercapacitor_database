A new ternary composite of manganese dioxide (MnO2), polyaniline (PANI) and graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) has been fabricated through a two-step polymerization process. With manganese dioxide nanorods and graphene nanoribbons embedded in the PANI matrix, the MnO2/GNRs/PANI ternary composites with 3-dimensional porous structures exhibited higher specific capacitance and better charge-discharge cycling performance than that of MnO2 and MnO2/GNRs binary composites in supercapacitors. The specific capacitance of the MnO2/PANI/GNRs ternary composite can be achieved at 472 F g-1. After 5000 cycles, the specific capacitance with 79.7% of the initial capacitance can be preserved. The enhanced specific capacitance and cycle life implies the structural stability of MnO2/GNRs/PANI ternary composites and the synergistic effect between MnO2, GNRs and PANI.
