The effect of annealing temperature on the structural, morphological and electrochemical properties of the Co3O4 has been studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Cyclic Voltammetric (CV) studies. X- ray diffraction analysis confirms the formation of face centered cubic Co3O4 for the samples annealed at 300oC and 400oC. FTIR analysis shows the vibrations around 564 cm-1 and 663 cm-1 which correspond to Cobalt-Oxygen stretching vibration of Co3O4 spinel oxide. SEM images reveals 3D flower like Co3O4 for both the temperatures. CV analysis reveals maximum specific capacitance for Co3O4 annealed at 300oC.
