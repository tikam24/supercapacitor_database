Nafion is suggested as an efficient assistant in preparing supercapacitor by employing nanoparticles. In this work, Nafion-assisted electrophoretic deposition of zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) derivative N-doped porous carbon (ZIF-8-CN) coating is successfully realized in ethanol solvent, using a bi-additive of 0.08 mM NaOH + 0.10 g·L-1 Nafion. Comparing with ZIF-8-CN coating prepared with electrophoretic deposition (EPD) by employing other additive (such as polyethyleneimine, PEI), a better capacitance performance (233.6F·g−1 at the current density of 1.0 A g−1) is demonstrated on the ZIF-8-CN coating prepared by Nafion-assisted EPD. And an excellent capacitance retention of 85.3% is also exhibited through the cyclic stability test over 5000 cycles at a constant current density of 10.0 A g−1. This work indicates Nafion-assisted EPD may be a feasible option for preparing various coating electrodes with superior capacitance.
