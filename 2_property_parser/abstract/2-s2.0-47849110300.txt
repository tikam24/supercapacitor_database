Aim of the paper is to investigate an alternative solution to the traditional half-bridge step-up/step-down bidirectional DC/DC converter topology, used as interface between Supercapacitors (SCs) and a DC link for load levelling applications. Thus, taking the lead from comparative studies in other fields, a new configuration is proposed, which allows better regulation capabilities when there is a significant difference in the voltage levels between the SC side and the DC link side. This bidirectional DC/DC converter topology is called "Half Bridge - Current Source" (HBCS) converter. In the paper, a 3 kW prototype for stationary power supply is presented. Firstly, a brief explanation of the working modes of the HBCS converter is given. Then, design aspects for the converter prototype are discussed and verified through simulations coming from an accurate modelling. Finally, details of the prototype converter layout and experimental test are presented.
