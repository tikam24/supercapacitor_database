MoO3/multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composites were prepared by Magnetron sputtering in Ar/O2 atmosphere. This will provide a greener alternative for the fabrication of binder free composite electrode for supercapacitor applications. MWCNT provides good support for the growth of MoO3 thin films. This integrated composite electrode exhibited specific capacitance of 93 F g-1 and a corresponding energy density of 7.28 Wh kg-1 in non-aqueous electrolyte, which is almost fourfold increase compared to the bare MWCNT. Also the electrode maintains high power density of 4930 W kg-1 at high current rates, suggesting a potential energy storage material for portable and consumer electronics. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
