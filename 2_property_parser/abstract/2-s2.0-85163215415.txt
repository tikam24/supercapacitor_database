The authors regret to inform that the FTIR spectrum in Fig. 1(a) (I) does not accurately represent the graphene oxide (GO) used in this research. This discrepancy occurred because of an error in archiving the obtained data. Hence, this report presents the corrections applied to the FTIR and its respective explanations. The authors would like to apologize for any inconvenience caused. Corrected Text: 3.1. Characterization of developed nanomaterials In this section, the developed nanomaterials were well characterized using a range of different techniques. In Fig. 1(a), the FTIR spectrum of GO, rGO, and G-Ni-W can be seen. As demonstrated in part (I), GO is successfully synthesized with typical functional groups, including C-O alkoxy (1050 cm−1), CC double bond carbon atoms (1630 cm−1), viz., known as the fingerprint of the unoxidized heterocyclic structure of GO, CO carbonyl functional group (1710 cm−1), and hydrophilic hydroxyl functional groups, i.e., –OH (3410 cm−1) [53,54,57].
