Hybrid Sn–Co binary oxide with different Sn/Co feeding molar ratios on carbon paper are successfully obtained using a facile hydrothermal method followed by a post-annealing procedure. The results of electrochemical tests show that the electrode with a feeding molar ratio of 1:4 (named as Sn1Co4) has better electrochemical performance than that of the others. The specific capacitance can achieve 937.4 F g−1at 5 mV s−1 (580.8 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), as well as the capacitance retention is 97.5% after the galvanostatic charge-discharge for 20000 cycles at 30 A g−1. These results demonstrate that the Sn1Co4 can be considered as a potential electrode material for the next generation supercapacitor.
