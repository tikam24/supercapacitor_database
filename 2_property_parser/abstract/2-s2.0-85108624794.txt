Batteries are the primary energy storage for electric vehicles. Often the power of the battery cannot be adequate to satisfy the demands of heavy loads. Simultaneously with the battery source, secondary capacity, such as a super-capacitor, can be used to fulfil the power demand where ultra-capacitors meet the high-frequency specifications. Ultracapacitor can be used to inhibit the recycling of the high-current transient battery. In the course of the battery recycling impacts battery life, charging device with high current. This paper is focused on a PI control system for electric vehicle management and the selected MATLAB / Simulink simulation framework. The result from the energy management system that is using shows that with PI controller, the voltage and current more stable compared to the design without using PI controller.
