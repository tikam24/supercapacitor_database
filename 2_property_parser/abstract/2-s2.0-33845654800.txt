Poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/polypyrrole composite electrodes were prepared by electropolymerization of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) on the surface of polypyrrole (PPy) modified tantalum electrodes. The morphology observation of PPy and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/polypyrrole composite (PEDOT/PPy) was performed on Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The electrochemical capacitance properties of the composite were investigated with cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques in the two- or three-electrode cell system. The results show that the PEDOT/h-PPy (PPy with horn-like structure) composite films were characterized with highly porous structure, which leads to their specific capacitance as 230 Fg-1 in 1 M LiClO4 aqueous solutions and even 290 Fg-1 in 1 M KCl aqueous solutions. Moreover, the composite exhibits a rectangle-like shape of voltammetry characteristics even at scanning rate 100 mV s-1, a linear variation of the voltage with respect to time without a clear ohm-drop phenomenon in galvanostatic charge-discharge process and almost ideal capacitance behavior in low-frequency in 1 M KCl solutions. Furthermore, specific power of the composite would reach 13 kW kg-1 and it had good cycle stability. All of the above imply that the PEDOT/h-PPy composites were an ideal electrode material of supercapacitor. Â© 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
