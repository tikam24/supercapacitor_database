Flexible fiber-shaped supercapacitors are promising energy-storage devices in wearable smart electronics. Exploring the knittable fiber-type electrode with high capacitance would promote the wide-scale application of such capacitors. Herein, a solution-processed methodology to fabricate all-solid-state, flexible, and fiber-based supercapacitors employing Ti3C2Tx MXene is proposed. Commercially available silver-plated nylon fibers are chosen as fibrous structural support for the first time. Through mildly baking the surfactant-free Ti3C2Tx flakes suspension loaded on the silver-plated nylon fibers, a uniform and adhesive film consisting of Ti3C2Tx nanometer-thick flakes is well established in a parallel manner on the highly conductive fibrous support. It is emphasized that the chemically cross-linked polyvinyl alcohol–H2SO4 hydrogel is served as a solid-state electrolyte that guarantees the structural integrity and mechanical strength of the assembled capacitor. The fabricated capacitor exhibits a high areal capacitance of 328 mF cm−2 with excellent cyclability and flexibility, capacitance retention remaining at least above 80% under various deformation modes including bending, twisting, and knotting. The device based on the all-solid-state, fiber-type capacitors can drive a light-emitting diode. This work proposes a feasible strategy, offering a platform for rational designs of flexible electronics employing a large family of MXenes and their heterostructures as well.
