Graphene is considered as a promising electrode material for supercapacitors due to its large specific surface area, excellent electrical conductivity and so on. In this paper, few-layer graphene is prepared by self-propagating combustion reaction between CO and metal magnesium, using powder MgO as deposition template. Graphene with a high specific surface area of up to 928 m2 g−1 replicates the morphological feature of powder MgO. Raman spectroscopy analysis demonstrates that the graphene layer decreases when the dosage of MgO template is increased. The specific capacitance of as-prepared sample exhibits the highest specific capacitance of 222 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1 in EMI [TFSI] electrolyte. The sample demonstrates a “double high” performance with high specific energy density and high specific power density. A high energy density of 76.3 Wh kg−1 can be achieved at a specific power density of 1.75 kW kg−1, and it can still remain 48.6 Wh kg−1 when the specific power density reaches a high level of 35 kW kg−1.
