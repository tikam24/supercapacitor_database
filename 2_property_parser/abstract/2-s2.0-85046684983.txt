Porous carbons derived from tea seed shells were fabricated through hydrothermal activation and high-temperature activation. The microstructure was investigated via X-ray diffraction, Raman spectrometer, scanning and electron microscopy techniques. The activated carbons show high specific surface areas and developed porosity, and reveal excellent electrochemical performance, especially for the TSSCB samples. When the carbon material TSSCB was applied for lithium-ion batteries, it delivered superior specific charge capacity of 598 mAh g−1 at 0∙1C, and showed an impressive rate capability of 440 mAh g−1 at 1C, and maintained high capacity retention of 82∙9% even after 500 cycles. Moreover, when the carbon material TSSCB was utilized in supercapacitor, it also exhibited high specific capacitance of 305∙7 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1 and the capacitance retention ratio of 98∙6% after 10,000 cycles, indicating remarkable cycling stability. Porous carbons derived from tea seed shells are a potential energy storage material.
