In this work, tin disulfide/nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide/polyaniline ternary composites are synthesized via in situ polymerization of aniline monomers on the surface of tin disulfide/nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide nanosheets binary composites with different loading of the conducting polymers. The tin disulfide/nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide/polyaniline ternary composites electrode shows much higher specific capacitance, specific energy and specific power values than those of pure polyaniline and tin disulfide/nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide binary composites. The highest specific capacitance, specific energy and specific power values of 1021.67 F g−1, 69.53 W h kg−1 and 575.46 W kg−1 are observed for 60% polyaniline deposited onto tin disulfide/nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide composites at a current density of 1 A g−1. The above composites also show superior cyclic stability and 78% of the specific capacitance can be maintained after 5000 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles. The good charge-storage properties of tin disulfide/nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide/polyaniline ternary composites is ascribed to the organic-inorganic synergistic effect. This study paves the way to consider tin disulfide/nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide/polyaniline ternary composites as excellent electrode materials for energy storage applications.
