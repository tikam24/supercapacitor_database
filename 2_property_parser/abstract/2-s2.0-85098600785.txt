Ni2P nanospheres were prepared by an ultrafast (120 s), easy, and energy-efficient one-step microwave method. By controlling the reaction conditions and feed ratio, Ni2P nanospheres with novel nanostructures and ultra-high electrochemical properties were prepared. These nanospheres demonstrated a high specific capacitance of 404.2 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and high cycling durability. They maintain 81% of their initial capacity after 2000 cycles at 6 A g−1. The optimum device based on Ni2P//AC showed an outstanding energy density of 27.2 Wh kg−1 and power density of 375 W kg−1. A method that is much faster and much more energy-efficient than other approaches was developed to produce transition metal phosphates without atmosphere protection.
