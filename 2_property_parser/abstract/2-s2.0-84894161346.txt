A low-cost high-performance solid-state flexible asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) with α-MnO2 nanowires and amorphous Fe2O 3 nanotubes grown on flexible carbon fabric is first designed and fabricated. The assembled novel flexible ASC device with an extended operating voltage window of 1.6 V exhibits excellent performance such as a high energy density of 0.55 mWh/cm3 and good rate capability. The ASC devices can find numerous applications as effective power sources, such as powering color-switchable sun glasses and smart windows. © 2014 American Chemical Society.
