In this paper, an observer-based type-2 fuzzy method is proposed for control and energy management strategy (EMS) of the hybrid energy storage system (HESS) which can be composed of the fuel cell (FC), battery (BA), and supercapacitor (SC). The objective and main contribution of the suggested strategy is to provide: 1) Appropriate tracking performance of power sources by an observer-based control method in the presence of noise and signal ripples. 2) An observer-based composite adaptive type-2 fuzzy (OCAT2F) to approximate the voltage of power sources. 3) A dynamical model of DC-bus to guarantee the stability of closed-loop system. 4) An intelligent EMS. To have a high-power supply, the proposed EMS includes two parts; a type-2 fuzzy logic control rule table (T2FLCRT), and an observer-based robust adaptive fuzzy type-2 fuzzy (ORAT2F). Furthermore, stability analyses of the closed-loop system are provided by the input-output linearization (I-OL) approach and based on the Lyapunov theorem. The simulation results of the proposed control scheme under MATLAB/Simulink indicate that the suggested strategy can provide a suitable control performance, and stability of the whole system is achieved.
