Efficient and stable supercapacitor electrodes must possess large surface area, excellent conductivity and electrochemical stability. In this regard, conductive carbon loaded metal oxide composites are of particular interest. Herein, Ru–Mn oxide loaded graphene was synthesized with different graphene oxide (GO) proportion using simple solution chemistry method. Morphological and compositional characterizations were carried out to confirm the well-integrated Ru–Mn oxide/graphene nanocomposites. Nanoporous structures were identified by N2 adsorption–desorption analysis at 77 K. Based on the nanoporous structure and related conductivity enhancement, capacitance of the samples boosted from 351 to 437 F g−1, which is more than twofold higher than the samples without graphene. Because of the larger accessible nanopores, rate retention of the samples was also improved from the 40 to 82% from 2 to 20 A g−1 current density. Excellent capacitance storage and rate retention performance illustrate that favorable nanoporous structured composites not only promote the capacitance but also retain the capacitance over prolonged period. The results verify that nanoporous structures of the nanocomposites occupy a major room for their energy storage performance in supercapacitor application.
