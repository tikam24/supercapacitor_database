In recent years, vanadium disulfide (VS2), as a transition metal sulfide with two-dimensional layered structure and high surface activity, has been widely used as a cathode material for zinc ion batteries (ZIBs). However, the disadvantages of growth stack and low energy density seriously hinder its application in energy storage equipment. Therefore, Co9S8@P-VS2 NTAs with core-shell structure is prepared by coating P-doped layered VS2 nanosheets on the surface of Co9S8 nanotube arrays (NTAs), which effectively avoids the bulk VS2 nanosheet stacking growth and make layered VS2 disperse uniformally on the surface of the nanotubes. In addition, appropriate doping of P element further improves the conductivity of the heterojunction between Co9S8 nanotubes and VS2 nanosheets. Therefore, benefiting from the synergistic effect of P-dopping and nano-core-shell structure, the prepared Co9S8@P-VS2 NTAs presents excellent electrochemical energy storage properties when a novel zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitor (ZHSCs) as a capacitive positive electrode and a battery-type zinc negative electrode is assembled. When the amount of phosphorus source in the precursor solution is 30 Î¼L/35 mL, the prepared Co9S8@P-VS2 NTAs (Co9S8@P-VS2-30 NTAs) obtains an ultra-high an area specific capacity of 6.72 F/cm2 (current density: 2 mA/cm2) in 2 mol/L ZnSO4 electrolyte, which is much higher than Co9S8@VS2 NTAs (2.98 F/cm2). At the power density of 1.6 W/cm2, its energy density can reach 2.39 mWh/cm2. Moreover, the ZHSCs maintains good cycle stability, the area specific capacity can still be maintained as 74.26% of the initial specific capacitance after 1000 cycles at 2 mA/cm2.
