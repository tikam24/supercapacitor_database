Hybrid energy storage system (HESS) usually adopts the traditional PI control, However, the linearity of PI control and the lack of inertia of the bidirectional DC-DC converter have led to the system stability problem. The joint control of the virtual DC machine (VDCM) control with a low-pass filter and the model predictive control (MPC) is proposed. VDCM control improves the voltage stability of the DC-bus by simulating the inertia and damping characteristics of the synchronous DC machine. The low-pass filter (LPF) is to allocate the power between the battery and supercapacitor Energy Storage (ES) units. Furthermore, the MPC is used to accelerate the response speed by predicting the response based on the VDCM control. In this paper, the VDCM small-signal model with a low-pass filter is established firstly, the influence of inertia, damping coefficients and filter time constant on the dynamic step response are analyzed too. Then the MPC is applied in the inner current loop of the control. The DC-bus voltage Feedback Correction (FC) is introduced further in the MPC control to realize the optimization control. Compared with the traditional PI double closed-loop control and traditional MPC, simulation results show that the proposed control strategy enables the HESS to restrain the fluctuation of the DC bus when load changes, and has fast response speed.
