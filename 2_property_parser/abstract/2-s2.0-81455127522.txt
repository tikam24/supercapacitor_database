Metallically conductive PAC 1003, an inherently conductive polymer product of Crosslink, has been developed to have remarkably high electrical conductivity (>1000 S/cm) which can be applied to advanced polymer supercapacitor design. The metallic conductivity of the polymer allows for supercapacitors with low equivalent resistance and high capacitance via efficient redox electrochemical activity. The use of n-dopable polymers can enhance the function of the supercapacitor to achieve higher energy and power densities. In parallel efforts, device structures with strategic technical features including nano-structured interfacial layers, leakage free device design and bipolar device designs have proven to give promising device performance.
