The synthesis of carbon electrode from durian shell based on variations in the activation time has been carried out. Synthesis of carbon electrode was started by a carbonization process at a temperature of 600°C in nitrogen gas and then followed by physical activation process using water vapor at a temperature of 900°C by varying time of 1, 2 and 3 h. All of the variations of the samples were chemically activated using an activator of ZnCl2 with a concentration of 0.4 M. The physical properties such as density, surface morphology, degree of crystallinity and elemental content were analyzed. Moreover, the electrochemical properties such as specific capacitance of supercapacitor cells were studied using Cyclic Voltammetry methods. The density, stack height and carbon content were increased as activation time increases, while the specific capacitance of the supercapacitor cell decreases against the increase of activation time. Specific capacitances for 1, 2 and 3 h activation time are 88.39 F/g, 80.08 F/g and 74.61 F/g, respectively. Based on the surface morphology study it was shown that the increased in activation time causes narrowing of the pores between particles.
