Although titanium nitride (TiN) is promising as electrode material in supercapacitors due to the high conductivity, there are drawbacks such as the brittleness, low capacitance, and chemical stability. Herein, three-dimensional (3D) carbon-encapsulated mesoporous titanium nitride nanotubes (TiN/C NTs) arrays with carbon doping are prepared by one-step nitridation of anodic TiO2 NTs with organic electrolyte as the carbon source. In TiN/C NTs, 3D carbon matrix not only serves as a protective layer and mechanical support to mitigate electrochemical oxidation and structural collapse, but also provides a conductive network to facilitate electron transfer. The capacitance retention of the TiN NTs electrodes increases from 72.5 to 92.2% for 4000 cycles after carbon encapsulating. Moreover, the carbon doping increases the active charge storage sites of the TiN NTs. The TiN/C NTs electrode exhibits a large volumetric capacitance of 121 F cm−3 (0.83 A cm−3), which is one time larger than that of the pure TiN NTs (69 F cm−3). The symmetrical all-solid-state device assembled with two TiN/C NTs electrodes and polyvinyl alcohol electrolyte shows a large volumetric capacitance of 8.3 F cm−3. This finding provides a good potential application in flexible supercapacitor.
