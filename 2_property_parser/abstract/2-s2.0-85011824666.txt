One-pot fabrication of flake Cu1.81S/C composite with size of 300 nm was successfully demonstrated in this work. As the supercapacitor electrode material, the obtained Cu1.81S/C composite sample displayed good cycling stability of 83.6% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles and high specific capacitance of 617 F g-1 at current density of 0.5 A g-1. The excellent electrochemical performance is mainly attributed to flake nanostructure, which provides large electrode-electrolyte contact area and facilitates an easy access of electrolyte ions to the electrode surface. This result provides a new pathway for the fabrication of high-performance electrode material for supercapacitors.
