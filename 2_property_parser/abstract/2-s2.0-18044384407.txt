The objective of the present paper is to demonstrate the possibility to synthesize manganese oxide xerogels as alternative economic materials for supercapacitors. Manganese oxide xerogels were made using sol-gel method. XRD results show that the manganese oxide xerogels have a crystalline Mn 3O4 structure. TEM images reveal that the particle size of the manganese oxide xerogels is between 30-50nm. Results of N2(77K) adsorption isotherm show that the Pore size distribution of manganese oxide xerogels is in the regime 1-20nm with a BET specific surface of 70.8m 2/g. The capacitive performance was measured using cyclic voltammetry in 7M KOH. Capacitance of manganese oxide xerogels is about 190F/g in potential window 0.05V-0.65V vs. Hg/HgO. High performance obtained indicates that manganese oxide xerogels are promising electrode materials for supercapacitors.
