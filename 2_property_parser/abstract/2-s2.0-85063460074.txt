During recent years, many important distributed control approaches have been proposed to realize the stabilization of networked system including static feedback, which has been proven to be an efficient control strategy. Based on its traditional design method, for first- and second-order networked dynamical systems, we propose another kind of nonlinear consensus controllers where the input of each agent can be written as a product of a nonlinear gain and a sum of nonlinear interaction functions so that all states will reach consensus at a value preset. By using integral Lyapunov functions, we can prove the stability of proposed control protocols. We also choose supercapacitors as simulation models to realize voltage equalization under our distributed control protocols.
