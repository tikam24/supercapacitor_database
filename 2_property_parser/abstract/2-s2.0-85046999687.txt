This work presents the first demonstration of atomic layer deposited (ALD) black titania (TiOx), to the best of our knowledge. By fabricating b-TiOx using ALD we have accomplished four distinct achievements: (1) development of a direct deposition method of b-TiOx, without need for deoxygenation annealing, as required by current fabrication processes; (2) the ability to deposit b-TiOx onto highly porous materials with Ã…ngstrom-level precision; (3) increased response to the solar spectrum over TiO2, as demonstrated by >10x improvement in detectable photocurrent when compared to TiO2; (4) >7x improvement in capacitance when comparing a b-TiOx supercapacitor to a TiO2 supercapacitor. As such, this work allows for more robust and precise black titania deposition, opening up new possibilities of devices based on b-TiOx.
