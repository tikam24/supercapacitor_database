Spinel LiMn2O4 was synthesized by high temperature solid-state reaction. XRD analysis illustrates that the spinel LiMn2O4 powder can be gained at reaction temperature of 700°C. The effects of reaction temperature and retention time on capacitive performance of the LiMn2O4 samples were investigated by charge-discharge curves, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectra(EIS) in 2 mol·L-1(NH4)2SO4 solution. The results show that LiMn2O4 electrodes exhibit good capacitive performance. When the reaction temperature at 700°C and the retention time is in the range of 4-24h, the charge-discharge and cyclic voltammetric curves show that no significant change of discharge specific capacitances is observed. The discharge specific capacitance of the sample is 127F·g at 10 A·cm-2. The EIS testing also shows that LiMn2O4 electrodes present excellent electrochemistry capacitance behaviors in 2 mol ·L-1 (NH4)2SO4 solution. The solution resistance of the sample synthesized at 700°C is only 0.50.
