In this paper, poly vinyl chloride (PVC) based nano-hybrid composites of multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) and barium titanate (BT) are prepared by solution casting technique and their morphology and dielectric characteristics are studied. The presence of barium titanate in hybrid composites is confirmed by X-ray Diffraction. Dielectric and morphological studies of PVC-MWCNT composites and PVC-MWCNT-BT hybrid composites also studied to verify the improvement in dielectric properties of PVC-MWCNT-BT hybrid composite compared to PVC-MWCNT composite. The hybrid composites show improved dielectric properties when BT is incorporated as dielectric filler with multi-walled carbon nanotube in PVC. PVC-MWCNT 1 %-BT 3 % hybrid composite showed the highest dielectric constant and the lowest tan Î´ value among the composites. This hybrid composite is useful for electromagnetic shielding and supercapacitor applications.
