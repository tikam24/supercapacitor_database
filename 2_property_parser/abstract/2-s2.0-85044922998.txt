In this work, we investigate the application of Ni-Al LDH-rGO composite directly synthesized on nickel foam by a low cost and facile CV electrodeposition method as a new electrode for all-solid-state flexible supercapacitors. Due to the synergistic effects between the Ni-Al LDH and the graphene sheets, directly grown on the surface of Ni foam, the as prepared electrodes exhibit an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 2693.25 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1. When these electrodes are used in asymmetric (Ni-Al LDH-rGO//Fe2O3-rGO) and symmetric (Ni-Al LDH-rGO//Ni-Al LDH-rGO) all-solid-stat supercapacitors, the as-prepared devices show excellent flexibility with a maximum specific capacitance and energy density of 214.4 F g−1 and 76.23 Wh Kg−1 for asymmetric device, and 412.30 F g−1 and 36.65 Wh Kg−1 for symmetric device.
