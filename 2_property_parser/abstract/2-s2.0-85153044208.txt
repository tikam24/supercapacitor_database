Redox active small organic molecules (OM) are the promising materials for energy storage applications. The practical utilization of such materials in combination with excellent redox-active material is advantageous to enhance the specific capacitance (Csp). Herein, naphthalene diimide (NDI) and perylenediimide (PDI) molecules linked with pyrazine (Pyr) are exploited as faradiac reversible redox-active material on graphite foil (GF) surface to act as electrode materials in supercapacitor (SC) device. The as-fabricated NDI-Pyr/GF and PDI-Pyr/GF electrodes were optimized in three-electrode SC device in view of their electrochemical performance. The NDI-Pyr/GF and PDI-Pyr/GF in SC device demonstrated a Csp of about 260 and 302 F g−1, respectively at 0.5 A g−1 current density. However, in two-electrode symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) device i.e. PDI-Pyr/GF//PDI-Pyr/GF exhibited excellent Csp of about 192 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 current density with longer cycling stability with 88.13% after 4000 galvanostatic (GCD) charge/discharge cycles. Furthermore, an excellent energy density of 54 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 2700 W kg−1 is provided by the SSC device. These results suggest that the as-prepared PDI-Pyr/GF//PDI-Pyr/GF have practical energy storage application in OSC devices.
