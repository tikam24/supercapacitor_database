Over recent decades, the conversion of energy and its storage have been in the lime light due to the depletion of fossil resources. The electrochemical energy storage devices like supercapacitors and batteries, and their materials and fabrication methods have been extensively evaluated, which is the best solution for the energy crisis. Herein, zinc cobaltite (ZnCo2O4; ZCO) nanostructures grown on nickel (Ni) foam by microwave-assisted solvothermal fabrication for hybrid supercapacitors are reported. Two different structures/samples, ZCO-15/Ni (nanoflowers) and ZCO-30/Ni (nanowires), were obtained by simply adjusting the reaction time. The electrochemical and physicochemical properties of the as-prepared samples were systematically determined. Particularly, ZCO-15/Ni exhibits excellent structural stability due to its dual morphologies: nanoflowers and nanopetals, and exhibits a large electroactive surface area (25.61 m2g−1), pore diameter (48.38 nm), and robust adhesion to Ni foam, enabling ion and electron transport. ZCO-15/Ni foam electrode delivers an excellent specific capacity of 650.27 C g−1at 0.5 A g−1and admirable cyclic performance of 91% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles compared to ZCO-30/Ni electrode. The excellent electrochemical performance of ZCO makes them promising electrode materials for batteries, hybrid supercapacitors, and other alternative energy storage applications.
