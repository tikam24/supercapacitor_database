Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and conjugated polymers (CPs) have potential applications in nanoelectronics, sensors, energy storage devices, photovoltaics, and nanocomposite materials. One of the major challenges to fully realize their extensive applications is efficient dispersion of CNTs with functional materials. Through the understanding of molecular interaction between CNTs and CPs, we have developed unique approach to disperse CNTs using conjugated polymers and fabricate conjugated polymer supramolecular structures on CNTs. In this presentation, dispersing and functionalizing carbon nanotubes using conjugated polymers, building conjugated polymer supramolecular structures as well as fabricating CPs/CNT/MnO2 composites for supercapacitor electrodes will be discussed. Our studies demonstrate that conjugated polymers offer an efficient and non-invasive approach to disperse and functionalize CNTs and the synergistic combination of CNTs, conjugated polymers and MnO2 nanoparticles has advantages (low resistance and large accessible surface area) over the sum of the individual components, leading to electrodes with higher capacitance and longer life time.
