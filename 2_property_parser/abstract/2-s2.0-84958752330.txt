This short review summarizes our recent progress in fiber-shaped solar cells based on carbon nanomaterials. Highly efficient fiber-shaped solar cells based on graphene/platinum composite fibers were developed with a certified power conversion efficiency of 8.45%. Furthermore, stretchable fiber-shaped solar cells were realized by designing elastic conducting multi-walled carbon nanotube fibers with a novel rotation-translation method. These solar cells were further integrated with fiber-shaped supercapacitors to simultaneously achieve energy conversion and storage. These fiber-shaped energy devices can be woven into textile as next-generation power source for various portable electronic devices.
