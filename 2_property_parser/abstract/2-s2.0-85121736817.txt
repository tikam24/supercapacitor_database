In this work, g-C3N4@NiMoO4/CoMoO4 (gCN@NCM) was fabricated by a hydrothermal method. g-C3N4 sheets were embedded in staggered NiMoO4/CoMoO4 rods to form a three-dimensional structure. The prepared gCN@NCM exhibited good electrochemical performance of high specific capacitance (641.5 â€‹F/g) and excellent cycle stability (15.79% of capacitance lost after 8000 cycles). The specific capacitance of the gCN@NCM//active carbon (AC) device got 30% enhanced at the first 2000 cycles. Moreover, 110% of the original specific capacitance was still maintained after 10,000 cycles. These results indicate that the g-C3N4@NiMoO4/CoMoO4 has great potential in supercapacitors.
