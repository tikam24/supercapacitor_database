This book chapter progresses an overview of the formation, characteristics, and applications of nanostructured polymerâ€“metal oxide heterostructures (PMOHs). Heterostructures exhibit strong interactions between closely packed interfaces, showing superior performances compared to individual structures. This chapter systematically elaborates the recent progress on the synthesis methods, crystallographic and morphological characteristics of emerging PMOH as well as their potential applications. The present book chapter mainly highlights an assortment of heterostructures of conducting polymers particularly PANi, PEDOT, PTh, and PPy-based metal oxides such as Eu2O3, Fe2O3, In2O3, MoO3, WO3, V2O5, ZnO, MnO2, RuO2, SnO2, TiO2, and ZrO2 with their useful applications in gas sensors and energy storage supercapacitor devices.
