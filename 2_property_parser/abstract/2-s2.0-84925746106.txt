Hollow spiny shell Ni-Mn precursors composed of one-dimensional nanoneedles were synthesized via a simple hydrothermal method without any template. The hollow Spiny shell Ni-Mn oxides are obtained under thermal treatment at different temperatures. The BET surface areas of Ni-Mn oxides reach up to 112 and 133 m2 g-1 when calcination temperatures occur at 300 and 400 °C, respectively. The electrochemical performances of as-synthesized hollow spiny shell Ni-Mn oxides gradually die down with annealing temperatures increasing. The porous hollow spiny shell Ni-Mn oxide obtained at 300 °C delivers a maximum capacitance of 1140 F g-1 at a high current density of 1 A g-1 after 1000th cycles and the specific capacitance of Ni-Mn oxide will increase with cycling times increasing. So, porous hollow spiny shell Ni-Mn oxide obtained at low annealing temperature can form a competitive electrode material for supercapacitors.
