Reasonable regulation of crystal structures plays an important role in improving cathode materials for energy storage devices. A good crystal structure is beneficial to charge transfer in the electrode, while introduction of an amorphous phase is helpful to expose more active sites, which makes adaptation to the structural strain in the process of high current charging and discharging easier. Therefore, we have grown crystalline-amorphous hybrid CoNiO2 nanowires on nickel foam by a simple solvothermal method, which proves that it is an effective cathode material for zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitors with enhanced specific capacity, good rate property, and outstanding energy density. This unique hybrid structure not only provides a direction for the crystal structure design of electrode materials but also greatly promotes the development of next-generation energy storage devices.
