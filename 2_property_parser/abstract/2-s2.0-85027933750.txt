The precursor of NiO-Co3O4composites was synthesized via a simple hydrothermal process. After that, the precursor was calcined at 300 °C for 3 h to obtain the composite powders. The powders calcined at 300 °C showed amorphous, and the powders calcined at 400 °C and 500 °C for comparison showed the composite phase of NiO and Co3O4. The composite products showed a microstructure of micro-spheres. For the samples calcined at 300 °C for 3 h, the specific capacitance reached 801 F g−1at a current density of 1 A g−1.
