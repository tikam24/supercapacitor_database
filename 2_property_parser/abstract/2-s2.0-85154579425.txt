Recently, Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZIHCs) have been widely investigated. Therefore, it is very important for the commercial development of ZIHCs to find high-capacity and stable cathodes. Herein, the layered and honeycomb porous carbon by a straight forward and scalable one-step simple KHCO3-activated method has been synthesized triumphantly. The obtained samples have large surface area, well-developed porosity. Meanwhile, the conductive network and abundant electrode active sites make them have great potential and advantages as electrodes for ZIHCs. After optimization, the honeycomb porous carbon-based ZIHCs demonstrated superior electrochemical performances (0.5 A g−1, 131 mAh g−1), excellent rate and cycling performance. Moreover, it demonstrated high energy density (104.6 Wh kg−1) and power density (12.0 kW kg−1). It can also effectively power the red light-emitting diodes (LEDs), showing the practical application of the porous carbon based ZIHCs. What is more important, the synthesized porous carbon revealed remarkable capacity for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) (0.2 A g−1, 780 mAh g−1). Even at high current density of 5 A g−1, it still maintains an impressive capacity of 533 mAh g−1 after 1500 cycles. Based on our results, the honeycomb porous carbon could be potential electrodes for ZIHCs and LIBs.
