ZnWO 4 nanomaterials have been synthesized through DNA template approach with variable hydrothermal reaction time. The affirmation of formation of crystalline ZnWO 4 nanomaterials were examined by X- Ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and Raman spectroscopic studies. The surface morphologies of ZnWO 4 specimens were closely related to the hydrothermal reaction time and DNA template, which has a profound impact on the electrochemical performance of prepared materials. The resulting material displays a well-defined one-dimensional nanorod structure. Cyclic voltammetry results have established the pseudocapacitive nature of ZnWO 4 materials and freshly prepared ZnWO 4 nanomaterial via DNA template route with a hydrothermal reaction time of 24 h achieved a comparatively high specific capacitance of 552 F g -1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s âˆ’1 and outstanding cycling stability with 91% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles. These exceptional features tend to formulate the feasibility of exploitation of ZnWO 4 nanomaterials for advanced energy storage applications.
