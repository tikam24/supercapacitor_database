The growing global demand for energy supply and environmental protection has led to the use of high-efficiency energy storage devices, which supercapacitors are used as one of these devices with high storage capacity and exceptional stability. To be used for this purpose, an easy and rapid synthetically method was used to produce the CO3O4/GO nanocomposite, and its electrochemical performance as the electrode material in hybrid-supercapacitors was further investigated. In this nanocomposite, the CO3O4 crystals with less than 500 nm particle size are uniformly in contact with the wrinkled GO sheets, that their structure and morphology were investigated by surface analyzes. In addition, the functional groups, crystallographic properties, and elemental composition were investigated using the FTIR, XRD, and EDX analyzes. To confirm the supercapacitive effectiveness of the prepared samples, the electrochemical measurements (EIS, CV, and GCD) were done. The results have shown that the values of specific capacity, energy and power densities of Co3O4/GO hybrid nanocomposite are 234 mAh g−1, 16.075 W h kg−1 and 251 W kg−1, respectively. Also, the Co3O4/GO has the lowest amount of resistance compared to other electrodes. Nearly constant efficiency at 104% after 1000 cycles indicates that the nanocomposite has excellent cyclic stability. The proper electrochemical efficiency of the nanocomposite corresponds to the synergistic effect on the composition.
