Most rechargeable batteries suffer from severe capacity loss at low temperature, which limits their applications in cold environments. Herein, we propose an original proton battery, which involves a MnO2@graphite felt cathode and a MoO3 anode in an acid electrolyte containing Mn2+. Its operation depends on the MnO2/Mn2+ conversion in the cathode and H3O+ insertion/extraction in the anode. This battery exhibits a promising energy density (177.4 Wh kg-1) and a supercapacitor-like power density (66.6 kW kg-1) at room temperature. We demonstrate that the electrolyte shows high conductivities even after freezing at low temperatures. As a result, a solid-state proton battery is formed at -70 °C, which maintains 81.5% of the room temperature capacity and shows an unprecedented cycle stability (a negligible capacity fading over 100 cycles). Furthermore, even at -78 °C, it can still deliver sufficient energy to power an electric device.
