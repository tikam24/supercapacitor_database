Energy crisis is one of the most urgent and critical issues in our modern society. Currently, there is an increasing demand for efficient, low-cost, light-weight, flexible and environmentally benign, small-, medium-, and large-scale energy storage devices, which can be used to power smart grids, portable electronic devices, and electric vehicles. Novel electrode materials, with a high energy density at high power are urgently needed for realizing high-performance energy storage devices. The recent development in the field of 2D materials, including both graphene and other layered systems, has shown promise for a wide range of applications. In particular, graphene analogues, due to their remarkable electrochemical properties, have shown great potential in energy-related applications. This review aims at providing an overview of current research and important advances on the development of 2D materials beyond graphene for supercapacitors and batteries. The major challenges to be tackled, and more generally the future directions in the field, are also highlighted.
