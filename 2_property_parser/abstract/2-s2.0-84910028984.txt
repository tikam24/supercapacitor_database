Actived carbon nanotubes are prepared by carbonizing and activating polyaniline nanotubes, which are synthesized by polymerization of aniline with a template-free self-assembly method in aqueous media. The morphology and surface area of the activated carbon nanotubes were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller measurement (BET), respectively. The electrochemical properties of the supercapacitor in H2SO4 and hydroquinone/H2SO4 electrolyte were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. It was found that the supercapacitor exhibited an outstanding specific capacitance value of 380 F/g in the HQ/H2SO4 electrolyte at a sweep rate of 2 mV/s, which was significantly higher than that of the original supercapacitor (188 F/g) using 1 mol/L H2SO4 as electrolyte. The result showed that the capacitance of the as-prepared materials was heightened by 192 F/g, reaching 380 F/g, which was due to the HQ/H2SO4 electrolyte could provide pseudocapacitance.
