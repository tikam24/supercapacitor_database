The aim of this paper is to present a new topology of a matrix power converter for conditioning the current and voltage behaviour of embarked energy sources used in electrical vehicles. The fuel cells together with supercapacitors have been chosen as the power supply. The originality of the proposed matrix converter is its topology and that it is controlled as set of classic converters, for each load to be supplied. The main advantage of such a topology is the suppression of the constant DC bus of the vehicle. This converter is controlled as a set of the following different converters: 2 inverters for supplying the PMSM by the fuel cell (FC) or supercapacitor (SC), two H-bridges for supplying the PMDCM by the FC or SC, two boost DC-DC converters by the FC or SC and finally 2 DC-DC converters for supplying the auxiliaries. Each converter needs a specific type of switch to be adopted.
