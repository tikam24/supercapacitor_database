In this thesis, we design and implement the degradation state diagnostic system for supercapacitors. In order to detect the degradation degree of supercapacitors, it is necessary to measure the changes of parameters that include capacitance, ESR (equivalent series resistance) and the leakage current. The way to obtain these parameters is to collect the voltage and current values by the data acquisition card. And then the data are transmitted to the software of LabVIEW to calculate the parameters. By comparing the values of capacitance and ESR with the original values separately, the degradation state of the supercapacitor can be estimated.
