In this study, we investigated that the activated carbon (AC)-based supercapacitor and introduced SIFSIX-3-Ni as a porous conducting additive to increase its electrochemical performances of AC/SIFSIX-3-Ni composite-based supercapacitor. The AC/SIFSIX-3-Ni composites are coated onto the aluminum substrate using the doctor blade method and conducted an ion-gel electrolyte to produce a symmetrical supercapacitor. The electrochemical properties of the AC/SIFSIX-3-Ni composite-based supercapacitor are evaluated through cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests (GCD). The AC/SIFSIX-3-Ni composite-based supercapacitor showed reasonable capacitive behavior in various electrochemical measurements, including CV, EIS, and GCD. The highest specific capacitance of the AC/SIFSIX-3-Ni composite-based supercapacitor was 129 F g−1 at 20 mV s−1.
