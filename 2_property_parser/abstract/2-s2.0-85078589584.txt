The sodium ion intercalated ultrathin δ-MnO2 flakes (abbreviated as NaxKMO) are synthesized by one-step hydrothermal synthesis. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of sodium ion intercalating process and the homogeneous few-layered microstructure, the NaxKMO electrode shows increased electron conduction as well as largely enhanced intercalation capacitive performance of 324.2 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and 40.91 % capacitance retention at 8 A g−1 is obtained. Meanwhile, the 91.9 % diffusion contribution for NaxKMO electrode is clarified to be higher than that of KMO electrode, which indicates the preintercalated sodium ions caused a promoted diffusion-controlled kinetic in charge-discharge processes for the NaxKMO electrode. An asymmetric supercapacitor device (ASC) is assembled with the NaxKMO cathode and activated carbon anode. With a voltage window of 1.6 V, the fabricated ASC device delivers a high energy and power densities of 31.2 Wh kg−1 and 1571 W kg−1, respectively. With the continuous charge-discharge tests, the device demonstrates outstanding capacitance retention of 98.2 % after 5000 cycles at 1 A g−1, suggesting a great potential of sodium ion intercalated MnO2 film electrodes in practical applications.
