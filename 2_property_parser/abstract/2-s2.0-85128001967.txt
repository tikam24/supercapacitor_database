In the present work, synthesis of bimetallic copper zinc tungstate (CuZnWO4) nanoparticles with reduced graphene oxide (CuZnWO4/rGO) via one-step hydrothermal technique was attempted. The synthesized CuZnWO4/rGO composite are characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UVâ€“Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV DRS) and Photoluminescence (PL). The photocatalytic performance is examined by the degradation of methylene blue (MB) dye under visible light irradiation. The MB dye is almost 73% degraded within 80 min. Further, the electrochemical performance of hybrid CuZnWO4/rGO composite showed the specific capacity (SC) of 480 F/g at 4 A/g in 6 M KOH electrolyte with excellent cyclability conserving a capacitance retention of 127% after 5000 cycles due to increase diffusion of electrolyte ions to the electrode materials. These results support the hybrid CuZnWO4/rGO composite as an appropriate electrode material for high-performance SCs electrode and an auspicious catalyst for the degradation of dye (organic) contaminants in aqueous media.
