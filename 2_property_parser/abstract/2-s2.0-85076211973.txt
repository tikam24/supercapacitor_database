Novel gel polymer electrolyte (hydrogel) was prepared by incorporation of poly (vinylphosphonic acid) (PVPA) as a host matrix and redox active ammonium molybdate, Mo. Supercapacitors including active carbon electrodes were fabricated using hydrogels, PVPA/MoX where X represents the percent fraction of Mo in PVPA. All the electrolytes were in gel form and show excellent bending and stretching properties in a device. The electrochemical performance of the devices was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) experiments. Surprisingly, the specific capacitance (Cs) of the device increased to 1276 F g−1 which is at least 50 times enhancement by introducing Mo as mediator compared to the PVPA based system. The supercapacitor with PVPA/Mo10 has the highest energy density of 180.2 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 500 W kg−1. The device with the same hydrogel structure exhibited higher performance after 2300 charge-discharge cycles and the maintained 85% of its initial capacitance performance. A supercapacitor was fabricated using PVPA/Mo10 and tested under bent and twisted conditions confirming remarkable capacitance retention.
