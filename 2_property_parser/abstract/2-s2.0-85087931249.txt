This paper introduces the management control of a microgrid comprising of photovoltaic panels, battery, supercapacitor, and DC load under variable solar irradiation. The battery is used to store the energy from the photovoltaic panels or to supply the load. The supercapacitor is used to reduce stress on batteries, improve their life cycle, and absorb the fluctuations in the energy produced. The generated photovoltaic power is optimized using Perturb and Observe and Incremental Conductance algorithms to extract the maximum power point tracking. The two algorithms are modified by adding an instantaneous step size to change the direction of the power, so as to reach the maximum power point tracking. The currents of the battery and supercapacitor are managed and controlled using the multi-loop proportional integral controllers. The obtained results show that the multi-loop proportionally integral controllers Perturb and Observe are better than the multi-loop proportional integral controllers Incremental Conductance in terms of stability of injected power. The storage system works perfectly for energy supply, system protection, and fluctuation absorption during the transitions in the solar irradiation. The proposed hybrid storage system can be installed in rural areas as an off-grid system for several uses.
