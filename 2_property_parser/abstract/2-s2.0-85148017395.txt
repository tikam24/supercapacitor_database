With fast development of green economy and carbon neutral society, biodegradable and sustainable materials are urgent needed for multifunctional transient electronics. Here, a flexible, green and flame-retardant fibre-particle-polymer network is developed for physically transient supercapacitors and chemiresistors. By regulating 1D-0D-2D ternary interface, micro/nanoarchitectured polyaniline/ink/alginate semiconductive network enables effective electrolyte infiltration and abundant surface adsorption and diffusion. Moreover, the 0D ink particles promote interface bonding between 1D alginate fibres and 2D polyaniline, giving rise to better wear resistance, compression-after-impact strength and electrical conductivity. As expected, the transient supercapacitor delivers high areal capacitance of 134.1 mF cmâˆ’2, and the transient gas sensor exhibits desirable response (33 %) and long-term stability (56 days) toward 40 ppm NH3 at room temperature, which is superior to most of previous reports. This work pushes forward a significant step towards fibre-particle-polymer interfacial design of physically transient electronics and shows great potential in flexible platform based on comfortable biofibers.
