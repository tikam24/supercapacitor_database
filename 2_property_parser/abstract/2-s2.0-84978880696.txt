We present a simple, fast, eco-friendly, low-cost method to reduce graphite oxide (GO) by using an atmospheric pressure plasma. The ambient plasma is directly applied to a GO solution for a short time. Changes in the morphology, the compositions of carbon and oxygen, the electrochemical properties, and the impedance are investigated for GO before and after the plasma treatment. After the plasma treatment, amount of oxygen is reduced from 30 to 26 at% and the impedance is reduced by about 23%. In addition, after the treatment, the specific capacitance is increased from 13 to 19 F/g, indicating better electrochemical performance for supercapacitor applications. Therefore, an ambient plasma applied directly to a GO solution should be a simple and easy approach for effective reduction of GO and is good for use in various industries.
