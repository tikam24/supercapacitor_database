Developing advanced supercapacitors with both high areal and volumetric energy densities remains challenging. In this work, self-supported, compact carbon composite electrodes are designed with tunable thickness using 3D printing technology for high-energy-density supercapacitors. The 3D carbon composite electrodes are composed of the closely stacked and aligned active carbon/carbon nanotube/reduced graphene oxide (AC/CNT/rGO) composite filaments. The AC microparticles are uniformly embedded in the wrinkled CNT/rGO conductive networks without using polymer binders, which contributes to the formation of abundant open and hierarchical pores. The 3D-printed ultrathick AC/CNT/rGO composite electrode (ten layers) features high areal and volumetric mass loadings of 56.9 mg cm −2 and 256.3 mg cm −3 , respectively. The symmetric cell assembled with the 3D-printed thin GO separator and ultrathick AC/CNT/rGO electrodes can possess both high areal and volumetric capacitances of 4.56 F cm −2 and 10.28 F cm −3 , respectively. Correspondingly, the assembled ultrathick and compact symmetric cell achieves high areal and volumetric energy densities of 0.63 mWh cm −2 and 1.43 mWh cm −3 , respectively. The all-component extrusion-based 3D printing offers a promising strategy for the fabrication of multiscale and multidimensional structures of various high-energy-density electrochemical energy storage devices.
