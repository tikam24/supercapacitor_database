In this work, we have developed a novel nanocomposite via deposition of ceria (CeO2) on nitrogen-doped reduced graphene (CeO2/NRGO). NRGO was synthesized through a facile, safe, and scalable method to achieve simultaneous thermal reduction along with nitrogen doping of graphene oxide (GO) in air at much lower reaction temperature. CeO2/NRGO was prepared via a sonochemical method in which ceria nanoparticles were uniformly distributed on NRGO sheets. The structure and morphology of CeO2/NRGO nanocomposites were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and Raman spectroscopy. Electrochemical properties of the proposed nanocomposite electrodes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge, continuous cyclic voltammetry (CCV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. CeO2–NRGO nanocomposite electrodes showed excellent supercapacitive behavior, including much higher specific capacitance (230 F g−1 at 2 mV s−1) and higher rate capability compared to pure N-graphene. The cycling stability of the electrodes was measured by continues cyclic voltammetry (CCV) technique. The CCV showed that the specific capacitance of the CeO2/NRGO and NRGO nanocomposite maintained at 94.1 and 93.2% after 4000 cycles. The results suggest its promising potential as efficient electrode material for supercapacitors.
