Two new metal-organic frameworks {[Ni0.5(DTA)0.5(H2O)]‧H2O}n (1) and [Ni(DTA)]n (2), where H2DTA = 2,5-di(1H-imidazol-1-yl)terephthalic acid, were constructed from the same reaction system at 120 °C and 180 °C, respectively. Different reaction temperatures were found to trigger different assembly processes and final structures. Single-crystal X-ray analyses show that compound 1 exhibits a 2D layered structure, further forming a 3D supramolecular by hydrogen bonding, while compound 2 shows 2-fold interpenetrating 3D framework with PtS topology. Compounds 1–2 have been evaluated as electrode materials for supercapacitors. The results show that compound 1 exhibits better electrochemical performance than 2. It may be ascribed to 2D layered structures facilitating electron transport and sufficient interlayer spaces available for the storage.
