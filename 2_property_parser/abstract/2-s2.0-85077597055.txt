This article provides insights into nanowhisker nanofiller particles, different categories of polymer/nanowhisker nanocomposites, and broad span of applications. Nanowhiskers are hierarchical needle-like elementary crystallites, often used as nanofillers in polymers. Cellulose, chitin, zinc oxide, fullerene, and aluminum nitride-based nanowhiskers have been employed in matrices. Inclusion of organic and inorganic nanowhiskers in polymers has enhanced thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, thermal stability, water resistance, and other physical properties of nanocomposites. Polymer/nanowhisker nanocomposites have found technical applications in supercapacitors, sensors, anticorrosion agents, antibacterial agents, and drug delivery systems. Future research directions for potential applications rely on material design, nanowhisker functionalization, better dispersion, better reinforcement, and better processing techniques.
