In this paper, a computer-controlled voltage andcurrent source, together with aresponse monitoring system for electrochemical investigations, is presented. The measuring system consisted of two major parts: the measuring hardware (HW) and the proprietary software. The hardware included the data acquisition USB card NI USB 6211 from National Instruments Company as well as all needed circuits (the analogue front end, the signal conditioning circuits, and power supplies). The software is based on the LabVIEW platform from National Instruments, and it is designed to control the signal generation and measurements, to cancel the noise in the signals, and to calibrate the device. The supported electrochemical methods are potential, potentiostatic and galvanostatic measurements, as well as the cyclic voltammetry and impedance measurments. The system was thoroughly tested, and it was determined that the system characteristics fulfil the requirements for most of the electrochemical and bioelectrochemical measurements, supercapacitor characteristics investigations, and much more. The overall system is modular; the HW and SW can easily be upgraded to support different methods and purposes and, therefore, the performance of the system.
