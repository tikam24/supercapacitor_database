The engineering of multifunctional materials applied to energy storage and conversion remains an important challenge in addressing the intermittency issues associated with natural energy resources. Herein, we have achieved an overall improvement in the electrochemical performance of metalâ€“organic frameworks (MOFs) through an elaborate lattice distortion strategy. Compared to the ordered lattice in conventional materials, the partially distorted lattice in the newly synthesized MOFs contributes a completely new kinetics feature: a surface-controlled and high-rate Faradaic reaction. In-situ water splitting can be achieved by employing the lattice-distorted MOF as both the anode of an asymmetric supercapacitor and electrocatalyst, thereby converting intermittent clean energy into electrochemical energy. The lattice distortion strategy in this work provides new insight into the functional design of MOFs, and may provide a novel and economically sound strategy for practical energy sustainability.
