Compared to traditional electric double-layer capacitors, redox-enhanced electrochemical capacitors (redox-ECs) show increased energy density and steadier power output thanks to the use of redox-active electrolytes. The aim of this study is to understand the electrochemical mechanisms of the aqueous pentyl viologen/bromide dual redox system at the interface of an ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK-8) and improve the device performance. Cells with CMK-8 carbon electrodes were investigated in several configurations using different charging rates and potential windows. The pentyl viologen electrochemistry shows a mixed behavior between solution-based diffusion and adsorption phenomena, with the reversible formation of an adsorbed layer. The extension of the voltage window allows for full reduction of the viologen molecules during charge and a consequent increase in the specific discharge energy delivered by the cell. Investigation of the mechanism indicates that a 1.5 V charging voltage with a 0.5 A g-1 charging rate and fast discharge rate produces the best overall performance.
