In the present study, a Mn-supported catalyst material developed from Microcystis aeruginosa microalgae for hydrogen generation was tested as a supercapacitor electrode material for the first time. The catalyst material (MA-HCl-Mn) was examined for hydrogen generation through methanolysis of NaBH4, and it demonstrated good catalytic activity. Symmetric and asymmetric supercapacitor cells were prepared using MA-HCl-Mn as the electrode material. The electrochemical performance of the cells were evaluated by a two-electrode system using 2 M KOH as the electrolyte. The gravimetric capacitance of the symmetric and asymmetric cells found to be 40 F/g and 71 F/g, respectively. It was concluded that MA-HCl-Mn served as a sustainable, dual functional material showing a high catalytic activity for the hydrogen generation and a promising electrochemical performance as the supercapacitor electrode.
