Manganese oxide (MnO2) nanowires with diameters of 40-50 nm and lengths up to several micrometers have been successfully synthesized through a simply hydrothermal route. The influences of synthetic parameters, such as reaction time, and reaction temperature, on the growth and morphologies of MnO2 nanowires have been investigated. It is found that MnO 2 nanowires can be evolved into MnO2 microrods with the reaction time/temperature increased. The electrochemical characterization of MnO2 nanostructures was carried out in 1 M Na2SO 4 aqueous electrolyte at the scan rate of 10 mV s-1. The results indicate that the MnO2 microrods obtained when the reaction performed at 200 °C for 24 h showed the best performance for supercapacitor. © 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
