Biomass-derived carbonaceous materials are considered as one of the most perspective electrodes for symmetric supercapacitors working with alkaline-basic electrolytes. However, they still exhibit lower energy density. Herein, we demonstrate the capacitance performance of the commercial carbon product (YP-50F, “Kuraray Europe” GmbH), obtained from coconuts, in symmetric supercapacitors by using lithium and sodium organic electrolytes. It is found that YP-50F delivers higher energy density when lithium electrolyte containing LiBF4 salt is employed. The sodium electrolyte with NaPF6 salt is less aggressive toward YP-50F than that of LiPF6 salt, as a result of which a good capacitance performance is observed in the sodium electrolyte. The contributions of surface functional groups of YP-50F, as well as its compatibility with non-aqueous lithium and sodium electrolyte, are discussed on the basis of post-mortem scanning electron microscopy (SEM)/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data analyses. The obtained correlations could be of significance in order to design sustainable supercapacitors with high energy density.
