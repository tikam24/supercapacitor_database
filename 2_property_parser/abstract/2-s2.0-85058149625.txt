Whisker multiwalled carbon nanotubes (WMWCNTs) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were synthesized via chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. Paper fibers were used as matrix material, WMWCNTs and MWCNTs as functional material. Paper fibers were mixed with dispersed WMWCNTs and MWCNTs by speed-cutting procedure in water. Then the composite papers were fabricated by vacuum filtration method. The electrochemical performance of the supercapacitor was tested by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge. The testing results indicate the supercapacitor has a maximum capacitance of 120F/g at a scan rate of 1mV/s and has a specific capacitance of 51.5F/g at 0.4A/g. The maximum energy density and power density reach 63.7Wh/kg and 3.99kW/kg respectively in the current range of 0.4-1.4A/g.
