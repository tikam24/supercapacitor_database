The advantage of zero emission, guaranteed load leveling descent transient operation and followed with better energy recovery of braking option, makes battery significant for the principle storage. However due to low power density, batteries are not used for high power industries. So, the supercapacitor plays the chief role as the storage unit. The work on improvement of reliability efficiency have become cynosure for research interest. The design aspects of a conventional bidirectional converter for energy recovery purposes along with MATLAB simulation is presented in this paper. It consists of adjustable frequency drives that can control the speed, torque and direction of induction motor and also generating regenerative energy by regenerative braking technique. The supercapacitor is charged through buck mode and discharged through boost mode. A SPWM method is used to control the torque during acceleration and deceleration. A unique feature called ride through capability has been discussed as one off the operational mode. All operational modes are briefly analyzed and the designed control elucidates the systematic method for control of independent switch. The basic principle has been evaluated and the proposed control method has been verified in simulation and results are discussed.
