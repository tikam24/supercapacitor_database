This paper proposes a method for the sizing of a power plant of an electric vehicle based on fuel cells. The key feature of the proposed methodology aims at reducing the amount of weight on board in order to reduce the energy requirement and to obtain better performance and high fuel economy. The fuel cell in the proposed power plant configuration is chosen as main energy source, while battery power and a supercapacitor are considered as auxiliary power sources. The methodology describes the sizing of the energy sources, enabling a minimum size required of the plant for a given driving profile, independent of an energy management strategy. The method proposed is based on the fulfillment of fuel economy and power requirements of a given driving profile. The proposed method can thus help to better size a power system and assists in the use of a specific energy management strategy.
