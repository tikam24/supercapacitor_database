The influence of ultrasonic radiation in the cavitation regime on the properties of wood activated carbon has been studied. The impedance dependence for the supercapacitors made both of the original and the modified carbon have been analysed. The equivalent electrical circuits modelling the impedance hodographs have been constructed. It has been shown that ultrasonic radiation changes the properties of the surface and shifts the position of the Fermi level to the energy area with high density of states of delocalised electrons.
