The biomass-based inter-transmission network architecture is expected to act on all-solid-state supercapacitors (ASSSCs) by building excellent conductive paths and achieving high ionic conductivity to promote their development as future electronic devices. Here, biomass-derived hybrid organogel electrodes constructed by incorporating polyaniline (PANI) into cellulose/dealkaline lignin (C/DL) film architectures exhibit an impressive specific capacitance (582 F g-1at 1 A g-1) due to the effective dispersion and doping of PANI. Moreover, the specific capacitance of the best C/DL-PANI electrode is nearly 19 times higher than that of a cellulose-PANI electrode, which is attributed to the contribution of DL to the pseudocapacitance. ASSSCs assembled using the C/DL-PANI electrodes and the DL gel electrolyte exhibit excellent specific capacitance (344 F g-1at 1 A g-1), Coulombic efficiency (âˆ¼100% for 5000 cycles), cycle stability (85.7% for 5000 cycles at 1 A g-1), and energy density (58.1 W h kg-1at 0.5 kW kg-1). The ASSSCs showed a comparable or even higher electrochemical performance than the reported PANI-based or biomass-based ASSSCs, which can be due to the conductive network of the biomass-derived electrodes, the migration of ions between the electrodes through the gel electrolyte ion pathway, and the interfacial synergy. This innovative work paves the way for the development of ASSSC applications based on biomass materials.
