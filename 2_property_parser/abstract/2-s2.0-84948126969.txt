The service life of battery is reduced due to its work state of frequent charging and discharging conversion when the battery energy storage is applied to smooth wind power fluctuations. To this end, an evaluation method of the lithium battery life attenuation degree is presented and the best cycle depth of charge and discharge corresponding to the maximum throughput electricity in the life cycle of battery is established according to the method. The main circuit structure of hybrid storage system of dual lithium battery and super capacitors is adopted, considering that the running cycle depth of charge and discharge of the single battery has a detrimental effect on the lifetime of battery and the storage media of high energy density and high power density have complementary advantages. Meantime, the reference power of energy storage unit is determined by the piecewise average algorithm and the control strategy of dual battery units is designed to make the lithium battery running in the optimal charge and discharge depth. At last, based on the basic parameters of large-scale battery energy storage system in which wind farms have been installed in some region, the rationality and effectiveness of the above structure and operation control strategy of energy storage system are verified. The simulation results show that, the deviation between cycle depth of charge and discharge of the single battery and standard cycle depth of charge and discharge is remarkable at the same goal, and it has a great effect on the decay of battery energy storage life; the A and B units of double battery energy storage can run at the standard cycle depth by using the proposed coordinating control strategy, thus the battery lifetime and economic benefits are improved greatly.
