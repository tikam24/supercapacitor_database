Vanadium-based oxides are prepared on graphite substrates by an anodic deposition technique. The plating bath is 0.2 M VOSO 4 solution with NaCH 3COO addition. A scanning electron microscope and an X-ray diffractometer are used to characterize the deposits; the analyses indicate that the porous Na-doped V 2O 5 electrodes with a nano-crystalline nature are obtained. Supercapacitor properties of the oxide electrodes are studied using cyclic voltammetry in KCl aqueous electrolyte. The data show that the deposited oxides can exhibit ideal capacitive behavior over a potential range of 1 V; the optimum specific capacitance is ∼180 F/g. A lower deposition potential leads to a higher porosity of the oxide, resulting in a better high-rate supercapacitor performance of the electrode. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
