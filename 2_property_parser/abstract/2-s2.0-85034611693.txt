NiO with maximum specific capacitance of 744 FÂ·g-1 was successfully synthesized by solgel method and then simple calcination. The microstructure and aggregation morphology of the as-prepared NiO electrode were characterized by powder X-ray diffract ometer (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and BET. An asymmetric supercapacitor has been constructed with nickel oxide as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode, respectively. The performance of the asymmetric supercapacitor was investigated in 2 mol/L KOH aqueous electrolyte using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge test. The asymmetric supercapacitor exhibited excellent energy density, power density and cycle stability, especially good electrochemical stability, i.e. even after consecutive 1, 000 cycles the capacitance of the capacitor still kept at 84.3% of the initial value.
