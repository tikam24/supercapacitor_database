The unique porous carbon (named AUSH) with superior porosity, wettability, and uniform spherical morphology was successfully prepared using a thermal pretreatment of glucose-derived spherical hydrochar with urea followed by KOH activation. Thermal pretreatment of hydrochar with urea induces nitrogen-containing functional groups and increases sp3-hybridized carbon to improve the surface wettability of hydrochar with KOH solution to facilitate the activation process and thus obtaining the borderline microporous-mesoporous structure. The highly porous AUSH possesses a high surface area (2775.9 m2 g−1) and large pore volume (1.89 cm3 g−1) with narrow pore size distribution (~2 nm). This borderline microporous-mesoporous structure exhibits an ultra-hydrophilic surface to increase the electrochemically active surface area in aqueous electrolytes and thus benefits the charge-storage capacity. The AUSH has higher specific capacitance (354 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), rate capability (264 F g−1 at 50 A g−1), and cycle-life stability in 6 M KOH than other KOH-activated porous carbon materials. The enhanced supercapacitive characteristics are largely attributed to the spherical morphology, hydrophilic surface, and well-developed porosity that bridges the gap in attainable pores between micropores and mesopores for facilitating the ion transport and surface-controlled redox kinetics.
