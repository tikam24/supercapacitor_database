In this article, we will focus on the development of electrical energy storage systems, their working principle, and their fascinating history. Since the early days of electricity, people have tried various methods to store electricity. One of the earliest devices was the Leyden jar which is a simple electrostatic capacitor that could store less than a micro Joule of energy. The battery has been the most popular in storing electricity as it has higher energy density. In this article, we will describe and compare the working of various kinds of batteries and capacitors. We will review the recent technological breakthrough in electrical energy storage devices.
