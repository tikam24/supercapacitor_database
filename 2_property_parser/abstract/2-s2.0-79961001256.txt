Birnessite nanotubes have been made through a templated hydrothermal route. Variations in experimental conditions have resulted in differing morphologies of high specific surface area. After forming into electrodes in supercapacitor test cells, good cycleability was observed with specific capacitances approaching 350 F g -1 at low discharge current densities.
