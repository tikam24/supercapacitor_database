Zeolite-templated synthesis of ordered microporous carbons was performed with Ca2+ ion-exchanged Y and beta zeolites, where the conventionally used carbon source gases (e.g., ethylene and propylene) were replaced by various organic solvents, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, acetone, tetrahydrofuran, and diisopropyl ether. The oxygen-containing solvents were fed to the zeolites as carried by N2 gas through a bubbler. Mass spectrometric analyses of the carbonization stream indicated that isopropanol, acetone, tetrahydrofuran, and diisopropyl ether were converted largely to propylene and H2O vapor, while ethanol and methanol to ethylene. The simultaneous generation of H2O and the olefins, without using high-pressure gas cylinders, can be merit in the Ca2+ ion-catalyzed synthesis of zeolite-templated carbons (ZTCs). The approach in this work provides a facile way to produce high quality ZTCs exhibiting excellent micropore orders and high specific capacitances in supercapacitor applications.
