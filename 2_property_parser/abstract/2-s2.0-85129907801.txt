As part of ongoing efforts by researchers to provide sustainable solutions to curb the problem of continuous emissions of greenhouse gases produced from the production and use of fossil fuels, attention has been directed toward biomass. Biomass is an organic matter that can be converted into useful energy forms such as gas and liquid fuels. Furthermore, biomass can serve as the main source for biobased carbon nanomaterials for electrochemical energy storage technologies such as batteries and supercapacitors (SC). Carbon nanomaterials derived from biomass possess unique chemical, structural, and mechanical properties and hence are explored as a source of carbon because of their high surface area, tunable structure, high abundance, renewable nature, low cost, and eco-friendly properties. The main aim of this chapter is to present a comprehensive understanding and perspective on applications of biomass for energy storage. We also examine recent developments and present challenges and opportunities for biomass materials in energy storage.
