Graphene and its hybrids have been regarded as promising electrode materials for supercapacitors due to their fascinating physicochemical properties and positive synergies. As a member of carbonaceous materials, graphene with high surface area and good electrical conductivity exhibits good supercapacitive performance. Additionally, the hybrids of metal oxide and graphene not only possess the intrinsic performances of individual graphene sheet but also provide additional capacitance via pseudocapacitance-type charge-storage mechanism. Herein, a comprehensive review of graphene-based nanomaterials is presented, summarizing the application of graphene and its hybrids in supercapacitors. Especially, the various types of graphene-based materials have been outlined by revealing the relationship between components and supercapacitive behaviors. Finally, we discuss the prospects and important research directions on the exploration of graphene-based hybrids with enhanced performance.
