Regenerative braking is one of the main reasons behind the high levels of energy efficiency achieved in railway electric traction systems. During regenerative braking, the traction motor acts as a generator and restores part of the kinetic energy into electrical energy. To use this energy, it should be either fed back to the power grid or stored on an energy storage system for later use. This paper reviews the application of energy storage devices used in railway systems for increasing the effectiveness of regenerative brakes. Three main storage devices are reviewed in this paper: batteries, supercapacitors and flywheels. Furthermore, two main challenges in application of energy storage systems are briefly discussed.
