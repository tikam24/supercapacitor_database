The present work demonstrates the high photovoltaic power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.12% using single wall carbon nanohorn assisted carbon counter electrode based dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), which demonstrates a superior PCE compared to that of platinum (9.41%). This superior performance was a motivation to fabricate a dye sensitized solar module (DSSM) consisting of six series connected DSSCs arranged in a bifacial manner toward the application of building integrated photovoltaics. The DSSM demonstrated a remarkable, champion PCE of 19.71%. This high PCE, driven to fabricate an integrated device (photocapacitor), consists of a DSSM and a supercapacitor (SC). Upon two-sided illumination, the DSSM generated electrical power, and the same power is used for charging the supercapacitor. A working light emitting diode is demonstrated with discharge of the SC. The detailed fabrication strategies and results are discussed.
