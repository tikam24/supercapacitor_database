Combining lithium-ion batteries with supercapacitors within the storage systems of electric and hybrid vehicles is a way to fulfil the demand for both a high energy content and a high power level. In addition, it is possible to avoid power peaks within the lithium-ion batteries, which leads to a significantly increased lifetime. In order to fully exploit this potential, it is necessary to achieve optimal control of the power distribution between the two storage components. For this purpose, a predictive control strategy is developed that uses a short-term prediction of the vehicleâ€™s expected power demand to calculate the current setpoint for the supercapacitors in real-time. In order to accurately follow that setpoint a highly dynamic DC/DC converter is developed.
