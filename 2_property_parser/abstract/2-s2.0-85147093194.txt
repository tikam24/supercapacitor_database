In order to achieve high-value application of waste medical masks in the field of energy storage, silver plating and carbon coating methods were used to treat the inner melt-blown nonwovens surface of disposable medical masks to prepare electric double-layer electrodes, and finally the supercapacitor devices were assembled. The electrochemical performances of melt-blown nonwovens electrode and as-prepared device were characteriZed by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and AC impedance methods. The results show that the specific capacitance of the electrode is as high as 298 F / g when the current density is 1 A / g and 224 F / g at the current density of 20 A / g, showing a higher rate capability (75%) with the charge transfer internal resistance and equivalent series internal resistance of the electrode being 0. 86 and 0. 15 Î©, respectively. The energy density of the device reaches 9. 7 W.h / kg under the power density of 125 W / kg. After 10 000 charge / discharge cycles, the specific capacitance retention of the device is as high as 99. 8%, indicating the eXcellent cycling stability.
