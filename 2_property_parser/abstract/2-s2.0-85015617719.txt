Prussian blue-manganese hexacyanoferrate (PB-MnHCF) nanocomposite is electrochemically deposited on glassy carbon (GC) electrode by potential cycling method from solution containing equimolar mixture of Fe3+, Mn2+ and [Fe(CN)6]3− ions. The film is characterized by CV, XPS, EDS, UV-Vis spectroscopy and the surface topography is seen by AFM technique. It shows high specific capacitance of 1333±95 F g−1 (areal capacitance of 11±0.5 mF cm−2 or absolute capacitance of 767±34 μF), high specific power density of 3475±97 W kg−1, high specific energy density of 185±13 W h kg−1 at a current density of 7 A g−1 and excellent cycling stability (93 % capacitance retention up to 500 cycles) at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 in 0.1 M KNO3 (pH=2) medium. It shows selective and sensitive electrocatalytic response towards H2O2 reduction with high sensitivity and low detection limit. It also shows electrocatalytic response towards ethanol oxidation with lower values of charge transfer resistance and Tafel slope along with prolonged stability in acidic solution. All of these demonstrate its potential candidature as a multifunctional high performance non-precious electrode material for electrochemical supercapacitors, hydrogen peroxide sensing and ethanol oxidation.
