Carbon nanotubes prepared by a catalytic pyrolysis method were considered as active electrode materials for the storage of energy in supercapacitor. Due to their unique mesoporosity, these materials have a high ability for the accumulation of charges in the electrode/electrolyte interface. Electrochemical capacitors based on nickel oxide/carbon nanotube composite electrodes were developed through the electrochemical deposition of nickel oxide on the nanotube electrode. The value of capacitance obtained from nanotubes modified by nickel oxide reaches 52F/g. The self-discharge rate of this supercapacitor is much lower than that of the supercapacitor composed of carbon nanotube electrode.
