High performing porous Zinc Stannate (Zn2SnO4) nanostructured metal oxides was successfully synthesized via novel and cost effective hydrothermal technique. The size controlled Zinc Stannate nanoparticle was synthesized using Sodium Hydroxide as mineralizer.Further the nanoparticles were characterized by PXRD (Powder X-ray Diffraction). The zinc stannate was crystallized in spinel structure and average crystallite sizes of the prepared nanoparticles are around 10nm. For the first time pseudocapacitive nature of the Zn2SnO4 was evaluated under aqueous 3 M KOH electrolyte solution using electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique. From the observed measurements, it is found that the spinel Zinc Stannate exhibits high specific capacitance of 545 F/g at 5 mV/s scan rate. Zn2SnO4 is a promising electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
