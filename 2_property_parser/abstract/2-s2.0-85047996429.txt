Nanocomposite CNT/NiOx electrode material formation for applying in supercapacitors is represented. Through the electrophoresis, it is possible to manipulate and deposit nanoparticles, such as carbon nanotubes obtained by chemical vapor deposition, in liquid suspensions under the applying of an electric field. In the suspension, Ni2+ ions cover functionalized CNT surface, bringing positive charge to it and allowing to carry out the deposition of both carbon nanotubes and nickel, that react with vacant (OH)-, simultaneously on cathode. Finally, received material on a foil undergoes the annealing in order to turn Ni(OH)2x into NiOx. The result is porous coating, where CNTs play a matrix role, providing stability and high power rate, and nickel oxide NiOx, which is active material, increases the specific capacity due to faradaic processes. For the time being, the capacity of 23 mF/cm2 is reached in KOH electrolyte without significant decrease during cycling voltametry at 10 mV/s.
