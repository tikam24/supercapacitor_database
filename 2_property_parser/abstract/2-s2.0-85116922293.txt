Reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/Co0.85Se composites are synthesized via one-step hydrothermal method. The introduction of reduced GO prevents the aggregation of Co0.85Se, enhances the specific area, and provides more active sites. The optimized rGO/Co0.85Se composite achieves a high specific capacitance of 1200F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in 3 M KOH electrolyte. The asymmetric supercapacitor assembled with activated carbon and rGO/Co0.85Se composite delivers an energy density of 60.76 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 800 W kg−1, with a capacitance retention of 76% over 8000 cycles at 5 A g−1.
