The necessity for advancement in the field of energy storage devices is inevitable due to the forthcoming exhaustion in the availability of primitive hydrocarbon deposits. Benign and ecological renewable sources can opt as the perfect substitution for fossil fuels as a remedy for sustainability, which can be stored to meet the overflowing energy demand. Even a single spark in the development of energy storage devices can be viewed as an explosion in the execution of future energy concerns. This review is a token of recent progress in the arena of two-dimensional material-based supercapacitors for energy storage applications, manuscript starts with the need for energy storage devices in the anticipation of upcoming energy catastrophe. A brief introduction to the capacitors along with their classification under various parameters and their peaks and valleys in storing energy are included in the review. The chief attention of the appraisal stands on the capacitors employing the pseudo mechanism but those based on electrochemical double layer and faradaic mechanism are also included along with performance evaluation. The role of various 2D materials including graphene, molybdenum-based TMDs, tungsten-based TMDs, MXene, two-dimensional metal-oxides and phosphides in enhancing the charge storage performance are scrutinized in the review.
