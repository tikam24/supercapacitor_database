According to the analysis on the working condition characteristics of a 5 tons loader, a parallel hybrid solution based on automatic transmission was proposed for improvement of energy efficiency and torque transmission. The torque and speed online was estimated by fuzzy logic control strategy. We set torque requirement, SOC value of the super capacitor, vehicle speed, accelerator-pedal position and efficiency of hydraulic torque converter as inputs, and the operating point of the engine and the motor and gear of the system as outputs. The results showed that the engine efficiency is improved, the SOC value of the super capacitor is stable, and the gear change is rational and efficient. The hybrid loader saves about 9.56% fuel than that of the conventional one. Meanwhile, the hybrid loader of automatic transmission saves about 11.82% fuel than that of the conventional one, therefore this strategy can improve the fuel economy.
