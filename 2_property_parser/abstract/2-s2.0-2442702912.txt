Nanostructured and nanorod-shaped three-dimensional In2O 3 were deposited on stainless steel (SS) by a novel potentiodynamic method at a high scan rate of 200 mV s-1. In2O 3/SS electrodes were found to exhibit high specific capacitance, high power density, and long-term stability when used as active electrode materials for redox supercapacitors.
