A facile two-step method has been developed to synthesize 3D core/shell-structured composites (CNTs@Ni-Co-S) composed of ternary nickel cobalt sulfide nanosheets (Ni-Co-S) as the shell and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the core on a flexible Ni mesh (Ni@CNTs@Ni-Co-S). CNTs are in situ grown on a metallic Ni mesh via a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method and further serve as the skeleton to deposit ultrathin Ni-Co-S nanosheets. Due to the intimate combination of highly conductive CNTs and high redox-active Ni-Co-S nanosheets, the as-prepared composite electrode delivers a high specific capacity of 222 mA h g-1 at 4 A g-1 and excellent rate capability (193 mA h g-1 at 50 A g-1). An advanced asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was designed using Ni@CNTs@Ni-Co-S as the positive electrode and carbon cloth @CNTs as the negative electrode in KOH solution. Our ASCs present a high energy density of 46.5 W h kg-1 at a power density of 800 W kg-1. Even at an ultra-high power density of 33.7 kW kg-1 (charging only for 2 s to 1.6 V), the ASCs can still demonstrate an energy density as high as 15.9 W h kg-1. Impressively, when charging to 3.4 V within 70 s, two ASCs assembled in series can effectively light up 10 light-emitting diodes (LEDs, lowest working voltage are 3.2 V) for more than 2 min or one single LED for around 50 min. These remarkable capacitive performances of Ni@CNTs@Ni-Co-S//CC@CNTs ASCs show great potential for application in supercapacitors, particularly in wearable devices.
