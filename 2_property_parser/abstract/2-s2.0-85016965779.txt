Nanostructured Ni(OH)2 is a promising candidate to be used as an extrinsic pseudocapacitors material. Here, nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) was grown on the surface of a Ti plate, galvanostatically via electrodeposition method. In the electrodeposited films a stable α-Ni(OH)2 phase with particles in cabbage form and average crystallite size of 20 nm is obtained. The α-Ni(OH)2 sample exhibits excellent electrochemical performance at different current densities and good cycling stability. A maximum specific capacitance of 1903 F g−1 is achieved at a current density of 1 mA cm−2. The energy and power density values found are 42.31 W h kg−1 and 430 W kg−1.
