Renewable based isolated DC microgrids(IDCMG) faces reliability issues due to intermittent nature of sources. Hence non-renewable source (diesel generators, gas generators, etc) are generally used to increase the reliability of isolated DC microgrids. Power control and management techniques plays crucial role in achieving optimal utilization of renewable and non-renewable sources. A power control algorithm (PCA) is developed to attain effective energy management between renewable and non-renewable sources by utilizing the hybrid storage systems (battery and supercapacitor). Proposed strategy also covers the extreme scenarios of battery storage and IDCMG. Strategy is simple, reliable and efficient in utilizing the renewable source power. Strategy also improves the life time of battery by diverting high frequency power oscillations to supercapacitor. Simulation of proposed scheme is executed on IDCMG in real time simulator RSCAD/RTDS platform to validate the effectiveness.
