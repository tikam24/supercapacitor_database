This work demonstrates a hierarchical structure design with mixed holey graphene oxide (HGO) and Ni(OH)2 active material layer made by one-pot hydrothermal reaction clinging to Nickel foam as backbone and ice-template oriented graphene oxide (GO) aerogel as filling, aiming to create an asymmetric solid supercapacitor (ASC) device with compliable flexibility and high electrochemical performance. The effects of hydrothermal treatment and ice-template freezing parameters on electrochemical stability under repeated exterior deformation are discussed, the optimal parameters result in a high areal capacitance of 479.8 mF/cm2 in asymmetric supercapacitor device setup. The use of porous HGO and oriented GO aerogel synergistically contribute to the high energy and power density up to 1.69 Wh/m2 and 9 W/m2 as well as excellent electrochemical performance retention under repeated curving deformation which reaches 102% thanks to a novel activation process. The electrode assembly including metal foam and the buffering GO aerogel should be instructive for future supercapacitor design.
