We demonstrated a facile and effective synthesis of graphene oxide (GO)/conducting polymer (CPs, PANI and PPy) composites via an in situ oxidative polymerization suitable for supercapacitor application. A novel aldehyde-poly(ethylene glycol) modified graphene oxide (PEG-CHO/GO or APGO) was designed and synthesized. Experimental results showed that PEG-CHO can not only act as anchor sites to combine with the amine nitrogens of the PANI or PPy chains, but can also facilitate the diffusion and growth of polymer monomers on the surface of GO sheets. Moreover, APGO as conducting networks can provide large surface and more electronic transport paths for conductive networks inside the bulk electrode matrix. The as-assembled aldehyde-poly(ethylene glycol) modified graphene oxide/conducting polymer (APGO/CPs) composites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and a stable, highly efficient charge-transfer configuration was disclosed and confirmed. Moreover, the electrochemical performance of the fabricated electrodes was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The obtained APGO/CPs composites presented good electrochemical properties, low internal resistance and stable cycling performance, indicating a synergistic effect of APGO and CPs. Noticeable improvements in other electrochemical properties of graphene oxide based conducting polymer composites allow its charming application as electrode material for supercapacitors.
