Proper storage sizing of hybrid electric vehicles is essential for the optimal utilization of on-board energy sources. Unlike previously developed sizing methods, where component size is bounded by power, energy, weight, volume, cost constraints, this work introduces an efficiency-based method by which supercapacitors are sized in a battery electric vehicle. An extensive efficiency model is developed, which take into account of various power-sharing methods and supercapacitor state-of-charge deviation. The proposed method is applied to the EPA UDDS, ARTEMIS, and WLTC drive cycle tests. Results of this study suggests that the percentage mass of the supercapacitor should be 7-13%of the total mass of the hybrid energy storage system.
