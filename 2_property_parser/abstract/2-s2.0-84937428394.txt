Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) have a wide range of applications and are commonly prepared under harsh conditions with small quantities. A green method for the preparation of CNFs under mild conditions with the scalable potential is highly challenging. Here, we describe a facile water-based room-temperature approach to producing gel fibers from a perylene diimide derivative via self-assembly, gelation, freeze-drying, and then to generating CNFs by subsequent pyrolysis under Ar. The entangled CNFs, with relatively uniform diameters around 20-50 nm, can be prepared as thin films or monoliths. The CNFs doped with elements N and Sn can be readily produced. The CNFs are characterized by various techniques and particularly evaluated as electrode materials for supercapacitor by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge. A non-ionic surfactant (Pluronics F-127) can be easily incorporated into the self-assembly process, which produces the CNFs with a higher surface area 520 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> and a specific capacitance of 346 F g<sup>-1</sup> at the scan rate of 1 mV s<sup>-1</sup> or 192 F g<sup>-1</sup> at the current density of 1 A g<sup>-1</sup>. The CNF electrodes are highly stable. Quite surprisingly, the specific capacitance increases with repeated testing, achieving an impressive 226 F g<sup>-1</sup> for 1000 charge/discharge cycles at 4 A g<sup>-1</sup>.
