The current work describes the porous Nickel metal–organic frameworks (Ni-MOF) synthesized by hydrothermal route. The fabricated electrocatalyst proved an admirable electrocatalyst for the Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) explored in basic media (1 M NaOH). The Ni-MOF electrode exhibited outstanding stability and OER catalytic activity, achieving the desired current density of 10 mAcm−2 at an overpotential of merely 276 mV. This remarkable activity may be justified by the enormous surface area of the as-synthesized porous Ni-based MOF. These characteristics will make Ni-MOF a profitable candidate as a vital-performance electrocatalyst for OER applications. The porous Ni-MOF electrode has significant performance with a specific capacitance of 50.6 Fg−1 at 1 Ag−1, energy, and power densities of 2.53 WhKg−1 and 300 WKg−1 respectively and nearly 99% capacitance retention over 2000 cycles measured at 4 Ag−1, suggesting the commercial potential.
