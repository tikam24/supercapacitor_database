This review article investigates the hot topics by presenting the latest advances on graphene-based nanostructures for supercapacitors. In literature, many scientists have studied the nanomaterials and combination of conducting polymers in supercapacitor (SC) devices. The main aim of this review article is to present the higher capacitance, and higher power and energy density performances of the SC devices, which includes the active materials of carbon-based materials, metal oxides, conducting polymers, nanocomposites, etc. Many conventional techniques have already been used such as photolithography, inkjet printing, etc. Each of these methods has specific advantages and some drawbacks, with some working better in different environments. Among various nanoscaled materials, nanocrystal oxides of transition metals play an important role in advanced materials development. In addition to design of active material, symmetric and asymmetric supercapacitor device fabrication is also directly effect to obtain a higher capacitance, energy and power density performances. Therefore, this review article focuses on supercapacitor technology in new developments, such as design of active materials, device fabrication, etc.
