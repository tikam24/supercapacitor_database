This study was focused on the composite lignin nanoparticles (LNPs) loaded natural fibers, which was by KOH activation to prepare composite porous activated carbon fiber electrode materials. Then the as-prepared activated carbon fiber electrode was tested to evaluate the electrochemical performance in a three-electrode system. The results showed that the specific capacitance of KOH activated carbon fiber electrode material was 351.13F/g at the current density of 0.5A/g, which was much higher than that of non-activated carbon fiber electrode material (7.88F/g) and natural fiber activated carbon fiber material without LNPs (306.50F/g) under the same conditions. In addition, fiber surface loaded with LNPs formed porous activated carbon layer structure during the activation process, which further improved the cyclic stability of the composite activated carbon fiber material. Meanwhile, the abundant hydroxyl of LNPs endowed the composite material with additional pseudocapacitance. After 10000 cycles at a current density of 10A/g, the capacitive retention of the composite activated carbon fiber electrode was still at 95%, which was higher than that of the activated carbon fiber electrode of 87% without LNPs loading. The results indicated that lignin nanoparticles/ natural fiber based activated carbon fiber was an ideal electrode material for supercapacitors. This study also provided a new way for the high-value application of LNPs in biomass carbon fiber as energy storage electrode material.
