Scale-like CoMn2O4 nanosheets anchoring on reduced graphene oxide(CoMn2O4/rGO) were fabricated via a facile co-precipitation and thermal process. The resulting product of CoMn2O4/rGO was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy(FESEM), transmission electron microscopy(TEM), X-ray diffraction(XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS). When evaluated its potential as electrode material in supercapacitors, CoMn2O4/rGO nanocomposites exhibit enhanced energy storage performance with high specific capacitance(1000.8 F/g at 2 A/g) and excellent cycle stability(93.6% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles).
