A simple approach has been developed to fabricate ideal supercapacitors based on porous Mn 3O 4-Co 3O 4 nanocubic composite electrodes. We can easily obtain porous corner-truncated nanocubic Mn 3O 4-Co 3O 4 composite nanomaterials without any subsequent complicated workup procedure for the removal of a hard template, seed or by using a soft template. In such a composite, the porous Mn 3O 4-Co 3O 4 enables a fast and reversible redox reaction to improve the specific capacitance. The porous nanocubic Mn 3O 4-Co 3O 4 composite electrode can effectively transport electrolytes and shorten the ion diffusion path, which offers excellent electrochemical performance. These results suggest that such porous Mn 3O 4-Co 3O 4 composite nanocubes are very promising for next generation high-performance supercapacitors. Â© 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
