A high capacitance RuO2-ZrO2coating was prepared by thermal decomposition method. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), X-ray diffraction (XRD),high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM)and ab initiocalculations were appliedtounderstand the role of the microstructure in the acquisition of high specific capacitance of RuO2-based oxides.The results show that the RuO2-ZrO2oxide prepared at critical crystallization temperaturecan be considered to be quasi-amorphousor microcrystalline (Ashort-range ordered crystal structure can be seen from the TEM image, but no diffraction peaks can be seen from the XRD diffraction patterns). And this RuO2-ZrO2was identified as asolid solutionwith high solid solubility. It referred to herein as a quasi-amorphous solid solution. Such a special microstructure was conducive for "synergistic catalysis" owing to the cationic interaction and thus could gain high "active site density" andhigh "active surface", thus developinghigh specific capacitance.
