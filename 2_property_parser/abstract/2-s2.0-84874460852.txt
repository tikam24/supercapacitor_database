For the small microgrid, this paper proposes a program that contains an active storage (AS) combined with a single pole double throw (SPDT) switchgear installed at the point of common connection (PCC). A multi-source cooperative control strategy (CCS) for the microgrid is proposed as well. Some specific control models are adopted to implement the cooperative control only with local information. These control models contain integrated control models of inverter and self-determination model including the AS model and back-up generation (BG) model. Cooperative control is realized between the AS and the BG without communication. The strategy proposed is verified by a simulation system made from PSCAD/EMTDC using the supercapacitor as the AS and the microturbine as the BG, realizing the CCS and autonomous operation in the island mode.
