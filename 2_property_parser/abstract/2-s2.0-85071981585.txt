In this study, two-dimensional V2CTx MXene has been prepared by selectively etching Al layers from V2AlC MAX phase by NaF+HCl etching at 90 Â°C for 72 h and its performance as supercapacitor (SC) electrode were tested using simulating seawater as electrolyte. V2CTx MXene-based electrodes shows a good capacitance of 181.1 F/g, which is in accordance with the volumetric specific capacitance of 317.8 F/cm3, and with 89.1% capacitance retention even after 5000 cycle. Compared with other MXenes, V2CTx have better electrochemical performance as SC electrode. This work provides an innovative strategy to apply V2CTx MXene as SC electrode in safety and effective seawater electrolyte.
