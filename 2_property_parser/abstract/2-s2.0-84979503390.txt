In the past few years, insensitive attentions have been drawn to wearable and flexible energy storage devices/systems along with the emergence of wearable electronics. Much progress has been achieved in developing flexible electrochemical energy storage devices with high end-use performance. However, challenges still remain in well balancing the electrochemical properties, mechanical properties, and the processing technologies. In this review, a specific perspective on the development of textile-based electrochemical energy storage devices (TEESDs), in which textile components and technologies are utilized to enhance the energy storage ability and mechanical properties of wearable electronic devices, is provided. The discussion focuses on the material preparation and characteristics, electrode and device fabrication strategies, electrochemical performance and metrics, wearable compatibility, and fabrication scalability of TEESDs including textile-based supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries.
