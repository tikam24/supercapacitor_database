Hierarchical Ni3S2@CdS core-shell nanostructures on nickel foam were synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal method for the first time. As supercapacitor materials, the Ni3S2@CdS core-shell nanostructures exhibited a high capacitance of 3.15 F cm-2 (2100 F g-1) at a current density of 2 mA cm-2, and 86.7% of the original capacitance was retained even at a high current density of 15 mA cm-2, suggesting excellent rate capability. An asymmetric supercapacitor based on Ni3S2@CdS as the positive electrode, porous carbon as the negative electrode and KOH as the electrolyte can work steadily at a voltage of 1.5 V, and presented excellent electrochemical performance. After 4000 charge-discharge cycles at a current density as large as 6 mA cm-2, 130% of the initial capacitance was maintained. The asymmetric supercapacitor exhibited a high energy density of 127.5 W h kg-1 at a current density of 2 mA cm-2 and with a corresponding power density of 0.995 kW kg-1. The above-mentioned results indicate that Ni3S2@CdS could be a potential candidate for supercapacitors.
