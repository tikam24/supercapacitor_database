This paper proposes a high area-efficiency 14-bit column-parallel successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for array sensors. A novel hybrid capacitor digital-to-analog converter (CDAC) based on the charge transfer is utilized to increase the area efficiency. It consists of a 9-bit split CDAC and a 5-bit serial CDAC. A foreground digital calibration is employed to compensate for the linearity error caused by the capacitor mismatch and bridge parasitic capacitor. The prototype was designed and fabricated in a 130-nm CMOS technology. Sampling at 200KS/s, the total power consumption is 57 μW. With the digital calibration, the proposed ADC achieves the Spurious Free Dynamic Range (SFDR) of 89.14 dB and the Differential Nonlinearity (DNL) of 0.87/-0.99 LSB. The single ADC occupies an active area of 15 × 1450μm2 and the area efficiency is only 6.77 μm2 code.
