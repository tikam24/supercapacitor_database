Manganese oxides as active electrode materials for supercapacitors were prepared by a simple chemical coprecipitation between KMnO4 and MnSO4 solution. Electrochemical performances of manganese oxide electrodes were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and constant current charge/discharge in a three-electrode system. The effects of heat treatment, discharge current and cycle number on the capacitive characteristics of the manganese oxides were investigated. Manganese oxide at a lower annealing temperature exhibited ideal capacitive behavior in 1 mol/L Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte between -0.2 and 0.8 V (vs SCE). The specific capacitance of manganese oxide annealed at 45°C and 80°C is 147.97 F/g and 112.26 F/g at 7.32 mA/cm2 discharge, respectively, and the manganese oxide annealed at 80°C has excellent cycle life.
