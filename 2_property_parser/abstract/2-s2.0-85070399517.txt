In this article, polyaniline nanofibers (PANI-NF)/manganese dioxide composites (PANI/MnO2) were synthesized through an interfacial polymerization approach. The PANI-NF and MnO2 were obtained by in situ oxidation of aniline by potassium permanganate and in situ reduction of potassium permanganate by aniline, respectively. During the interfacial polymerization, the monomer aniline can only be oxidized to PANI after it diffuses into the water phase. This diffusion-control feeding process of the monomer results in nanofiber structure. The morphologies and crystal structures of the prepared PANI/MnO2 composites were measured by scanning electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction. The supercapacitive behaviours of these composites were analysed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) tests. The CV and GCD tests indicate that the PANI/MnO2 composites possess better electrochemical activity and higher capacitive properties compared to neat PANI nanofibers. The specific capacitance of PANI/MnO2 composites and PANI-NF are 751 F g−1 and 180 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 in Na2SO4 solution, respectively. We believe that the enhanced capacitive properties are related to the special nanostructure and strong interaction between PANI and MnO2 that resulted from the interfacial synthesis method.
