The design of bimetallic tellurides that exhibit excellent electrochemical properties remains a huge challenge for high-performance supercapacitors. In the present study, tellurium is consolidated on CoNi2@rGO for the first time, to synthesize NiTe2-Co2Te2@rGO nanocomposite by using a facile hydrothermal method. As-prepared NiTe2-Co2Te2@rGO nanocomposite was characterized by EDS, TEM, FESEM, Raman, BET, XRD, and XPS techniques to prove the structural transformation. Upon the electrochemical characterization, NiTe2-Co2Te2@rGO has notably presented numerous active sites and enhanced contact sites with the electrolyte solution during the faradic reaction. The as-prepared nanocomposite reveals a specific capacity of 223.6 mAh g−1 in 1.0 M KOH at 1.0 A g-1. Besides, it could retain 89.3% stability after 3000 consecutive galvanostatic charge–discharge cycles at 1.0 A g−1 current density. The hybrid supercapacitor, fabricated by activated carbon as an anode site, and NiTe2-Co2Te2@rGO as a cathode site, presents a potential window of 1.60 V with an energy density of 51 Wh kg−1 and a power density of 800 W kg−1; this electrode is capable of lighting up two red LED lamps and a yellow LED lamp for 20 min, which is connected in parallel. The present work opens new avenues to design and fabrication of nanocomposite electrode materials in the field of supercapacitors.
