A method based on electrophoretic deposition (EPD) has been developed to produce uniform and local deposits of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNT) on interdigital structures of planar supercapacitor (SC) at room temperatures. Alcohol/acetone suspensions were used under constant voltage conditions in the range of 6 to 100 V, with deposition times ranging from 2 to 60 minutes and electrodes space from 2 to 15 mm. It was shown that for dense layers deposition with good adhesion on the narrow lines of the planar SC electrodes it is necessary to use average values of the electric field and multi-stage method in which the deposition and drying processes are alternated. Electrochemical tests of the sandwich-like supercapacitors with electrodes obtained by the described method were carried out. The specific capacity of experimental samples increased from 0.24 to 1.07 mF/cm2 with an increase in the number of EPD cycles from 3 to 9.
