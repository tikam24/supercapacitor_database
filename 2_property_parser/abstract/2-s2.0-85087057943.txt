Electrical double-layer capacitors are widely concerned for their high power density, long cycling life and high cycling efficiency. However, their wide application is limited by their low energy density. In this study, we propose a simple yet environmental friendly method to synthesize cobalt and nitrogen atoms co-doped porous carbon (CoAT-NC) material. Cobalt atoms connected with primarily pyridinic nitrogen atoms can be uniformly dispersed in the amorphous carbon matrix, which is benefit for improving electrical conductivity and density of states of the carbon material. Therefore, an enhanced performance is expected when CoAT-NC is served as electrode in a supercapacitor device. CoAT-NC displays a good gravimetric capacitance of 160 F/g at 0.5 A/g combing with outstanding capacitance retention of 90% at an extremely high current density of 100 A/g in acid electrolyte. Furthermore, a good energy density of 30 Wh/kg can be obtained in the organic electrolyte.
