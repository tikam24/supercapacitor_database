Due to an increase in industrial and consumer needs, electronic equipment has gained a large interest. This equipment uses a large number of nonlinear loads that inject harmonics to the system and thereby distorting the supply current. Hence a tremendous need for APFC has arrived. A closed-loop variable frequency controlled interleaved buck PFC with a hybrid capacitor is introduced to diminish the conduction losses and switching stresses that occur in traditional PFCs. The converter control deals with the switching frequency rather than the duty cycle to achieve the aim. A 220V AC to 15V DC, 100W system is developed in Matlab to verify the thesis and the waveforms are obtained. The results confirm that THD has greatly decreased and hence the power factor correction is carried out.
