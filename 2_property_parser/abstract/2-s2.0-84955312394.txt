Hierarchical carbon@Ni3S2@MoS2 (C@Ni3S2@MoS2) double core-shell nanorods have been synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method using highly conductive carbon/Ni (C/Ni) nanorods as both the precursor and template. As supercapacitor electrodes, the C@Ni3S2@MoS2 nanorods deliver a specific capacitance as high as 1544 F g-1 at a current density of 2 A g-1 with excellent cycling stability (retaining 92.8% of the capacitance after 2000 cycles at a current density of 20 A g-1). The C/Ni nanorods as the backbone played crucial roles in enhancing the rate performance of the device, in the meanwhile, interconnected MoS2 nanosheets on the shell provided numerous accessible surfaces and contacts with the electrolyte. Our work demonstrated an effective design of robust hierarchical double core/shell nanostructures, which could provide a general and promising approach to fabricate high-performance materials for energy storage applications.
