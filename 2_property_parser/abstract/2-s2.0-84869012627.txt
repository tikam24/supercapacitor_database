Hydrothermal treatment of KMnO 4 and graphene flakes (GFs) leads to MnO 2 nanosheets decorated on GFs. The resulting MnO 2/GF (MG) composite has been tested as a supercapacitor electrode in aqueous electrolyte and found to exhibit good cycling stability with a specific capacitance of 147 Fg -1 at a current density of 5 Ag-1 (see figure).
