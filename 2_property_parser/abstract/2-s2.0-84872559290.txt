PbO@C nanocomposites were synthesized by soaking maize in Pb(NO3)2 solutions followed by calcination in nitrogen atmosphere. TEM photos showed highly dispersed PbO nanoparticles homogeneously embedded in the carbon matrix and the main particle sizes of PbO were distributed between 15-29 nm. Electrochemical tests revealed a high specific capacity of 152.6 F·g-1 and good stability at discharge current density of 1.0 A·g-1. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
