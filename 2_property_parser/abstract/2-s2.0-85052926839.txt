Superthin Co3O4 porous nanoflake was synthesized via a simple natural biomembrane support system at a mild reaction condition. Due to its high BET specific surface area (125 m2 g−1) and superthin porous nanoflake structure, the as-obtained sample exhibits a remarkable electrochemical performance, including high specific capacitance (448 F g−1) and excellent electrochemical stability (94% capacitance retention from 0.5 A g−1 up to 10 A g−1).
