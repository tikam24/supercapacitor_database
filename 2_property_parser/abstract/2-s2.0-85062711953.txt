The paper is focused on the tram input LC traction filter stabilization by the super capacitor energy storage system. The input LC filter is almost undamped resonant circuit connected on the both sides to the sources of disturbances. On the input side, LC filter is connected by the tram pantograph to the dc-trolley overhead lines. The main disturbances are caused by the dc-trolley voltage drops, other vehicles, pantographs head arcs, etc. On the output side, the LC filter is connected to the traction drive. With the constant torque command, the tram during the voltage drops increase the current flow from the LC filter to hold constant torque and thereby further decrease the LC filter voltage, and vice versa. This could lead to unstable traction drive behavior. The super capacitor storage system, which is commonly used to accumulate energy during tram breaking, can be furthermore used to stabilize LC filter voltage. The paper describes the algorithm of the LC filter stabilization by the super capacitor storage system control.
