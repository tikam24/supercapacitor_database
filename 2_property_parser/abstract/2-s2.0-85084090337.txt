It is necessary to have an energy management strategy (EMS) to control the operation of the different components inside renewable system. In renewable hybrid power system containing fuel cell (FC), battery storage (BS) and supercapacitor (SC) (FC/BS/SC), the main objective is to minimize the hydrogen consumption of fuel cell. In FC/BS/SC system, the battery is helping the FC when the load power is high while SC is working at the load transient or load fast change. The management strategy is based on fuzzy logic control (FLC). It is used to manage optimally the load demand among the different components of FC/BS/SC system. Modeling and simulation of the different system components have been performed using the Matlab/Simulink software. Simulation results reveal the ability of EMS based on FLC to optimize the system performance. In this paper, an energy management strategy was designed to achieve this objective.
