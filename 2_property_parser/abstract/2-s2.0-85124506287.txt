Graphene-based flexible supercapacitors have been widely developed for wearable devices. To enhance the electrochemical property, various electroactive materials have been incorporated into the graphene-based electrodes. Here, tetraaniline (TA) was used to fabricate the high-performance flexible electrodes for supercapacitors, owing to its high electroactivity and good processability. The well-defined tetraaniline deposited graphene was optimized by investigating the effects of the kinds of graphene, fabrication methods, and the feeding ratios between the two components. The symmetric supercapacitors based on the optimized one (TA-rPGO) via the one-step mixed self-assembly of TA in presence of porous expandable graphene oxide (PGO) possessed specific capacitance of 85.6 F/g, energy density of 7.9 Wh/kg, and power density of 87.6 W/kg at 0.10 A/g respectively, with excellent flexibility and cycling stability.
