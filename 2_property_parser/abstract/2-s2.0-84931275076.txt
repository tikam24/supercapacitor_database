One-dimensional flexible supercapacitor yarns are of considerable interest for future wearable electronics. The bottleneck in this field is how to develop devices of high energy and power density, by using economically viable materials and scalable fabrication technologies. Here we report a hierarchical graphene-metallic textile composite electrode concept to address this challenge. The hierarchical composite electrodes consist of low-cost graphene sheets immobilized on the surface of Ni-coated cotton yarns, which are fabricated by highly scalable electroless deposition of Ni and electrochemical deposition of graphene on commercial cotton yarns. Remarkably, the volumetric energy density and power density of the all solid-state supercapacitor yarn made of one pair of these composite electrodes are 6.1mWh cm-3 and 1,400 mW cm-3, respectively. In addition, this SC yarn is lightweight, highly flexible, strong, durable in life cycle and bending fatigue tests, and integratable into various wearable electronic devices.
