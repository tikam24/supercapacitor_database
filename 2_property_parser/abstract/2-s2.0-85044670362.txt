The graphene-AgVO3 nanocomposites (GA30) were synthesized by facile one-step chemical-bath method. SEM and TEM images of the synthesized nanocomposites indicate that this method is possible to anchor the AgVO3 nanoparticles onto the graphene surface. Galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) shows that specific capacitance, cycle stability, and rate capability of the supercapacitor device can be enhanced with AgVO3 incorporation. The GA30 shows a high energy density of 10 Wh/kg at a power density of 25 W/kg as well as a high power density of 2045 W/kg at an energy density of 6 Wh/kg, which are much higher than those of graphene/activated carbon composites (GC30) and previous reported graphene-based composites. The improvement in specific capacitance, cycle stability, energy density and powder density of the graphene would be attributed to the special microstructure with high-rate transportation of both electrolyte ions and electrons due to the incorporation of AgVO3.
