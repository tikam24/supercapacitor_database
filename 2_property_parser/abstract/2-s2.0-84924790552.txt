Due to their exceptional flexibility and transparency, CVD graphene films have been regarded as an ideal replacement of indium tin oxide for transparent electrodes, especially in applications where electronic devices may be subjected to large tensile strain. However, the search for a desirable combination of stretchability and electrochemical performance of such devices remains a huge challenge. Here, we demonstrate the implementation of a laminated ultrathin CVD graphene film as a stretchable and transparent electrode for supercapacitors. Transferred and buckled on PDMS substrates by a prestraininig-then-buckling strategy, the four-layer graphene film maintained its outstanding quality, as evidenced by Raman spectra. Optical transmittance of up to 72.9% at a wavelength of 550 nm and stretchability of 40% were achieved. As the tensile strain increased up to 40%, the specific capacitance showed no degradation and even increased slightly. Furthermore, the supercapacitor demonstrated excellent frequency capability with small time constants under stretching.
