In this study, we use a facile one-pot chemical method to prepare MoS2 and MoS2-graphene hybrid nanostructures. Structural formation is confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Furthermore, the refined d-spacing values using transmission electron micrograph for graphene and MoS2 are analyzed. The MoS2 and MoS2-graphene hybrid sheet based electrodes reveal a specific capacitance of 175 and 756 F·g−1, respectively, at 0.5 A·g−1, and the MoS2-graphene supercapacitor retains 88% of the primary capacitance after 10000 cycles. Pure MoS2 exhibits low performance with an electric double-layer capacitive behavior, whereas MoS2-graphene hybrid sheets demonstrate superior storage performance with a pseudo-electric double-layer capacitive behavior. The observed maximum energy density of the MoS2-graphene supercapacitor device is 26.6 Wh·kg−1 at a power density of 125 W·kg−1. The substantially enhanced electrochemical performance of MoS2-graphene hybrid sheets may be ascribed to the synergistic effects of MoS2 and graphene.
