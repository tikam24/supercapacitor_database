The paper discusses different components that are used to make a supercapacitor and optimizes different materials that can be chosen to make a supercapacitor with highest performance and longest life-cycle. Supercapacitors find application in many fields, including transportation, electronics industry and as power back-ups. Electric vehicles employ supercapacitors for providing peak power requirements during starting or acceleration, for capturing energy from regenerative braking or when it is required to frequently start vehicles during winters when temperatures are very low. A high productivity could be obtained from supercapacitors by winding the different cell components with a precise control of all the parameters. This work concentrates on the effect of materials such as the electrolyte, composition of carbon aerogel (CAG), type of current collector, binding agent and electrolyte on the performance of carbon aerogel supercapacitors.
