Abstract: Thermogravimetry and calorimetry in combination with mass spectroscopy, as well as X-ray diffraction, have been employed to study thermal transformations in mechanically activated MoO3/C, MnO2/C, Bi2O3/C, and V2O5/C systems, which are promising materials for electrodes of supercapacitors and ion batteries. It has been found that the crystalline structure of activated highly dispersed nanocomposites is stable up to 250–350°C depending on the nature of an oxide. Reactivity has been analyzed for “weakly bound” oxygen formed in different oxides due to reduction with carbon during mechanical activation. In the cases of МоО3 and MnO2, the onset temperature of oxide reduction with carbon is substantially decreased due to the lower temperatures of oxide decomposition with oxygen liberation as a result of the activation. The interactions of the mechanically activated oxides with carbon, aluminum, and CO have been compared. It has appeared that the presence of carbon decreases the temperature of MnO2 reduction, has almost no effect on the reaction rate in the cases of МоO3 and Bi2O3, and increases the temperature of V2O5 transformation.
