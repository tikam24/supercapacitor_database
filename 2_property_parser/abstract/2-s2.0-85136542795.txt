Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) materials have aroused tremendous attention and been used as electrochemically active materials. In this work, a new electrode material of nickel/ cobalt metal-organic frameworks (Ni/ Co-MOFs) was fabricated by a facile one-pot solvothermal reaction using 1, 3, 5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (H3BTC) as the organic ligand, and nickel chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2 ·6H2O) and cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O) as the central of metal ions. The microscopic morphology and structural composition of the Ni/ Co-MOFs sample were characterized by SEM, XRD, XPS and BET, and the electrochemical performances were tested by cyclic voltammetry, galvanosta-tic charging-discharging and electrochemical impedance spectra methods. The results indicate that the novel spherical Ni/ Co-MOFs is successful-ly fabricated. The prepared Ni/ Co-MOFs exhibits the specific capacitance of 779 F/ g at the current density of 0. 5 A/ g in 6 mol/L KOH electro-lyte, and the capacitance retention remains 79% after the current density increases to 5 A/ g. Furthermore, the asymmetric supercapacitor of Ni/ Co-MOFs椰AC assembled using Ni/ Co-MOFs as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode possesses the specific ca-pacitance of 107 F/ g at the current density of 0. 5 A/ g. The asymmetric supercapacitors device delivers a satisfied energy storage capacity with the energy density of 38 Wh/ kg at the power density of 400 W/ kg, and the desired cycling stability of 65. 71% after 10 000 cycles sequential char-ging-discharging. As such, it is believed that the prepared Ni/ Co-MOFs have potential applications as electrode materials in the energy storage devices.
