Polyaniline/sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (PANI/CMC) nanorods have been synthesized via in-situ oxidation polymerization of aniline in the presence of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose as a polymerization template. The structure and morphology of the nanorods are characterized by TEM, FE-SEM and XRD. The size and shape of the composite nanorods are uniform with a diameter of 100 nm. Their electrochemical properties are also investigated using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurement. The specific capacitance of PANI/CMC nanorods prepared with 20 wt% CMC can be as high as 451.25 F g -1. Its capacitance remains higher than 300 F g -1 after 1000 cycles at a current density of 1 A g -1. These novel nanorods are desirable for applications in supercapacitor devides. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.
