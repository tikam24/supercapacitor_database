A facile hydrothermal-assisted process without surfactant was developed to prepare hierarchical CuS clusters and novel CuS–thermal reduced graphene oxide (TRGO) composites as advanced electrodes. The preparation of TRGO was simple and efficient without protective atmosphere and reagent, and the CuS–TRGO composites were characterized by distributed CuS microspheres coated with TRGO carrier uniformly to improve the pseudocapacitance properties. Electrochemical performance of the electrode of CuS–TRGO composites was elucidated by utilizing cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy methods respectively. The electrode exhibited ultrahigh specific capacitance up to 1222.5 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 , good rate capability as well as excellent cycling stability with 92.11% capacitance retention after 3000 charge–discharge cycles at 5 A g −1 , which implied that the as-prepared CuS–TRGO could be a favorable and suitable electrode material as supercapacitors in energy storage.
