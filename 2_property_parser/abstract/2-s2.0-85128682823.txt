Zinc doped manganese dioxide nanoparticles (Zn = 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1 and 0.125 M) were prepared via a facile hydrothermal method. The prepared samples were analyzed using XRD and SEM/EDX. The capacitance behaviour of Zn doped MnO2 nanoparticles estimated by cyclic voltametry measurement. The XRD results revealed the tetragonal structure of bare and Zn doped MnO2 nanoparticles. The crystallite size ranged from 9.2 to 35.33 nm. SEM images exhibited the smooth surface and rod shape structure. The specific capacitance of Zn doped MnO2 nanoparticles was found to be 255F g−1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1.
