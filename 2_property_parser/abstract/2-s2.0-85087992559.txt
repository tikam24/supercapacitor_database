Areal capacitance is an important metrics for miniaturized capacitive energy storage devices due to the constraint of device area. In the present work, we proposed a free-standing hierarchical cobalt-doped Ni3S2 (Co-Ni3S2) nanorod arrays as a novel pseudocapacitive electrode to realize impressively high areal capacitance. With enhanced surface area donated by the introduction of cobalt, the Co-Ni3S2 nanorods exhibit an ultrahigh areal capacitance of 3.46 F cm-2 at 8 mA cm-2, which is more than three-fold over that of pristine Ni3S2. When coupled with an FeOOH anode, the fabricated Co-Ni3S2//FeOOH hybrid supercapacitor can deliver a large areal capacitance of 1.61 F cm-2, a peak energy density of 0.73 mW h cm-2, and a peak power density of 36.00 mW cm-2. Besides, the as-fabricated hybrid supercapacitor also exhibits stable capacitive performance (83.5% capacity retention after 5000 cycles). The advanced and stable Co-Ni3S2 electrode developed in this work is highly desirable for micro supercapacitor devices.
