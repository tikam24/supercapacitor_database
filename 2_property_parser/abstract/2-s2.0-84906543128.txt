Manganese phosphate nanosheets (Mn3(PO4) 2·3H2O NSs) with ∼2 nm thickness were prepared by exfoliating the bulk material in dimethylformamide (DMF) under ultrasonication. They can spontaneously form face-to-face stacked assemblies with exfoliated graphene NSs in DMF. The assemblied Mn3(PO 4)2·3H2O and graphene NSs at the mass ratio of 1:10 (M1G10) revealed a specific capacitance of 2086 F g-1 at 1 mV s-1. These M1G10 assemblies were used to fabricate all-solid-state supercapacitor (M 1G10-ASSS) on the basis of PVA/KOH solid polymer electrolytes, which exhibited a specific capacitance of 152 F g-1 (or 40 mF cm-2) at 0.5 A g-1, an energy density of 0.17 μWh cm-2 at 0.5 A g-1 (1.3 A m-2) and a power density of 46 μW cm-2 at 2 A g-1 (5.3 A m -2). M1G10-ASSS also showed excellent cycling stability and nearly 100% capacitance retention was achieved after 2000 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles at 2 A g-1. Such extraordinary properties were attributed to the synergistic effect of high pseudocapacitance of Mn3(PO4)2·3H2O NSs, high conductivity and surface areas of graphene NSs. © 2014 American Chemical Society.
