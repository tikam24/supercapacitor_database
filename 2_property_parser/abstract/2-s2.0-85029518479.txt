Developing vanadium based supercapacitor electrode materials with excellent rate capacity and cycling performance is still remaining as challenge towards their usefulness in advanced supercapacitor devices. In the present work, we have developed vanadium pentoxide (V2O5)/nitrogen containing mesoporous carbon spheres (n-MPC) nanocomposite without the use of expensive organic vanadium precursors and sophisticated instruments. The outcomes from different analytical investigations supporting well with the formation scheme of this hybrid material. Presence of n-MPC with V2O5 significantly enhances the conductivity and specific surface area. Commendably, V2O5/n-MPC electrode exhibit higher specific capacitance, good rate capacity and cyclic stability. This unique combination delivers specific capacitance as high as 487 Fg-1 at 0.5 Ag-1 and retains 410 Fg-1 at a higher current density of 10 Ag−1confirming its excellent rate performance. Further, this hybrid material show16% of capacitance fading up to 2000 charge-discharge cycles. Furthermore, a full cell supercapacitor assembled using V2O5/n-MPC electrode showing specific capacitance of 91 Fg-1 with an energy density of 12.8 WhKg−1. These attractive notable electrochemical features of V2O5/n-MPC nanocomposite confirm its usefulness towards advanced supercapacitor applications.
