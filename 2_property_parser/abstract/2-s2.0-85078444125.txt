This paper presents an hybrid energy storage system for the integration of renewable-based power plants in power networks. A hybrid energy storage system is defined as that able to integrate and maximize the contribution of a heterogeneous grouping of storage systems. The services which this hybrid solution is able to perform are identified and then related to a specific storage technology which have the best potential to solve the issues created by the intermittent renewable generation. The presented solution combines three different storage technologies, a lead-acid battery pack, a flywheel and a set of supercapacitors. The description of the system is complemented by a study case, for the performance analysis of the set of supercapacitors.
