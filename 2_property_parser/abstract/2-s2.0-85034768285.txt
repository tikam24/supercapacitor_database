The polyanion Li7V15O36(CO3) is a nanosized molecular cluster (≈1 nm in size), that has the potential to form an open host framework with a higher surface-to-bulk ratio than conventional transition metal oxide electrode materials. Herein, practical rechargeable Na-ion batteries and symmetric Li-ion batteries are demonstrated based on the polyoxovanadate Li7V15O36(CO3). The vanadium centers in {V15O36(CO3)} do not all have the same VIV/V redox potentials, which permits symmetric devices to be created from this material that exhibit battery-like energy density and supercapacitor-like power density. An ultrahigh specific power of 51.5 kW kg−1 at 100 A g−1 and a specific energy of 125 W h kg−1 can be achieved, along with a long cycling life (>500 cycles). Moreover, electrochemical and theoretical studies reveal that {V15O36(CO3)} also allows the transport of large cations, like Na+, and that it can serve as the cathode material for rechargeable Na-ion batteries with a high specific capacity of 240 mA h g−1 and a specific energy of 390 W h kg−1 for the full Na-ion battery. Finally, the polyoxometalate material from these electrochemical energy storage devices can be easily extracted from spent electrodes by simple treatment with water, providing a potential route to recycling of the redox active material.
