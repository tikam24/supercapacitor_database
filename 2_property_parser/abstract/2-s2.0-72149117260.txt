The Nisshinbo electric double layer supercapacitor called the "N's Cap" that uses an ionic liquid as the electrolyte is an excellent device with high voltage and high power. A "N's Cap" with a rated voltage of 3.0V was developed by increasing the rated voltage and by reducing the internal resistance to produce a high energy density and high power density. It is used for various applications. Investigations into the life process of "N's Cap" were done to assist into further its life. A life process was suggested that after the positive and negative potentials become noble during the float charge, the positive potential was at a more noble potential with a significant energy decrease in the capacitor. As a result, it was postulated to be effective for improving the life of the capacitor the oxidation was protected as oxygen was reduced, a negative substrate was made more corrosive resistant, and the gas generating during charge was controlled. Additionally, we present a storage module assembled with "N's Caps", its lineup, and some application examinations. Â© EVS-22 Yokohama, Japan.
