NiO/Ta 2O 5 nano-composite films have been investigated and determined to be a good electrochromic material as well as an electrochemical supercapacitor. Thin film nano-composites of polycrystalline nickel oxide and amorphous tantalum oxide have been deposited by reactive RF-magnetron sputtering in O 2 from a composite target. With increasing concentration of tantalum oxide, the specific capacitance of the composite material reaches a maximum at atomic ratio of Ta/Ni = 0.26, and then decreases with further increasing amount of tantalum oxide. TEM studies indicate that we have synthesized nano-sized polycrystalline particles of NiO embedded in an amorphous Ta 2O 5 matrix. These NiO/Ta 2O 5 nano-composite films exhibit an optical density change of 0.22 at 670 nm wavelength with capacitor-type charge/discharge properties in an anodic coloring fashion.
