The rapid development of lightweight and wearable devices requires electronic circuits possessing compact, high-efficiency, and long lifetime in very limited space. Alternating current (AC) line filters are usually tools for manipulating the surplus AC ripples for the operation of most common electronic devices. So far, only aluminum electrolytic capacitors (AECs) can be utilized for this target. However, the bulky volume in the electronic circuits and limited capacitances have long hindered the development of miniaturized and flexible electronics. In this work, a facile laser-assisted fabrication approach toward an in-plane micro-supercapacitor for AC line filtering based on graphene and conventional charge transfer salt heterostructure is reported. Specifically, the devices reach a phase angle of 73.2° at 120 Hz, a specific capacitance of 151 µF cm−2, and relaxation time constant of 0.32 ms at the characteristic frequency of 3056 Hz. Furthermore, the scan rate can reach up to 1000 V s−1. Moreover, the flexibility and stability of the micro-supercapacitors are tested in gel electrolyte H2SO4/PVA, and the capacitance of micro-supercapacitors retain a stability over 98% after 10 000 cycles. Thus, such micro-supercapacitors with excellent electrochemical performance can be almost compared with the AECs and will be the next-generation capacitors for AC line filters.
