The one-step synthesis of porous carbon nanoflakes possessing a 3D texture is achieved by cooking (carbonization) a mixture containing two condiments, sodium glutamate (SG) and sodium chloride, which are commonly used in kitchens. The prepared 3D porous carbons are composed of interconnected carbon nanoflakes and possess instinct heteroatom doping such as nitrogen and oxygen, which furnishes the electrochemical activity. The combination of micropores and mesopores with 3D configurations facilitates persistent and fast ion transport and shorten diffusion pathways for high-performance supercapacitor applications. Sodium glutamate carbonized at 800 Â°C exhibits high charge storage capacity with a specific capacitance of 320 F g<sup>-1</sup> in 6 m KOH at a current density of 1 A g<sup>-1</sup> and good stability over 10 000 cycles. The one-step synthesis of porous carbon nanoflakes possessing a 3D texture is achieved by the thermal treatment of sodium glutamate with sodium chloride, and employed for high-performance supercapacitor electrode materials.
