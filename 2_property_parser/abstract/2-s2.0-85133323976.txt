In the large-scale production of flexible supercapacitors, given the poor interface stability and the low mass loading of functional films on the fiber electrode, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and constant current (CC) electrodeposition methods were adopted to prepare polypyrrole/multi-walled carbon nanotubes (PPy/MWCNTs) on the surface of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) carbon cloth to explore the optimization process. The surface morphology and structural properties of the flexible electrode were characterized, and the electrical and electrochemical properties were studied. The research indicated that the PPy/MWCNTs were uniformly distributed on the fiber surface in the form of a linear structure and were amorphous and rich in carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen functional groups. A higher deposition current density helped improve the degree of coating of the MWCNTs with PPy and the number of oxygen-containing functional groups. The electrical and electrochemical properties of the flexible electrode prepared using the CC method were excellent; the electrochemical properties of the samples in the bent state were not significantly different from those in the straightened state. Using CC and CV methods, the conductivities of the samples were 32.4 S cm−1 and 24.1 S cm−1, the area-specific capacitance values were C 96.24 mF cm−2 and 46.18 mF cm−2 at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, the equivalent series resistance Rs values were 2.74 Ω and 4.67 Ω, the specific capacitance retention rates were 94.4% and 88.3% after 1000 cycles, and the capacitance retention rates were 89.7% and 80.6% after 5000 cycles, respectively. The differences in the performances of the flexible electrodes using the same preparation solvent and different preparation processes were due to the higher deposition current density of the CC method compared with that of CV. The former enhanced the polymerization degree of the PPy/MWCNT flexible electrode and improved the electrochemical performance. The presented research results are significant for the optimization of large-scale production processes.
