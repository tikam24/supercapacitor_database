Layered molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has attracted increasing attention for supercapacitors in recent years because of large specific surface area, appropriate interlayer distance, high theoretical specific capacitance and different oxidation states of Mo (+2 to +6). However, the active sites of MoS2 are limited to the edges but the basal plane is low activity and MoS2 is easy to gather during the charging and discharging process, which lead to the decline of energy storage performance. Introduction of defects into MoS2 can optimize the intrinsic properties to increase active sites and boost conductivity, achieving the excellent electrochemical performances. The aim of this paper is to briefly review the progress of defect engineering of MoS2-based materials as supercapacitors electrode. The energy storage mechanism of supercapacitors has been emphasized firstly, and then preparation methods, characterization techniques, and roles of defects have been summarized and analyzed. Furthermore, this review mainly focuses on recent advancements in the synthesis and electrochemical properties of defective MoS2 as electrode material for supercapacitors. The researches have shown the defective MoS2 is constructed by metal doping, nonmetal doping, and intrinsic defects, which can increase active sites, improve the conductivity, and enhance ion transport ability, obtaining excellent energy storage performance. Finally, prospects and challenges of defect engineering of MoS2 in the fields of energy storage are proposed.
