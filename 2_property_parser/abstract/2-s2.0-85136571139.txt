Supercapattery a high-performance energy storage device, it is a combo of best rate capability and outstanding power density of supercapacitor and the high energy density of the battery. Herein, an electrode's material for supercapattery is synthesized by blending two substantial that are PANI, the best-conducting polymer and Zn3(PO4)2 (zinc phosphate). The blending of these two into one another greatly enhances the performance of the device which can be depicted via the electrochemical characterization. The blend of an equal amount of Zn3(PO4)2 and PANI demonstrate the significant boost in specific capacity from 43.52 to 118.63 C/g depicted by CV and GCD. To examine the real-time performance of Zn3(PO4)2/PANI: 50/50% electrode, supercapattery is assembled using activated carbon as negative electrode material. The assembled device exhibits a power density of 2550 W/kg and an energy density of 25.16 Wh/kg with the capacity retention of approx. 20% after 1500 charge-discharge cycles. The EIS measurements performed after a month showed the excellent stability of the device. Hence, Zn3(PO4)2/PANI composites with optimized weightage can be utilized as a novel electrode material for supercapattery device applications.
