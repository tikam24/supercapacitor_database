Three-dimensional, hierarchically ordered, porous carbon (HOPC) with designed porous textures, serving as an ion-buffering reservoir, an ion-transport channel, and a charge-storage material, is expected to be advanced an energy material for high-rate supercapacitors. Herein, HOPC without/with partially graphitic nanostructures have been directly synthesized by means of a simple one-pot synthesis procedure. The designed porous textures of the 3D HOPC materials are composed of highly ordered, fcc macroporous (300 nm), interconnected porous structures, including macroporous windows (170 nm), hexagonally ordered mesopores (5.0 nm), and useful micropores (1.2 nm). 3D HOPC-g-1000 (g=graphitic, 1000=pyrolysis temperature of 1000 °C) with partially graphitic nanostructures has a low specific surface area (296 m 2 g-1) and a low gravimetric specific capacitance (73.4 F g-1 at 3 mV s-1), but improved electrical conductivity, better rate performance, higher electrolyte accessibility (24.8 μF cm -2 at 3 mV s-1), faster frequency response (≈1 Hz), and excellent cycling performance (>5400 cycles). The specific capacitance per surface area is higher than that of conventional porous carbons, carbon nanotubes, and modified graphene (10-19 μF cm-2). Open up! A three-dimensional hierarchically-ordered porous carbon with partially graphitic nanostructure has been designed, fabricated, and explored as a supercapacitor electrode (see picture). The macropores, interconnected porous structures, and meso/micropores are used as ion-buffering reservoirs, ion-transport channels, and charge-storage materials, respectively, and are expected to be advanced energy materials for high-rate supercapacitors. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
