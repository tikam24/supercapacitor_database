Supercapacitors are the modern-day state-of-the-art energy storing devices based on the electrochemical conversion principles. The supercapacitors are portrayed as energy-storing devices analogous to batteries and fuel cells. The supercapacitors, however, differ in the characteristics and hence are dedicated for diverse applications. The supercapacitors comprise five components in its configuration, namely, electrode, electrolyte, separator, current collector, and sealants. The two main characteristic components of the supercapacitor on which most of the properties are determined to include electrode and electrolytes. The electrode and electrolyte perform the fundamental operations in supercapacitors. This chapter is dedicated toward the electrolytes that are essential for supercapacitors in terms of operating potential and their applicability. The supercapacitor fundamentals along with different types of electrolytes are discussed along with their properties.
