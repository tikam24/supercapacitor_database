Freestanding two dimensional (2D) porous nanostructures have great potential in electrical energy storage. In the present work, we reported the first synthesis of two-dimensional (2D) β-Ni(OH)2 thin sheets (CQU-Chen-Ni-O-H-1) assembled by 3D nanoflake array as basic building units under acid condition by direct hydrothermal decomposition of the mixed solution of nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)2) and acetic acid (CH3COOH, AA). The unique 3D nanoflake array assembled mesoporous 2D structures endow the thin sheets with a high specific capacitance of 1.78 F cm−2 (1747.5 F g−1) at the current density of 1.02 mA cm−2 and good rate capability of 67.4% retain from 1.02 to 10.2 mA cm−2. The corresponding assembled asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) achieves (CQU-Chen-Ni-O-H-1//active carbon (AC)) a high voltage of 1.8 V and an energy density of 23.45 W h kg−1 with a maximum power density of 9 kW kg−1, as well as cycability with 93.6% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles. These results show the mesoporous thin sheets have great potential for SCs and other energy storage devices.
