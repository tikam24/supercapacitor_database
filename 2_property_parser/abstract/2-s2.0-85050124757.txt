Dempster-Shafer theory(DST) is based on probabilistic approach. It includes the hypothetical approach towards the matters. It obeys the rules of probabilities and possibilities. It represents the truth behind the output of multiple choice. This paper includes the evidence of the rating of battery charging and discharging with the mass of Indian classical musical notations. The mass of eachnotation is hypothetical to be the evidence of ratings of battery charging and discharging. In hybrid storage system Super capacitors are backbone for the batteries which provides the charge to the batteries in emergency but the way how to manage the charge in the hybrid storage is more important towards system efficiency concern. In this paper, this phenomenon is used for electrical vehicles like E-bicycle, E-moped and E-bus.
