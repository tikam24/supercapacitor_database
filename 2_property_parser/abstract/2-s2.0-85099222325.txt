A vacancy-ordered MXene, Mo1.33CTz, obtained from the selective etching of Al and Sc from the parent i-MAX phase (Mo2/3Sc1/3)2AlC has previously shown excellent properties for supercapacitor applications. Attempts to synthesize the same MXene from another precursor, (Mo2/3Y1/3)2AlC, have not been able to match its forerunner. Herein, we show that the use of an AlY2.3 alloy instead of elemental Al and Y for the synthesis of (Mo2/3Y1/3)2AlC i-MAX, results in a close to 70% increase in sample purity due to the suppression of the main secondary phase, Mo3Al2C. Furthermore, through a modified etching procedure, we obtain a Mo1.33CTz MXene of high structural quality and improve the yield by a factor of 6 compared to our previous efforts. Free-standing films show high volumetric (1308 F cm-3) and gravimetric (436 F g-1) capacitances and a high stability (98% retention) at the level of, or even beyond, those reported for the Mo1.33CTz MXene produced from the Sc-based i-MAX. These results are of importance for the realization of high quality MXenes through use of more abundant elements (Y vs. Sc), while also reducing waste (impurity) material and facilitating the synthesis of a high-performance material for applications.
