Low-cost and efficient heteroatom-doped porous carbon materials play an important role in the development of high-performance supercapacitors. Phenolic resin based foam insulation board containing nitrogen and oxygen elements, is 'Zero' cost raw materials for preparing efficient porous carbon. In this work, porous carbon for electrode material of supercapacitor was prepared from waste phenolic resin insulation board by chemical activation method. The results show that the optimum conditions of electrochemical performance are as follows: KOH activator, alkali-carbon mass ratio 2:1, activation temperature 600 ℃, activation time 2 h. The structures of porous carbon with high specific surface area of 960 m2/g are mainly micropores and mesopores under such circumstance. XRD and Raman analyses show that the graphitization degree of porous carbon is low, and its structure is mainly amorphous. What's more, through XPS and FTIR nitrogen and oxygen elements are detected in porous carbon. In the three-electrode 3 mol/L KOH aqueous solution test system, with the voltage window was -1-0 V and the current density was 0.5 A /g, the mass ratio capacitance of porous carbon can be as high as 315 F/g.Meanwhile, the capacitance retention and coulomb efficiency of the symmetric supercapacitor are still close to 100% after 20 000 cycles at the current density of 4 A/g. At the high current density of 15 A/g, the energy density of 27.1 Wh•kg-1 and the power density of 7 100 W•kg-1 were measured by the symmetric two-electrode system. Compared with other simple carbon materials, the porous carbon of waste phenolic resin insulation board shows better electrochemical performance.
