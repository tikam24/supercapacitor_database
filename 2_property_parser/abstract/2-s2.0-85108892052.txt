In this study, α Borophene as a two-dimensional nanomaterial was prepared via a facile and low-cost ultrasonic exfoliation. Zeta potential profile showed that the prepared α borophene has sufficient electrostatic repulsion to achieve good physical stability. Randomly grown Polyaniline (PANI): α borophene nano network electrode was prepared on Ni foam substrate. Electrochemical performance of PANI: α borophene was investigated. The electrochemical measurements reveal that the specific capacitance of the PANI: α borophene electrode was 960 Fg-1 with the capacitance retention of 95% after 1000 cycles. α Borophene enhanced the capacitive performance of PANI. PANI: α borophene is a promising material with high specific capacity and good stability for supercapacitors.
