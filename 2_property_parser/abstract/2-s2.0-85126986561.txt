Textile-based supercapacitors are ideal energy supply equipment for intelligent wearable products. Apart from the further enhanced energy storage property, the poor bending resistance and air permeability also compromise their electrochemical performance in practical use. Based on traditional textile technology, the supercapacitors woven by fibrous electrodes promise to combine both electrochemical and wearable performances. Herein, the carbon fiber-based Ni-Fe double hydroxide electrode (NiFe@NiFeDH/CF) with uniform morphology has been obtained through a facile route of palladium-free electroless plating coupled electrooxidation. By controlling Fe2+ content in the plating baths, the interwoven nanosheets with small intervals and large crystal spacing could be designed, which provided low diffusion resistance for electrolyte ions and adequate active sites for energy storage. Subsequently, the all-solid-state asymmetric textile supercapacitors (wSC-NF//CY) were fabricated by weaving techniques with NiFe@NiFeDH/CF as positive electrode and carbon yarns as the negative electrode. Benefit from the better electrochemical property of NiFe@NiFeDH/CF, the wSC-NF//CY owned unexpected excellent energy storage performance that at the power density of 9.0 W cm−2 the energy density could reach 26.8 mW h cm−2. Additionally, with the help of fabric structure, the wSC-NF//CY could be integrated into different materials to accommodate curved human bodies or other non-flat surfaces. Moreover, the NiFe@NiFeDH/CF could also be used to decolorize sewage with an electro-Fenton reaction under a small voltage. Thus, this work constituted a breakthrough on multifunctional energy storage materials and their eco-friendly and sustainable usage.
