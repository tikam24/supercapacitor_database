Manganese oxide graphene nanocomposites (G-MnOx) as advanced supercapacitors are described in this work. The synergistic combination of a pseudocapacitor (PC) such as manganese oxide and an electrochemical double layer capacitor (EDLC) such as graphene, functionalized graphene and doped graphene into a nanocomposite yields higher power density and energy density compared to the pure material, and bridges the gap between pure EDLC and PC. The synthetic methods such as hydrothermal process, solvothermal process, electrodeposition and self-assembly process are critical for the preparation of high quality G-MnOx nanocomposites, with high surface area and low particle aggregation, which yields higher power density and energy density.
