NiS hollow spheres were synthesized directly on the surface of Ni foam (NiS@NF) at room temperature via a simple electrodeposition in a KOH/thiourea solution without any Ni precursors. Morphological analysis revealed the formation of NiS hollow spheres, which consisted of nanoparticles. The NiS@NF nanocomposite exhibited a very high specific capacitance of 1553 F g−1 (2.64 F cm−2) at a current density of 2.35 A g−1 (4 mA cm−2) in 6 M KOH electrolyte. The NiS@NF nanocomposite also demonstrated excellent cycling stability (95.7% specific capacitance retention after 2000 cycles).
