Activated carbons (ACs) have been prepared from chemical treatment of walnut shells (WS) precursor at various temperatures (400‒800 °C) by using phosphoric acid (H3PO4) as activating agent. Influence of activation temperature on the porosity development and capacitive properties of resulting carbons was investigated. Thermal post-treatment of carbons previously activated at moderate temperature, e.g. 400 °C allowed further structural and porosity modification. Then, these carbons were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, electrochemical techniques and low temperature nitrogen adsorption exhibiting high BET specific surface area of approximately 2100 m2 g-1 and a total pore volume up to 1.3 cm3 g-1. Carbon material obtained through activation by H3PO4 at 400 °C and post-treated at 800 °C was used to make electrodes which were implemented to realize AC/AC capacitor using 1 mol L-1 Li2SO4. The electrochemical capacitor demonstrated high capacitance of 123 F g-1 per mass of one electrode, reduced cell resistance and stable capacitance for 5000 galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles at 1.0 A g-1.
