This paper presents an improved, all-textile, hybrid energy storage device for e-textile applications. Comprised of a textile secondary zinc ion battery connected in parallel with textile supercapacitors, this study investigates an improved configuration of these components and the impact on maximum energy and power densities while maintaining a small footprint. The proposed hybrid energy storage system with one textile battery and two identical supercapacitors achieved a stored energy capacity of 95.1 Î¼Wh at 1 mA.cm-2 discharge current between 1.9 V and 0.9 V.
