Polypyrrole (PPy) has high electrochemical activity and low cost, so it has great application prospects in wearable supercapacitors. Herein, we have successfully prepared polypyrrole/reduced graphene oxide (PPy/rGO) nanocomposite cotton fabric (NCF) by chemical polymerization, which exhibits splendid electrochemical performance compared with the individual. The addition of rGO can block the deformation of PPy caused by the expansion and contraction. The as-prepared PPy-0.5/rGO NCF electrode exhibits the brilliant specific capacitance (9300 mF cm-2 at 1 mA cm-2) and the capacitance retention with 94.47% after 10 000 cycles. At the same time, the superior capacitance stability under different bending conditions and reuse capability have been achieved. All-solid-state supercapacitor has high energy density of 167 Î¼Wh cm-2 with a power density of 1.20 mW cm-2. Therefore, the PPy-0.5/rGO NCF electrode has a broad application prospect in high-performance flexible supercapacitor fabric electrode.
