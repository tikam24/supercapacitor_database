Graphene, the last representative of sp<sup>2</sup> carbon materials, has been an ideal material platform for constructing flexible electronic devices. Exploring a new method to fabricate high-quality graphene films with a more porous structure is a key for flexible electronic devices to achieve higher performance. A flexible solid-state supercapacitor based on a 3-dimentional graphene film electrode is fabricated via filtration and laser irradiation method. The fabricated films with excellent mechanical properties display high electrical conductivity (8.53 Î©) and improved electrochemical performance (185 F g<sup>-1</sup>). This 3-dimensional film is freestanding, which can thus be used directly as supercapacitor electrodes without external current collectors or binders that are often used in commercial supercapacitors. Moreover, the films maintain excellent electrochemical properties under high stress and thus hold promise for being widely used in various energy storage devices.
