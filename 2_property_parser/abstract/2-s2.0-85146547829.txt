Flexible fiber-shaped supercapacitors attracted extensive attention in next-generation wearable, portable, and multifunctional electronic devices, owing to the advantages of miniature size, flexibility, and lightweight. Whereas, the restrained surface area of fibers and low energy density is undesirable for performance enhancement. This study reports an innovative method to prepare a hierarchically nanostructured porous film as a current collector by dynamic hydrogen bubble template electro-deposition method. For the first time, we fabricated Co(OH)2 nanosheets and NiCo LDH nanoworms on porous 3D-Ni coated Cu–Ni wires by simple, and low-cost electrochemical deposition methods. Benefiting from this unique structure, the electrode delivers a high capacitance of 996 F g–1 under the current density of 1 A g–1. Importantly, the capacitance increased to 1420.22 F g–1 (at 6 A g–1) after 3000 cycles of galvanostatic charging–discharging with remarkable cycling stability (169.33% after 3000 cycles), a remarkable maximal energy density of 28.58 Wh kg–1 at a power density of 0.227 kW kg− 1. This unique design provides a new direction in the development of flexible fiber-shaped energy storage devices.
