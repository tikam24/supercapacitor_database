Carbon materials were regarded as ideal electrode materials for supercapacitors due to their reasonable price, high conductivity, large pore size, high specific surface area and high chemical stability. To apply these properties to high-performance supercapacitors, it is essential to develop manufacturing methods that preparing electrodes with adjustable pore structure and high heteroatom doping level from appropriate carbon sources. Here, taking the advantages of threonine protic ionic liquids, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and H3BO3, a N/B co-doped hierarchically porous carbon material was successfully fabricated. During the process of preparing carbon materials, CTAB and H3BO3 were used as heteroatoms source and pore-forming agents. The properties of carbon materials such as porous structure features and heteroatom doping level can be tuned by controlling the additive amount and proportions of CTAB/H3BO3 composite precursor. By optimal condition, the as-prepared Thr-C0.1-B demonstrates a high capacitance (242 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), while after 10,000 cycles of stability tests, the capacitance retention rate is up to 96%. In addition, the assembled symmetrical supercapacitor deliver energy density and power density of 5.1 Wh kg−1 and 249 W kg−1 in alkaline electrolyte.
