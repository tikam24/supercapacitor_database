Fabrication of supercapacitor (SC) electrodes plays a vital role in enhancing the electrochemical performance of SCs. Conventional fabrication techniques have limitations in fabricating the complex SC electrodes. The three-dimensional (3D) printing technique has several advantages over conventional manufacturing techniques that includes patterning capability, contact-less high-resolution, controlled material deposition, design flexibility, and multi-material compatibility. Due to these excellent qualities, considerable research efforts have been made in developing 3D printed SC electrodes. This review offers a literature update on the recent printing materials employed and the design aspects in making of SC electrodes. It also discusses the impact of critical parameters involved in various techniques of 3D printing of electrodes. Finally, the paper concludes with the scope and challenges in material/manufacturing of electrodes and the performance comparative analysis of various 3D printed structures.
