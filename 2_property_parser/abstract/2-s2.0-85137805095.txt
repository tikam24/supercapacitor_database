The application of new energy sources on ships has received increasing attention. Wind turbines and photovoltaic power generation systems are greatly affected by the conditions of the ship's maritime navigation. Therefore, the stable power supply to the load has become the key to energy management. When a new ship travels in the ocean, the external environment is unpredictable and the environment is changeable, and the efficiency of the ship's new energy power generation will also be affected. In order to match the power of new energy electric power generation with the power required by the actual load of the ship, a reasonable new energy ship management system is required to reasonably allocate the power of different energy sources. In this paper, the energy management strategy of wind turbines, photovoltaic power generation and super capacitors under different wind speeds and light conditions is based on the maximum power point tracking based on particle swarm algorithm to ensure that different energy sources work in a reasonable range and increase the power generation of new energy sources. efficiency and the endurance of new energy ships.
