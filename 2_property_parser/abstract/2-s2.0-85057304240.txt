Nowadays it has become a prime need to find alternative sources for generating electricity due to the extensive scarcity of energy. Lead Zirconate Titanate materials are one such alternative source having piezoelectric property where mechanical energy can be converted into electrical energy due to pressure. Present work aims at harvesting electrical energy by human footsteps and the smart use of these type material properties in public gathering situations for efficient generation of electricity. In this research paper, piezoelectric sensor is implanted beneath the shoe to harvest electricity from the vibrations produced due to any human movement that also can be stored in super capacitors for later use. This power generation technique for minor needs is more sustainable, economic and ecological than other existing systems.
