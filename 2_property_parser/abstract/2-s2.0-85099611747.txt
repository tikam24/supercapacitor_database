So far, there are still some difficulties in controlling the pore structure of porous carbon materials. Exploring the relationship between the structure and electrochemical behavior of porous carbon through optimizing pore structure is of great significance for its application in the field of energy storage.Here, we employ the interpenetrating polymer networks as the precursor to prepare ultra-microporous carbon with a pore diameter of 0.6 nm, and regulate the mesoporous content by chemical activation. The relationship between mesoporosity and electrochemical performance was studied. In our experimental results, the optimized sample has a mesoporous ratio of 55.1% and the specific surface area of 2453 m2g−1. As electrode material, its specific capacity reaches 247F g−1with excellent cycle performance. As the symmetric device, its specific energy reached 17.75Wh kg−1.
