Currently there is tremendous interest in supported metal single atom (MSA) materials owing to their remarkable performance in many fields. Typically MSA materials are prepared by co-precipitation or pyrolysis methods, and can be highly variable in terms of the spatial distribution of MSA sites created. Herein, we report a new method, quenching, as an effective synthetic strategy for loading MSA sites onto nanostructured supports. As a proof of concept, a hot α-Fe2O3@CNT fiber (CNT = carbon nanotube) was quenched rapidly by immersion in an aqueous solution of SnCl4at 4 °C, to yield a fiber uniformly decorated with Sn single atoms (Sn-Fe2O3@CNT fiber). The resulting Sn-Fe2O3@CNT fiber electrode exhibits outstanding performance, offering a capacitance of 391.32 mF cm−2at 0.24 mA cm−2, which is more than 1.5 times that of the α-Fe2O3@CNT fiber. Moreover, an all-solid-state fiber-shaped supercapacitor consisting of a Sn-Fe2O3@CNT fiber negative electrode and a MnO2@CNT fiber positive electrode affords a very high areal capacitance of 105.68 mF cm−2and an exceptional energy density of 6.09 mW h cm−3. The surface quenching strategy is expected to be widely applicable for the synthesis of MSA functionalized materials, thus opening up new avenues for energy and catalysis research.
