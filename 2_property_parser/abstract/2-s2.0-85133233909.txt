The demand for energy is increasing on a daily basis. The utilization of waste energy as reusable energy of human foot power is very relevant and important. On the other hand, many energy resources are being depleted and squandered. It will generate electrical force when people walk around it. The power generation of piezoelectric transducers is organized in a planned circuit alongside various parts that are connected in series under a mechanical design. The observing circuit is constrained by a customized Arduino Uno. These electrical charges will be stored in a super capacitor and can be used in low-power applications. The value of the DC voltmeter will be displayed on the LCD. This experiment yielded the most cost-effective solution.
