With the rapid popularization of electronic products and portable devices, multifunctional integrated devices which can integrate many functions in one device and miniaturize their volume, are constantly evolving in recent years. Herein, four kinds of planar devices namely micro-supercapacitors, pressure sensor, photodetector and gas sensor were modularly manufactured, all with the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) encapsulated poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) [P(VDF-TrFE)] (PVDF) nanofibers (NFs) as the functional materials. They were integrated into a single pixel to form a self-powered multifunctional electronic skin system, where the micro-supercapacitors could drive the three sensors to detect the change of the environment conditions and physiological signs of health, like the functions of human skins and sense organs. The technology is quite simple and efficient, which can in principle be scaled-up to fabricate more compact and higher performance e-skins for applications in wearable electronics or bionics field.
