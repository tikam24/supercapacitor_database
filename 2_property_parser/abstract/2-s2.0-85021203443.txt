Substantial effort has been devoted to endowing flexible and wearable supercapacitors with desirable functions and solving urgent concerns regarding their practical application, particularly materials selection, air permeability, self-healability, shape memory, integration, and modularization. This gives rise to challenges with regard to both suitable materials and device fabrication. This review highlights the current state-of-The-Art of these supercapacitors pertinent to materials, fabrication strategies, and performance. Challenges and solutions are also discussed to further improve their practicality. The aim of this review is to make a timely summary of this emerging field and discuss future opportunities and challenges.
