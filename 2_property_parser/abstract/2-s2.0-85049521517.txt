In pursuit of high specific capacitance and high energy density; morphology, specific surface area and conductivity of electrode material are key factors. In this context, Ni1-xMgxCo2O4@C (x = 0.0, 0.5) nanostructures are synthesized via facile hydrothermal route using the cotton template. Notably; the morphology altered from flowers to rods with the incorporation of cotton templates. Additionally, Mg dopant ion helps to attain greater electrical conductivity while preventing the morphology. Besides, Influence of Mg doping on the pseudocapacitance of NiCo2O4 electrode was investigated by electrochemical analysis in 6 M KOH electrolyte. This remarkable synergy display superb electrochemical performance for Ni0.5Mg0.5Co2O4@C rods, i.e a high specific capacitance of 1340 Fg-1 at a current density of 1 Ag-1 and admirable cyclic stability of âˆ¼97% up to 2000 charge-discharge cycles (at 15 Ag-1). Further, the proposed Ni0.5Mg0.5Co2O4@C rods electrode delivered high values of energy (59.5 Wh/Kg) & power (799.2 W/Kg) densities at a current density of 1 Ag-1, which is 2 times more as compared to flowers structured material. This can be attributed to increase in the specific surface area with more porous nature of rods. This work conveys the deeper understanding of the morphology and chemical composition effect on the supercapcitive performance of Ni0.5Mg0.5Co2O4@C. Thus, Ni0.5Mg0.5Co2O4@C (NMCo@C) rods may be an excellent electrode material for high-performance supercapacitor due to its exceptional electrochemical performances.
