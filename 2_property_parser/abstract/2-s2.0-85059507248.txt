In this study, three-dimensional glucose/graphene-based aerogels (G/GAs) were synthesized using the hydrothermal reduction and CO2 activation method. Graphene oxide (GO) was used as a matrix, and glucose was used as a binder for the orientation of the GO morphology in an aqueous media. We determined that G/GAs exhibited narrow mesopore size distribution, a high surface area (763 m2 g-1), and hierarchical macroporous and mesoporous structures. These features contributed to G/GAs being promising adsorbents for the removal of CO2 (76.5 mg g-1 at 298 K), CH4 (16.8 mg g-1 at 298 K), and H2 (12.1 mg g-1 at 77 K). G/GAs presented excellent electrochemical performance, featuring a high specific capacitance of 305.5 F g-1 at 1 A g-1, and good cyclic stability of 98.5% retention after 10,000 consecutive charge-discharge cycles at 10 A g-1. This study provided an efficient approach for preparing graphene aerogels exhibiting hierarchical porosity for gas adsorption and supercapacitors.
