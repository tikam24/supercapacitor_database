As the importance of the improvement of energy efficiency is constantly increasing, a study has been done on the implementation of an energy storage system, to improve load efficiency, on the railway which has relatively large regenerative energy. The pre-existing regenerative energy not only has a low efficiency but also increases the catenary, which has a possibility to create problems in the electrical device voltage, during the regeneration process. In this paper, the improvement of the efficiency and stabilization of the catenary voltage by the implementation of an energy storage device is being discussed. The composition of the interface, control strategy and reduced railway model for simulation are being proposed.
