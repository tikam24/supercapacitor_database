Lignocellulosic biomass can be used as a suitable basic material for producing activated carbon for use as a supercapacitor cell electrode, due to the high specific surface area, adjustable pore structure, chemical stability, electrical conductivity, and environmentally friendly. Lignocellulosic biomass of areca midrib (AM) is the first biomass to be used as a carbon electrode of a supercapacitor cell carbon without an adhesive material. AM is processed into self-adhesive carbon grains (SACG). Furthermore, SACG is chemically activated with potassium hydroxide (KOH) activator with varying concentrations 0.1 M, 0.2 M, and 0.3 M for get green monolith, before carbonization with N2 gas at 600°C and physical activation with CO2 gas at 700°C to produce carbon monolith electrodes for supercapacitor applications. X-ray diffraction and N2 isothermal methods to determine physical properties of carbon electrodes, while cyclic voltammetry method to determine electrochemical properties of supercapacitor cells. The results of the microstructure analysis showed the Areca carbon midrib electrode has a semicrystalline structure, indicated by the presence of (002) and (100) hkl planes at an angle of 2θ about 24° and 44°, while the highest heap height (Lc) value was produced at a concentration of 0.2 M (carbon electrodes AM-02). The results of isothermal gas N2 and electrochemical properties analysis show that carbon electrodes AM-02 have the highest specific surface area (SSA) and specific capacitance (Csp) of 654.729 m2/g and 142 F/g, respectively. Based on research results, it was shown that the AM-02 had a better potential as an energy storage device for supercapacitor applications than the AM-01 and AM-03 samples.
