Due to controlling CO2 emissions and climate changes from the burning of fossil fuels, the growing renewable energy storage systems are the most crucial tasks for power application. Supercapacitors have gained extensive concentration as green energy storage systems from their rapid charge-discharge, superb power density, inexpensive, less weight, and good long-term stability. However, the large-scale application of supercapacitors is hindered from their low energy density and low stability in strong alkaline solutions. Therefore, it is essential to construct new electrode materials with excellent capacitive and long-term durability. In the past few decades, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been acknowledged as potential porous crystalline materials for energy application ascribed to their large surface area, superb porosity and convenient surface structures. MOFs are also played as excellent carbon sources to achieve highly porous carbon materials. Therefore, in the present review, the modern developments of MOFs-derived porous carbons for supercapacitors are presented in detail. Especially, we focused on the discussion about the preparation of porous carbon from Zn and Al-based MOFs and their noteworthy impact in the supercapacitors applications. At last, we discussed the current challenges and further prospects for the developing MOF-derived carbon materials in order to develop high-performance energy storage devices.
