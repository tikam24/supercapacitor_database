While wind and solar generation has increased dramatically over the past decade, there has been a much larger increase in gas generation (eia, 2019). This is driven in part by low gas prices but also in part by how electricity markets are organized. The intermittent nature of wind and solar generation increases the need for more flexible and reliable generation; a role gas plants fill well. However, current market structures and rules unfairly tip the balance in their favor compared to energy storage systems. They have created market barriers restrictive enough to prevent market participation of a technology key to a 100 % renewable grid: supercapacitors. Adjusting markets to remove the market barriers to supercapacitor and other energy storage systems will allow for increased renewable penetration while simultaneously improving grid performance and reducing costs.
