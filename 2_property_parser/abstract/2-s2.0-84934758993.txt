This article presents the application of carbon nanotube thin films and their composites for supercapacitors. CNT thin films were produced through a continuous floating catalytic chemical vapor deposition and Ni(OH)2/CNT composite films were prepared via a facile electrochemical deposition. Though small amounts of impurities consisting of deformed CNT entanglements still remain inside films, the composites achieved a good electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance over 1200Fg-1. More importantly, due to the good electrical conductivity and mechanical rigidity of CNT films, their capability of replacing traditional current collectors effectively reduces electrode weight. To our best knowledge, it is the first report on the CNT films for supercapacitor applications based on a continuous fabrication technique.
