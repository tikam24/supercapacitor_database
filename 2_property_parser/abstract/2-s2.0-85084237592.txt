Super capacitors have emerged as a new link to bridge the gap between batteries and conventional capacitors. In the present study, an electrochemical double layer capacitor (EDLC) was fabricated and its performance was evaluated. The novelty of the investigation is use of Sri Lankan natural rubber (NR) and natural graphite (NG) for the electrolyte and electrodes respectively. Cyclic voltammetry test, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic charge discharge test were the characterization techniques used in the study. Single electrode specific capacity depends on the potential window of cycling and the scan rate. Capacitive properties become dominant at low frequency regions.
