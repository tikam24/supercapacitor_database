Supercapacitors (SC) are promising energy storage devices with higher power density, quick charge/discharge ability, long life, higher temperature range, etc. Compared to lithium-ion batteries, SCs can charge within few seconds on providing high current. While charging with a higher current, the supercapacitors show charge redistribution, which will accelerate the self-discharge rate. This paper focuses on the charge redistribution effect with different charging methods such as constant current-constant voltage (CC-CV) charging and constant current (CC) Charging. An experimental analysis is carried out using 3000F, 360F, and 480F supercapacitors of different manufacturers to validate the charge redistribution performance of the SC.
