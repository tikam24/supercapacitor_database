• Supercapacitor (SC) inner resistance, in particular, that for Yunasko devices is close to low limit and can further be reduced by a factor of 2 at the most. • Still the lowest resistance values are important since they imply high efficiency (hence, low heat generation and improved safety) and low RC-constant (hence, grid frequency regulation). • Higher operating temperature (about 100 °C) and higher rated voltage (about 3 V) are good challenges, and they are in Yunasko R&D portfolio today. Since the SC energy density is limited by 5-8 W.h/kg, hybrid devices can become a good choice when the larger energy density is critical while a shorter cycle life can be accepted (up to 37 Wh/kg and 10'000 full charge-discharge cycles in Yunasko technology today). Along with the discussion of possible SC performance limits, the most recent Yunasko SC modules, their performance and possible applications will also be presented.
