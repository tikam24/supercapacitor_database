Currently, development of efficient binary composite electrode materials is a dire need to overcome the energy crises globally. Determent to increase the capacitance of supercapacitor, TiS2, MoS2 and TiS2/MoS2 composites are synthesized by hydrothermal technique and their growth mechanism is also proposed. The structural and morphological properties of the grown materials were examined by employing SEM, EDS, XRD and TEM techniques. In synthesized hierarchal micro-flowers composite the nano-sheets are evenly distributed on the spherical surface improving the surface porosity and surface area resulting enhancement in the electrons and ions transfer on the TiS2/MoS2 surface. The TiS2/MoS2 composite based electrode exhibited significantly improved specific capacitance (709 F/g) in contrast to individual TiS2 (480 F/g) and MoS2 (402 F/g) owing to their fast ion transfer, numerous active sites on their high surface area and robust synergistic effect. Additionally, after 4000 cycles, more than 91 % capacitance was sustained for TiS2/MoS2 composite indicating their excellent stability. Consequently, TiS2/MoS2 binary metal sulfide composites with enhanced specific capacitance and significantly extended cycle life validating their potential applications in high-performance energy storage devices.
