The current development of fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles is facing many technical challenges, evolving the power sources, the power electronic configuration, the energy management strategy, and the control techniques. Among these challenges rises the optimal sizing issue as fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle efficiency is highly dependent on the on-board energy storage system. Thus, this paper focuses on the optimal sizing of the hybrid energy storage systems by considering the energy management strategy based on frequency separation. Best solutions are computed for different load profiles through a multi-objective grey wolf optimizer. Then, the obtained results are presented and discussed.
