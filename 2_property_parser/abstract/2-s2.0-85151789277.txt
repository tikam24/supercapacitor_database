Conductive polymers have attracted intense interest as electrode materials in supercapacitors, especially the flexible ones with graphene-based frameworks. To improve the electrochemical performance, a four-pronged approach was developed here, by efficient fabricating poly(1,5-diaminoanthraquinone) grafted holey N-doped graphene (PDAA-HNrGO) via a solvothermal graft polymerization of 1,5-diaminoanthraquinone (DAA) onto holey N-doped graphene oxide (HNGO) following with reduction. Holey N-doped expandable graphene oxide (HNEGO) was oxidatively cut into smaller HNGO with more functional groups under the solvothermal condition, favoring the graft polymerization. Owing to the unique architecture, the proposed PDAA-HNrGO/rEGO electrodes possessed excellent electrochemical property, especially the cycling stability. The flexible symmetric solid-state supercapacitors (SSSCs) possessed a capacitance of 320 mF cm−2, power density of 275.6 mW cm−2 and energy density of 28.4 mWh cm−2 at 0.50 mA cm−2, with superior capacitance retention of 96% after 10,000 CV cycles.
