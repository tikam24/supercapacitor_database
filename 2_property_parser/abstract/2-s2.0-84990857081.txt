Activated carbon fibers (ACFs) produced from recycled fir sawdust were used as electrodes in supercapacitors. It was shown that the ultramicropores (0.65–0.85 nm) were most efficient in contributing to the supercapacitor capacitance, while mesopores helped increase the rate performance capacitance. The experimental ACF electrode supercapacitor indicated a capacitance of 242 F g−1 in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte exhibiting a high energy density of 8.4 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 250 W kg−1. Excellent cycle stability was also achieved, showing a good competitiveness of wood-based ACFs in comparison with other activated carbons currently used in supercapacitors.
