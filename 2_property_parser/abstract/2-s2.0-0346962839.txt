Electrochemically prepared poly(methyl)thiophene is characterized by cyclic voltammetry and galvanometry with an activated carbon counter-electrode. It is then used as a cathode in a laminated plastic asymmetric hybrid electrochemical device with a nano-structured Li4Ti5O 12 anode. This device displays the specific power of a supercapacitor, with a higher specific energy of 10 Wh/kg, and better cycle-life than a Li-ion battery. The matching ratio of the active materials was found to strongly influence cycle-life. Â© 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
