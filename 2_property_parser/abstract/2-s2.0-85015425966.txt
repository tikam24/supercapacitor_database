In this work, a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) comprising of ultra-capacitor and battery is proposed for smoothing oscillating power from wave energy conversion system (WECS). Using generated power data from an installed wave energy converter (WEC), each component of the proposed HESS is sized to optimize the cost of the energy storage. A control scheme is designed to regulate the power into battery and ultra-capacitor to deliver smoothed average power to the grid. Energy storage minimizes the grid side converter (GSC) rating and also improves the stability of the grid by not injecting the oscillating power. The control scheme is verified through MATLAB simulation using the power data from field with maximum power reaching around 500-kW and a combination of available ultra-capacitors and batteries. An experimental validation of the control scheme is presented with an ultra-capacitor based energy storage system in a grid-connected wave energy conversion system (WECS) with an induction motor emulating as WEC to drive an induction generator.
