In this study, we reported a facile two-step reduction method to prepare a high-quality graphene with intact structure. Hydroxyl group is acquired by utilizing LiAlH4 to reduce the oxygen-containing functional groups in GO. Then it is further reduced by ethanethiol/aluminum trichloride (Et-SH/AlCl3) to obtain graphene. The results of Infrared and XPS showed that the prepared graphene material (rGO2) has been reduced completely and had structural integrity. Besides, the conductivity of rGO2 obtained can reach 2.632 * 103 S mâˆ’1, which is higher than that obtained by general chemical reduction method and high temperature reduction method. Investigated as a potential material for supercapacitors, the as-prepared graphene reveals excellent electrochemical properties, including good rate capability and cycling stability, which mainly benefits from its intact structural characteristics.
