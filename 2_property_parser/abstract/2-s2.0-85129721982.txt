In the present study, activated carbon is synthesized by combining banana peel (BP) and ZnCl2 at high temperature for the first time, and the existing catalyst (Zn@BP) is used as a dual function both in hydrogen production and in supercapacitor application. In methanolysis experiments, optimum conditions are determined based on the maximum hydrogen generation rate (HGR). Methanolysis experiments are performed in the presence of different parameters, such as different H3PO4 concentrations, different ZnCl2 concentrations, different carbonization temperatures, and different carbonization times. Thus, in the presence of Zn@BP catalyst, the maximum HGR value is recorded as 43,665 mLmin−1gcat−1 (Experimental conditions: catalyst amount: 100 mg, NaBH4 concentration: 2.5%, temperature: 30 °C, H3PO4 concentration: 40%, ZnCl2 concentration: 30%, carbonization temperature: 700 °C, and carbonization time: 40 min.). Zn@BP catalyst with maximum HGR value is used as an electrode in supercapacitor applications. The specific capacitance value of the electrode is determined as 223.98 F/g for 1 A/g. Furthermore, the Zn@BP catalyst is characterized structurally and morphologically.
