In order to assess the dynamic performance of fuel cell only and fuel cell hybrid power train, the models of fuel cell and other energy storage such as battery, supercapacitor have been developed in Matlab/Simulink environment. The simulation results demonstrate that, with the same power management strategy and the same hybrid structure in fuel cell hybrid powertrain, fuel cell/supercapacitor hybrid powertrain has the best dynamic performance, whereas fuel cell/battery hybrid powertrain has preferable performance in a long term. Among these three fuel cell powertrains, fuel cell only powertrain is insufficient when the power demand is sharply increased.
