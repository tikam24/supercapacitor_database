Reports on the events and activities to take place during the IEEE VTS Motor Vehicles Challenge which will focus on combining energy management and component sizing multiobjective optimization problems for a multisource EV (see Figure 2). The participants will design the hybridization of a battery and supercapacitor based on commercial vehicle and cell models. Then, they will develop the realtime EMS to minimize the objective function of battery SOC, supercapacitor charge-sustaining, battery cell current rms value, and its variations.
