Aniline (Ani) and pyrrole (Py) based copolymers (poly(Ani-co-Py)) were fabricated by varying the reaction time ranging from 4 to 8 h through chemical oxidative polymerization technique. The photocatalytic performance and the application as supercapacitors of prepared copolymers were assessed together with the studies of their morphological features. The formation of poly(Ani-co-Py) copolymers was confirmed by FTIR, UV–Vis, and photo-luminescence (PL) spectroscopy. All the copolymers demonstrated almost similar morphology, like irregular, aggregated, and spherical-shaped structures, investigated by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Such morphology was different from the individual polymer of PANI (rod-like) and PPy (spherical) although diameters remained similar in the range of 50–200 nm for the homo and copolymers. The prepared copolymers showed excellent photocatalytic representation towards methylene blue (MB) degradation in comparison to the PANI and PPy. The supercapacitors fabricated using poly(Ani-co-Py) copolymers also showed promising prospects for the hybrid supercapacitor. These findings may provide a new insight to fabricate poly(Ani-co-Py) photocatalysts for organic pollutants treatment as well as may have potential prospects for supercapacitor.
