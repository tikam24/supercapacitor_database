The different composites made of rGO, Ni-MOF, and PANI were synthesized via the hydrothermal method and used for the fabrication of electrodes for supercapacitors. The structure and morphology of composites obtained were characterized via SEM, XRD and FTIR. The electrochemical properties of electrodes were studied using CV and galvanostatic charge/discharge methods, as well as by EIS. The results obtained demonstrated that the incorporation of rGO, Ni-MOF and PANI significantly increase the specific capacitance of electrodes. It can be explained by the formation of a better specific surface area with a branched porous structure that enhances the contact between electrolyte ions with the electrode materials. The specific capacitance of rGO/NiMOF/PANI in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte is 195.14 F/g at 0.2 A/g charge-discharge and the average capacitance retention remained 79.78% after 5000 cycles at current density 1 A/g.
