Electrode materials design is the subject of intense research in the area of energy development and advancement. Recently, great attention has been paid to transition metal nitrides (TMNs) in supercapacitor application with regards to excellent conductivity and outstanding physicochemical properties endowed by their intrinsic structures and unique chemical bonding. Therefore, it is essential to methodically review the exploration and state-of-the-art modification of TMNs-based materials. The relationship between synthetic method, charge-storage mechanism, structural and compositional engineering of TMNs with improved supercapacitive performance is analyzed, which sheds light on the design and synthesis for next-generation electrical energy storage technologies. Current challenges, merits and loopholes of TMNs are discussed as well. Corresponding feasible research directions and future trends in full utilization of TMNs-based materials for high performance supercapacitors are also proposed.
