Tailored nanoarchitecture design is of great significance for the performance of supercapacitors, especially for heterostructure composites. Herein, we report a facile two-step hydrothermal strategy to prepare Co3O4@MnO2 nanocomposites, where the well-aligned Co3O4 nanograss array is capable of loading numerous and uniformly vertical MnO2 nanosheets that present an open structure of a nanoflower pattern. The microstructure of the nanograsses and nanoflower can be regulated by adjusting the hydrothermal process. The optimized Co3O4@MnO2 displays a Schlumbergera bridgesii-like nanostructure with a maximum specific capacitance of 5038.19 F g-1 as well as excellent capacity retention of as high as 97.48% after undergoing 5000 cycles at 10 A g-1. The assembled symmetric supercapacitor also exhibits a high energy density of 1467.23 Wh kg-1 and a maximum power density of 5500.07 W kg-1. This work provides a tunable strategy for the fabrication of heterostructure nanostructured composite for supercapacitor.
