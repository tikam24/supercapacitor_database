To increase the energy efficiency of traction elevators, the regenerative energy must be stored or fed back into the grid. The regenerative energy can be stored in batteries or supercapacitors using the appropriate DC/DC converter. In this paper, the DC/DC converter topologies typically used in supercapacitor-based energy storage systems for elevator applications are investigated. The requirements for the DC/DC converters are analyzed from two perspectives: elevator drive and supercapacitor bank. The performance of the most commonly used topologies is compared using simulation tests, and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed.
