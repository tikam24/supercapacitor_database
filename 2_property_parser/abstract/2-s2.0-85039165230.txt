Herein, we report the metallic 1 T phase MoS2 petal-like nanostructures (MP-LNs), synthesized by the solvothermal method, for applications in supercapacitor electrodes. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) verified the composition and distribution of Mo and S, illustrating that the 1 T metallic phase is predominant in the MP-LNs. Electrochemical analyses were performed to explore the supercapacitor applications of the MP-LN material, demonstrating a superior cyclic voltammetry (CV), high specific capacitance, good stability. MP-LN-based supercapacitors (MP-LNS) show high specific capacitances of 811 F/g and 400 F/g at current densities of 0.1 A/g and 10 A/g, respectively. The long-term cycling stability was also studied to investigate the reproducible nature of MP-LNS and was found to display excellent specific capacitance retention of 49.3% (at 0.1 A/g) and 82.7% (at 10 A/g) after 1000 charge-discharge cycles, which indicates good reversibility of the galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) of the electrode material. These findings highlight the potential use of MP-LNs in supercapacitors.
