Despite its important contribution to the overall series resistance of a supercapacitor, little attention has been directed towards improving the performance of the separator. The present research examines the use of a number of commercially available materials as separators, and characterizes their performance under temperature conditions ranging from room temperature to a simulated Arctic environment.
