All solidification is the only way for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) to achieve commercial application. At present, the intricate and expensive approaches such as vapor deposition used for DSSCs based on hole transport materials are unsuitable for the development of large-scale all-solid-state devices. Herein, a new avenue for the evolution of all solid-state DSSCs through dissolving the I−/I3− redox couple in commercial UV glue and then solidifying under UV light as electron transport materials is put forward. Not only does this device show superior stability (the power conversion efficiency (PCE) can be maintained more than 95% after 1000 h), but also an optimum PCE of 6.15% (short-circuit photocurrent density = 11.93 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage = 683 mV, fill factor = 0.75) is obtained. It must be the best choice for the future development of all-solid-state DSSC device.
