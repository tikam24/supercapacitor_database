Nanoporous metals are the of porous metal materials with pore sizes ranging from 0.1-100 nm. Because of its unique porous structure, high specific surface area, and high conductivity, nanoporous metals have wide applications in many fields. In this article, several common methods for preparing nanoporous metals are summarized, they are template method, dealloying method and electrochemical method. The dealloying method is mainly introduced, including the recent advances in liquid metal dealloying and gas phase dealloying. The development status and related research work of nanoporous metals in surface-enhanced Raman scattering, catalysis, and supercapacitor are detailed. Finally, through the discussion of the simulations and experiments of the mechanical properties of nanoporous metals,the research trends and main problems of the mechanical properties of nanoporous metals are analyzed. From now on, realizing the 3D performance of materials through microstructure will become the development trend of smart materials. Nanoporous metal is an important material microstructure, and the technology will develop more and more maturely in the future. In the future research of nanoporous metals, the following two directions will receive wide attention: using a prepared nanoporous metal as a template and using a cheaper alloy as a precursor.
