Abstract: It is demonstrated that charge/discharge characteristics of supercapacitors with electrodes made of porous carbon can be described using a simple equivalent scheme with fixed values of capacities and resistances. Results of numerical modeling show that there is a relationship between the parameters of equivalent scheme and structure of pores in the electrode material. The results also indicate that there is an inhomogeneous character of charging for various groups of pores in electrode material of the supercapacitor structure.
