MnCo 2 O 4 nanosheets and FeMn 2 O 4 nanospheres were synthesized using a hydrothermal method. Choline chloride was used as the capping agent during the preparation of the nanoparticles. XRD patterns confirmed the spinel structure of MnCo 2 O 4 and FeMn 2 O 4 . XPS measurements were used to determine the oxidation state of the prepared spinel metal oxides. HRTEM images revealed the formation of hexagonal nanosheets of MnCo 2 O 4 and nanospheres of FeMn 2 O 4 . Electrochemical measurements were made for both positive and negative electrodes using three electrode systems. MnCo 2 O 4 Exhibits 282C g −1 and FeMn 2 O 4 yields 110C g −1 at a specific current of 1 A g −1 . Hybrid supercapacitor device was fabricated using MnCo 2 O 4 as the positive and FeMn 2 O 4 as the negative electrode material. The hybrid supercapacitor device was delivered a maximum power of 37.57 kW kg −1 .
