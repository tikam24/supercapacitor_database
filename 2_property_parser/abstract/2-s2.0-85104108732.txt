Energy storage is recognized as a potential solution to alleviate the impacts of inertia reduction and intermittency due to the integration of inverter based renewable energy sources (RES) in power systems. Out of various rapid responsive energy storage technologies, supercapacitor energy storage (SCES) is the most promising technology for synthetic inertia support. Because the SCES has high power density, very small response time, and large cycle life. In this paper, a dynamic derivative-droop control strategy is developed for SCES to provide the synthetic inertia in low inertia power system. The proposed strategy overcomes the limitations of separately applied derivative and droop controls. In addition, the use of time varying gains (referred as dynamic) instead of fixed gains improves the performance compared to derivative-droop coordinated control. Different types of events are created at different penetration levels of RES to test the robustness of the proposed control. A comparison, based on RoCoF and frequency nadir, between the derivative, droop, derivative-droop coordinated and the proposed controls is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.
