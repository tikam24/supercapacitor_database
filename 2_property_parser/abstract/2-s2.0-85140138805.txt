The NiCo2S4/nickel foam composite electrodes have been fabricated by cyclic voltammetric deposition of NiCo2S4 arrays on nickel foam, and the supercapacitor performance of the composite electrodes has been investigated. The results show that the electrode with 5 deposition cycles has the highest supercapacitor performance. It achieves a specific capacitance of 2244.8 F/g at current density of 1 A/g; it still has a capacitance retention rate of 66 % and a Coulombic efficiency of 99 % after 1000 cycles of charge/discharge.
