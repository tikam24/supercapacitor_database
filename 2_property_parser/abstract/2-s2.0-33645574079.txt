A bidirectional DC-DC converter for supercapacitor-based energy storage systems in advanced electric vehicles is proposed in this letter. This converter consists of a half-bridge and current-fed push-pull circuit linked with a high frequency transformer, which is well applicable to the low voltage/high current charge and discharge of the supercapacitor. The experimental results of the prototype system prove the effective properties of the proposed topology in terms of a low device-conduction loss and a low switching surge.
