Though new generation organic electronic devices have evolved from mere scientific perceptions to real-life marketed applications, considerably less research attention has been focused on n-type or electron transporting small molecule semiconductors. The present study is focused on the exploration of structural, thermal, electrochemical, electrical, and optical properties of two pyrene-based chalcones: PC1 and PC2, synthesized through Claisen Schmidt condensation reaction. The chalcones displayed good thermal stability and wide bandgap n-type semiconducting behaviour with high charge carrier concentration and dielectric constant. The experimental evidences including fluorescence measurements, nanoaggregate size, and morphology analysis, supported by DFT calculations and molecular dynamic simulations advocated the intramolecular charge transfer and aggregation-induced enhanced emission features of the molecules. Successful fabrication of a diode in combination with the current-voltage characteristics established the candidature of PC1 and PC2 for electro-optical devices. The dielectric studies were performed to measure dielectric constant and AC conductivity at different frequency ranges. The cyclic voltammetry and AC impedance response of PC2 differed from PC1 due to the inclusion of a fluorine atom in the molecular scaffold. Further, the functional implication of PC2 as an electrode material was explored by constructing a supercapacitor, which offered a specific capacitance of 220 Fg-1 at a scan rate of 10 mV sâˆ’1. Moreover, these chalcone-based organic semiconductors displayed high thermal and charge carrier concentration as well as compatibility with other layers in an OLED device. Hence PC1/PC2 can be further investigated as dopants along with other emissive layers as host materials in OLEDs.
