Ultrathin flexible supercapacitors (UF-SCs) are highly desired for powering electronic skin devices. Most of current UF-SCs require electrochemically inactive substrates and binders to load electro-active materials, which limit the volumetric capacitance and stability of these UF-SCs. Herein, we report an all-polymer UF-SC based on conductive polypyrrole (PPy) film, which is constructed by the dynamic network formed by rigid PPy (~90 wt%) and soft polyethylene glycol (PEG, only 10 wt%) through supramolecular interactions. The network structure can effectively dissipate the destructive energy during mechanical or electrochemical deformation, making the PPy film strong and robust; and also helps to maximize the utilization of PPy, enabling the PPy film better electric conductivity and electrochemical capacitance than conventional PPy materials. After systematic optimization, we found the PEG600-PPy as the optimal electrode material, which can serve as electroactive material, current collector, and mechanical support simultaneously. Therefore, without using any substrate or current collector, these high-performance PEG600-PPy films can be directly used as electrodes for making all-polymer UF-SC. With high volumetric capacitance (547 F/cm3), outstanding mechanical and electrochemical stability, our all-polymer UF-SC (~80 Î¼m in thickness, thinner than a piece of A4 paper) is a promising power device for electronic skin devices.
