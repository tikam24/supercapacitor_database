Two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin molybdenum dichalcogenides MoS2 has gained a great deal of attention in energy conversion and storage applications because of its unique morphology and property. The 2D MoS2 nanosheets provide a high specific surface area, 2D charge channel, sub-nanometer thickness, and high conductivity, which lead to high electrochemical performances for energy storage devices. In this paper, an overview of properties and synthetic methods of MoS2 nanosheets for applications of supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries is introduced. Different phases triangle prismatic 2H and metallic octahedral 1T structured MoS2 were characterized using various analytical techniques. Preparation methods were focused on top-down and bottom-up approaches, including mechanical exfoliation, chemical intercalation and exfoliation, liquid phase exfoliation by the direct sonication, electrochemical intercalation exfoliation, microwave-assisted exfoliation, mechanical ball-milling, and hydrothermal synthesis. In addition, recent applications of supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries using MoS2 electrode materials are discussed.
