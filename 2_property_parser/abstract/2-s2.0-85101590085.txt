Rational hybrid structure consisting of multiple components with unique functions is a promising and challenging strategy for developing high-performance supercapacitor electrode materials. In this work, the composites composed of Bi12NiO19 (BNO) micro-sheets grown on graphene oxide (GO) have been successfully prepared via one-step electroless deposition approach. In virtue of the decent conductivity and 2D structure of GO carrier, the incorporation has a momentous effect on morphologies and electrochemical properties of BNO. As anticipated, as-prepared BNO/GO-2 based electrode owns higher gravimetric specific capacity (925.4 C g−1) compared with bare BNO-3 (744.3 C g−1) based electrodes at current density of 1.0 A g−1. The BNO/GO-2 exhibits a wide voltage window (−0.9 to +0.2 V), which allows the configuration of two-electrode asymmetric supercapacitor device by combining with Ni(OH)2. The asymmetric device achieves a specific energy value of 80.8 Wh kg−1 at specific power of 993.4 W kg−1. The results above indicate that as-prepared BNO/GO composites are believed as feasible electrode materials for supercapacitor.
