A series of heteroatom doped ordered mesoporous carbons (HOMCs) such as ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC), nitrogen doped ordered mesoporous carbons (NOMC), phosphorus doped ordered mesoporous carbons (POMCs), and nitrogen and phosphorus co-doped ordered mesoporous carbon (NPOMC) were synthesized via a chemical vapor deposition nanocasting (CVD nanocasting) route using SBA-15 as the template at 800 Â°C for high-performance supercapacitor. The formation of the template and HOMCs were confirmed by various physicochemical characterization techniques such as XRD, RAMAN, BET, SEM-EDAX, HR-TEM and XPS. The magnetic properties of prepared HOMCs were measured. Also, the electrochemical properties of HOMCs were evaluated using electrochemical analyses such as CV, EIS and GCD in 1 M H2SO4 medium. Among the various prepared HOMCs, sample NPOMC showed a high specific capacitance of 355 Fg-1 at a current density of 0.5 Ag-1 due to the heteroatoms. Moreover, the symmetric device fabricated using NPOMC exhibited 98% columbic efficiency with 98% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles at 2 Ag-1 current density.
