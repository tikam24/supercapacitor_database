The development of reliable and low-cost energy storage systems is of considerable value in using renewable and clean energy sources, and exploring advanced electrodes with high reversible capacity, excellent rate performance, and long cycling life for Li/Na/Zn-ion batteries and supercapacitors is the key problem. Particularly because of their diverse structure, high specific surface area, and adjustable redox activity, electrically conductive metalâ€“organic frameworks (c-MOFs) are considered promising candidates for these electrochemical applications, and a detailed overview of the recent progress of c-MOFs for electrochemical energy storage and their intrinsic energy storage mechanism helps realize a comprehensive and systematic understanding of this progress and further achieve highly efficient energy storage and conversion. Herein, the chemical structure of c-MOFs and their conductive mechanism are first introduced. Subsequently, a comprehensive summarization of the current applications of c-MOFs in energy storage systems, namely supercapacitors, LIBs, SIBs, and ZIBs, is presented. Finally, the prospects and challenges of c-MOFs toward much higher-performance energy storage devices are presented, which should illuminate the future scientific research and practical applications of c-MOFs in energy storage fields.
