In the paper selected aspects of applications of the commercial supercapacitors modules were discussed. Advantages and disadvantages of the supercapacitors modules usage against the usage of the separate supercapacitors were also described. Authors presented the results of tests of the four modules battery with 500F/16V capacity, connected in the serial-parallel manner. The application of the DC/DC converters as the output voltage stabilizers and two selected projects were described as well.
