Electrochemical synthesis is used to obtained a number of composite materials (CMs) consisting of different layers of reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (RGONS) and polyaniline (PAni) coatings of different thickness synthesized on these layers. Ranges of PAniâ€“RGONS weight content, at which the maximum values of capacity are reached, are determined. CM samples with high C values demonstrated higher stability in the course of electrochemical studies.
