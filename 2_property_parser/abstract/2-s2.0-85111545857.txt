Recently, some scientific communities have begun to consider more critically what should be carried out to maintain natural resources and control energy consumption. Energy storage systems can performance a crucial part in a diverse range of manufacturing usages and bulk energy storage systems. High reliability, specific energy, superior power, and acceptable safety are regarded as the significant criteria of these systems, as mentioned earlier. There is a fast demand for flexible energy storage devices due to the swiftly developing business for flexible electronics. Flexible supercapacitors are unanimously introduced as a promising energy storage technology because of their favorable features like high capability, easy fabrication, fast charge/discharge rate, lightweight, environmentally friendly, long lifecycle times, and being flexible. The flexible electrode plays a vital role in a flexible supercapacitor. Carbon materials such as one-dimensional (1D) carbon nanotubes (CNTs), two-dimensional (2D) graphene are significant flexible electrode material for flexible supercapacitors owing to their extensive surface area and high electrochemical stability. In this chapter, we first detailed a general overview of the energy storage system. We summarized capacitors modeling, including thermal modeling, self-discharge, fractional-order models, intelligent models, and equivalent circuit models. Then, structural, electric double-layer, pseudocapacitors, and hybrid capacitors and industrial applications of capacitors.
