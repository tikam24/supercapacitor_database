A type of hierarchical porous carbon material was prepared using a Schiff-base network as the precursor and ZnCl2 as the activation agent, and their electrochemical performances were investigated in acid and alkaline aqueous solutions, respectively. The as-prepared materials have high surface areas, appropriate distributions of hierarchical pore sizes, and various forms of nitrogen/oxygen derivatives. These structural advantages guarantee the outstanding performances of such carbon materials as electrodes for supercapacitors, which include high specific capacitances, fast current responses, and high cycling stabilities.
