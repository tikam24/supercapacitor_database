Graphene has gathered attention in the recent era of research owing to a novel one-atom-thick plane sheet corresponding to the sp2 hybridized carbon atom packed within the lattice honeycomb. Various efforts are undertaken to develop advanced electrochemical sensor and supercapacitor based on graphene finally leading to influence the strategies for assays toward the multiple target molecules. A few methods are recommended for electrochemical assay in the form of synthesis approaches. There are various features necessary for the selection of methods to synthesize graphene sheets, namely defects related to sheets, expenses, edge of sheet, modification, technique, compatibility, electrical conductivity, and so on. It is believed that with the advent of literature related to graphene, many more advantages of it for electrochemical analysis and supercapacitor can be generated and put into use. In general, the facts to be considered in selecting a synthesis method are the cost effectiveness, defects of sheets, edge of sheets, number of chemical modifications, electrical conductivity, and compatibility of the formed graphene. In this chapter, an overview of electrochemical sensing and supercapacitors along with the properties of graphene material are discussed along with the role of graphene for various sensing approaches. In addition, we provide an overview of the electrochemical sensing applications with the use of graphene-based materials in different sensing protocols.
