This paper presents a novel DC/DC converter for hybrid energy storage system (HESS) in DC microgrids. The proposed converter contributes to significantly reduce the component ratings, cost and size of the conventional HESS converters by using the multi-level, interleaved structure. The multi-level structure helps decrease the ratings and cost of power semiconductor and inductor; whereas the interleaved structure enables the replacement of bulky electrolytic capacitors using film capacitors, which substantially enhances converter reliability. Furthermore, the proposed converter allows the independent control of battery and supercapacitor energy storage. Its performance is verified by simulation results.
