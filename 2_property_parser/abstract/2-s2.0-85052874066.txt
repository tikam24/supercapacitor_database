Ni(OH)2 is recognized as a good electrode material for supercapacitors, but it suffers from capacitance decrease with repeated cycles at high current density. To enhance its electrochemical performance even at high current density, a newer two dimensional molybdenum diselenide – nickel hydroxide nanohybrid (2D MoSe2-Ni(OH)2) have been prepared by a simple one-step hydrothermal synthesis. The 2D MoSe2-Ni(OH)2 nanohybrid have an excellent electrochemical properties due to their synergistic effect. This 2D-2D hybrid electrode exhibits a higher specific capacitance of 1175 F g−1 than Ni(OH)2 nanosheets (933 F g−1) at 1 A g−1 and also maintains a high rate capability of 85.6% at 10 A g−1. In addition, the 2D MoSe2-Ni(OH)2 nanohybrid based asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is fabricated and provides a high energy density of 43 Wh kg−1, high power density of 8181 W kg−1 with the capacitance retention of 85% even after 5000 cycles at a high current density of 1 A g−1. When two ASC devices are assembled in series and then charged for 1 min, gives power to light-emitting-diode for more than 3 min suggesting the great significant of the prepared 2D MoSe2-Ni(OH)2 nanohybrid for excellent energy storage.
