Cubic spinel MnFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles were synthesized using a simple hydrothermal method followed by post-annealing. The effects of the reaction temperature on the crystallinity, morphology, and electrochemical performance were studied. The reaction temperature played an important role in the synthesis of highly crystalline MnFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles. At low reaction temperatures (<160 °C), the synthesized product contained a secondary inactive Fe 2 O 3 phase as well as MnFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles. In contrast, pure MnFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles were obtained at temperatures above 180 °C. Furthermore, the crystallinity of the MnFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles was enhanced significantly by increasing the reaction temperature to 200 °C. The cubic spinel MnFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles synthesized at 200 °C delivered a maximum specific capacitance of 282.4 F g −1 at a current density of 0.5 A g −1 in a 2 M aqueous KOH solution, and exhibited long-term cyclic stability of 85.8% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles. This was attributed to the cubic spinel ferrite nanocrystallite particles not only providing the more active sites for OH − ion diffusion but also reducing the path lengths for OH − ion diffusion. These results show that the synthesized MnFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles are promising candidates for pseudocapacitors and other electrochemical applications.
