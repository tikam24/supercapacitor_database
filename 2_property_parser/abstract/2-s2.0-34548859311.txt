Activated carbons were prepared from petroleum cokes by the method of pre-oxidation then steam activation. The structures of activated carbons were characterized by XRD and BET measurements. The electrochemical properties of activated carbons used as electrodes of supercapacitor were also investigated by constant current cycling method. It was found that the activity of activated carbons was extremely accelerated by pre-oxidation of air. The surface area and specific capacitance of activated carbons were 299.7 m2/g and 78 F/g, respectively, which were dramatically increased compared to the sample without oxidation by air before activation. Meanwhile, the activity of petroleum coke was greatly affected by the structure of petroleum coke. The petroleum coke with optical textures of small mosaics and small crystals is the most suitable material to form activated carbon.
