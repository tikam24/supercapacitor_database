The present work focuses on the in-situ electrodeposition of crispy flake-like sulphur decorated elongated cuboctahedron shaped Mn3O4 (i-S/Mn3O4) over the copper foil to serve as the supercapacitor electrode and its electrochemical performance is compared with pristine S, Mn3O4, and layered S/Mn3O4 composite (l-S/Mn3O4) coated electrode. The crystallinity, morphology, and elemental composition of the electrodeposited active materials are evaluated through X-ray diffraction pattern, field emission scanning electron microscopic images, and energy dispersive X-ray spectra, respectively. The electrochemical behaviors of the prepared electrodes are investigated in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte where the i-S/Mn3O4 electrode system exhibits relatively high specific capacitance of 1595 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 compared to other systems owing to the novel architecture. Further, symmetric type supercapacitor is fabricated using the i-S/Mn3O4 electrodes and display 1.06 V as output which discharges for 4.69 min after charging it for 1 min using 9 V battery.
