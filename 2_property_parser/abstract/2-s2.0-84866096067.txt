Reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) paper is easily synthesized by a flame-induced reduction of graphene oxide (GO) paper under ambient conditions. The X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscope results confirm the effectivity of the flame-induced reduction. The resulting r-GO paper has a high surface area of 274.9 m2 g-1 and contains a certain amount of oxygen-containing groups. Electrochemical behaviors of the electrode built with the r-GO paper are investigated in two kinds of electrolytes, 2 M KOH aqueous solution and 1 M Et4NBF4-acetonitrile solution, respectively. The results show that the high values of the specific capacitance for the r-GO can be obtained in both electrolytes, which reach 212 and 160 F g-1 at the same current density of 1 A g-1 respectively. Also, the r-GO-based electrode and supercapacitor exhibits stable cycling performance. The good capacitive performances in KOH aqueous electrolyte are due to the high surface area and the remaining oxygen containing groups of the r-GO paper. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
