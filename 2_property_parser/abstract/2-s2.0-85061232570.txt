The work describes the synthesis of the 2D[Mn(H2O)2(Fc(PHOO)2)â‹…2H2O]n using manganese nitrate. The energy of Li-Fc interaction has been estimated quantum-chemically. It was shown that substituent on the Cp ring do not prevent such interactions. Thus, one can expect that the coordination polymers (CPs) under study can be used for Li-ion batteries.
