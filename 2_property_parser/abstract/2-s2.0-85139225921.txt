We consider a strategy to improve the basic characteristics of hybrid supercapacitors by sequentially modifying electrode materials and electrolytes. The cathode was fabricated by converting Na4Co3P4O15 in situ to the Co(OH)2/CoO(OH) nanoforms in an alkaline electrolyte. Electrochemical tests have shown additional possibilities to increase the specific capacity of electrodes using a combined alkaline electrolyte 1 M KOH + 0.1 M K3[Fe(CN)6]. Low-cost commercial carbon was used as the anode material, which has been subsequently activated by KOH at 850 °C (Ar atmosphere). This treatment has allowed increasing the porosity and surface area of carbon from 937.2 to 1441.2 m2⋅g−1, and electrochemical capacity from 58 to 101.2 F⋅g−1. The assembled hybrid supercapacitor demonstrates significant specific energy of 42 W⋅h⋅kg−1 with a power density of 400 W⋅kg−1 and has a good stability of cycle life (retains more than 78.3% capacity after 5000 charge–discharge cycles). The proposed technological routes can improve supercapacitors in the energy sector.
