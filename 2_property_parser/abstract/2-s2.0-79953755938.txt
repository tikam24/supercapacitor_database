The in-situ electropolymerized-polyaniline(PANI) film (thickness: 5~10 Î¼m) on SS (stainless steel) doped with various conterions ClO4-, SO42-, NO3-, BF4-, p-toluenesulfonate (TsO-) etc. was prepared. SEM(scanning electron microscopy) morphologies showed that different doping conterions have great impact on the morphology of electropolymerized PANI film, various morphologies and microstructures of porous, particle and fibrillar were observed. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of PANI-SS electrodes showed that the electropolymerized-polyaniline doped with SO42- (PANI-SO4) and ClO4- (PANI-ClO4) electrodes have more specific capacitance. Galvanostatic charge-discharge tests indicated that the specific capacitance of electropolymerized-PANI doped with different ions at a current density of 2.0 A/g was 645.6, 468.3, 345.8, 275.6, 218.6 F/g, respectively. However, after 1000 cycles, about 48% and 23% specific capacitance loss for PANI-SO4 and PANI-ClO4- were observed, indicating that the PANI-SO4 electrode was much stable than the PANI-ClO4- electrode.
