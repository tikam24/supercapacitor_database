Rambutan-like NiCo2O4 hierarchical architectures have been fabricated effectively by facile chemical bath deposition and subsequent thermal annealing free of any template and surfactant. The corresponding formation mechanism has also been investigated by continuously controlling the reaction conditions. Supercapacitors assembled with the as-synthesized rambutan-like NiCo2O4 displayed a specific capacitance of 798 F g–1 at 0.5 A g–1, with 520 F g–1 still remaining even at a high current density of 20 A g–1, and good cycling stability with 91.7 % retention of the maximum capacitance (632 F g–1) after 1500 cycles at 2 A g–1. The outstanding electrochemical properties of the rambutan-like NiCo2O4 hierarchical architectures show great potential for application as high-performance supercapacitors.
