Conducting polymers (CPs) are the class of improvised organic substances showing the electrical properties analogous to metals. CPs have been trending in the research arena only because of the economic importance, better environmental stability, and improved electrical conductivity, which includes mechanical properties, electromechanical properties, and optical properties. The review also stresses on synthesis techniques, their innovation in structural properties for developing various applications in the field of mechanical sciences. New forecasts from the characterization and howthey prove useful in developing certain applications are being discussed. TheCPs are being used in various systems, to make the system robust in nature. The various applications include electrostatic materials, conducting adhesives, electromagnetic shielding against electromagnetic interference (EMI), artificial nerves, aircraft structures having sensoric systems, diodes, and transistors. The assessment brings in some of the potential applications of these polymers as binders with nanofibers and nanotubes in the gas sensors, nanodiodes, field-effect transistors for the transmission of power, and supercapacitors for energy storage and its prospects in the near future.
