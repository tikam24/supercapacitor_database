Polyaniline (PANI) nanowires on indium tin oxides (ITO) conducting glass substrates were synthesized by means of a galvanostatic method from an aqueous solution of 1.0mol路L-1 HClO4 and different concentrations of aniline monomer. The effects of aniline concentration and synthesis time on their morphology and electrochemical performance were systematically investigated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that PANI synthesized in different conditions was a wire in shape with different diameters of 100 to 500nm. Electrochemical characterization of the PANI electrode was performed in an aqueous solution of 3mol路L-1 NH4Cl and 2mol路L-1 ZnCl2 by galvanostatic charge-discharge, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). A high specific capacitance of 746.7F路g-1 was obtained within the potential range of -0.2 to 0.5V.
