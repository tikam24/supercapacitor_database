Recently, multifunctional lignin-based materials are gaining more and more attention due to their great potential for low-cost and sustainability. In this work, to obtain both an excellent supercapacitor electrode and an outstanding electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorber, a series of multifunctional nitrogen-sulphur (N-S) co-doped lignin-based carbon magnetic nanoparticles (LCMNPs) had been successfully prepared through Mannich reaction at different carbonization temperature. As compared with the directly carbonized lignin carbon (LC), LCMNPs had more nano-size structure and higher specific surface area. Meanwhile, with the increase of carbonization temperature, the graphitization of the LCMNPs could also be effectively improved. Therefore, LCMNPs-800 displayed the best performance advantages. For the electric double layer capacitor (EDLC), the optimal specific capacitance of LCMNPs-800 reached 154.2 F/g, and the capacitance retention after 5000 cycles was as high as 98.14 %. When the power density was 2204.76 W/kg, the energy density achieved 33.81 Wh/kg. In addition, N-S co-doped LCMNPs also exhibited strong electromagnetic wave absorption (EMWA) ability, whose the minimum reflection loss (RL) value of LCMNPs-800 was realized âˆ’46.61 dB at 6.01 GHz with an thickness of 4.0 mm, and the effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) was up to 2.11 GHz ranging from 5.10 to 7.21 GHz, which could cover the C-band. Overall, this green and sustainable approach is a promising strategy for the preparation of high-performance multifunctional lignin-based materials.
