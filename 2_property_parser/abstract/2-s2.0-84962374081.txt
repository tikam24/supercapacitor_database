CdO nanonecklace like structure with interconnected nanobeads were produced by air annealed Cd(OH)2 nanowire structure thin film at 290 °C. Simple and low cost chemical route has been successfully employed for the synthesis of Cd(OH)2 nanowires on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates at room temperature (27 °C). Structural analysis confirmed the conversion of hydroxide phase to the oxide phase by annealing which also leads to change in optical band gap from 3.5 to 2.34 eV. The necklace like nanostructure represent unique surface morphology which can be emerged as a potential candidate towards wide range of applications in different fields of nanotechnology such as solar cell, gas sensor, supercapacitor and photo-catalyst.
