Flexible and lightweight supercapacitors with superior mechanical flexibility and outstanding capacity are regarded as an ideal power source for wearable electronic devices. Meanwhile, incorporating additional novel characters such as transparency and electrochromism can further benefit the development of smart supercapacitors. Nevertheless, the application of the commonly used planar-structural current collectors is seriously restricted by their intrinsic properties such as poor rigidity, large thickness, and limited loading surface area. Flexible and ultralight current collectors with 3D architecture, high conductivity, and easy integration are believed to be the most appropriate alternatives to build high-performance supercapacitors. In this study, a novel and scalable manufacturing technique is developed to produce a flexible and ultralight 3D Ni micromesh (3D NM) current collector for supercapacitor. Flexible smart supercapacitor integrated by 3D NM and high active Ni–Co bimetallic hydroxide (3D NM@NiCo BH) delivers a considerable rate performance (60.6% capacity retention from 1 to 50 mA cm−2). Furthermore, the fabricated hybrid supercapacitor device integrated with electrochromic functionality can visually indicate the energy level by a color display. This flexible electrochromic supercapacitor based on ultralight 3D Ni micromesh provides a novel insight into multifunctional energy storage systems for smart wearable electronic devices.
