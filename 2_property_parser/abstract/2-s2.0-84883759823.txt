Flexible asymmetric supercapacitors with excellent electrochemical performance and aesthetic property are realized by using ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) MnO 2 and graphene nanosheets as cathode and anode materials, respectively. 2D MnO 2 nanosheets (MSs) with a thickness of ca. 2 nm are synthesized with a soft template method for the first time, which achieve a high specific capacitance of 774 F g-1 even after 10000 cycles. Asymmetric supercapacitors based on ultrathin MSs and graphene exhibit a very high energy density up to 97.2 Wh kg-1 with no more than 3% capacitance loss after 10000 cycles in aqueous electrolyte. Most interestingly, we show that the energy storage device can have an aesthetic property. For instance, a "Chinese panda" supercapacitor is capable of lighting up a red light emitting diode. This work has another, quite different aspect that a supercapacitor is no longer a cold industry product, but could have the meaning of art.
