Inspired by the magical biomimetic structure of mosses grown on rocks, form interconnected networks to enhance the accessible surface to nutrients, we report the synthesis of hybrid porous carbons (HPCs) via anchoring porous carbon nanosheets on bulk carbon backbones by using multidirectional carbon nanosheets as mosses with bulk carbon backbones as rocks to enhance the transport of both electrons and ions. The as-synthesized HPC possesses ultrahigh specific surface area (3619 m2 g-1) and graphitic carbon layers. The HPCs display a high specific capacitance of 205 F g-1 at 0.2 A g-1, good rate capability up to 176 F g-1 at 20 A g-1, and exceptional cycle stability with 97% of capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles in a two-electrode cell. This work provides a facile strategy to construct novel energy storage materials by imitating the biological behaviors.
