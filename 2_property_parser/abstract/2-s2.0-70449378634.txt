A facile approach is demonstrated for the preparation of mesoporous carbon nanowires in nanotubes, mesoporous carbon nanotubes and mesoporous carbon nanothorn microspheres by combining surfactant-templating self-assembly of organic resols with different MnO2 hard templates, and they deliver excellent capacitive performance for supercapacitor applications.
