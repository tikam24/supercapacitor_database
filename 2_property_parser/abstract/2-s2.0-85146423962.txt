In this paper, an attempt has been made on designing a fruit fly optimization algorithm (FFOA) based tilt-integral-derivative plus filter (TIDF) controller for an interconnected power system (IPS). Two areas of the hydro-thermal (TAHT) system are considered and analysis is carried out by impressing area-1 with 10% step load perturbation. However, the optimization of TIDF is perpetuated on account of the integral time square error (ITSE) function. The efficacy of FFOA is revealed with widely accepted algorithms of firefly algorithm (FA), gravitational search algorithm (GSA) and water cycle algorithm (WCA). To further attain the IPS performance effectively, a supplementary control strategy of Thyristor controlled phase shifter (TCPS) and ultra-capacitors (UCs) are implemented. A sensitivity test is conducted to reveal the robustness of the presented control approach.
