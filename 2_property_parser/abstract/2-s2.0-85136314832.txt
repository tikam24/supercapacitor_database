Aim to improve the capacitive performance of the NiCo2S4-based electrode materials, a novel composite material with a homogeneous and heteromorphic construction, h-NiCo2S4/u-NiCo2S4/NF, was successfully prepared through layer-by-layer growth in a hydrothermal process using urea and hexamethylenetetramine as alkali source in this work. This material presents a specific capacity high up to 1245.3 C g−1 (345.9 mAh g−1) at the current density of 2 A g−1 in a 6 M KOH electrolyte solution. Moreover, a 74.6 % of the initial specific capacity is still retained when the current density increases from 2 to 10 A g−1, showing a relatively good rate capability. Especially, an 84.0 % of capacity retention rate can be obtained after it suffers from 7000 charging-discharging cycles at 50 mA cm−2 (9.2 A g−1), exhibiting a good cycling stability. Using it as the positive electrode material to assemble an asymmetrical supercapacitive device with a home-made porous carbon (PC) as the negative electrode material, an energy density high up to 48.4 Wh kg−1 at 1060.6 W kg−1 and a 63.2 % of capacity retention rate at 10,000 charging-discharging cycles can be achieved, superior to many NiCo2S4-based asymmetrical supercapacitive devices reported so far.
