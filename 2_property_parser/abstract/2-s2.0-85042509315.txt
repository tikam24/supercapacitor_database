Sulphur/nitrogen co-doped reduced graphene oxide (SNG) aerogels were prepared by a simple solvothermal method with l-cysteine-assisted in ethylene glycol. The morphology and composition tests showed that the S/N heteroatoms were evenly distributed on SNG microsheets, and these microsheets were further composed of SNG aerogels with three-dimensional (3D) porous structure. The cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests illustrated the SNG bind-free electrode possessed electric double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance, and had a capacitance of 254 F g −1 at a current density of 1 A g −1 . After the 5000 cycles tests, the capacitance retained 83.54% at a current density of 2 A g −1 . Meanwhile, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data shown the electrode materials had excellent capacity and good conductivity. Hence, the SNG aerogel prepared by l-cysteine-assisted solvothermal method is a great material for high-performance supercapacitors.
