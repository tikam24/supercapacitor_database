Fast-growing poplar sapwood chips were used as raw materials for autohydrolysis pretreatment, and both inorganic molten-salt hydrates and the autohydrolyzed poplar sapwood (APW) chips were added into the hydrochloric acid solution for immersion. The resultant APW chips were then freeze-dried, carbonized, washed respectively with dilute-acid solution and deionized water, and dried successively, and a woody biomass-based porous carbon material was finally obtained. The effect of APW chips activated with different inorganic molten-salt hydrates on the physical structure and properties of the porous carbon materials was explored, and the electrochemical performance was also tested as the porous carbon material was used as a supercapacitor electrode. The results showed that the activation treatment with inorganic molten-salt hydrate ZnCl2 and ZnCO3 in hydrochloric acid solution was beneficial to improving the electrochemical performance of woody biomass-based porous carbon materials, while the former was more effective than the latter. And the woody biomass-based porous carbon materials prepared by ZnCl2 had more disordered structure. When used as a electrode material in a supercapacitor, the porous carbon material prepared with the combined activation of ZnCl2 and ZnCO3 was more advantageous in the electrochemical performance under a certain total-amount of the activator. At a current density of 0.2 A/g, its specific capacity reached 143.20 F/g. After 5000 cycles of charge-discharge process at the current density of 2.0 A/g, the retention of specific capacitance was as high as 99.90%, indicating that the material had fine cycle stability. In addition, at a scanning rate of 10 mV/s, its cyclic voltammetry curve maintained a well-closed and approximately rectangular shape.
