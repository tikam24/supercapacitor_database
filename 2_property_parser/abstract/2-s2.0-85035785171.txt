A novel high-performance supercapacitor electrode material, polyaniline (PANI) modified two-dimensional Ti3C2 composites(denoted as PANI-Ti3C2), has been synthesized via in situ polymerization. The experiment results showed that the introduction of PANI to Ti3C2 can improve the electrochemical properties of Ti3C2 because the amino groups in PANI not only increased the electric conductivity for faster ion transport but also improved the surface wettability of Ti3C2 for more active sites and provided faradaic reactions for additional capacity. The specific capacitance of PANI-Ti3C2 can achieve a maximum of 164 F g−1 at 2 mV s−1 and 1.26 times greater than that of Ti3C2 (131 F g−1). Moreover, PANI-Ti3C2 showed superior cycling stability, retaining ∼96% of its initial capacitance after 3000 cycles.
