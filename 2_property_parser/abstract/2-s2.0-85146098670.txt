Fiber-shaped supercapacitor (FSSC) is considered as a promising energy storage device for wearable electronics due to its high power density and outstanding safety. However, it is still a great challenge to simultaneously achieve high specific capacitance especially at rapid charging/discharging rate and long-term cycling stability of fiber electrode in FSSC for practical application. Here, a ternary poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)/reduced graphene oxide/polypyrrole (PEDOT:PSS/rGO/PPy) fiber electrode was constructed by in situ chemical polymerization of pyrrole on hydrothermally-assembled and acid-treated PEDOT:PSS/rGO (PG) hybrid hydrogel fiber. In this case, the porous PG hybrid fiber framework possesses combined advantages of highly-conductive PEDOT and flexible two-dimensional (2D) small-sized rGO sheets, which provides large surface area for the deposition of high-pseudocapacitance PPy, multiscale electrons/ions transport channels for the efficient utilization of active sites, and buffering layers to accommodate the structure change during electrochemical process. Attributed to the synergy, as-obtained ternary fiber electrode presents ultrahigh volumetric/areal specific capacitance (389 F cm−3 at 1 A cm−3 or 983 mF cm−2 at 2.5 mA cm−2) and outstanding rate performance (56 %, 1–20 A cm−3). In addition, 80 % preservation of initial capacitance after 8000 cycles for the corresponding FSSC also illustrates its greatly improved cycle stability compared with 64 % of binary PEDOT:PSS/PPy based counterpart. Accordingly, here proposed strategy promises a new opportunity to develop high-activity and durable electrode materials with potential applications in supercapacitor and beyond.
