This paper presents research and development of an industrial project which aims to propose a realistic solution to smooth short time power fluctuations for marine renewable energy sources. This project, funded by the European Community and Brittany Region (FEDER funding), associates SABELLA and Entech Smart Energies with the French Naval Academy research laboratory. The main objective is to design and test a preindustrial prototype of a controlled Energy Storage System (ESS) based on a supercapacitor bench, which can be associated with marine energy devices. The project includes realistic scale (several hundred kW rated power) design and test of this prototype in a dedicated emulation test bench. This paper details the project context, the test bench and prototype design and configuration.
