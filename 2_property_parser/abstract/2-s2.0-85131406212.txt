Herein, mixed-phase BiFeO3/Fe2O3 (BF-M) nanocomposite has been successfully prepared in a simple single-step synthetic strategy and its structural, physicochemical and magnetic properties have been characterized. The performance of as-synthesized mixed-phase BF-M catalyst has been investigated in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation and photocatalytic dye degradation analysis by comparing with the partials Fe2O3 with BiFeO3 (BF–P). The BF-M photocatalyst has degraded 95.7% of the rhodamine B (RhB) dye while BF–P has degraded 82.1% in 80 min. In addition, the BF-M electrode exhibited 0.57 mA cm−2 photocurrent density which was 1.83 times higher than the BF–P electrode (0.31 mA cm−2), signifying that the formation of a mixed-phase nanostructure interface is advantageous in enhancing light absorption capacity and reducing the rate of electron-hole recombination.
