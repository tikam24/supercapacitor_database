The paper presents a comparative analysis of selected methods of controlling supercapacitor storage of traction vehicle. Chosen control methods were compared due to the condition of the energy storage operation point and to the energy efficiency of the power flow in the traction grid. The article presents the results of the simulations that are taking into account the typical operating conditions of the traction vehicles on an isolated section of the power grid.
