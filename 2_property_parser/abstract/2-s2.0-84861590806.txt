The manganese oxides (MnO 2) with nanostructures was fabricated with non-aqueous alcohol and aqueous solution of potassium permanganate (KMnO 4) at room temperature. The test results show that the nano-MnO 2 well coated on the surface of carbon nanotube (CNT), while the specific capacitance of the composites with MnO 2 deposited on singlewall carbon nanotube (SWNT) was better than coated on multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWNT). The specific capacitance of MnO 2 coated on SWNT film can reach 769F/g at scan rate of 5mv/s in the first cycle. Â© (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
