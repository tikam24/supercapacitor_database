Hydrogen fuel cell (HFC) is one of the renewable resources to address fossil fuel depletion and global warming. Its primary advantages are power is generated from renewable fuel hydrogen and the emission is only water. However, HFC supplies power in a slow dynamic response. In fuel cell electrical vehicle (FCEV), energy storage system (ESS), i.e. supercapacitor and battery, is required to immediately compensate the difference between load demand and power supply; the lifetime of HFC is affected by current ripple. In order to manage power flow between HFC and load, HFC is interfaced with a unidirectional DC-DC converter. The converter steps up the terminal fuel cell voltage and regulate the voltage before it is connected to the load. Among the proposed HFC DC-DC converters, interleaved DC-DC converter seems more suitable for FCEV application due to its advantages. When galvanic isolation is required, current fed full bridge converter receives significant consideration as the module of interleaved converter. This paper simulates interleaved current fed full bridge (ICFFB) converter and discusses the suitability of ICFFB for FCEV application.
