In the chemical synthesis of polypyrrole (PPy), pyrrole oxidative polymerization was done. The use of alkali salts viz. FeCl3, Fe(NO3)3, as an oxidative polymerizer, creates impurities, affecting the purity of formed PPy. In this work, highly pristine PPy flexible electrodes (FE) were chemically synthesized using a 0.1 M solution of pyrrole acidified with 0.05 M HClO4 and 30 wt % H2O2, by the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. FEs XRD patterns indicate amorphous PPy formation. A characteristic peak at 1559 cm-1 in the FTIR spectra confirms PPy formation. A gradual change in the surface morphology with SILAR immersion time was observed. Nyquist plots describe different impedance parameters, which vary with SILAR immersion times. In cyclic voltammetric analysis (CV), the maximum specific capacitance observed for the FEs prepared with an immersion time of 10 s was 520.48 Fg-1. Specific capacitance calculated using the galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) analyses was 529.70 Fg-1, which was nearly the same as that observed by CV. FEs exhibited great cycling stability, even after 5000 cycles, with 74.43% of capacitance retention. Solid state symmetric device (SSD) produced specific capacitance as high as 312.28 Fg-1 , with 76 % of retention, even after 5000 cycles.
