There are tremendous efforts in various fields to apply the inkjet printing method for the fabrication of wearable devices, displays, and energy storage devices. To get high-quality products, however, sophisticated operation skills are required depending on the physical properties of the ink materials. In this regard, optimizing the inkjet printing parameters is as important as developing the physical properties of the ink materials. In this study, optimization of the inkjet printing software parameters is presented for fabricating a supercapacitor. Supercapacitors are attractive energy storage systems because of their high power density, long lifespan, and various applications as power sources. Supercapacitors can be used in the Internet of Things (IoT), smartphones, wearable devices, electrical vehicles (EVs), large energy storage systems, etc. The wide range of applications demands a new method that can fabricate devices in various scales. The inkjet printing method can break through the conventional fixed-size fabrication method.
