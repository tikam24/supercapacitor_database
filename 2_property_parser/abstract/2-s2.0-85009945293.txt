Mechanically resilient TiC/C composite nanofibrous felt has been prepared by electrospinning of precursor nanofibrous mat followed by thermal treatments including the carbothermal reduction at 1400°C. The felt consists of overlaid TiC/C composite nanofibers with diameters of 200-400. nm; in the composite nanofibers, self-generated TiC crystallites (∼. 70. wt.%) with sizes of 5-30. nm are randomly distributed in carbon (∼. 30. wt.%). The TiC/C composite nanofibrous felt can be surface-decorated with Pt nanoparticles as a highly efficient electrocatalytic system for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and as a cost-effective counter electrode in dye-sensitized solar cells. Moreover, the TiC/C composite nanofibrous felt can be conformally converted into carbide-derived carbon (CDC) nanofibrous felt through chlorination at an elevated temperature, and the resulting freestanding TiC/C-CDC felt exhibits superior performance as a binder-free electrode in a double-layer supercapacitor.
