Wearable energy storage device nowadays gains great interest due to sharply increased demand for highly flexible, stretchable and embedded electronics, where fiber-based supercapacitor (FSC) is a competitive counterpart. The poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid)/ polyaniline (PEDOT:PSS/PANi) fiber has been prepared via an accessible technique of one-dimensional (1D) self-assembly. Nevertheless, PSS as the main cross-linking matrix may lead to more hopping sites for charge carriers, lessening the continuous electrically conductive path. Herein, PEDOT:PSS/PANi fiber was treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to remove the insulative PSS chains. Coupling high electroactivity of PANi and high conductivity of PEDOT, the optimized DMSO-PEDOT:PSS/PANi fiber displays enhanced electrochemical properties with a high specific capacitance (Cs) of 367.7 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and good rate capability. Moreover, a symmetric FSC based on the DMSO-P4P6 fiber exhibits a high energy density of 42.4 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 302.3 W kg−1.
