Different nanostructures of active material have an imperative impact on its supercapacitive performance. Here, the nanoflakes like MnCo2O4 thin films have been synthesized by electrochemical method in constant current mode. By varying deposition parameters such as current density and deposition time, structural evolution has been studied. Formation of spinel MnCo2O4 has been confirmed by XRD, FT-RAMAN, XPS and EDS analysis. Electrochemical studies suggested that the change in deposition parameters has an evident effect on the supercapacitive performance of MnCo2O4. The optimized current density of − 0.8 mA cm−2 and the deposition time of 40 min evaluated nanoflakes like MnCo2O4 thin films, exhibiting a maximum specific capacitance of 52.6 F g−1.
