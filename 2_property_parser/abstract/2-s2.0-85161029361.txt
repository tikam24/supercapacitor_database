Layered two-dimensional (2D) transition metal nitrides/carbides/carbonitrides are collectively known as MXenes. MXenes are the most explored candidates in the family of 2D materials due to their extraordinary physicochemical properties, which have proved to be beneficial for multifunctional applications, most likely in electrochemical energy storage, energy generation, sensing, photocatalysis, etc. In the MXene family, niobium carbide (Nb2CTx) is an emerging novel member finding suitable applications due to its unique properties, although a smaller number of research studies have been conducted on this particular MXene to date and are still in their infancy. The Nb2CTxMXene has attracted great scientific attention among the various available non-titanium-based MXenes. A detailed review on the peculiar characteristics and prominent energy applications of this novel 2D material is lacking in the literature. This has motivated us to present a review article that provides an outline on the synthesis and exemplary energy applications of Nb2CTxMXene based materials, particularly for rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors. A brief description of the crystal structure and properties of the Nb2CTxMXene is included. By understanding the physics and chemistry of the Nb2CTxMXene, the properties can be tailored suitable for specific applications. This review proclaims that Nb2CTxMXene based materials can be a future efficient electrode material for rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors.
