To solve the inevitable aggregation and the low cycling stability of NiCo 2 S 4 electrode materials, herein NiCo 2 S 4 nanoparticles anchoring onto polypyrrole nanotubes were synthesized by a hydrothermal method. The obtained NiCo 2 S 4 /polypyrrole nanotubes composites exhibit a high specific capacitance of 1705 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 , and remarkable rate performance of 747.6 F g −1 at 20 A g −1 . Furthermore, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor using NiCo 2 S 4 /polypyrrole nanotubes as a positive electrode and activated carbons as a negative electrode delivers a high energy density of 52.5 Wh kg −1 at a power density of 562.5 W kg −1 , and excellent cycling stability with 83.3% retention after 5000 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance of NiCo 2 S 4 /polypyrrole nanotubes can be attributed to the high conductivity of polypyrrole nanotubes, and the key assistant effects of polypyrrole nanotubes which impede the aggregation of NiCo 2 S 4 and improve the exposed active sites for redox reaction. The results demonstrate that NiCo 2 S 4 /polypyrrole nanotubes are a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.
