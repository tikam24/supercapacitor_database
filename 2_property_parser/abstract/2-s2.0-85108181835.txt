Design of nanostructured surface architecture is currently playing a vital role to enhance the energy storage capability of electrode materials and opening up a new era for future technologies through electrochemical supercapacitors. Present effort portrays the growth of nanostructured bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) as an active electrode for supercapacitor application by using ease and industry scalable successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. Structural analysis reveals the development of orthorhombic structured BiVO4 with spongy nano-pebbles like surface architecture. Synthesized BiVO4 electrode yields remarkable capacitance of 707 F/g @3 mV/s scan rate. Faradaic and capacitive type contributions have been evaluated for in-depth understanding along with the estimation of electrochemical active surface area. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis of BiVO4 electrode exhibits 5.723 and 0.89 Î© cm2 values of series and charge transfer resistances, respectively. Interestingly, BiVO4 electrode delivers outstanding capacitive retention of 102% even at 3500 cycles, indicating its potential candidature for the advancement in high capability supercapacitors with excellent stability for the future technologies.
