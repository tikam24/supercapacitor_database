Background: A traction elevator system is analytically simulated in this paper, driven by an induction motor, in order to study possible energy saving modes of operation in terms of returning energy to the DC. Methodology: In order to reduce the total energy consumption of the system, the conventional braking system is replaced by a regenerative braking system, where the energy produced during braking is stored and not dissipated. This energy is transferred back to the DC-bus when there is high energy demand. Result: Two regenerative brake systems are simulated, with supercapacitors and with flywheel, and the results are compared to a real applicationâ€™s measurements.
