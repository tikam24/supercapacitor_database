The heterogeneous Co3O4-nanowires/vertical-graphene-nanosheets on Ni foam (Co3O4NW/VGN/NF) was synthesized by microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD) and hydrothermal process. The morphology of Co3O4NW/VGN/NF shows a uniform porous structure. The Co3O4NW/VGN/NF electrode exhibits a high area specific capacitance of 8.44 F cm−2 at 5 mA cm−2. The excellent capacitive performance of the composite material can be ascribed to the improved charge transfer rate and ion diffusion path.
