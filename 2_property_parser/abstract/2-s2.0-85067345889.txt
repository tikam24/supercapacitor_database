Activated carbon is recently applied in many field such act as absorbent in water treatment, air pollution control and supercapacitor electrodes. The previous study conducted has been found that the activated carbon also has a great potential to act as a dispersing agent. This finding has its significance in synthesizing perovskite type-oxides such as Ba(Ce,Zr)O3 electrolyte to reduce agglomeration during calcination process to produce nanoparticle of the ceramic electrolyte. For this study, the treated activated carbon from oil palm empty fruit bunches (AC-EFB) was used. To synthesis the Ba(Ce,Zr)O3 powders, a technique of citrate-EDTA complexion was applied. The ethylene glycol (EG) and treated activated carbon was added as polymerization and dispersing agent, respectively followed by adjustment of pH of the metal precursor to neutral. Then, the gel-sample was dried at 325°C/2h and calcined at 1100°C/10h and followed by fabrication of pellet. For the characterization, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) and Impedance Spectroscopy (IS) were conducted. The FTIR results further confirmed the presence of the functional group corresponded to the BCZY while SEM micrograph depicted that a dense morphological distribution of BCZY ceramic electrolyte were observed. While, the EDX data further confirm the composition of the pellet electrolyte. The IS data gives impedance spectra which significant in order to have the resistance results of the sample as well as the conductivity and also reported in this work. The IS data will be incorporated to further study the effect of acid-treated activated carbon on the properties of ceramic electrolyte.
