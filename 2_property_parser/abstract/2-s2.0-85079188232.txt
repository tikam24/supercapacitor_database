The carbon material based biomass in energy storage has attracted much interest due to their environmental friendly, natural abundance and special porous structures. In this paper, the relationship between the species of biomass-based electrode and properties of supercapacitors are systematically discussed. On the one hand, the influence of the specific morphologies, heteroatom-introducing and graphitization degree of active carbon on the electrochemical properties are analyzed in detail, which give a promising direction for biomass-based carbon in clean energy field. On the other hand, machine learning, especially artificial neural network model, has been widely used as data mining technology to predict the electrochemical properties of electrode materials. It makes the structure-performance relationship for biomass-based supercapacitors more specifically. Current development in synthesis of active carbon from biomass combined with theoretical prediction is summarized, which provides a meaningful guidance into the application of energy storage supercapacitors. Current challenges and new trends on the biomass-based carbon materials in supercapacitors have also been proposed.
