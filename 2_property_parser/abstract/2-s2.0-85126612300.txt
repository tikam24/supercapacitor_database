A lattice engineering exfoliation-reassembling route is used to prepare porous layer-by-layer self-assembled nanohybrids of cobalt-chromium-layered double hydroxide (Co-Cr-LDH) intercalated with 0D polyoxotungstate anions (CCW). The CCW nanohybrids provide interconnected nanosheets morphology, highly porous stacking structure, flexible chemical composition, and exceptional electrochemical activity. The self-assembled CCW nanohybrids display a high specific capacity of 1303 C g–1 with a capacity retention of 85.43 % over 5000 cycles. An aqueous hybrid asymmetric supercapacitor (AHAS) and all-solid-state hybrid asymmetric supercapacitor (ASHAS) devices are fabricated using CCW nanohybrids and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as cathode and anode, respectively. The AHAS device demonstrates a high specific capacitance of 167 F g–1 at 0.8 A g–1 and specific energy (SE) of 59.37 Wh kg−1 at specific power (SP) of 640 W kg−1 with capacitance retention of 91 % after 10,000 cycles. Moreover, the ASHAS device delivers high specific capacitance of 126 F g–1 at 1.92 A g–1 and SE of 44.58 Wh kg–1 at SP of 1536 W kg–1 with capacitance retention of 87 % over 10,000 cycles. The POW intercalative hybridization significantly improves the electrode activity of the CCW nanohybrids, representing an effective method for developing LDH-based nanohybrid materials.
