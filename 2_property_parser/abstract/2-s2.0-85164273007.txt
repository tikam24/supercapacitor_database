This paper focuses on the modeling and control of a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) consisting of lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitor designed for a single-phase installation. The proposed control method combines an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm with a nonlinear sliding mode control (SMC) system that considers variations in irradiance and power consumed by the load. The storage systems are separately connected to a DC bus via a DC-DC converter, and the PV installation is connected via a boost converter controlled by an intelligent MPPT using a fuzzy logic algorithm (FLC) to enhance the performance of the PV system. To protect the batteries from overcharging and deep discharge and maintain a constant state of charge for the supercapacitor, two management and protection algorithms are developed. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency and stability of the proposed ANN-SMC control strategy without any oscillations or overshoot during the transient regime until reaching the final value.
