In this work, utilizing lotus root knot as raw material, nitrogen and oxygen co-doped hierarchical porous carbon with appropriate heteroatom doping, multi-connected 3D pore structure and suitable pore size distribution were produced by carbonization and chemical activation step. The maximum specific surface area the biochar material reached was 3659 m2 g−1. These physical properties exhibit ultrahigh specific capacitance of up to 454.3 F g−1 in a supercapacitor of the three-electrode system under the current density of 1 A g−1 and a capacitance retention rate of 81.5 % within the range of 1∼10 A g−1. Furthermore, the specific capacitance is maintained at 91.5 % of the initial value in a two-electrode system after 10,000 cycles. In a two-electrode system with tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEABF4)/acetonitrile (ACN) solution as the electrolyte. The voltage window attained was 3 V with high energy density of 51.4 Wh kg−1 under the power density of 750 W kg−1. These results show that the assembled supercapacitors provide excellent energy and power density at the same time.
