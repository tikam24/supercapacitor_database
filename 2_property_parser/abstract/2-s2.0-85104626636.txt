Afterin situselenylation, hydrothermally synthesized NiMoO4was partially converted to NiSe2and MoSe2, and the obtained NiMoO4/NiSe2/MoSe2nanowires were used as a supercapacitor electrode material. The specific capacitance of the nanowired NiMoO4/NiSe2/MoSe2was significantly higher than that of NiMoO4at a current density of 1 A g−1(955vs.489 F g−1). NiMoO4/NiSe2/MoSe2also exhibited a high capacitance retention of 86.1% after 5000 cycles at 10 A g−1. The high supercapacitive performance of NiMoO4/NiSe2/MoSe2can be ascribed to the obvious heterointerfaces, rich defects and remarkably increased electrical conductivity afterin situselenylation of NiMoO4
