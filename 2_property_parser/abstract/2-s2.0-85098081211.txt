In recent 20 years, many studies were devoted to the development of materials for supercapacitors. Various methods were devised for the synthesis of advanced materials with high specific characteristics. However, the interaction of such materials in the production of electrodes may decrease the fraction of active surface involved in the creation of electrode capacitance, thus eliminating all advantages of the material. A search for the materials that could diminish the detrimental effect of pore blocking and increase the electrode conductivity is a topical problem. Attempts are made to solve this problem with the use of graphene, carbon nanotubes and other materials. In this work, the modified carbon black and its combinations with commercial types of porous carbon materials were investigated as such electrode components. The combined two-component electrode was shown to have a higher surface permittivity (26.9 mF/cm2) as compared to the single-component electrode (14.4 mF/cm2).
