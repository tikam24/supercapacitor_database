Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely employed as precursors to prepare various nanostructured functional materials. Here, a “nanoparticles-in-MOF” dual-template approach for generating complex cobalt sulfide (CoS) nanobubble cages is reported. A novel nanoparticles-in-MOF hybrid structure consisting of a Co-based MOF polyhedron host and many encapsulated mesostructured TiO2 nanospheres is first prepared, fol-lowed by a sulfidation process to obtain a complex cage structure consisting of CoS nanobubbles in the shell. Importantly, this strategy can be extended to prepare many other functional nanoparticles-in-MOF hybrid structures. When evaluated as an electrode material for hybrid supercapacitors, the as-derived CoS nanobubble cages display remarkable electrochemical performance with long cycle life and good rate capability.
