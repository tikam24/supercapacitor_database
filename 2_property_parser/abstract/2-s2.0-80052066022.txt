Poly(N-acetylaniline)/multi-walled carbon nanotubes composite (PAANI/MWCNTs) are synthesized using electrochemical method. The morphology of the composite is examined by scanning electron microscopy. Electrochemical properties are characterized by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge. A remarkable specific capacitance of 690 F g-1 is obtained at a current density of 2.5 A g-1, compared to 225 F g -1 for pure PAANI and 90 F g-1 for MWCNTs. The composite presents excellent cycle stability, losing 15% of the maximum capacity after 1000 cycles.
