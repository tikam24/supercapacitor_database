New insight into the effect on the alkali cations of Li+, Na+, and K+ pre-intercalated between adjacent layers of Mn3(PO4)2·3H2O towards the charge storage mechanism and their electrochemical kinetics of intercalation/deintercalation in three alkali electrolytes is demonstrated. The electrochemical performance of the designed Li[sbnd]Mn3(PO4)2·3H2O material outperforms that most of Mn-based pseudocapacitive electrode materials. The designed unique stratified structure is attractive for quick charge migration, which confirms that the appropriate pre-intercalation of alkali cation between layers is an efficient strategy to improve kinetics for the high-power density pseudocapacitive supercapacitor energy storage application.
