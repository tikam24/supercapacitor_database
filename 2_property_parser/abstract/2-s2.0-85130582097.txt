With the demand for next-generation energy storage equipment and industrial applications, the development of carbon-based electrode materials with more comprehensive electrochemical performance and more convenient production process has become a top priority. Here, an N/O co-doped carbon material (Z-700) was prepared by one-step carbonization with 2,6-bis(2-pyrazin-2-yl)âˆ’ 4-(4-(tetrazol-5-yl)phenyl)pyridine acting as the carbon and nitrogen source. Z-700 is a clastic carbon material with non-uniform size and low specific surface area (4.1 m2/g). However, when assembled into supercapacitors, Z-700 has excellent comprehensive capacitance performance, such as a specific capacitance of 218.6F/g (0.5 A/g), a specific energy of 43.7 Wh/kg, a cycling stability of more than 100,000 cycles, and a charge/discharge rate less than 2 s (10 A/g). In addition, the assembled symmetric supercapacitor has excellent capacitance performance. This high-performance carbon-based electrode material has great application potential in industry and next-generation supercapacitors.
