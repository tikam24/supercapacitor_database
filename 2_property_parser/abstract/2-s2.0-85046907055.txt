Flexible electrode film was fabricated using cellulose nanofibers aerogel as a framework dispersed with reduced graphene decorated with SnO2 for supercapacitors. The electrode film was synthesized through a simple hydrothermal reduction method followed by a free-drying process. Scanning electron microscope showed that cellulose nanofibers were uniformly wrapped around by reduced graphene, and a high specific area capacitance of 4.314 F cm−2 at 1 mA/cm2 in 1 M H2SO4 was obtained due to the 3D porous network of the aerogel. Furthermore, the aerogel electrodes showed extraordinary cycling stability for 2000 cycles with retention up to 60.47% at 10 mA cm−2. In view of its great electrical performance, easy synthesis, low cost, and environmentally friendly nature, the CNF/RGO/SnO2 aerogel may find promising application for flexible supercapacitors.
