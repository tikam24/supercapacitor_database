We report self-supported porous Co/NiO core/shell nanowire arrays via the combination of hydrogen reduction and chemical bath deposition methods. The Co nanowire acts as the backbone for the growth of NiO nanoflake shell forming hierarchically porous Co/NiO core/shell nanowire arrays. As electrode materials for pseudo-capacitors, the Co/NiO core/shell nanowire arrays exhibit a specific capacitance of 956 F g-1 at 2 Å g-1 and 737 F g -1 at 40 Å g-1, and good cycling stability, which is mainly due to the metal nanowire based core/shell nanowire architecture which provides good conductive network as well as fast ion/electron transfer and sufficient contact between active materials and electrolyte. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.
