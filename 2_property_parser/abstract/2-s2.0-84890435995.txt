Chemically bonded graphene/carbon nanotube composites as flexible supercapacitor electrode materials are synthesized by amide bonding. Carbon nanotubes attached along the edges and onto the surface of graphene act as spacers to increase the electrolyte-accessible surface area. Our lamellar structure electrodes demonstrate the largest volumetric capacitance (165 F cm-3) ever shown by carbon-based electrodes. Â© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
