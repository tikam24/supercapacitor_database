Layered double hydroxide (LDH) is widely explored in supercapacitors on account of its high capacity, adjustable composition and easy synthesis process. Unfortunately, solitary LDH still has great limitations as an electrode material due to its shortcomings, such as poor conductivity and easy agglomeration. Herein, nanoflakes assembled NiCo-LDH hollow nanocages derived from a metal–organic framework (MOF) precursor are strung by CuO nanorods formed from etching and oxidation of copper foam (CF), forming hierarchical CuO@NiCo-LDH heterostructures. The as-synthesized CuO@NiCo-LDH/CF shows a large capacitance (5607 mF cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2), superior rate performance (88.3 % retention at 10 mA cm−2) and impressive cycling durability (93.1 % capacitance is retained after 5000 cycles), which is significantly superior to control CuO/CF, CuO@ZIF-67/CF, NiCo-LDH/CF and Cu(OH)2@NiCo-LDH/CF electrodes. Besides, an asymmetrical supercapacitor consists of CuO@NiCo-LDH/CF and activated carbon displays a maximum energy density of 47.3 Wh kg−1, and its capacitance only declines by 6.8 % after 10000 cycles, demonstrating remarkable cycling durability. The advantages of highly conductive and robust CuO nanorods, MOF-derived hollow structure and the core-shell heterostructure contribute to the outstanding electrochemical performance. This synthesis strategy can be extended to design various core-shell heterostructures adopted in versatile electrochemical energy storage applications.
