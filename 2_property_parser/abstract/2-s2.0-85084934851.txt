In this paper, a multi-port system is proposed to recover the braking energy in a diesel-electric locomotive, using it to recharge a battery-supercapacitor based Energy Storage System (ESS) and to supply the locomotive auxiliary loads. To manage the system power flow, a single DC bus voltage controller generates current references for each converter. Also, an Energy Management System (EMS) decides the mode of operation, maintains the state of charge (SoC) of the battery and supercapacitor within a predefined range, and extends the battery lifetime by reducing its current stress. Numerical simulations are presented to validate the system concept.
