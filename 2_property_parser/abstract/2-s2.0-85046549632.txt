Light electric vehicle LEV autonomous present a major important problem for modern commercialized Electric Vehicle propulsion system. To improve the perfomance of LEV an efficiency fuzzy logic controller power management are proposed. The proton exchange mebran fuel hybrid system considered in this paper consists of fuel cells, lithium-ion batteries, and supercapacitors. The LEV is moving in the Algerian Saharan region, exactly in Bechar city. The aim objective of this work is to study the comportment of 2WDLEV based direct torque control supplied by differents sources of energy under diffrents speed varaiation. The performances of the proposed strategy controller give a satisfactory simulation results. The proposed control law increases the utility of LEV autonomous under several speed variations. Moreover, the future industrialâ€™s vehicle must take into considerations the hybrid power management choice into design steps.
