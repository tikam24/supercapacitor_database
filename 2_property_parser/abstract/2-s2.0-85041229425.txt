We present a facile one-step electrochemical approach to generate MnO2/rGO nanocomposite from a mixture of Mn3O4 and graphene oxide (GO). The electrochemical conversion of Mn3O4 into MnO2 through potential cycling is expedited in the presence of GO while the GO is reduced into reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The MnO2 nanoparticles are evenly distributed on the rGO nanosheets and act as the spacer to prevent rGO nanosheets from restacking. This unique structure provides high electroactive surface area (1173 m2 g−1) that improves ions diffusion within the MnO2/rGO structure. As a result, the MnO2/rGO nanocomposite exhibits high specific capacitance of 473 F g−1 at 0.25 A g−1, which is remarkably higher (3 times) than the Mn3O4/GO prior conversion. In addition, the electrosynthesized nanocomposite shows higher conductivity and excellent potential cycling stability of 95% at 2000 cycles.
