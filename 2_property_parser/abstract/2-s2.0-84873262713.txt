γ-MnOOH nanowires have been synthesized via a simple hydrothermal process without any template at relatively low temperature. The as-obtained sample was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical properties of the γ-MnOOH nanowires were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge methods. And a high specific capacitance calculated from the galvanostatic discharge curve was 191 F·g-1 at the current density of 0.1 A·g-1, which remain a good specific capacitance of 143 F·g-1 at the current density of 1.0 A·g-1. The electrochemical analysis results demonstrate that γ-MnOOH nanowires should be a good candidate as electrode material for supercapacitor. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
