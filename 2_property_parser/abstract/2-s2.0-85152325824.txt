The electrochemical capacitors, commonly known as supercapacitors (SCs), have engrossed immense consideration in the energy storage field owing to their merits like excellent capacitance, ability to deliver a high power, and ultra-long cycle life. Therefore, electrochemical capacitors have found applications in a number of sectors starting from hybrid electric vehicles to energy harvesting systems for renewable energy. Magnetite (Fe3O4) is a cost-effective, naturally abundant material that has been intensively studied as supercapacitor electrodes. Although magnetite has high theoretical capacitance, its relatively poor conductivity and low surface area due to self-aggregation restrict its electrochemical performance. Hence, many studies have focused on the composites of magnetite and high-surface-area conductive carbon materials like activated carbon, graphene, carbon nanofibers, carbon nanotubes, etc. Among these carbon materials, graphene is a two-dimensional material with excellent conductivity and high surface area, which makes it a good candidate for making composites with magnetite and energy storage application. This chapter presents a review and analysis of recent developments of magnetite-graphene-based composites for the application in electrochemical capacitors.
