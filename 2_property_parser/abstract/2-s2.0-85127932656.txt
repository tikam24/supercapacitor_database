In the scenario, a novel Ce2(WO4)3/ZnO@GO (CWZG) nanocomposite (NCs) were constructed by an easier hydrothermal technique. The crystalline phase and the structure of the material were characterized by the Powder X-Ray diffraction analysis (P-XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis; the presenting elements for synthesized materials were confirmed by EDAX spectroscopy analysis. The corresponding band energy value and the adsorption value for the degradation of the pollutants were examined by UV–Visible spectroscopy and DRS-UV spectroscopic techniques. In this process, the CWZG catalyst has higher photocatalytic performance in the visible region toward the decomposition of ciprofloxacin (CIP), methylene blue (MB) and amaranth dye (AM) with above 95% efficiency. The CWZG NCs have better catalytic performance and high stability even after more than four repeating recycle tests. The plausible degradation mechanism of the pollutants degradation reaction was examined by the Reactive Oxidative Species (ROS) test. Besides, the CWZG nanocomposite exhibits a superior capacitance of 114 Fg−1 than the other host materials. This superior electrochemical performance redox reactivity of the prepared material denotes the significance in photocatalytic applications. The above results strongly testify to the fact that CWZG nanocomposite may be a good photocatalytic material for environmental use.
