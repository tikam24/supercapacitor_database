In this paper, we report a novel high-performance Mn3O4@carbon fabric nanosheets (Mn3O4@CF-NS) electrode material synthesized by a facile one-step hydrothermal (HT) method. In this hierarchical design, flexible carbon fabric is coated with interlinked Mn3O4 nanosheets, which produces a highly porous reticular oxide/hydroxide/carbon composite structure. The flexible supercapacitors electrode of unique architecture exhibits an excellent specific capacitance of 941 F g−1 at a current density of 1 mA cm−2, with the advantages of light weight, and long-term cycling stability by retaining 89.7% after 5000 charge–discharge cycles at a constant current density of 5 mA cm−2. Such unique architecture offers outstanding pseudocapacitive performance with low cost and could be a promising material for flexible supercapacitors applications.
