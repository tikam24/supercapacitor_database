An attempt has been made in preparing graphene composite matrix with Ni(OH) 2 in a green route via Moringa oleifera plant leaf extract in an ordinary co-precipitation method for supercapacitor applications. The as-prepared graphene and its composites with various molar ratios of Ni(OH) 2 are investigated by XRD, UV, Raman, XPS, SEM, and TEM analyses which have confirmed the conversion of graphene oxide into reduced graphene oxide and its complexation with Ni(OH) 2 . Electrochemical activity of the samples is examined by using CV, GCD, and EIS techniques in 2 M KOH electrolyte solution. The leaf extract-reduced graphene oxide has shown pure EDLC behavior, and its composites with Ni(OH) 2 have contributed good redox couple leading to enhanced electrochemical performance of 350.7 F g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 . In the two-electrode set-up for asymmetric supercapacitor design, rGO//rGO-Ni(OH) 2 has performed good reversible cyclabilty with the energy density of 34.2 Wh kg −1 and power density of 507.5 W kg −1 at 2 A g −1 . The device shows good cyclic stability for 6000 successive charge/discharge cycles, and therefore, the green option can be one of the best alternatives for advancing supercapacitor technology.
