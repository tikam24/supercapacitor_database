Polyaniline (PANI) was grafted with carbon-nanotubes (CNT) via azobenzene (Azo) to increase the pseudo-capacitance of PANI. CNT was functionalized with azobenzene and used in the in-situ polymerization of aniline using emulsion polymerization. X-ray diffraction result supports the formation of composite materials. Morphology of grafted composites showed a higher uniform growth in PANI/ CNT-Azo composite than PANI/CNT composite. Electrochemical performance was evaluated by symmetric super-capacitor cells using cyclic voltammetry and chargedischarge studies. PANI/CNT-Azo showed a higher specific capacitance value than pristine PANI. The results show grafting of PANI onto CNT via Azo helps to achieve higher capacitance and thermal stability than non-grafted PANI/CNT composite materials.
