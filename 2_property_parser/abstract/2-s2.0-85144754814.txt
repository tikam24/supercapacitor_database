Constructing heterostructured electrode materials is a promising strategy for improving the performance of supercapacitors. However, the performance of existing active materials does not meet the growing demand for energy storage devices. In this study, novel nanoarrays with Cu(OH)2 nanorod cores and nickel oxalate shells were grown on copper foam as electrode materials for boosting the performance of supercapacitors. The synthesized CF@Cu(OH)2@NiC2O4 can reach a specific capacitance of 9.7 F cm− 2 (3 mA cm−2), which presents a good enhancement for the precursor electrode. The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) prepared with activated carbon exhibited a high energy density of 0.97 mWh cm−2 (2.4 mW cm−2) and an excellent cycling performance (82.3% retention after 30,000 cycles at 100 mv/s). The improved properties are inferred to be attributed to the construction of the novel electrode with heterostructures. This study provides a new idea that core-shell hybrids with oxalate shells can be used as advanced electrode materials for energy storage applications.
