This work demonstrates the investigation and fabrication of CoMoS4/Co3V2O8 nanocomposite as a new electrode material for supercapacitors. The new nanocomposite was successfully synthesized through a facile chemical precipitation method and possesses an effective porous structure with good electron conductivity and exhibit the good electrochemical performance. The specific capacitance of as-prepared CoMoS4/Co3V2O8 nanocomposite is about 584 F g−1at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 with a rate capability of 84.1% at the various current density of 0.5 to 5 A g−1. In addition, the nanocomposite shows low ionic internal resistance and good cycle stability after 3000 cycles. The low cost and excellent electrochemical and structural characteristic of CoMoS4/Co3V2O8 nanocomposite was found to combine the advantages of single CoMoS4 and Co3V2O8 nanoparticles. Therefore, the CoMoS4/Co3V2O8 nanocomposite is a promising candidate for electrode materials of supercapacitors.
