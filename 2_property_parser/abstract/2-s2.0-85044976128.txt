Mesoporous crosslinked polyaniline (MCP) was prepared by chemically copolymerizing aniline and p-phenylenediamine with triphenylamine as crosslinker, using ammonium persulfate as an oxidant and sodium dodecylsulfate as a soft template. Disordered mesoporous structure of MCP was suggested by SEM observation, TEM observation and BET analysis. Nitrogen adsorptionâ€“desorption isotherm revealed that the specific surface area of MCP was up to 59.1 m2/g. In addition, MCP exhibited a high specific capacitance of 516 F/g at 2 A/g and a remarkable electrochemical cycling stability with the specific capacitance retention of 73.2% after 2000 cycles, which was better than polyaniline with a specific capacitance of 293 F/g at 2 A/g and the specific capacitance retention of 48.2% after 2000 cycles. The improved specific capacitance and electrochemical cycling stability of MCP were essentially attributed to the synergistic effects of special mesoporous crosslinked structure, high conductivity and large specific surface area.
