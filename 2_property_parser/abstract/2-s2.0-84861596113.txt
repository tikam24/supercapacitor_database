A novel, facile and low-cost sawdust-template-assisted route was presented for the fabrication of MnO 2 nanorods from the in-situ redox reaction between KMnO 4 and methanol for the first time. The resulting samples were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) tests. The observations revealed the formation of α-MnO 2 nanorods with diameters of 30-80 nm and lengths of 200-500 mm. Electrochemical results showed that the MnO 2 nanorods owned the ability to deliver the specific capacitance of 78 F g -1 and good electrochemical stability of ca. 19% capacitance loss after 1000 cycles. Moreover, the fabrication process provided a universal and efficient approach to large-scale production MnO 2 nanorods for supercapacitor application. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
