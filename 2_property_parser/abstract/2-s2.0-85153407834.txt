In this study we report a facile, cost effective one step preparation method for the synthesis of Mn doped cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles (NPs) through co-precipitation technique. The synthesis was performed at relatively low temperature using a green reagent oxalic acid as reducing agent. The structural and optical attributes of the samples were characterized by X-Ray Diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), UVâ€“Visible spectroscopy and SEM (Scanning electron microscopy). The XRD and FTIR results show the formation of Mn doped ceria NPs having a cubic fluorite structure. The morphology and chemical composition of the prepared sample was realized using SEM and EDX spectrum. The synthesized Mn doped ceria NPs shows greater absorption in the visible region and reduced particle size compared to pure ceria NPs.
