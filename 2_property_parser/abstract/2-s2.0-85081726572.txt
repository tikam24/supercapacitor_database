The adjusted graphite microcrystallites (GMCs) in amorphous carbons have an important effect on their structures and capacitive performances. Samples with various accumulations of GMCs are prepared from carbon microspheres (CMSs). Their structures and capacitive performances are probed by morphology, spectroscopy, nitrogen adsorption–desorption, and electrochemical methods. The carbons with multilayer graphene (MLG) being in situ formed possess the specific surface area, mesopore volume, and specific capacitance of about 2087 m2 g−1, 0.92 cm−3 g−1, and 250 F g−1, which is 2.33, 8.4, and 1.9 times larger than CMSs, respectively. The combination of ordered and disordered GMCs results from MLG being in situ formed in amorphous carbons, and makes the carbons possess obviously decreased electric and ionic transmission resistances and improved capacitive performances at large charge–discharge current densities. It is also found that the accumulation of GMCs in amorphous carbons can be adjusted by controlling the infiltration of sodium metals into the matrix.
