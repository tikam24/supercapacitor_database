The present work gathers a general review of the properties, advantages and disadvantages of the principal electrode materials used in electrochemical capacitors (also called supercapacitors). The choice of these materials has an enormous influence on the final characteristics of the electrochemical device. Among the available electrode materials for their application in supercapacitors, carbonbased porous materials, transition metal oxides and conductive polymers are included. Each of these families of materials presents some advantages and drawbacks, so, in many occasions, a single material is not used for the preparation of the electrodes. The trend is directed to the use of hybrid electrodes, namely, those made of materials of different nature to combine the beneficial aspects and to offset the limitations of each material separately.
