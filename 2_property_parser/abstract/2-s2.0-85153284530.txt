The electrochemical performance of the faradaic battery-type metal oxide electrodes is dependent on the calcination temperature. Herein, we report metal–organic framework (MOF) derived bimetallic oxide (NiCo2O4-MOF) electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitor (SC) applications. Remarkably, the optimal NCM electrode with the annealing temperature 300 °C (NCM-300) achieves the maximum specific capacity of 188 mAh/g at 5 Ag−1 and the excellent rate capability of 85.25% after 3000 cycles, far exceeding those of their single counterpart. Interestingly, designed asymmetric device (ASC) using NiCo2O4-MOF (positive electrode) and activated carbon (AC) (negative electrode) showed excellent energy density 84.26 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 1185 W kg−1 with 83.23% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles. This report illustrates a novel route for synthesis and fabrication of metal oxides derived MOF having a large porosity which is beneficial to the electrochemical energy storage applications.
