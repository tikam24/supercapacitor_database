Here, we present a binder less sputtering approach for controllable growth of copper nitride (Cu3N) nanoflakes incorporated into 2D layered molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanoworms directly grown on flexible stainless steel (SS) substrate. The formation of the intermixed nanostructure is revealed by surface morphology. Moreover, the porous structure and good conductivity, and the presence of sulfur and N2 edges facilitate the synergistic effect favor more pathways for insertion and desertion of electrolyte ions (Na+). The optimized composite electrode achieves an outstanding specific capacitance (215.47 F/g at 0.5 A/g) along with remarkable elongated cycle life (∼90% retention over 2000 cycles at 9.5 A/g). Additionally, the electrode (of dimensions 3 × 1 cm2) shows high energy density (∼30 Wh/kg at a power density of 138 W/kg), extended potential window (1 V), fair mechanical stability, and pliability (retains ∼91% specific capacitance at 175° bending angle). The contemporary method provides a cathode material for practically applicable supercapacitors with superior flexibility and desirable electrochemical properties.
