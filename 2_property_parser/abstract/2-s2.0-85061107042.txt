This paper investigates the dependence of the supercapacitor Peukert constant on its terminal voltage, aging condition, and operating temperature. Recent studies show that the charge delivered by a supercapacitor during a constant current discharge process increases when the discharge current decreases if the discharge current is above a certain threshold, i.e., Peukert's law applies. By conducting extensive experiments using three supercapacitor samples with different rated capacitances from different manufacturers, this paper reveals that the Peukert constant increases when the initial voltage of the constant current discharge process is lower, the supercapacitor is more heavily aged, or the operating temperature is lower. The physical mechanisms accounting for the Peukert constant dependence are illustrated by analyzing an RC ladder circuit model. When the supercapacitor terminal voltage is higher, the aging condition is lighter, or the operating temperature is higher, more charge is stored in the supercapacitor. Consequently, when the same discharge current is applied, the discharge time is longer and the branch capacitors are more deeply discharged. Therefore, the relaxation effects of the slow branches are reduced and the supercapacitor behaves more like a single capacitor rather than a distributed capacitor network, which ultimately leads to a lower Peukert constant.
