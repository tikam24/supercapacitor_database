In this letter hydrothermally synthesized hierarchical stacked nanoplate of Ni(OH)2 and Ag deposited Ni(OH)2 have been successfully fabricated on graphene nanosheet. The prepared Ni(OH)2, Ag deposited Ni(OH)2 and their graphene based composites were characterized by XRD, FESEM and TEM analysis. Graphene increases the utility of the pseudocapacitive Ni(OH)2 and Ag deposited Ni(OH)2 as electrode material. Electrochemical characterizations in 6 M KOH electrolyte revealed superior electrode performance of the Ag deposited Ni(OH) 2/graphene composite over Ni(OH)2/graphene composite with maximum specific capacitance of 496 F/g at 1 A/g current density accompanying 93% specific capacitance retention at the end of 500 consecutive charge discharge cycles.
