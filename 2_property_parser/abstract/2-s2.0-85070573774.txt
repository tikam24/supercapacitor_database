The standalone/unconnected Photovoltaic (PV)-based systems for off-grid societies necessitates midway energy stowing policies/devices to stream/engross the sporadically generating power from Solar energy and to bring an equilibrium between generation and load consumption units. Storing energy in batteries as external source have been one of the key factors that upsurge the functioning cost of the standalone PV operated battery energy storing system which results in the faster let down by the unbalanced charging and discharging procedures. This paper recommends to install a capacitor segment in the presently working PV-battery systems in standalone conditions to lessen the charging/discharging traumas in battery by eradicating the strictly changing currents. Grounded on local solar isolation and projected load statistics of locomotive Himalayan Queen Train in MATLAB Simulink model is established to analyse the efficacy of the anticipated system in modifying battery strains. The projected Supercapacitor model was executed and tested with real Solar-battery energy system. Together simulation and investigational results demonstrates noteworthy drop in current flowing through batteries and the oscillation which has recommended for the upgrading in battery lifespan.
