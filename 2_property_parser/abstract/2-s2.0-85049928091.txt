Increasing penetration level of Distributed Generators (DGs)/ Renewable energy sources (RES) creates low inertia problems, damping effect on grid dynamic performance and stability. Voltage rise by reverse power from PV generations, excessive supply of electricity in the grid due to full generation of the DGs, power fluctuations due to variable nature of Renewable energy sources, and degradation of frequency regulation can be considered as some negative results of mentioned hurdle. For securing such a grid there should add inertia, virtually. The proposed control approach based on an inverter connected in Microgrid, which operated as a virtual synchronous generator (VSG) reacting only in transitory situations. Super capacitor (SC), an energy storage system (ESS) included in MG-forming inverter i.e., a normal inverter structure used for contributing system robustness and reliability. In steady-state load distributed between the MG-supporting inverter are achieved with two restoration controllers for active and reactive powers. The virtual inertia hypothesis can be used for maintaining a large share of DGs in future grids without affect system stability. This proposed system analyzed and simulated using MATLAB/SIMULINK.
