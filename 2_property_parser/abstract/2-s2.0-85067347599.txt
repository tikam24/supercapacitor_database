A simple approach of template growth of graphitic-carbon nitride (g-CN), a polymeric unit consisting of C, N, O, and H elements derived from extracts of green plant Aloe vera, which are rich in several chemical constituents, has been successfully experimented in this work. Comparing several other methods used for synthesizing g-CN involving a large amount of toxic components, here, we propose the simplest route economically and environmentally highly viable for near future. Green plants are highly rich in natural carbon and nitrogen compounds, such as acemannan, glucose, aloin, protein, etc. Way before g-CN research, many carbon-based materials have been synthesized for multifunctional properties, but g-CN has much benefit over them due to the presence of elements such as C, N, O, and H, thus making it electron-rich. Multifunctional properties of graphitic-carbon nitride interface bonding as a supercapacitor or as a metal-free catalyst thus help degrade dyes. Violet-blue broad band emission was even noticed when excited at 240 nm via C-C bonding (π-π∗ transition) in the absorption band with an extinction coefficient of ∼104 M-1 cm-1. With our research, we want to pave new ways of synthesizing such materials present in our nature in a biological form, which can protect our environment, thus causing less harm to mankind.
