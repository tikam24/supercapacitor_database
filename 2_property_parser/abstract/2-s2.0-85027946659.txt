Two-dimensional atomically thick materials, reduced graphene oxide (RGO), and layered molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) have been investigated as potential novel energy storage materials because of their distinct physicochemical properties. These materials suffer, however, from rapid capacity decay and low rate capability. This study describes a facile, binder-free approach to fabricate large-scale, 3D network structured MoS2@carbon nanotube (CNT)/RGO composites for application in flexible supercapacitor devices. The as-obtained composites possess a hierarchical porosity, and an interconnected framework. The electrochemical supercapacitive measurements of the MoS2@CNT/RGO electrode show a high specific capacitance of 129 mF cm−2 at 0.1 mA cm−2. The symmetric supercapacitor devices based on the as-obtained composites exhibit a long lifetime (94.7 % capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles), and a high electrochemical performance (29.7 mF cm−2). The present experimental findings will lead to scalable, binder-free synthesis of MoS2@CNT/RGO hybrid electrodes, with enhanced, flexible, supercapacitive performance, in portable and wearable energy storage devices.
