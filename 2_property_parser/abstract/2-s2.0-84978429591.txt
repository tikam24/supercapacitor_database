Eco-friendly wood-derived biochar (WDB) was used as a substrate material to support sheet-like nano-MnO2via an easily-operated in situ redox reaction between the biochar and KMnO4. WDB was readily obtained by pyrolyzing wood waste of agriculture and industry. The MnO2/WDB composite displays a core-shell structure and can be utilized as a free-standing and binder-free supercapacitor electrode. The MnO2/WDB electrode has a moderate specific capacitance of 101 F g-1, an excellent coulombic efficiency of 98-100%, and a good cyclic stability with a capacitance retention of 85.0% after 10000 cycles, making it useful for supercapacitor applications. Moreover, it is expected that such porous inexpensive WDB can serve as a novel harmless substrate material to combine with other electrochemical active substances for the development of high-performance energy storage devices.
