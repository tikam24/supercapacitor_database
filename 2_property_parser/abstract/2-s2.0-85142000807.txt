Perovskite phase metal oxides are extensively explored due to their structural and compositional flexibility and excellent electrocatalytic activity. Its composite with the porous and conductive materials has potential application for the energy storage devices due to its additional conductive pathways for enhancing the charge kinetics. In the present work synthesis of highly porous Cu-MOF(HKUST-1)/LaNiO3 heterostructure composite is explored as pseudocapacitive electrode in three electrode system using KOH as well as LiOH electrolytes. The prepared HKUST-1/LaNiO3 composite electrode has shown a high specific capacitance of 424.30 F/g, 786.0 F/g in LiOH and KOH electrolytes respectively at 1 A/g current density. The obtained value is significantly better than the pristine LaNiO3 perovskite electrode (170 F/g and 273 F/g in LiOH and KOH respectively). The symmetrical supercapacitor using HKUST-1/LaNiO3 electrodes have displayed the energy densities of 28.24 Wh/kg and 28.15 Wh/kg and power densities of 775 W/kg, 836 W/kg in KOH and LiOH electrolytes respectively.
