Ordinary modular energy storage systems require cell- and module-level equalizers, in addition to a main bidirectional converter, increasing the system complexity and cost. This article proposes a bidirectional buck-boost converter using cascaded energy storage modules. Each module contains a cell-level equalizer with a half-bridge cell. The half-bridge cell in each module is utilized not only for the cell-level equalizer but also for the cascaded buck-boost converter. Module voltages are equalized by adjusting duty cycles of the half-bridge cells, allowing the elimination of dedicated module-level equalizers. Furthermore, the cascaded structure equivalently increases the switching frequency and reduces the inductor current ripple. An experimental charge-discharge cycling test using the prototype was performed for three electric double-layer capacitor modules. Cell and module voltages were gradually equalized during cycling, demonstrating the bidirectional power conversion and cell- and module-voltage equalization capabilities of the proposed converter.
