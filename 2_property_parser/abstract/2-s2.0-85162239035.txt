This paper proposes a multiport converter that integrates PV, battery, supercapacitor, and the dc-link for solar electrical vehicle (SEV) applications. The proposed design addresses two main challenges of solar EV: 1) partial shading on different sides of the SEV and 2) improving the acceleration and deacceleration operation of the SEV. A dual-input LLC (DLLC) converter can help PV panels to achieve their respective MPPs individually by changing switching frequency and phase shift. On the other hand, the bidirectional hybrid dc-dc converter plays a significant role as the interface between storage sources and dc-link. Adding the supercapacitor as extra energy storage to the SEV design increases the battery's lifetime, utilizing the mutual power flows. The proposed multiport converter has many advantages, such as a wide voltage-gain range, low voltage stress on the power switches, common ground between the low-voltage and high-voltage ports, and ZVS soft switching. A dual-input LLC resonant converter integrated with a hybrid converter was built and tested. The operational waveforms are shown to confirm the accuracy and practicality of the theoretical analysis.
