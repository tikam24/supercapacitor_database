In the present study is investigated the self-discharge current of a 500 F supercapacitor bank with 16.2 V rated voltage. Initially, the bank was charged from 0 to 16.2 V and the data was used to obtain its actual capacitance - 542 F. Thereafter, it was let to self-discharge in open circuit mode for a period of 62 days under room temperature conditions. A monitoring system was used in order to measure the voltage of each cell and of the bank as a whole. The analysis of the results showed that the self-discharge has an exponential character, however the exponent is also exponentially nonlinear. The obtained models allowed to obtain the leakage resistance of the capacitor, which varies from 25 $\Omega$ at 16.1 V to more than 214 k$\Omega$ at 12.5 V. This shows that when the capacitor is charged near its rated voltage, its initial power losses could go above 10 W.
