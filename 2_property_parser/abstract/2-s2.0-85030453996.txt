We investigated a type of hybrid power boat in order to solve the environmental pollution problem caused by the ship emission. The hybrid power boat uses photovoltaic (PV) cell and a super capacitor as the main power supply and auxiliary power supply, respectively. The electrical propulsion system of the hybrid power boat used the novel Z-source inverter. Details about the operating principle and control strategy of the hybrid power propulsion system were investigated. The stability of the DC-link voltage was maintained by the dual loop control, and the controller was designed based on a small signal model. The predictive model of the PV cell output power was established by applying a three-layer BP neural network. Furthermore, we designed the power predictive system of the PV cell. The output power of the PV cell and the super capacitor was controlled by the shoot-through duty cycle and the modulation factor. Finally, simulation and experiment results indicated that the PV cell delivered average power, and that the super capacitor provided the transient power and absorbed the regenerative braking power when the boat was running. These results verified the validity of the proposed control strategies.
