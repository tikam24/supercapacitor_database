By employing a new template method using surfactant/silicate solution template, highly mesoporous carbon/manganese oxide composite materials were prepared in one step and their performance as electrodes of supercapacitor was investigated. Because of the high dispersion of Mn oxide and well developed mesoporosity of carbon, a high specific capacitance and an improved rate performance were observed at the electrodes fabricated by Mn/carbon composite materials.
