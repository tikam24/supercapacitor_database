Battery electric vehicles have several challenges like power density, continuity of supply, life time etc. To solve this problem another power source is connected with the battery. In this paper a battery-ultra capacitor (UC) hybrid energy storage system (HESS) is proposed. This combinational arrangement gives better power and energy density. In this case UC supports both acceleration and regeneration periods of electric vehicles (EV). This paper presents a supervisory controller for HESS including a bidirectional three port buck-boost converter and a brushless dc (BLDC) motor. The proposed control strategy regulates power level of battery and state of charge (SOC) of UC with the help of a conventional proportional integral controller (PI) and fuzzy logic controller (FLC) and are evaluated with simulations in MATLABÂ®. Simulation results have confirmed that the controller effectively splits the load demand on battery and UC.
