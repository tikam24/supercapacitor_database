The use of Energy Management System (EMS) in energy storage becomes a concern in electric vehicles development. This paper discusses the design of an EMS using Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) cascade type by considering the State of Charge (SOC) of the battery and supercapacitor, as well as power demand in EV. The proposed system is evaluated using simulations with three different SOC conditions for batteries and supercapacitor under specific EV power demand. The result shows that the proposed EMS is able to share the power requirements that the battery and supercapacitor have to accommodate properly.
