It is important to address the challenges posed with the ever-increasing demand for energy supply and environmental sustainability. Activated carbon, which is the common material for commercial supercapacitor electrodes, is currently derived from petroleum-based precursors. This paper presents an effective synthetic method that utilizes waste tires as the precursor to prepare the activated carbon electrodes by the pyrolysis and chemical activation processes. Adjusting the activation parameters can tailor multiple physical properties of the resulting activated carbon, which in turns tunes the performance of the activated carbon electrode. Statistical multiple linear regression and stepwise regression methods are employed to investigate the dependence of the specific capacitance and the rate capability upon the physical properties (such as porosity) of the activated carbon electrode. The specific capacitance of activated carbon electrode is controlled by the micropore volume but independent of the mesopores volume. The rate capability is dominated by the mesopore/micropore volume ratio instead of the absolute value of mesopore volume. Â© 2014 American Chemical Society.
