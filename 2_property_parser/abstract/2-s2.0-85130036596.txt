Because of the rapid development of portable electronics, there is an urgent need for ultrathin, lightweight, and bendable electrodes for flexible and wearable energy-storage devices (FWESDs). This paper introduces the structural engineering of flexible electrodes with the above characteristics based on a Ag nanowire (NW) network current collector. The conductive interconnected networks give electrodes a highway of electron transport and excellent flexibility. Two kinds of nanostructures have been designed for high-performance electrodes, enabling diverse applications in FWESDs. In a core-shell Ag@NiCo/MnOx NW electrode, the MnOx thin shell layer favors a quick and reversible faradic reaction at the near surface. The electrode achieves a specific capacity of 41 mF cm-2 (350 F g-1), a capacitance retention rate of 88% after 2000 cycles, and stable electrochemical performance under repeated bending. In double-layer Ag@NiCo NW-Co(OH)2 electrode, the vertical growth of Co(OH)2 nanosheets covers the entire network, generating a high mass loading and abundant pathways for ion diffusion. As a result, the electrode delivers a high capacity of 376 mF cm-2 (1886 F g-1) and an excellent Coulombic efficiency of 95%. Both electrodes are demonstrated in FWESDs under various working scenarios, indicating promising prospects in the next generation of flexible electronics.
