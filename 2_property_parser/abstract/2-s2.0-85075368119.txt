An aqueous supercapacitor based on two dissimilar polymers is presented. Negative and positive electrodes are fabricated by electrodepositing poly(1,5-naphthalenediamine) and poly(4,4â€²-oxydianiline) onto carbon-fabric-supported porous activated carbon coatings, respectively. The asymmetric supercapacitor has a broad voltage window of 1.6 V, high specific capacitance around 600 F g-1 and high mass loading over 10 mg cm-2 for each electrode. The capacitance retention is 91% after 10000 charge-discharge cycles. The charge storage mechanism accounting for the widened voltage window is proposed.
