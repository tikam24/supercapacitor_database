As the low-cost, natural multi-component for elemental doping and environment-friendly characteristics, biomass-derived porous carbon for energy storage attracts intense attention. Herein, walnut shells-based porous carbon has been obtained through carbonization, hydrothermal and activation treatment. The corresponding porous carbon owns superior electrochemical performances with specific capacitance reaching up to 462Fg-1 at 1Ag-1, and shows excellent cycling stability (5000 cycles, 94.2% of capacitance retention at 10Ag -1 ). Moreover, the symmetry supercapacitor achieves high specific capacitance (197Fg -1 at 1Ag -1 ), relevant electrochemical cycling stability (5000 cycles, 89.2% of capacitance retention at 5Ag -1 ) and high power/energy density (42.8Whkg -1 at 1249Wkg -1 ). Therefore, the facile synthesis approach and superb electrochemical performance ensure that the walnut shells-derived porous carbon is a promising electrode material candidate for supercapacitors.
