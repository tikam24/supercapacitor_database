Cobalt hydroxide, often used as an additive in nickel electrode, is rarely studied as active material for supercapacitors. In this paper, the Co(OH) 2 with the particle size less than 20nm by deposition transformation was synthesized. Its single electrode specific capacitance was measured to be 92F · g-1, and the electrode resistance was so low that the initial potential drop when discharging is unobvious even the discharge current increased to 200mA for a 1cm2 electrode. After ten thousand cycles, CO(OH)2 on the electrode changes to Co3O4 gradually, the resistance of the electrode does not increase much, while the specific capacitance increases to 133F · g-1 at 10mA o.
