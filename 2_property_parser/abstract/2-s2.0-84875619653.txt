As a novel energy storage system, supercapacitors with characteristics of long cycle-life and high rate charge discharge capability, can be applied in many fields. The performance of the electrode material is the most important factor affecting the nature of supercapacitor. MnO2 has advantages in price, environmental friendliness, and easy access. The energy storage mechanism of manganese dioxides electrode materials for supercapacitor was described, and the relationship between nano manganese dioxide microscopic structure and its electrochemical properties was analyzed. The recent developments of synthesis, doping modification, and compounding methods of manganese dioxide-based materials were reviewed from the angle of nanometer manganese dioxides preparation and its comprehensive modification. The main development directions of manganese dioxide-based electrodes for EC application were presented. Â© All Rights Reserved.
