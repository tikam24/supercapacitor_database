An asymmetric supercapacitor, exploiting ultra-high density aligned activated graphene flakes as the positive electrode and nm-scale conformal coating of a conducting polymer poly(ethylenedioxythiophene) on aligned carbon nanotubes as the negative electrode, is introduced. By complementary tailoring of the asymmetric electrodes, the layered device exhibits a wide 4 V electrochemical window, with the highest power density (149 kW L-1) and energy density (113 Wh L-1) reported thus far for carbon-based supercapacitors. 2014 This journal is Â© the Partner Organisations.
