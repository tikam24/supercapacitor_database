In this paper, we report the green synthesis of 1-(4-ferrocenylbutyl)piperazine chemically grafted rGO (P.Fc/rGO) as a battery-type supercapacitor electrode material. For this purpose, initially, the ability of the aqueous Damson fruit extract is investigated in the reduction reaction of graphene oxide (GO). 1-(4-ferrocenylbutyl)piperazine (P.Fc) is synthesized via nucleophilic substitution reaction of piperazine with as-synthesized 4-chlorobutylferrocene. In continue, P. Fc is incorporated to GO by ring-opening reaction of epoxide groups on the GO surface. In the next step, the modified reduction method by aqueous Damson fruit extract was used to prepare the P.Fc/rGO from P.Fc/GO. The prepared materials were characterized by various techniques including FT-IR, Uv–vis, XRD, SEM, EDX, and BET. N2 adsorption–desorption data of P.Fc/rGO nanocomposite shows that the surface area is 37.746 m2 g−1. The capability of P.Fc/rGO nanocomposite for using as an energy storage electrode material in battery-type supercapacitor was examined by investigation of its electrochemical behavior by CV, EIS, and GCD measurements. The charge storage capacity of 1,102 mAh g−1 is achieved at 2.5 A g−1. This nanocomposite shows 89% retention of charge storage capacity after 2000 CV cycles.
