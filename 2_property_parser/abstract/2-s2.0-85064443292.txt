Heteroatom-doped hierarchical porous carbon materials have aroused widespread concern in the field of supercapacitors due to their effective ion-accessible surface, abundant porosity and low manufacturing cost. However, their relatively poor electric conductivity might not completely meet the requirements of comprehensive application of supercapacitor. Herein, to further promote conductivity of porous carbon, an all carbon nanocomposite was successfully fabricated by implanting carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into the surface and edge of hierarchical porous carbon (HPC). The sp2 CNTs endows the composites with high conductivity and connect porous carbons to each other, which renders rapid ion transfer and store during charge/discharge process. Benefiting from strong bonding effects due to plentiful heteroatom functional groups, the nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon/CNT hybrid exhibits considerable charge transport ability, superior specific capacitance of 293.1 F g−1 at current density of 1 A g−1 and high rate capability of 207.0 F g−1 at 30 A g−1. Furthermore, the assembled symmetric supercapacitor displays a high energy density of 27.46 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 874.98 W kg−1. The unique hierarchical three-dimensional hybrid structure provides a novel way to develop conductive carbon electrode materials for advanced supercapacitors.
