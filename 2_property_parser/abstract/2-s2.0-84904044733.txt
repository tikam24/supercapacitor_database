A novel synthesis of hierarchical porous carbons (HPCs) with 3D open-cell structure based on nanosilica-embedded emulsion-templated polymerization was reported. An oil-in-water emulsion containing SiO2 colloids was fabricated using liquid paraffin as an oil phase, resorcinol/formaldehyde and silica sol as an aqueous phase, and Span 80/Tween 80 as emulsifiers. HPCs with macropore cores, open meso/macropore windows, and abundant micropores were synthesized by the polymerization and carbonization of the emulsion, followed by scaffold removal and further KOH activation. A typical HPCs sample as supercapacitor electrode shows the charge/discharge capability under large loading current density (30 A/g) coupling with a reasonable electrochemical capacitance in KOH electrolyte solution.
