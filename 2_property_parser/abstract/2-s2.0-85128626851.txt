Modern society is witnessing a presumed fourth industrial insurgency characterized by a boom of intelligent and digital electronic devices as the globe progresses toward electromobility and, with it, decarbonization of its electrical supply is urgently needed. As a result, battery and supercapacitor demand has skyrocketed, as the need for the ores, metals, and materials used to manufacture them. This chapter intends to demonstrate that there is room to develop organic-based electrodes for electrochemical energy storage devices. Organic electrode materials are an alternative to the traditional inorganic electrode materials, which require intercalation and are promising candidates for advancing next-generation multifaceted and sustainable energy storage systems. We present a comprehensive overview of the fundamental understanding, history of development, types, synthesis methods, and specific applications of organic electrodes by starting with robust structural analysis. The use of organic electrodes in flexible supercapacitors and flexible batteries and their electrochemical and mechanical properties are addressed.
