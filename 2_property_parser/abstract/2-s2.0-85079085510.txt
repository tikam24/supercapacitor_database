This paper covers the synchronized cell balancing charging of supercapacitors using pi control. The main objective of this project is to design a balanced circuit for supercapacitor and balance the voltage for each supercapacitor in series using pi control. This project aims to introduce a switch resistor design for a supercapacitor to balance the cell. Due to its low cost, easy to implement, and charge/discharge, the switch resistor design was chosen as the balanced circuit. The switch resistor design process was accomplished taking into account all the calculation for the design parameters. Using the pi control given to the circuit the stability and balancing in the voltage. The pi control design process was accomplished with the calculation for the design parameters.
