Nanohoneycomb-like manganese cobalt sulfide/three dimensional graphene-nickel foam hybrid electrodes for supercapacitor are synthesized by chemical vapor deposition and electrodeposition. The ternary sulfide electrode exhibits high specific capacitance (1938 F g −1 at 5 A g −1 ) with excellent rate capability (76.8% capacitance retention at 100 A g −1 ) due to the intercrossed feature of the nanowalls and three-dimensional interpenetrating nanoarchitecture. Moreover, the specific capacitance of the electrode after 4000 cycles at a high current density of 50 A g −1 is 1320 F g −1 . The asymmetric supercapacitor assembled with the manganese cobalt sulfide electrode and an activated carbon electrode displays an energy density of 14.33 W h kg −1 at a power density of 74.87 W kg −1 . The manganese cobalt sulfide is a promising electrode material for practical application.
