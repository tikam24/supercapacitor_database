Nickel-doped manganese dioxide (Ni-MnO2) synthesized by sol-gel method has been used as an electrode material for supercapacitors. The structure and electrochemical properties of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectrometry (EIS). Results showed that the nickel-doped manganese dioxide sample exhibited irregular particles with the diameter of about 500 nm. The crystallographic structure of MnO2 was the poorly crystallized Î³-MnO2. The doping ratio had a great influence on the electrochemical properties of the materials. When the molar ratio of Ni/Mn was 3/100, the specific capacitance of Ni-MnO2 achieved to 252.61 F/g. After 2000 charge/discharge cycles, the specific capacitance of Ni-MnO2 was still maintained at 74.36%, which was attributed to its excellent cycling stability.
