To overcome the low energy density and poor conductivity of conventional electrode materials for building supercapacitor, herein, a hybrid hydrogel prepared from compositing bio-based chitosan with holey graphene oxide by microwave-assisted hydrothermal is proposed. This binary hydrogel is endowed with heteroatomic functional groups and conductive porous network by chemical pretreatments, where amides and carboxyl groups are introduced during the acylation modification of chitosan to enable it soluble in water for sufficient reaction, while the oxidation etching for graphene oxide in the defect area by H2O2 facilitates in-plane nanopores network to provide abundant active surface and short ion diffusion pathway. Benefited from the high conductivity and flexibility, this hydrogel present promising performance when used as additive-free electrode in a three-electrode, with a high specific capacitance of 377 F/g at 5 A/g. The rich nitrogen and oxygen groups on surface of the hydrogel contribute to high capacitance directly, while the in-plane nanopores and hierarchically porous network benefit to promote their wettability, accelerate the charge transfer and enhance their charge storage ability. When the hydrogel composite is adopted into a flexible solid-state supercapacitor employing lignin hydrogel electrolyte, it unfolds a specific capacitance of 210 F/g at 0.5 A/g, with an ultrahigh energy density of 31 Wh/kg at the power density of 150 W/kg. The solid-state supercapacitor exhibits promising potential in applications such as signal sensor and portable energy storage.
