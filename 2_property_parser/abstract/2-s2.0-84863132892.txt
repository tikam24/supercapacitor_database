This paper presents an account of some electrochemical aspects in relation to supercapacitors (SPs) with composite electrodes of carbon nanotubes and redox pseudocapacitive materials. Firstly, the origin of pseudocapacitive behaviour is rationalised by the band theory of solids. The maximum achievable mass specific capacitance of conducting polymers is also considered by calculations with the aid of a new ferrocenyl bithiophenic polymer capable of both capacitive and non-capacitive faradaic charge transfer reactions. Another aspect considered is the relationship of the ratio of positive and negative electrode capacitances with the voltage and energy capacity of asymmetrical SPs. This work has led to significantly increased energy storage capacity. A novel trenched graphite disc electrode and a tube-type two electrode cell for SP fabrication are also introduced in this paper. Lastly, the fabrication and performance of a 20 V SP stack is reported. Â©The Electrochemical Society.
