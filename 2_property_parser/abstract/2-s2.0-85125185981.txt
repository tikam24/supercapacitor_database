In this paper, an improved state machine control strategy based on equivalent consumption minimization for fuel cell/battery/ultra-capacitor hybrid electric vehicles is presented. By combining with an improved state machine control strategy, the power of the three power sources (fuel cell, battery and ultracapacitor) is reasonably allocated to improve the performance of the equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS). In addition, the current is tracked by the non-singular terminal sliding mode controller (NTSMC) to obtain accurate current. The proposed method can effectively reduce the fuel consumption of the system and improve the fuel cell efficiency. The fuel cell hybrid vehicle is modeled in MATLAB/Simulink. The simulation results show that compared with the state machine and equivalent consumption minimization strategy, this method can effectively reduce hydrogen consumption and reduce the consumption cost of fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles.
