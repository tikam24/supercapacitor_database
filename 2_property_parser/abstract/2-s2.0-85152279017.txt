Carbon-based materials are mostly used in supercapacitor due to control porosity, higher surface area, and easy processing for electrode production. However, it is still challenging to fabricate carbon/metal oxide-based nanocomposite electrodes with various structures and configurations for supercapacitors, particularly for miniaturized electronics. Here, in the present study, CeO2–Nd2O3/rGO ternary nanocomposite was synthesized by facial co-precipitation route, which evident enhanced capacitive performance than CeO2–Nd2O3 binary composite, bare CeO2, and Nd2O3. The rGO was homogeneously anchored on the surface of CeO2–Nd2O3 nanoparticles, forming a semi-spherical morphology. The electrochemical performance of all electrodes was investigated by different measurements. The ternary composite have a higher specific capacitance of 1265 F g−1 at 3 A g−1 current density and maintained 99% retention after 2000th cycles, showing excellent cycling performance and rate capability compared to other grown products. The excellent electrochemical pseudocapacitive performance of the ternary composite-based electrode could be ascribed due to rGO and its interfacial contact with CeO2–Nd2O3. The improved electrode conductivity generates plentiful active sites for charging and discharging and provides an easy path for the fast transportation of ions. These results open an innovative pathway for fabricating rGO and metal oxide-based composite in developing electrochemical energy storage devices for commercial production.
