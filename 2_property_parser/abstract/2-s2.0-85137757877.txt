Lately, the interest in more storage capacity has been creating a result of their use in various applications that use supercapacitors. The fundamental objective of this assessment is to investigate and depict the components of electrochemical execution of graphene-based supercapacitors. An illustration of a supercapacitor was organized using a terminal of graphene layer covered with a main polymer layer (polyaniline). In this paper, a proposed approach for predicting the charge move resistance of supercapacitor subject to DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) figuring Brain Organization (DNANN) is introduced. Animated by the new achievement of using Artificial Intelligence(AI) computations in work assessment, and concentrate critical level features from data, we use this proposed brain association to the issue of recognizing the repeat - impedance association and to choose a similar course of action resistance of the supercapacitor so that to evaluate its power capacity. The alleged knee repeats of the supercapacitor which is the essential repeat where all surface locale is submerged is in like manner expected.
