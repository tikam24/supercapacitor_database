We report a facile strategy to synthesize WO3-RGO composite by intimately coating WO3nanoflower with RGO via an electrostatic attraction between positive charge modified WO3and negatively charged GO. The WO3-RGO composite showed higher specific capacitance (495 F g−1at a current density of 1 A g−1) compared with pure WO3(127 F g−1) in 0.5 M H2SO4aqueous electrolyte. In addition, the WO3-RGO composite electrode showed excellent cyclic stability of 87.5% even after 1000 cycles. The enhancement in specific capacitance and excellent cyclic stability of the composite electrode is mainly due to sufficient interfacial contact as well as synergetic effect of pure WO3and graphene. The experimental results demonstrated that WO3-RGO composite is a promising electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.
