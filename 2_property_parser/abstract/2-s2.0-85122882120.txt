Considerable diversity in the preparation methodology of active electrode materials for carbon supercapacitors makes direct comparison of the results obtained by different groups difficult. The electrode compositions usually included a variety of additives, such as the different forms of binders and/or conductive additives. All additives differ in physico-chemical properties, which affect the supercapacitive properties of electrodes in a different manner. In this study, we aimed to extend accumulated knowledge of the effect of active electrode content by performing the electrochemical characterization of a series of in-house-prepared carbonâ€“carbon supercapacitors, which differ in compositions of active electrode materials and their thicknesses. The main focus was to investigate the frequency responses of the assembled devices and describe their behavior with the appropriate equivalent electric circuits to get a deeper understanding of the charge storage in the carbon electrodes. Assembled supercapacitors were subjected to external pressure, and the influence on cell performance was investigated. Results revealed how the applied variations influenced the equivalent serial resistance and capacitance, which is crucial in the process of supercapacitor assembly.
