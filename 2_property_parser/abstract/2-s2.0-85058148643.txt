Mesoporous Al2O3 template was facially constructed by hydrolysis of aluminum nitrate solution, and 3D MnO2 foam was fabricated by redox reaction of Mn2+ and MnO4 - in the nanoholes of Al2O3 template, followed by sacrificial dissolution of the Al2O3 matrix. The as-prepared 3D MnO2 sponge is composed of cross-linked worm-like nanofibers which promise enhanced charge transfer capability. The specific surface area and porosity of the MnO2 sponge is affected by the concentration of Mn2+ ion when the pores of Al2O3 template were immersed, and higher specific surface area, higher pore volume and hence better electrochemical performance were developed at lower Mn2+ concentration. When 0.02mol L-1 of Mn2+ solution was used to immerse the Al2O3 template, a specific capacitance of 215.3F g-1 can be achieved for the resultant 3D MnO2 sponge in 1 mol L-1 Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte at 2mV s-1 scan rate, and all as-prepared 3D MnO2 sponges provide good long-term charging/discharging stability with approximate 96% retention of capacitance at 5mV s-1 scan rate after 2000 cycles, showing that the facially synthesized 3D MnO2 sponge is a promising electrode material for supercapacitor.
