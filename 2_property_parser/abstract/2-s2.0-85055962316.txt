Supercapacitors based on two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin nanomaterials of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) are rapidly growing, but constructing three-dimensional (3D) skeleton networks structure with both high energy density and superior cycle stability remains challenging. In this work, supercapacitor based on 3D skeleton networks of rGO nanosheets/V2O5 nanobelts hybrids has been successfully constructed via a simple one-pot hydrothermal method. The resultant rGO/V2O5 hybrid aerogel electrodes show a high specific capacitance of 310.1 F g−1 (1 A g−1) and 195.2 F g−1 (10 A g−1). Moreover, the assembled symmetric supercapacitors based on as-fabricated hybrid electrodes deliver a high gravimetric capacitance of 225.6 F g−1 (0.5 A g−1), a high energy density of 31.3 Wh kg−1 (249.7 W kg−1) and excellent long-term cycle stability (remain 90.2% after 5000 cycles). Above all, the as-designed 3D skeleton networks, with rGO nanosheets and V2O5 nanobelts hybrids intimately stacked, can give a guidance for designing other high-performance graphene-based electrodes and hold a great potential for high-performance electrical energy storages.
