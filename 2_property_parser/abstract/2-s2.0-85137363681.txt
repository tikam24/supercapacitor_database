In this work, carbonized materials produced from crushed and milled corncobs are presented. Different heat treatment regimes were investigated. It was found that at a temperature of 500 Â°C and a reaction time of 2 h, the material had the highest oxygen content with the most diverse surface group composition. In this case, in order to obtain material for the manufacture of supercapacitors preliminary grinding may be unnecessary due to the excessive number of groups on the surface. Based on obtained data, it is possible to propose the method of corncobs processing with the least economic costs. The resulting carbonized material is of interest for further research, in activation processes. The selection of activation temperature regime in case of physical activation (possible due to high potassium and calcium content in the samples) or temperature regime and reagents in case of chemical activation may allow conducting directed synthesis of activated carbon maximally suitable for application in supercapacitors and gas sensors.
