The proceedings contain 9 papers. The topics discussed include: a hierarchical nanostructure electrode with 3-dimensional ZnO nanorod and PeDot nanotue and nanofiber network assembly for supercapacitor energy storage; embedded fiber optic sensors for in situ and in-operando monitoring of advanced batteries; nanostructures and dielectric properties of PVDF-based polymer films with high energy density and low energy losses; a highly soluble redox shuttle with superior rate performance in overcharge protection; electrochemical performance of lithium-ion hybrid supercapacitors based on activated caron and nanoplatelet Li<inf>4</inf>T<inf>15</inf>O<inf>12</inf> insertion electrode synthesized by nanoscission technique; development of rechargeale lithium-bromine batteries with lithum ion conducting solid electrolyte; on the staility and reactivity of redox shuttles in their neutral and radical cation forms; and ion solvation and the search for a correlation with electrode passivation.
