Soot is used as an electrode material for possible supercapacitance applications. The carbonaceous product is collected from a domestic heating system and possesses a naturally developed high surface area, which is one of the key requirements for such applications. The low-molecular-weight compounds in the soot are evaporated and carbonized by heat treatment of the samples in the range 400–800 °C. The heating at different temperatures causes different degrees of carbonization, functional groups removal, and samples’ stabilization. The capacitance is compared of prototypes with electrodes made from materials treated at different temperatures. The prototype samples are investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy, revealing sequentially removed functional groups and a variety of carbon structures, such as graphene sheets, monocrystalline carbon particles, and onion-like structures.
