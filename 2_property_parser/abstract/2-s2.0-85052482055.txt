In order to make high-performance electrodes in the field of energy storage and conversion such as fuel cells, supercapacitors and batteries, a great deal of efforts has been devoted to the functionalization of nanoporous carbons. In this chapter, the classification of nanoporous carbon materials according to pore sizes will be briefly introduced first. In the following part, three main common strategies including hard template method, soft template method and hard-soft template method will also be presented to prepare ordered porous carbon materials in energy-related fields. The emphasis of this chapter will be focused on the control of porosity, morphology, surface modification and framework composition. Finally, the outlook of nanoporous carbon materials towards optimizing the electrochemical behaviour in fuel cells, batteries and supercapacitors will be discussed.
