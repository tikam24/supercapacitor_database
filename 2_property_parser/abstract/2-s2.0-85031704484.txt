In situ nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon was synthesized by using waste protein-rich pig nails as precursors in a facile KOH activation method. The microstructure and electrochemical characteristics of the materials were investigated by tuning the amount of KOH. When the weight ratio of KOH to pig nails is 1 : 1, the obtained nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon (NHPC-1) exhibits the largest specific surface area (2569 m2 g−1) with interconnected porous network structure, which are beneficial to ion/electron storage and transfer. In addition, abundant nitrogen of 2.8 at % in the NHPC-1 also contributes to the high electrochemical activity of the supercapacitor during the charging/discharging process. As a result, the NHPC-1 electrode in the supercapacitor exhibits a high specific capacitance of 231 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and superior retention of 98 % after 5000 cycles at 1 A g−1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte. Additionally, the assembled symmetric device based on NHPC-1 exhibits a high energy density of 7 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 500 W kg−1. Our study suggests that waste pig nails can act as low-cost and renewable carbon precursors for high performance supercapacitor.
