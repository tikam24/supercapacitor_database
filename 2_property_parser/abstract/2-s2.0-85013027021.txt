Conducting polyaniline (PANi) is deposited in situ as a homogeneous shell on the monocrystalline VO2 nanobelts by using a simple and facile reactive template strategy without the assistance of any surfactant for supercapacitor electrodes. The as-prepared VO2@PANi coaxial heterostructures show larger specific capacitance, better rate capability than the bare VO2 nanobelts, and higher cycling stability than the HCl-doped PANi nanofibers in neutral electrolyte, owing to the synergetic contributions of the unique configuration and composition. These intriguing results can be extended to the synthesis of core/yolk-shell or hollow inorganic/organic functional nanostructures with various shapes by tuning the pH or reaction time, which have potential applications in energy storage, optoelectronic devices, environmental governance, and catalysis.
