Composite electrodes consisting of Mn-Co oxide and high electrical conductive carbon nanofibers(vapor grown carbon nanofiber, VGCF)(CoMnO2/VGCF) were prepared by thermally decomposing manganese and cobalt nitrates directly onto the pore of a porous nickel foam substrate as a current collector to form manganese and cobalt oxides, and their supercapacitive properties were investigated using cyclic voltammetry in 1M KOH aqueous solution. The CoMnO2/VGCF electrodes exhibited high specific capacitance value of 630 F/g at 5 mV/s and excellent capacitance retention of 95% after 104 cycles. Â© 2009 by ESG.
