Electrochemical capacitors, also called supercapacitors (SCs), have been gaining a more significant position as electrochemical energy storage devices in recent years. They are energy storage devices with a considerable power density, a satisfactory energy density and a long-life cycle, suitable for a large number of applications. The further development of these devices relies on providing suitable, low-cost, environmentally friendly, and abundant materials for use as the active materials in the electrodes. Among the current materials used, activated carbons have a superior performance. Their excellent electrochemical performance, high specific surface area, high adsorption, tunable surface chemistry, fast ion/electron transport, abundant functional moieties, low cost, and abundance have made them promising candidates as SC electrodes. These advantages can be enhanced if the activated carbons are prepared from biomass precursors. Recently, scientists have focused on biomass because it is abundant and renewable, low cost, simply processed, and environmentally friendly. The fundamentals of SCs as an electrochemical energy storage device are discussed and biomass from various sources is categorized and introduced. Finally, the activation techniques for these biomass precursors and their use as electrode materials for SCs are discussed.
