Carbon nanotubes/graphene/manganese dioxide nanostructured thin films are developed as supercapacitors electrodes in this contribution. The effects of nanostructuration and pseudocapacitance on electrochemical performances are investigated. The challenge is to assemble these materials in a composite electrode achieving controlled homogeneity, morphology, and composition. Mixing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene sheets in a hierarchical organization can increase the accessibility of the electrolyte to the entire active surface by creating a controlled porous network inside the electrode. The carbon nanomaterials are deposited on a current collector by dynamic spray gun deposition, an easily scalable, reproducible and industrially suitable method used for nano-structuration of thin films. MnO2 nanocrystals are obtained by anodic electrodeposition directly on this conductive nanostructured carbon framework. This binder free electrode is characterized by SEM, TEM, XPS, XRD, microporosity, Raman spectroscopy, and electrochemistry. Results show that the specific capacitance of the samples can reach 209 F/g thanks to a strong control of the MnO2 morphology, particle size and to adequate Mn/C ratios. The electrode has very good stability with capacitance retention of 96% after 3000 charge/discharge cycles.
