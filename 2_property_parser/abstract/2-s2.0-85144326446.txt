With the advent of cyber-physical system-based automation and intelligence, the development of flexible and wearable devices has dramatically enhanced. Evidently, this has led to the thrust to realize standalone and sufficiently-self-powered miniaturized devices for a variety of sensing and monitoring applications. To this end, a range of aspects needs to be carefully and synergistically optimized. These include the choice of material, micro-reservoir to suitably place the analytes, integrable electrodes, detection mechanism, microprocessor/microcontroller architecture, signal-processing, software, etc. In this context, several researchers are working toward developing novel flexible devices having a micro-reservoir, both in flow-through and stationary phases, integrated with graphanized zones created by simple benchtop lasers. Various substrates, like different kinds of cloths, papers, and polymers, have been harnessed to develop laser-ablated graphene regions along with a micro-reservoir to aptly place various analytes to be sensed/monitored. Likewise, similar substrates have been utilized for energy harvesting by fuel cell or solar routes and supercapacitor-based energy storage. Overall, realization of a prototype is envisioned by integrating various sub-systems, including sensory, energy harvesting, energy storage, and IoT sub-systems, on a single mini-platform. In this work, the diversified work toward developing such prototypes will be showcased and current and future commercialization potential will be projected.
