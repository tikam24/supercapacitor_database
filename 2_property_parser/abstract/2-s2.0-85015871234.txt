In today's nanomaterial moderated world, besides intercalated compounds like graphite, fullerenes and carbon nanotubes; search for specialized materials (2-Dimensional) such as graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), monolayer molybdenum disulfi de, molybdenum selenide (MoSe2), molybdenum telluride, tungsten sulfi de, etc., for sophisticated applications in batteries, electrochromics, integrated circuits, photovoltaic, cosmetics, catalysts, solid lubricants and supercapacitors have been a demanding fi eld of scientifi c inquiry. Graphene, the most signifi cant 2D nanomaterial having sp2 hybridized carbon atoms in a honeycomb arrangement is derived from pristine graphite. It is basically a semiconductor type material having a zero band gap. Simultaneously, it has got a very high charge mobility of some higher order magnitude than silicon semiconductor. To increase the conductivity of graphene, we can dope it by using nitrogen. Moreover, it has got a very high surface area as well as excellent thermal conductivity. In the case of graphene-based polymer nanocomposites, it gives a high modulus with an excellent mechanical and thermal stability. Th e chapter describes preparation and p roperties of graphene and alike two- dimensional materials.
