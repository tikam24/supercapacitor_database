This paper analyzes the benefits and drawbacks of using a modified center-tab rectifier in a high-current bidirectional dc-dc converter. In order to do this, an analytical model of the rectifier is proposed, and a design procedure based on this model is presented. Simulations and experimental data from a prototype validate this model. This topology is also optimized to reduce diode/switch reverse voltage stress. The prototype is designed to be attached to a supercapacitor stack in order to generate a regulated output power supply. Because one side of the converter (the supercapacitor side) has to transfer currents of up to 100 A at a low voltage (less than 50 V), the main reason for choosing this topology is the low conduction losses that it presents.
