This study presents the electrochemical studies of activated carbon prepared from palm kernel shell (ACPKS), with CaO impregnation. The CaO is obtained from chicken eggshell waste to produce CaO/ACPKS, which shows highly porous honeycomb structure with homogeneous distribution of CaO nanoparticles (30–50 nm in size). The prepared materials are evaluated as supercapacitor electrodes by testing their electrochemical characteristics. A high specific capacitance value of 222 F g−1 at 0.025 A g−1 is obtained for CaO/ACPKS, which is around three times higher than that for ACPKS (76 F g−1). In addition, electrochemical impedance data show lower impedance for CaO/ACPKS. Lastly, a practical symmetrical supercapacitor is fabricated by CaO/ACPKS and its performance is discussed.
