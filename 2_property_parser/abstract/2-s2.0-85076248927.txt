Nickel cobalt sulfides are deemed as promising electrode materials for energy storage devices due to their rich redox active sites as well as superior conductivity. Herein, we report P-doped Ni-Co-S@C (PNCS@C) assemblies consisting of many nanosheets through facile one-step solvothermal route and a subsequent phosphorization process. The as-obtained product is utilized as electrode material for supercapacitor, which shows a specific capacity of 1026 C g−1 at current density of 1 A g−1. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) delivers an energy density of 131.40 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 1355.37 W kg−1. As anode material for lithium ion battery, it presents a discharge capacity of 2300.10 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1. The superior electrochemical performance could be attributed to their unique spatial architectures and synergistic effect between composites.
