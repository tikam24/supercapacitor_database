A freestanding film composed of graphene (GN) sheets and polyaniline (PANI) nanofibres wasfabricated by reducing a graphite oxide (GO)/PANI precursor that was prepared by flow-directed assemblyfrom a complex dispersion of GO and PANI. This was followed by reoxidation and redoping of the reducedPANI in the composite to restore the conducting PANI structure. A scanning electron microscope (SEM)image indicates that the GN/PANI film is a layered structure with PANI nanofibres uniformly sandwichedbetween the GN sheets. In the composite film, the PANI nanofibres can increase the basal spacingbetween GN sheets. Therefore, electrolyte ions have better accessibility to the GN surfaces. The GNsheets can act as current collector to decrease the inner resistance of the electrode, which is convenientfor electronic and ionic transportation during the redox process of PANI. The electrochemical properties ofthe freestanding GN/PANI film were estimated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge in1 mol·L-1 HCl electrolyte. Electrochemical analysis demonstrates that the as-prepared GN/PANI film hasgood capacitive behavior. The specific capacitance was 495 F·g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A·g-1 and thecapacitance was 313 F·g-1 even at a current density of 3 A·g-1. After 2000 cycles, the capacitance of theGN/PANI film decreases 10% of its initial capacitance, which demonstrates that the GN/PANI electrode hasgood cycle stability. © Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.
