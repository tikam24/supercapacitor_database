Current Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies can manufacture parts with complex geometries using a wide range of plastic, metal, and ceramic materials. Currently, there are limited advancements in integrated technology to print dissimilar materials within the same part. Bonding dissimilar parts requires further processing; it also creates interfaces with debilitating stress concentrations. Overall, part performance is compromised. Therefore, there is value in 3D printing multi-material and functionally graded parts. Here, a novel binder jetting approach for single-print production of multi-material and functionally graded parts is reported. The approach deposits a nanoparticle ink in the binder. Ceramic, polymer, or metal powders are bound to build nanocomposites. By switching nanoparticle inks during printing, the process builds a material with graded conductivity and flexibility. To demonstrate the approach, a graphene oxide (GO) ink is formulated for printing onto polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) powder. The final product is a GO/PVOH composite that exhibits conductivity and high flexibility. The composite shows promise as a high-porosity material for supercapacitor applications.
