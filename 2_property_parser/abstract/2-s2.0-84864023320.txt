The well-defined polyaniline nanosheets are prepared via the facile chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline in the saturated NaCl solution for the first time. The specific capacitance of 778.6 F g -2, much higher than those supercapacitors based on PANI prepared via the chemical oxidative polymerization without any conductive substrate reported, is calculated from the charge-discharge curve at a specific current density of 10 mA cm -2 in the potential range -0.2~0.8 V, when they are used as the electrode materials for supercapacitors with 1.0M NaNO 3 as electrolyte and about 80% of its original capacitance is preserved after 500 cycles. The high specific capacitance and good cycling stability make them promising electrode materials for the high performance supercapacitors. Â© 2012 by ESG.
