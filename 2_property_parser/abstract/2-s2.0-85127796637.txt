The storage of energy for future requirements is an ongoing task in the current research era. Therefore many of the storage devices have been formulated. Besides others, the supercapacitors emerges much more attention because of their ease of fabrication, charge storage mechanism and better operational durability etc. This chapter contains a brief discussion on the emergence of energy storage systems, the dominance of supercapacitors over other storage systems and a broad classification of supercapacitors basing on their charge storage mechanism/fabrication. Moreover the revolutionary changes in the storage system (from capacitor to supercapacitor) has been presented to a glimpse of fundamental idea to the readers.
