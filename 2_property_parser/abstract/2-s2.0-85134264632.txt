Abstract: An approximate and analytical solution is obtained for a modified Poisson−Boltzmann (MPB) equation describing +z/−z electrolyte confined inside a cylindrical pore. Three expressions are obtained for the ration of surface charge density, σ, to surface potential, ψs, electrical potential distribution, and ion concentration profiles. The σ/ψs expression is in near-perfect agreement with the numerical solution for any values of ψs and pore radius rcylin non-dimensionalized by screening constant κ. The σ/ψs expression is applied to study electrical capacitance and energy storage behavior of the cylindrical pore supercapacitor. The MPB calculations accord with previous results from computer simulation and other theories. Main new findings are summarized as follows. (i) Influence of bulk salt mole concentration c is mainly manifested in that high c value lowers the saturation energy storage density Esat and the threshold electrode potential Usat, beyond which the Esat is just reached, and reduces the width of the zero energy domain around the zero charge potential. The effect of c value is only obvious in narrow pore. (ii) Although an increase in size of the ion reduces the Esat value, it simultaneously reduces the Usat value. Moreover, it brings a transition from camel shaped to bell shaped differential capacitance curve. (iii) High ion valency helps in raising both the Esat and Usat values. Moreover, the Esat-enhancing effect by the pore size reduces with the ion valency increasing. (iv) Large size pore raises both the Esat and the Usat values.
