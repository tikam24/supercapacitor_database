To enhance the supercapacitive performance, SnO2 was applied onto Ti3C2 by microwave irradiation. The increased layer spacing identified by XRD indicates the intercalation of Sn2+. SEM and TEM showed nano-sized SnO2 particles were anchored on the surface of Ti3C2. Electrochemical testing results revealed the capacitance of SnO2-Ti3C2 was nearly two times as high as that of pristine Ti3C2 (at 1 A g−1). After 8000 charge-discharge cycles (at 3 A g−1), 82% of the specific capacitance of SnO2-Ti3C2 electrode was retained. The findings are a clear indication of a new technical route for the development of novel nanomaterials with enhanced performance.
