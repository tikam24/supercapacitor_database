In this paper, porous carbon nanospheres (PCS) were prepared by carbonization at 1000 ℃ and KOH activation at 750 ℃ of polypyrrole (PPy) nanospheres. Then the post treatment of PCS was carried out by solvothermal reaction with p-Aminothiophenol (PATP) to prepare PATP functionalized PCS with high density (PATP-PCS). The results showed that after functionalization with PATP, low-density porous carbon material turned into high-density functionalized carbon material.The volumetric capacitance of PATP-PCS was up to 183.6 F/cm3 at 0.5 A/g; when the current density increased to 20 A/g, the volumetric capacitance is still 123.14 F/cm3, showing excellent rate performance.After 3 000 cycles of charge and discharge at the current density of 10 A/g, the cycle life is up to 94.7%, indicating a prominent cycle stability.
