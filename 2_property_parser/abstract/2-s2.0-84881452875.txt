For practical use of supercapacitors, new electrode materials are needed with high ionic adsorption capacity at the solid-liquid interface, fast and reversible surface redox reaction, and fast charge transfer. In the current study, we produce a new hybrid material of electrochemical double layer capacitive graphene, pseudocapacitive polyaniline (PANI) and highly conductive silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The nanocomposite of AgNP-PANI-graphene in a weight ratio of 0.1:1:1, coated on flexible carbon fiber paper (CFP), exhibits high specific capacitance and capacity retention. At an applied current density of 1.5 A g-1, the maximum specific capacitance of AgNP-PANI-graphene/CFP is 828 F g-1, which is about 4.0-, 2.2-, 1.6-, and 1.5-fold higher than those of graphene/CFP, PANI/CFP, AgNP-PANI/CFP, and PANI-graphene/CFP, respectively. The capacity retention of AgNP-PANI-graphene/ CFP after a charge-discharge test having 3000 cycles is 97.5% of the original specific capacitance. This was 4.4, 12.9, 14.5, and 23.5% more stable than PANI-graphene/CFP, graphene/CFP, AgNP-PANI/CFP, and PANI/CFP, respectively. An 0.8′′ × 6′′ all-solid-state supercapacitor device composed of AgNP-PANI-graphene/CFP exhibited a specific capacitance of 142 F g-1 measured at an applied current density of 1.5 A g-1 and a wide working potential of 6.2 V after consecutive charge-discharge tests over a 16.40 h period. This fully charged supercapacitor could power a 3 V motor for 7.30 min. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
