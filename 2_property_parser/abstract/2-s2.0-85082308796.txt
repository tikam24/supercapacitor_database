Layered-structure MOF is a promising material for electrochemical energy storage applications. However, low conductivity hinders their electrochemical performance. Herein, a hierarchical layered-structure CoNi-MOF with ultrathin nanosheets and nanotube arrays are directly grown on carbon cloth (CC) with Co(OH)2 as both template and Co source. The synthesized CC/CoNi-MOF shows high areal capacity of 1.01 C cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2, while keeps 61.4% capacity retention at 15 mA cm−2. A hybrid supercapacitor is successfully fabricated with CC/CoNi-MOF as positive electrode and reduced graphene oxide-carbon nanotube as negative electrode, possessing a maximum areal capacitance of 846 mF cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2, a high energy density of 55.5 Wh kg−1 at 175.5 W kg−1, and excellent cycling stability (96.5% after 10000 cycles). This work may pave a new way for designing MOF based materials with similar structure for high performance supercapacitors.
