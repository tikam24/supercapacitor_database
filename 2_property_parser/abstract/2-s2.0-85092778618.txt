Herein, a novel and facile electrophoretic/electrochemical deposition (EPD/ECD) method is reported for the fabrication of binder-free high-performance Fe3O4/functionalized g-C3N4 nanocomposite. In this method, through a simple EPD/ECD procedure, Fe3O4 nanoparticles are in situ simultaneously synthesized onto the edge-functionalized g-C3N4 (ef-g-C3N4) sheets electrophoretically deposited onto Ni foam. For comparison, pristine Fe3O4 nanoparticles and ef-g-C3N4 are deposited onto Ni foam via EPD and ECD procedures, respectively. The prepared materials are fully analyzed through XRD, TGA, FT-IR, Raman, FE-SEM, TEM as well as BET/BJH techniques. These analyses results verified co-deposition of fine Fe3O4 particles along with porous ef-g-C3N4 sheets onto the Ni-foam cathode, and formation of Fe3O4@ef-g-C3N4@Ni foam hybrid electrode. The formation mechanism of Fe3O4/ef-g-C3N4 nanocomposite through EPD/ECD was proposed and described in details. The electrochemical behaviors of the prepared electrodes were investigated as a binder-free supercapacitor electrodes. The results charge-discharge tests revealed that Fe3O4@ef-g-C3N4/NF is capable to deliver specific capacitance of 197.2 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and cycle life of 96.1 % and 88.5 % after 4000 continuous cycling at current densities of 0.5 and 3 A g−1, respectively, whereas the pristine Fe3O4/NF delivered only specific capacitance of 76.9 m g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and cycling stability of 87.6 % and 60.8 % at the similar conditions. These findings proved surprising positive synergistic contribution between Fe3O4 and edge-functionalized g-C3N4 to present high supercapacitive ability.
