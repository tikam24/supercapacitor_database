Transition metal phosphide alloys possess the metalloid characteristics and superior electrical conductivity and are a kind of high electrical conductive pseudocapacitive materials. Herein, high electrical conductive cobalt phosphide alloys are fabricated through a liquid phase process and a nanoparticles structure with high surface area is obtained. The highest specific capacitance of 286 F g-1 is reached at a current density of 0.5 A g-1. 63.4% of the specific capacitance is retained when the current density increased 16 times and 98.5% of the specific capacitance is maintained after 5000 cycles. The AC//CoP asymmetric supercapacitor also shows a high energy density (21.3 Wh kg-1) and excellent stability (97.8% of the specific capacitance is retained after 5000 cycles). The study provides a new strategy for the construction of high-performance energy storage materials by enhancing their intrinsic electrical conductivity.
