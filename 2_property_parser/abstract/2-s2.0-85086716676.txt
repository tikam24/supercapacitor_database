This work presents a methodology for the design of a hydrogen fuel cell-based hybrid electric power plant for hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), where a battery bank and ultracapacitors are also considered as components of the hybrid power plant. The methodology considers the design features of an electric vehicle and evaluates its energy and power requirements as to fulfil a driving cycle. The work starts by weight minimizing a fuel cell taking into consideration its physical and electrochemical characteristics. Batteries and ultracapacitors are then sized according to their dynamic response features and considering specifications from commercial candidate cells, to propose an electric configuration and specify the baseline for a hybrid power plant. In order to illustrate the methodology, a crossover utility electric vehicle and a WLTC class I drive cycle are used. This work shows that by reducing the power plant size, power and energy requirements can also be minimized and the overall performance can be increased promoting fuel and costs savings. For comparison and to show the impact of weight minimization on the energy on board and cost, this work presents the energy and power required by different power plant configurations. Results showed that including ultracapacitors to the power plant offers more benefits, such as less stress on batteries, at a marginal initial cost compared to a case without ultracapacitors, where batteries should attend transients with a limited capability for energy recovery from regenerative breaking. The methodology is easily implemented and does not large computational resources providing with a power plant baseline for further design stages, such as particular energy management approaches depending on particular priorities for the developer, such as range, productivity and performance, economy and others.
