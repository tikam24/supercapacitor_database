Graphene has recently attracted great attention because of its unique properties such as giant electron mobility, extremely high thermal conductivity, extraordinary elasticity and stiffness, and ultralarge specific surface area. In addition, graphene has attracted much attention because of its wide potential applications in nanoelectronics, energy storage and conversion, chemical and biological sensors, composite materials, and biotechnology. This chapter provides a comprehensive investigation on the current research activities that focus on the synthesis, properties, and applications of graphene-based composite nanostructures. We briefly describe the most commonly applied methodologies for the synthesis of graphene-based composite nanostructures. A range of remarkable properties is then presented. Finally, we include a brief analysis on the potential applications of graphene-based composite nanostructures in various fields including energy storage, medicine, catalysis, and development of biosensors. These studies constitute the basis for developing versatile applications of graphene-based composite nanostructures.
