The self-organization of NH4CoPO4·H2O microflowers is successfully synthesized by a mild chemical precipitation method. And different pore sized Co2P2O7 microflowers are synthesized through different calcination temperatures of NH4CoPO4·H2O microflowers. More importantly, supercapacitive performances of NH4CoPO4·H2O microflowers and porous Co2P2O7 microflowers are studied by using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements (CP), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods in 1.0 M aqueous KOH, NaOH and LiOH solutions. The results show that the crystallinity of materials has largely effect electrochemical activity of supercapacitor in different electrolytes. NH4CoPO4·H2O microflowers exhibit larger supercapacitive characteristics in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte than those of others. The specific capacitance of NH4CoPO4·H2O microflowers electrodes are up to 525 F g-1 at a current density of 0.625 A g-1 and have a long cycle life which have maintained 99.4% after 400 cycles in 1.0 M KOH. © 2013 by ESG.
