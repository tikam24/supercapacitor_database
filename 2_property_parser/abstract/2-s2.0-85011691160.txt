The discovery of new carbon materials and the reactive activation of CaC2 are challenging subjects. In this study, a series of alkynyl carbon materials (ACMs) were synthesized by the interfacial mechanochemical reaction of CaC2 with four typical polyhalogenated hydrocarbons. Their properties and structures were characterized, and their electrochemical performances were examined. The reaction was rapid and efficient arising from the intense mechanical activation of CaC2. The ACMs are micro-mesoporous materials with distinct layered structure, specific graphitization degree, and clear existence of sp-C. In addition, the ACMs exhibit high specific capacitance in the range of 57-133 F g-1 and thus can be ideal candidates for active materials used in supercapacitors. The results may imply an alternative synthesis of carbon allotropes, as well as an efficient approach for the activation of CaC2.
