In this work, we report a facile chemical precipitation method to prepare zinc manganite (ZnMn 2 O 4 ) materials. ZnMn 2 O 4 nanosheets were synthesized through a cathodic electrolytic electrodeposition (ELD), and their application as supercapacitor electrodes were evaluated. The effect of calcining temperature on the nanostructure and morphology of ZnMn 2 O 4 was investigated systematically through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), FTIR spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometery (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area measurements. Electrochemical properties of the synthesized products as electrodes in a supercapacitor device were studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in aqueous electrolyte. ZnMn 2 O 4 nanosheets exhibiting remarkable electrochemical performance in supercapacitors with specific capacitance (∼457 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 ), excellent rate capability (67.2% capacity retention at 10 A g −1 ), and good cycling stability (only 92.5% loss after 4000 cycles at 3 A g −1 ). All the results demonstrate that the synthesis route is cost-effective, facile, and can development for prepared electrode materials in electrochemical supercapacitors.
