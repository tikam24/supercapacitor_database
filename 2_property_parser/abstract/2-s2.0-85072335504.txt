The development and utilization of new energy sources has been extensively studied in the world. Here, we report the development of flexible self-supported metal-free electrodes based on non-oxidized graphene multilayer (MLG) paper containing the lead iodide nanoparticles (PbI2-NPs). The PbI2-NPs was obtained and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XDR) and Raman spectroscopy. Supercapacitor containing the PbI2-NPs in MLG electrodes was fabricated by a simple method and characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge techniques. The results show a flexible supercapacitor fashion reaching capacitance values of 154 F/g with high prospects in electronic area. Energy and power densities obtained for the pure MLG supercapacitor were 3.40 ÂµWh cm-2 and 0.73 mW cm-2, respectively. Regarding to PbI2-NPs/MLG capacitor the energy and power density obtained were 3.50 Wh kg-1 and 1.10 kW kg-1. The results herein presented open the possibility to new energy storage devices using PbI2-NPs and MLG flexible supercapacitor configuration.
