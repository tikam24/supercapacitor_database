Expanding the range of supercapacitor operation to temperatures above 100°C is important because this would enable capacitors to operate under the severe conditions required for next-generation energy storage devices. In this study, we address this challenge by the fabrication of a solid-state supercapacitor with a proton-conducting Sn 0.95 Al0.05H0.05P2O7 (SAPO)-polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) composite electrolyte and a highly condensed H3 PO4 electrode ionomer. At a temperature of 200°C, the SAPO-PTFE electrolyte exhibits a high proton conductivity of 0.02 S cm-1 and a wide withstanding voltage range of ±2 V. The H3PO4 ionomer also has good wettability with micropore-rich activated carbon, which realizes a capacitance of 210 F g-1 at 200°C. The resulting supercapacitor exhibits an energy density of 32 Wh kg-1 at 3 A g-1 and stable cyclability after 7000 cycles from room temperature to 150°C.
