To meet the power demands of various electronic devices, high-performance electrodes have been designed for use with multiple energy storage devices, from lithium batteries to supercapacitors. Graphene has many unique morphological and structural features and is important for developing highly effective devices because of its use for electrode fabrication and as a backbone for hosting other electroactive materials. Therefore, we constructed two types of novel graphene electrodes with different structures that both can be used to make binder-free electrodes: vertically aligned graphene nanosheets and freestanding, flexible, transparent graphene paper. The focus of this review is on the synthesis and properties of these graphenes and the application of related hybrid structure electrodes by our research group. The performances of these electrodes indicate that they have unlimited potential for application in the next generation of electrochemical storage devices.
