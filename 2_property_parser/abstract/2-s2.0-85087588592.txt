The research described here proposes a novel use of titanium oxide nanofibrous film as advanced electrode material for high performance supercapacitors. High frequency picosecond laser pulses were employed to generate a film of oxidized Ti on Ti substrate. Physico-chemical characterizations and morphological studies revealed the formation of fibrous TiO2 micro/nano-structures. The electrochemical measurements of the generated nanostructures showed their improved electrochemical properties and proved the feasibility of using laser pulses for fabrication of advanced electrodes with high specific capacitance. Also, our results showed by double laser processing, the average diameter of the generated TiO2 fibers decreased from 300 nm to the range of 60â€“70 nm. Combination of having higher porosity (smaller fiber diameters) and more oxidized Ti results in better supercapacitance behaviours. These studies demonstrated the usefulness of laser generated nanofibrous film as a novel electrode material for high performance supercapacitors. It can lead to promising methods for fabrication of advanced electrodes with high energy and power density with excellent cyclic stability.
