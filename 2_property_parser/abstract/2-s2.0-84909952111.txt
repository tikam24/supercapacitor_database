Carbon as electrode material can be specifically tailored for fuel cell or supercapacitor applications. For both electrode systems, specific porosity is required. Vertically aligned multiwalled carbon nanotubes or films of mesoporous carbon are functionalized by incorporating nitrogen atoms into the CNTs or by infiltrating of transition metal precursors resulting in good catalytic behavior for oxygen reduction or increased specific capacitance.
