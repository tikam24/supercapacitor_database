Three-dimensional (3D) supercapacitors have been demonstrated using vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (CNT) arrays and electroplated nickel nanoparticles. Two significant achievements have been demonstrated in this work: (1) a unique and reliable vacuum-assisted electroplating methodology for the uniform deposition of nickel nanoparticles on CNTs up to 150μm in length, and (2) usage of pseudo capacitance to significantly enhance the energy density of CNT supercapacitors up to one order of magnitude higher than those without nickel nanoparticles coating. Experimental results show robust operation of more than 100 times charge/discharge tests. ©2010 IEEE.
