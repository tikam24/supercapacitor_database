In this work, spherical NiCo2O4/CuS composites was synthesized by hydrothermal method. As electrode material, it possesses high specific capacitance (2169 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1), while maintaining excellent stability with about 123% capacitance retention after 7000 cycles at 1 A g−1. The asymmetric supercapacitor based NiCo2O4/CuS electrode exhibits a high energy density of 173.5 W h kg−1 at at a power density of 360 W kg−1 and can provide power supply for red LEDs indicator. This is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of CuS and NiCo2O4, which promotes electron transport and electrolyte ion diffusion.
