The proceedings contain 157 papers. The topics discussed include: a novel anti-collision protocol for energy efficient identification and monitoring in RFID-enhanced WSNs; flexible classification on heterogeneous multicore appliance platforms; improving load balancing with multipath routing; localized bridging centrality for distributed network analysis; a distributed routing algorithm for networks with data-path services; jitter buffer analysis; an empirical energy model for supercapacitor powered wireless sensor nodes; iterative decoding for redistributing energy consumption in wireless sensor networks; resource management schemes for multiple traffic in integrated heterogeneous wireless and mobile networks; fair randomized antenna allocation in asynchronous MIMO multi-hop networks; bandwidth consumption control and service differentiation for video streaming; and multi-modal target tracking using heterogeneous sensor networks.
