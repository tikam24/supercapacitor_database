Due to their random input variations, the wind generator and photovoltaic (PV) systems located in a hybrid power system produce fluctuated output power, voltage and frequency making it difficult to meet demand and provide reliable and stable services to the customers. Energy storage device provides a solution to this power quality issue. The energy storage system can be regulated through an internet based supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system, which makes them vulnerable to cyber-attacks that may significantly affect the power quality of the hybrid power system. This work analyzes the effects of cyber-attacks on the power quality of hybrid power system. The cyber-attacks have been considered for the supercapacitor energy storage (SES) system. Simulations have been performed by using the Matlab/Simulink software. Simulation results show that the power quality of the hybrid power system is deteriorated due to cyber-attacks on the SES.
