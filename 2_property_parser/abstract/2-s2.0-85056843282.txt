The three-dimensional (3D) nickel-cobalt double hydroxides nanosheets in situ grown on nitrogen-containing activated carbon (NAC/NiCo-DHs) were obtained via a simple solvothermal method. The NAC activated by low-cost green calcium chloride as a substrate greatly enhances the conductivity and specific surface area of the materials, and the unique sheet structure of NAC/NiCo-DHs facilitates the transport of charges. The electrochemical test results show that NAC/NiCo-DHs have a high specific capacitance of 1920 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, outstanding high-rate capability, with 85.4% retention after a 20-fold increase in current densities, and excellent cycling stability with 95.54% specific capacitance retained after 1000 cycles at 20 A g−1, and even after 2000 cycles, the capacitance retention rate of the material can still reach 71.37%. In addition, NAC/NiCo-DHs//AC device exhibits a maximum energy density and power density of 54.8 Wh kg−1 and 8000 W kg−1, and a remarkable cycling stability with 81.86% retention level after 2500 cycles at 5 A g−1, indicating that it has great potential as an energy storage device.
