In order to enhance the security, stability and economic operational capability of a DC microgrid effectively, an optimal control strategy of a Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) based on model predictive control theory is proposed. According to the characteristics of the supercapacitor & storage battery, system security requirements and various constraints, a prediction model of a DC microgrid with hybrid energy storage system is established. By defining the optimization index, the energy optimization management strategy is designed and transformed into a quadratic programming problem to be solved, and this realizes a reasonable power dispatch in the DC microgrid. In addition, a power control method for the system without constraints is proposed. The simulation results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed optimal management strategy.
