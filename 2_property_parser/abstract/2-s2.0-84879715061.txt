NiMH batteries are being used in hybrid electrical vehicles (HEVs) with demonstrated safety, reliability and cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, the lack of specific power of the battery restricts its wide adoption. In this study, a NiMH battery based supercapacitor (Ni-Cap) is designed specifically to be charged and discharged at very high rates up to 20C, delivering high specific power (3000W/kg) and energy (38.5Wh/kg). Various tests show that the Ni-cap holds energy well, has a long cycle time, a wide operating window and is tolerant to abusive conditions. The Ni-cap is suitable for HEV or micro-hybrid (stop and start system) energy storage applications. Â©The Electrochemical Society.
