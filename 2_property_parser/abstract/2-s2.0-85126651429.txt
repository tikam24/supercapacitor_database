Adding redox mediators in an aqueous electrolyte is one of effective methods to enhance the energy storage capacity of biomass activated carbon, however, the Coulombic efficiency is dissatisfied to meet the applied demand. In this paper, we propose the challenge can be met by designing adjustable dual redox electrolyte. Biomass activated carbon (TAC) with a specific surface area of 2521.8 m2•g−1 is prepared by waste tea-leaves using pre-carbonization and activation with KOH. In a three-electrode system, the specific capacitance of TAC is 358.6 F•g−1 in 1M H2SO4 at a current density of 1A•g−1. After introducing 0.05M Na2MoO4, as a redox addictive, the specific capacitance is 856.67 F•g−1, but the Coulombic efficiency is as high as 169.2% due to the irreversible reactions. To adjust the Coulombic efficiency, KBr is added to fabricate a dual redox electrolyte. The amazing results are that the specific capacitance of TAC is as high as 1901.36 F•g−1, which is 5.3 times higher than that in 1M H2SO4, and the Coulombic efficiency is back to a rational value (100.7%). A symmetric supercapacitor (TAC-RE) with the optimized electrolyte is assembled, which exhibits an excellent energy density of 57.52 Wh•kg−1 when a power density is 980 W•kg−1. The application of powering three LED demonstrates TAC-RE has desirable capacitive performances, especially is a kind of low-cost energy storage devices.
