Active carbons have unique physicochemical properties, but their conductivities and surface to weight ratios are much poorer than graphene. A unique and facile method is innovated to chemically process biomass by “drilling” holes with H2O2 and exfoliating into graphene-like nanosheets with HAc, followed by carbonization at a high temperature for highly graphitized activated carbon with greatly enhanced porosity, unique pore structure, high conductivity, and large surface area. This graphene-like carbon exhibits extremely high specific capacitance (340 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1) and high specific energy density (23.33 to 16.67 W h kg−1) with excellent rate capability and long cycling stability (remains 98% after 10 000 cycles), which is much superior to all reported carbons including graphene. Synthesis mechanism for deriving biomass into porous graphene-like carbons is discussed in detail. The enhancement mechanism for the porous graphene-like carbon electrode reveals that rationally designed meso- and macropores are very critical in porous electrode performance, which can network micropores for diffusion freeways, high conductivity, and high utilization. This work has universal significance in producing highly porous and conductive carbons from biomass including biowastes for various energy storage/conversion applications.
