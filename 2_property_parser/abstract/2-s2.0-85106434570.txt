In this study, the energy-storage potential of PVA/borax material for practical usage is investigated according to the doping level of graphite. For this purpose, cyclic voltammetry (CV), Raman spectrometry, and optical microscopy characterization techniques are employed. The characterization results indicate that the energy-storage capacity of PVA/borax increases along with graphite-doping level. However, as the amount of graphite doping increases, the polymer loses its self-healing properties. Even though 50% doping provides higher capacitance value, its unstable behavior and lack of self-healing make it unfavorable. On the other hand, 10% doping samples exhibit modest capacitance with good self-healing and supercapacitive properties for both electrolyte and electrode applications. The results highlighted that the fabricated PVA/graphite/borax (PGB) samples can be utilized for supercapacitor applications.
