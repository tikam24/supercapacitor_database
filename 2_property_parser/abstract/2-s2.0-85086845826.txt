In this academic research, highly efficient and novel material of CoNi2S4@Ni(OH)2 nanosheet arrays (NSAs) carried on Ni foam was experimented using a simplistic and novel hydrothermal technique. Based on the morphology's and other physical investigations of the as-developed composite was analyzed, which results suggest that the Ni(OH)2 nanoparticles have been effectively anchored into the binary CoNi2S4 nanoflake array (NFAs) surface. The composite of CoNi2S4-Ni(OH)2 NSAs nanoarchitecture contributes superior surface area with huge number of active sites to boost electrochemical reactions and excellent conveyance between electrons and ions, as we compared to CoNi2S4 NFAs. Meanwhile, taking consider to electrochemical studies, the composite CoNi2S4-Ni(OH)2 NSAs exhibited extraordinary Faradaic redox progress, which was different from the metal-oxide based electrodes profiles. Due to the fact of better electrical conductivity with finest pseudocapacitance material of Ni(OH)2 in combination with the quick transportation of ion/electron pathways of CoNi2S4 nanoflake arrays, the procured unique construction of CoNi2S4@Ni(OH)2 NSAs exhibits an boosted up pseudocapacitive capabilities of about 251.3 mA h g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, which was almost two-fold superior than that of the pristine CoNi2S4 nanoflake arrays (NFAs) sample (134.2 mA h g−1). Interestingly, the composite CoNi2S4@Ni(OH)2 NSAs electrode delivered finest cycling stability which was 97.91% preserved after 5000 long-cycles. For that reasons, the novel composite of CoNi2S4@Ni(OH)2 NSAs electrode can be favorable energy storage sources for high capability supercapacitors (SCs) applications.
