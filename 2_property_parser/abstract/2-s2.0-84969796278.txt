RGO/Resol carbon composites were prepared from a mixture of reduced GO and a low-molecular-weight phenolic resin (Resol) solution. The effects of the calcination temperature, amount of Resol added and KOH treatment on the electrochemical performance of the RGO/Resol composites were investigated. The physical and electrochemical properties of the composite materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) surface areas measurements, and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The relationships between their physical properties and their electrochemical performance were examined for use as supercapacitors (SCs). The RGO/Resol composite calcined at 400Â°C after the KOH loading showed dramatically improved electrochemical properties, showing a high BET surface and capacitance of 2190 m2/g and 220 F/g, respectively. The RGO/Resol composites calcined after the KOH treatment showed much better capacitor performance than those treated only thermally at the same temperature without KOH impregnation. The fabrication of high surface electrodes was essential for improving the SCs properties.
