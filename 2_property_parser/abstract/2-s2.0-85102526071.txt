Polyaniline (PANI) in the nano form was prepared by a simple sol-gel method. The prepared PANI was carbonized under a direct nitrogen gas carbonization method to produce carbonized polyaniline (CPANI). The difference in morphology and structure of the two prepared materials were studied and characterized for structure and morphological analysis by FT-IR spectrometry, X-ray diffractometry, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy. The Nano-PANI and C-PANI had a pore diameter of 84.96 and 90.86 nm which surface areas of 18.8 and 14.42 m2/g respectively. The prepared Nano-PANI was in emeraldine salt state; C-PANI was completely carbonized. The prepared materials were applied as electrode coating materials on the copper sheet which acted as a substrate and it produced a uniform smooth coating. This is promising and can further be studied for electrochemical applications. Further work is ongoing to ascertain its' electrochemical capacitance properties. The method of preparation of the Nano-PANI and Nano C-PANI is eco-friendly and simple for the production of mass material for industrial purposes.
