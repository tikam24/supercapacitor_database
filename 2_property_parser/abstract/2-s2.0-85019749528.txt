Manganese oxides with an alpha crystal structure are synthesized via combined solid-state reaction and wet chemical processing, which is a simple and inexpensive synthetic route easy for mass production. The effects of the synthetic reaction duration and the temperature of acid treatments on crystal structure, morphology, and electrochemical capacitive properties of α-MnO2 are discussed. It is evidenced that the samples treated in acid for a longer time at 25 °C display the uniform nanorods that are aggregated to form micro-buildings with fine features on the surface of rods. This microstructure possesses large surface areas and more active sites that are easy to access electrochemically, leading to a better electrochemical capacitive performance. We expected that these results would provide the practical information for shape-and morphology-controlled synthesis for nanostructured functional materials in supercapacitor applications.
