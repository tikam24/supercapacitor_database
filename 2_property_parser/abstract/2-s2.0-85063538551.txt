In this work, we have synthesized a nearly two-dimensional serrated structure of NiCoO 2 on nickel foam by simple hydrothermal method and heat treatment. In this strategy, the serrated structure of NiCoO 2 can be optimized by controlling the time of hydrothermal reaction. Electrochemical results show that its mass specific capacity reaches up to 778.5 C g −1 (1.68 C cm −2 ) at current density of 0.5 A g −1 . Meanwhile, it is very impressed that the specific capacitance value of 603.5 C g −1 can be maintained at a high current density of 40 A g −1 , indicating an excellent rate capability of as-prepared NiCoO 2 material. Further, the practical application of serrated NiCoO 2 /NF as positive electrode is also evaluated by using asymmetric supercapacitor device. These excellent electrochemical properties further promote its application as a supercapacitor electrode.
