Electrochemical performance of carbon materials can be enhanced by doping with heteroatoms. Electrochemical investigations suggest that the B-doped graphene in which B-source and graphene oxide are in the ratio 1 : 1 demonstrates a highest specific capacitance of 406 F/g at 2 A/g in 1 M H2SO4. The specific capacity of B-doped graphene in 0.01 M hydroquinone (HQ)/H2SO4 is 2523 C/g in redox additive electrolyte. Performance evaluation of fabricated symmetric supercapacitor cell indicates that the specific capacitance in 0.01 M HQ/H2SO4 and 1 M H2SO4 solution are found to be 440 and 284 F/g at 3 A/g, respectively and greater than EMIMBF4 (97 F/g). The maximum specific energy of the fabricated symmetric cell achieved using 0.01 M HQ/H2SO4 solution is found to be 50 Wh/kg which is comparatively superior than 1 M H2SO4 (14.2 Wh/kg) and EMIMBF4 (30 Wh/kg).
