Two-dimensional (2D) material of Nb2SnC was prepared by a mild and simple solid-state reaction for high performance supercapacitors. The prepared Nb2SnC were etched and further exfoliated in diverse solvents. The morphology development was observed by SEM and the results suggest Nb2SnC treated by hydrofluoric solution (HF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in sequence has a large surface area. Moreover, the phase and chemical properties of treated Nb2SnC were characterized by XRD, EDS and XPS. In this work, the electrochemical performances were recorded by Solartron 1287 Potentiostat Galvanostat workstation. It is revealed that the specific capacitance (Cs) of pristine Nb2SnC is only 25 ​F ​g−1 at a scanning rate of 2 ​mV ​s−1. Remarkably, the Cs was increased to 128 ​F ​g−1 at the same scanning rate after etched by HF for 48 ​h. Upon optimization, Nb2SnC–HF exfoliated by DMSO exhibits a capacitance of 140 ​F ​g−1 owing to the large electrochemical active surface. Promoting for practical applications, Nb2SnC based devices were assemble. The fabricated devices contributed to an energy density of 14.4 ​Wh kg−1 at the power density of 36 ​W ​kg−1 with a good stability within 0 V–0.8 ​V. Therefore, Nb2SnC is a highly promising candidate for energy storage systems with excellent electrochemical performances.
