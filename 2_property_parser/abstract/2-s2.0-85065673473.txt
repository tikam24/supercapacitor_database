The electrochemical storage properties of graphite//activated carbon electrodes were investigated in glutaronitrile based electrolytes. The specific capacitance of activated carbon was determined from the galvanostatic charge/discharge curve between 2.0 and 4.4 V versus Li+/Li. The capacitance values were found to be 93 F.g-1. The drawback concerning the corrosion of aluminium collectors was not observed in dinitrile based electrolyte. Finally, we have studied the electrochemical behavior of intercalation-deintercalation of Li+ in the graphite electrode with glutaronitrile-LiTFSI electrolyte. Glutaronitrile based electrolyte will be discussed in terms of high-energy and high-power lithium-ion capacitors as future electricity storage technology.
