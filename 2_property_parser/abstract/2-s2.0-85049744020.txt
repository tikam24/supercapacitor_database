Supercapacitors (SCs) has gained an impressive concentration by the researchers due to its advantages such as high energy and power densities, long cyclic life, rapid chargeâ€“discharge rates, low maintenance and desirable safety. Hence it has been widely utilized in energy storage and conversion devices. Among the different components of SC, electrodes play a vital role in the performances of SCs. In this review, we present the recent advances in 2-D nanostructured metal nitrides, carbides, and phosphides based materials for SC electrodes. Finally, the electrochemical stability and designing approach for the future advancement of the electrode materials are also highlighted.
