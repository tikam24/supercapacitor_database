A flexible electrode of flower shaped vanadium dioxide (VO2) with the incorporation of polyaniline (PANI) is designed by a facile synthesis procedure to confront the hurdles possessed by vanadium-based oxides in the development of flexible supercapacitor. As a result of PANI incorporation with VO2, the developed organic-inorganic electrode (VO2@PANI) exhibits a high specific capacitance of 700 F/g and a rate capability of 86.7%, is achieved after 10,000 cyclic performance. These unique hybrid systems of the inorganic-organic combination have the ability to fulfill the urge for the development of new functional materials for energy storage applications.
