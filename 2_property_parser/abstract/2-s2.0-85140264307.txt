In this work, a sandwich heterostructure CoNiLDH-rGO-CoNi2S4 nanosheet array is prepared by electrochemical deposition and hydrothermal synthesis using nickel foam (NF) as the conductive current collector, which is then applied to asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs). Furthermore, the open-pore framework integrated by cross-linked CoNiLDH and CoNi2S4 nanosheets gives rise to a honeycomb-like hierarchical nanostructure. Due to the maximum synergistic effect of the ultrathin CoNiLDH inner-layer, conductive rGO interlayers and CoNi2S4 outer-layer, the electrode exhibits fast electron/ion transport, high efficiency and excellent electrochemical performance. The CoNiLDH-rGO-CoNi2S4 electrode allows a high mass loading of 7 mg cm−2, while maintaining a high specific capacitance of 2101 F g−1 (14.708 F cm−2) at 1 A g−1 (7 mA cm−2). Its aqueous asymmetric device delivers a mass specific capacitance of 101.3 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. Additionally, an LED can be lit up for more than 1 h when two ASCs are connected in series. The all-solid-state ASC device also gives a high energy density of 1.12 W h cm−3 at a power density of 32.25 W cm−3. This work proposes a method to obtain high areal capacitive performance and volumetric energy density of thick electrodes by designing nanostructures with efficient synergistic effects.
