In the last decade, supercapacitors possessing high power density and cyclic stability have attracted great interests in various applications. Graphene-based composite electrodes are known as a promising candidate for supercapacitors due to synergistic effects. For the first time, in this work, we develop a simple one-step hydrothermal synthesis of graphene wrapped Ni3S2 nanocubes (rGO-Ni3S2) composite for high-performance and low-cost supercapacitor electrodes. The rGO-Ni3S2 electrode exhibits an ultrahigh specific capacity of 616 C g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1 with excellent cycling durability of 92.7% after 5000 cycles, which is much better when compared with the counterpart without graphene (pure Ni3S2). We attribute the remarkable performance of the rGO-Ni3S2 electrode to the synergistic effects of the graphene as the conductive support and Ni3S2 cubics as the pseudocapacitive material. This work constitutes a step forward towards the development of low-cost and high-performance supercapacitors for the next generation of portable electronics.
