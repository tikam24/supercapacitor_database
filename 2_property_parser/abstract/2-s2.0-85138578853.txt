An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is proposed by employing fluorine-doped NiCu layered double hydroxide (Ni4CuLDH/F) cathode and nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) anode. The Ni4CuLDH/F obtained a substantially dispersed structure and multiple active sites after fluorine ion doping, while the N-rGO achieved crimped graphene layers and additional pseudocapacitive properties after nitrogen doping. The Ni4CuLDH/F prepared by a low-temperature titration method displayed a considerable specific capacitance of 1780 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. Also, the capacitance of the hydrothermally prepared N-rGO intensified from 287 F g−1 to 392 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with a wider potential window. Besides, an ASC based on the two electrodes presented an outstanding energy density of 54.0 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 375 W kg−1 with distinguished cycling capability (59% retention over 10000 cycles). Overall, the ASC reveals a tremendous possibility for practical implementation in the arena of high-performance supercapacitors.
