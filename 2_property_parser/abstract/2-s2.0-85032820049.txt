Polyaniline (PANI) is one of the most attractive materials for pseudocapacitors. To enhance the electrolyte diffusion and improve the electrochemical performance of the electrode, the well-designed morphology of PANI is required. Incorporating carbon materials is also benefic on enhancing the cycling stability as well as the mechanical and electrochemical properties of PANI. In this study, a simple solution method is applied to synthesize the particle-deposited tube-like PANI. Due to the well-defined structure, a specific capacitance (CF) of 437.8 F/g is achieved at the current density of 4 A/g. Furthermore, the self-synthesized graphene oxide (GO) is simply mixed with the particle-deposited tube-like PANI to make a more efficient electrocapacitive material. An enhanced CF value of 475.0 F/g is achieved for the optimized PANI/GO electrode, owing to the synergic effects of the pseudo-capacitance from PANI and the functional groups of GO, as well as the electrochemical double-layered capacitance from GO. After conducting 2000 cycles repeated charge/discharge process, the CF retention of 90% and the average Coulombic efficiency of higher than 90% are also attained for the optimized PANI/GO electrode.
