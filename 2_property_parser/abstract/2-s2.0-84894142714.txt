The amplitude and frequency of the voltage obtained from renewable energy sources change because the environmental conditions change continuously. This situation causes ripples, harmonics and faults on loads. Therefore, it is important to fix the voltage on the load busses. In wind energy systems, continuous change in wind speed results in varying load voltage. In order to discard this situation, there is a need for controlled power conditioning devices which will fix the voltage at desired levels. In this paper, a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) which is designed to stabilize the voltage value of the load busses fed by Wind Turbine/Super capacitor (WT/SC) hybrid energy system. The improvement obtained with the proposed method is depicted by comparing the results with those of PI controller. All the system is designed in MATLAB/Simulink environment.
