Among the lithium metal oxides for asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor, Li4Ti5O12(LTO) is an emerging electrode material as zero-stain material in volume change during the with the charging and discharging processes. The pulverized LTO powder was observed to show the enhanced capacity from 120 mAh/g to 156 mAh/g at C-rate (10, 100 C). Hybrid supercapacitor module(48V, 416F) was fabricated using an asymmetric hybrid capacitor with a capacitance of 7500F. As a result of the measurement of C-rate characteristics, the module shows that the discharge time is drastically reduced at more than 50C, and the ESR and voltage drop characteristics are increased. The energy density and power density were reduced under high C-rate conditions. When designing asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor module, the C-rate and ESR should be considered As a result of measuring the 5 kw UPS, it was discharged at the current of 116A∼170A during the discharge in the voltage range of 48V∼30V, and the compensation time at discharge was measured to be about 33.2s. Experimental results show that it can be applied to applications related to stabilization of power quality by applying hybrid supercapacitor module.
