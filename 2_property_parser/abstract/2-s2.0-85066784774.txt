Novel copper-doped manganese ferrite nanoparticles were synthesized using a low-cost facile route via. hydrothermal method which provided high surface area and good conductivity for use as functional materials for storing and producing energy. A “hybrid mix” of the nano-ferrites with polyaniline showed a phenomenal influence on the investigated electrochemical properties. The hybrid mix gave maximum specific capacitance of 478.797 mAh/g of the symmetrical supercapacitor at 1 A/g current density and displayed an excellent cycling stability with capacitance retention of 78% after 5000 cycles. Morphology and structural analysis was carried out using Transmission electron microscope, Field-emission scanning electron microscope, and Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy in detail. The interactive mechanism between the CuxMn(1-x)Fe2O4 and PANI in the CuxMn(1-x)Fe2O4@PANI hybrid electrode material was investigated using RAMAN and X-ray photoelectron microscopy. In addition, the proposed energy storage system has been constructed without using any binder which simplified the electrode fabrication process by preventing the contact resistance between the electrode and current collector.
