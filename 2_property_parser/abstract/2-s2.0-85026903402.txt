The reduced graphene oxide/carbon nanotube hybrid fibers (G/CNTs) were prepared by a facile chemical reduction and self-assembly strategy at low temperature. SEM images indicate a certain degree of reduced graphene oxide nanosheets and carbon nanotube orientation along the main axis of the obtained hybrid fibers. The reduced graphene oxide/carbon nanotube hybrid fibers exhibit large surface area of 149.85 m2 g−1 and good mechanical strength. The electrochemical performances of hybrid fibers as flexible and binder-free electrodes are evaluated by using a three-electrode system, and it displays high specific capacitance of 243.0 Fg−1 at a current density of 200 mA g−1, which is mainly ascribed to porous structure and large specific surface area. The as-synthesized reduced graphene oxide/carbon nanotube hybrid fibers will be potential candidate for flexible and binder-free electrodes for supercapacitors.
