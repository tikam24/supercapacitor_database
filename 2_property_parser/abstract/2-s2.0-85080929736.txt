In this paper, we develop an energy management supervisor used to control power flow in a fuel cell electric vehicle, including a proton exchange membrane fuel cell and a supercapacitor. Our Target is to minimize the hydrogen consumption of a Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) Fuel Cell. In order to perform this goal, the system is controlled through an Energy Management Strategy (EMS), to minimize the fuel cell power demand transitions and therefore improves its durability. The model of the studied system parts and the control strategy are developed using MATLAB software. Simulation results of our designed plan demonstrate a 40% gain in hydrogen consumption through the recovered energy from braking phases.
