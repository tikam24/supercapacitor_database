We report a facile approach to large scale synthesis of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) materials at room temperature with hydrazine hydrate. As-prepared GO and RGO materials were characterized by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray Diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy techniques. Electrochemical tests of RGO materials have been performed using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements under aqueous solution. The maximum specific capacitance of 112.6 F g−1 for RGO material has been obtained to be at a current density of 1 A g−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution. The materials showed good cyclic stability up to 500 cycles and the degradation of the specific capacitance is only less than 3%. The simple approach and scalable synthesis of present study, is an efficient route to produce RGO sheets with low cost and is a promising material for potential supercapacitor applications.
