A negative electrode is constructed based on MnSn(OH)6 nanocubes prepared by a simple precipitation method at room temperature for supercapacitor application. The as-prepared material was structurally and morphologically characterized with the help of XRD, FT-IR, Raman, XPS, FESEM, and HRTEM analyses. The uniform structure and fine edge morphology with high conductivity due to oxygen vacancies promote the redox reaction, which results in high pseudocapacitance. The electrochemical performance is investigated through a three-electrode cell system in a negative potential window (âˆ’ 1.0 to 0.0 V). A maximum specific capacitance of 209 F/g is calculated at a specific current of 1 A/g. The electrodes also exhibit excellent cycling stability (79% specific capacitance retention after 3000 consecutive GCD cycles). Graphical Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
