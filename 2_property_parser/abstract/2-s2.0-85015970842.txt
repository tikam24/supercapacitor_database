Developing times have given rise to abundant opportunities to innovate new energy storage devices. One such energy device that has emerged as a trend is super and hybrid capacitors. It has found various applications in automotive industry, small energy devices, small scale electronic circuitry, hybrid vehicles etc. The integral elements in a hybrid capacitor are the current collectors, electrolyte, separators, electrode loading material and binders. Each of these elements affects the hybrid capacitor changing its energy storage capabilities. Researchers have been studying on these aspects of a hybrid capacitor but there is also a need to investigate upon the binder based electrode loading material and its effects on the current collector holding capacity. This paper consists of trials on binder based hybrid capacitor with grades of current collector.
