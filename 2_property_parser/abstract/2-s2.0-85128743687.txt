Polyaniline (PANI) has received significant attention in basic and applied studies because it has electrical and electrochemical properties comparable to conventional semiconductors and metals. PANI's electrical and electrochemical properties can be controlled through its preparation methods. Accordingly, in the present work, two different samples of PANI were prepared by the polymerization of aniline monomer via in situ polymerization method using two different oxidizers of dichromate (PANI (1)) and persulphate (PANI (2)). The products were blended with BaTiO3 (BTO) to form BTO@PANI composites. The composites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). SEM illustrated the covering of PANI layers on the BTO nanoparticles. The electrical and electrochemical properties of the prepared composites were studied. The BTO@PANI(2) composite sample showed a conductivity of 1.2 × 10–3 S/cm higher than that found for each BTO@PANI(1) 9.1 × 10–4 S/cm and its constituents. The supercapacity showed higher capacity values of 70 F/g, and 76 F/g for BTO@PANI(1), and BTO@PANI(2), respectively, which are higher than its constituents.
