Fast trolleybus acceleration causes high power peaks in the overhead network. For this reason, smoothing of power peaks has been a topical issue in the field of electric public transport. In part, this can be achieved through energy storage systems capable of storing braking energy that can be reused during the next acceleration. This paper compares the possibilities to apply mobile energy storage systems for two trolleybus types of standard Škoda 24Tr and articulated Škoda 27Tr. Idealized motion simulations were made in Matlab/Simullnk environment.
