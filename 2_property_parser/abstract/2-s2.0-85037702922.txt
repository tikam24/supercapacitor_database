The authors regret a mistake in reporting the testing conditions of the two-electrode system of supercapacitors. On page 13011, lefi column, line 2, the sentence "Specifically, it was composed of a glassy fibrous separator and our samples in 6 M KOH solution." should read "Specifically, it was composed of a glassy fibrous separator and our samples in 6 M KOH solution or 1 M Et4NBF4/PC electrolyte (Et4NBF4 tetraethylammonium tetra?uoroborate; PC propylene carbonate)." On page 13016, right column, line 9, the sentence "To evaluate its application as electrodes, a supercapacitor based on the asprepared ITC-JG-900 was assembled" should read "To evaluate its application as electrodes, a supercapacitor based on the asprepared ITC-JG-900 was assembled in 1 M Et4NBF4/PC electrolyte". On page 13017, lefi column, line 8, the sentence "this value still remains at 38.8 W h kg-1 at a high power density of 12 500 W h kg-1 in 6 M KOH" should read "this value still remains at 38.8 W h kg-1 at a high power density of 12 500 W h kg-1 in 1 M Et4NBF4/PC electrolyte". The Royal Society of Chemistry apologises for these errors and any consequent inconvenience to authors and readers.
