Supercapacitors have potential for use in space applications. To support their use in this area, the durability of the component materials and the device performances in the space environment need to be investigated. This work investigated the effects of proton irradiations on graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) materials and supercapacitor electrodes containing them. The results indicated that RGO-based supercapacitor electrodes could maintain their electronic performance after proton irradiation, whereas the GO-based supercapacitor electrodes could not maintain their electronic performance after proton irradiation. The changes in the material properties of GO and RGO due to proton irradiation are also presented, which provide evidences for the changes in the performance of the supercapacitors. Our results may foster the use of graphene-based supercapacitors for space applications.
