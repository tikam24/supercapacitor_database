Single-handed, helical, 4,4′-biphenylene-bridged polybissilsesquioxane nanotubes were prepared by using the self-assemblies of a pair of chiral low-molecular-weight gelators as templates. Single-handed, helical, carbon/silica nanotubes were obtained after carbonization of the self-assemblies, and single-handed helical carbonaceous nanotubes were then obtained by removal of silica with aqueous HF. Samples were characterized by using field-emission SEM, TEM, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, Raman spectroscopy, and circular dichroism. The polysilsesquioxane and carbonaceous structures exhibited optical activity. The walls of the carbon/silica and carbonaceous nanotubes were predominantly amorphous carbon. The surface area of the left-handed, helical, carbonaceous nanotubes was 1439 m2 g-1, and such materials have potential applications as catalyst supports, chirality sensors, supercapacitor electrodes, and adsorbents. Twisted silsters: Single-handed, helical, carbonaceous nanotubes are obtained by the carbonization of 4,4′-biphenylene-bridged polybissilsesquioxane and removal of silica with aqueous HF (see picture). The nanotubes exhibit optical activity and high surface area, which leads to potential applications as catalyst supports, chirality sensors, supercapacitor electrodes, and adsorbents.
