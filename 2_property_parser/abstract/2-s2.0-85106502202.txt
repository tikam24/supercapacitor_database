In this study, Tin oxide (SnO2) nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized through a facile hydrothermal method. The structural, morphological, elemental analysis were characterized for the as prepared SnO2 NPs by using different characterization techinques. The morphology of SnO2 NPs were in spherical shape with ultra size in the range 3 to 9 nm observed using transmission electron microcscopy technique. The prepared SnO2 NPs effect on the photocatalytic activity, dielectric and supercapacitor properties were studied. The influence of pH levels at different pH-conditions 8, 10 and 12 with respect to particle size/shape variation of SnO2 NPs were invesigated. Also analysized for optical, photocatalytic decolorization, dielectric and supercapacitor properties were carried out.
