A protic ionic liquid (PIL), [Phne][HSO4], was reported for the preparation of N/S-codoped carbon materials (N/S-CM) as a programmable nitrogen and sulfur-containing precursor. The [Phne][HSO4] was obtained by a simple neutralization reaction between phenothiazine and sulfuric acid, followed by directly carbonation and subsequent chemical activation by KOH. The obtained N/S-CM shows features including a large specific surface area (SBET), high porosity, and doped nitrogen/sulfur atoms. Using as an electrode material in supercapacitor, it has exhibited a high specific capacitance of 430 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 and an excellent stability with only about 10% capacity loss after 5000 cycles, which made it a promising electrode material for supercapacitor.
