The present investigation deals with the synthesis of nickel oxide (NiO)/zinc manganite (ZnMn2O4) nanocomposites (NCs) by a two-step approach. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern revealed the existence of face-centered cubic (FCC) phase of NiO and tetragonal rutile phase structure of ZnMn2O4 in NiO/ZnMn2O4 NCs. The optical properties of NiO/ZnMn2O4NCs have been investigated by the UV-diffuse reflectance Spectroscopy (UV-DRS) and photoluminescence (PL) spectral analysis. The surface morphology and elemental composition of NiO/ZnMn2O4NCs was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDX) analysis. The surface area and the nature of porosity of the samples were analyzed using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The electrochemical properties were investigated from the cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. In 0.5 M potassium hydroxide (KOH) electrolyte solution, NiO/ZnMn2O4NCs exhibited higher specific capacitance of 886 F/g at a current density of 1Ag−1 with high cyclic stability over 1000 charge–discharging cycles. Thus, the result demonstrates that the prepared NiO/ZnMn2O4NCs is a promising electrode material for future energy-storage devices.
