In this study, polythiophene (PTh), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), or graphene oxide (GO) and carbon black (CB) nanocomposites (rGO/PTh/CB and GO/PTh/CB) have been prepared chemically and electrospinning method for two-electrode symmetric attractive application prospects for supercapacitors. They have been synthesized by an easy procedure and cheaper than most of the other thiophene-based materials in the literature. Nanocomposites are characterized by Fourier-transform infrared–attenuated total reflection spectroscopy (FTIR–ATR), scanning electron microscopy–energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM–EDX), atomic force microscopy (AFM), thermal gravimetric analysis–differential thermal analysis (TGA–DTA), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area, and Four-point probe conductivity analysis. The highest electrical conductivity was calculated as 22.4 × 10–4 S × cm−1 for PTh due to the good conjugation of π–π bonds. The highest specific capacitance (C sp = 930.63 F × g−1 by CV method at 2 mV × s−1), capacitance retention (~ 92.57% at 1000 cycles at 100 mV × s−1 by CV method), energy density (E = 42.47 Wh × kg−1) and power density (P = 1532 W × kg−1 by GCD method) were obtained for rGO/PTh/CB nanocomposite. With the addition of PTh and CB on GO material, the specific capacitance was increased 6.86 times from C sp = 135.62 F × g−1 for rGO to C sp = 930.62 F × g−1 for rGO/PTh/CB nanocomposite at 2 mV × s−1 by CV method. In addition, R s(C 1 R ct(C 2 R 1)) circuit model was applied to interpret electrical parameters of supercapacitors. The results of this investigation demonstrate that rGO/PTh/CB nanocomposite can be successfully used as a supercapacitor technology. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
