Island power systems exhibit distinct features with respect to interconnected ones due to their isolated nature and small size and the cost of the fuel for power generation. Endesa has led a research and demonstration project (STORE) on testing the state of the art of Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) to address specific issues of small island power systems. Applications such as peak-shaving, voltage control, frequency control have been implemented. Power systems of the Spanish Canary Islands were used as test bench. STORE project comprises three ESSs of different technologies: a 4 MW - 20 MWs ultra-capacitor bank installed in La Palma power system, a 500 kW-18 MWs flywheel installed in La Gomera power system and a 1 MW /3 MWh Li-ion battery installed in Gran Canaria system. Gran Canaria battery is aimed at providing peak shaving and voltage control services. Both La Palma ultra-capacitor and La Gomera flywheel are aimed at frequency stability and control enhancement. Power electronic conversion as well as control systems of the three ESSs will be described. Actual records of tests and operational experience will be shown.
