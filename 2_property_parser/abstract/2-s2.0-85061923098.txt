Diatoms are three-dimensional (3D) natural biomaterials produced by unicellular algae with unique nano-and micro-morphologies, with numerous excellent structures. Diatom nanotechnology is a new research field emerging in recent years. It has been studied and applied in many fields such as biology, sensor, adsorption, nano-transport and new energy. Due to its special porous three-dimensional structure, high specific surface area and the combining with or transforming to other conductors or semiconductor materials, it has been widely used in energy storage and low cost natural electrode materials. According to the research status of this material both at home and abroad, the applications of diatom-based composites in other energy equipments such as supercapacitors, batteries and solar cells are demonstrated.
