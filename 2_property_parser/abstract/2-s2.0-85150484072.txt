Laser writing is a fast and efficient technology that can produce graphene with a high surface area, whereas laser-induced graphene (LIG) has been widely used in both physics and chemical device application. It is necessary to update this important progress because it may provide a clue to consider the current challenges and possible future directions. In this review, the basic principles of LIG fabrication are first briefly described for a detailed understanding of the lasing process. Subsequently, we summarize the physical device applications of LIGs and describe their advantages, including flexible electronics and energy harvesting. Then, chemical device applications are categorized into chemical sensors, supercapacitors, batteries, and electrocatalysis, and a detailed interpretation is provided. Finally, we present our vision of future developments and challenges in this exciting research field.
