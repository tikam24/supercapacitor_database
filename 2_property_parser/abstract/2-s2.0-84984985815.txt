A new type of carbon nanofiber (CNF) dominated electrode materials decorated with dilute NiO particles (NiO/CNF) has been in situ fabricated by direct pyrolysis of Ni, Zn-containing metal organic framework fibers, which are skillfully constructed by assembling different proportional NiCl2·6H2O and Zn(Ac)2·2H2O with trimesic acid in the presence of N,N-dimethylformamide. With elegant combination of advantages of CNF and evenly dispersed NiO particles, as well as successful modulation of conductivity and porosity of final composites, our NiO/CNF composites display well-defined capacitive features. A high capacitance of 14,926 F g−1 was obtained in 6 M KOH electrolyte when the contribution from 0.43 wt% NiO was considered alone, contributing to over 35% of the total capacitance (234 F g−1). This significantly exceeds its theoretical specific capacitance of 2584 F g−1. It has been established from the Ragone plot that a largest energy density of 33.4 Wh kg−1 was obtained at the current density of 0.25 A g−1. Furthermore, such composite electrode materials show good rate capability and outstanding cycling stability up to 5000 times (only 10% loss). The present study provides a brand-new approach to design a high capacitance and stable supercapacitor electrode and the concept is extendable to other composite materials.
