Combining the advantages of lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors is an interesting solution to high-energy devices with the maintenance of high power output. Herein we report on the performance of the lithium-ion capacitors (LICs), exploiting graphene-based materials and activated carbon as negative and positive electrodes, respectively. The electrochemical properties of pre-lithiated reduced graphite oxides (reduced thermally—TRGO, or chemically—CRGO) and pristine graphite are compared based on measurements conducted in two- and three-electrode cells. Chemically reduced graphite oxide (CRGO) displays excellent performance at current densities up to 8 A g−1. The assembled hybrid capacitor delivers the energy density around 80 Wh kg−1 along a wide range of power densities. Promising results show that even at power value of 24.8 kW kg−1, the device retains energy density over 35 Wh kg−1. The cycle performance also shows good energy retention comparing with a graphite anode. However, better energy retention is observable for the TRGO-negative electrode material. After the 2000 of cycles, the AC/TRGO(Li) system loaded with the current density of 1 A g−1 provides energy of 58 Wh kg−1. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
