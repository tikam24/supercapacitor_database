Reduced graphene oxide/Nickel oxide (rGO/NiO) nanocomposites were synthesized by one step solvothermal method followed by thermal annealing process under N2 gas. The effect of their composition and microstructures of composite material were systematically investigated with PXRD, FT-IR, UVVis-DRS, RAMAN, SEM and EDAX analysis. The magnetic properties of rGO/NiO nanocomposites were evaluated using VSM studies. Further, the electrochemical catalytic activities of rGO/NiO composites were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) indicating excellent conductivity and reduction in over potential and impedance which renders rGO/NiO composites as a promising candidate for a supercapacitor application.
