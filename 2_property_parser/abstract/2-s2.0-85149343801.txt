This paper systematically compares and evaluates three types SOC estimation methods for ultracapacitors (UCs) under different ambient temperatures. Firstly, based on the UC dynamic test data, the key parameters of Thevenin model are identified by genetic algorithm. Next, the polynomial fitting is employed to determine the relationship between parameters and ambient temperatures, and the temperature-varied model is established. At the same time, according to the extended Kalman filter (EKF), adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF) and unscented Kalman filter algorithm (UKF), three kinds UC SOC estimation methods are designed, which are suitable for different ambient temperatures. Then, the accuracy, robustness and self-correction ability of these SOC estimation methods are evaluated by using the urban dynamometer driving schedule test data at −10 °C, 10 °C, 25 °C and 40 °C. Finally, the results indicate that the AEKF algorithm is superior to the EKF and UKF, and its average absolute error and root mean square error are within 0.227 % and 0.318 % at different temperatures, respectively. In addition, the proposed temperature-varied model has a wider application.
