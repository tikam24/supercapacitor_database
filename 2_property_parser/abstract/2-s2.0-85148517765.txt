High-performance flexible electronic textiles exhibit considerable potential for use as wearable energy storage and sensor fields. In this paper, we fabricated multifunctional PANI/PLA composite electronic fabrics by a simple in-situ polymerization reaction. The fabrics have an areal specific capacitance of 1171.4 mF/cm2 when used as an electrode, and the capacitance retention of 93.02% after 2000 charge/discharge cycles. The symmetric all-solid-state supercapacitors assembled based on PANI/PLA fabrics demonstrated an attractive capacitive performance with a high energy density of 30.27 Î¼Wh/cm2 at a power density of 0.217 mW/cm2. Meanwhile, the PANI/PLA electronic fabrics can also be used as flexible sensors to monitor the movement of the human body in real time. More importantly, the PANI/PLA functional fabrics also possess good flame retardant performance, antibacterial and electromagnetic shielding properties. These results indicate that the prepared PANI-coated PLA fabrics have broad application potential in wearable electronic textiles.
