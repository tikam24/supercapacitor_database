Transition metal oxide-based battery-type electrode materials with well-defined nanostructure have shown great potential in supercapacitors, due to their high electrical conductivity and superior redox activity. Herein, promising CoWO4@WO3-1 heterostructured nanosheets with rich oxygen vacancies are designed via a two-step in situ construction process and following thermal treatment. The CoWO4@WO3-1 heterostructured nanosheet arrays grown on a flexible carbon cloth substrate can provide an effective nanoporous framework, facilitate electrons/ions transport, and generate effective synergistic effect of high conductivity from WO3 and superior redox activity from CoWO4. As a result, the as-prepared CoWO4@WO3-1 electrodes exhibit a high area specific capacity of 578.6 mF cm−2 at a current density of 0.5 mA cm−2 and keep 98.38% capacity retention at 20 mA cm−2 over 30 000 cycles. Additionally, all-solid-state supercapacitors assembled with CoWO4@WO3-1 as cathodes and Ov-NiMoO4 as anodes show a maximum area energy density of 13.93 mW h cm−2 and power density of 6502.11 mW cm−2, keeping outstanding cycling stability of 98.1% capacity retention over 20 000 cycles.
