Carbon aerogel (CA) spheres were prepared by an inverse phase suspension polymerization of resorcinol and formaldehyde (RF) monomers followed by supercritical drying and carbonization. The electrodes used for super-capacitors were made from the CA prepared spheres and their storage performances were investigated by cyclic voltammetric measurement, galvanostatic charge-discharge test and AC impedance measurement. The experimental results indicated that the resultant CA spheres exhibited good electrochemical behaviors. The electrodes of CA spheres are suitable for multi and larger current charge-discharge. The specific capacitance of the CA spheres prepared is as high as 215 F/g. Therefore, the resultant CA spheres is able to be used as the electrode materials of supercapacitors. The electrochemical performances of the CA spheres prepared are influenced by fabrication conditions and pore structure of the CA spheres. The optimum preparation conditions recommended are: rR/rC = 200, RF content = 50% and gelation temperature = 85Â°C.
