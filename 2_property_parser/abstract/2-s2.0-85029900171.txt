This paper presents a control solution designed to improve the dynamic response capability of autonomous microgrids (MGs). For this purpose, an MG-forming inverter (MGFI) controlled to take over the load only in transitory regimes by using a virtual synchronous generator operation mode is proposed. The MGFI, based on a supercapacitor energy storage system, is relived of the permanent load by distributing it to other units available to support the MG. The proposed control approach is validated by experimental results performed on a laboratory-scale MG.
