Hair-like (HL) nanoarchitectures constructed by ultrafine MnOx nanowires (âˆ¼7 nm) with ultrafine Ag nanoparticles anchored on were synthesized by in situ facile reaction between silver (Ag) nanowires and potassium permanganate (KMnO4), and followed by a following hydrothermal method. Based on a serious of time-dependent experiments, an orderly merged Kirkendall effect and dissolution-recrystallization (Ostwald ripening) mechanism were proposed for the formation of this novel morphology. The as-prepared HL Ag/MnOx nanocomposites as electrode exhibited a high specific capacitance (526 Fg-1 at scan rate of 5 mV s-1 and 450 Fg-1 at current density of 0.1 Ag-1), good rate capability (ca. 45.5% retention with reference to 205 Fg-1 at 50 times higher current density of 5 Ag-1) and desirable cycle stability (ranging from initial of 237 Fg-1 to 185 Fg-1 after 800 cycles and still maintaining 87% retention compared to 800th cycle after another 2800 cycles at current density of 2 Ag-1). Such desirable performance could be attributed to HL Ag/MnOx nanocomposites core (tubular nanosheets) with uniform dispersion of the ultrafine Ag nanoparticals provides a direct pathway for electron transport while the partial connected ultrafine nanowires networks with high specific surface area provides more electronic transmission channels and easy permeation of electrolyte, decreasing the polarization of the electrode and thus enhancing the discharge capacity and high-rate capability.
