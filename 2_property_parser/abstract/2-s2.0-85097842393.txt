Hollow nanostructures garner tremendous interest in the area of energy conversion and storage, owning to its large surface area, facilitated transport path and good buffering capability. In this paper, we summarize the recent research on hollow nanostructures with controllable structure and morphology for surface/interface chemical energy storage. First, we introduce the charge storage mechanism and challenges of surface/interface chemical energy storage, mainly including supercapacitor. Subsequently, we discuss the influence of structure parameters of hollow nanostructures on the performance of surface/interface chemical energy storage device in detail. Afterwards, we systematically outline the recent applications of hollow nanostructures as electrode materials for supercapacitors. By adopting hollow nanostructures, the specific capacitance, cycle stability and rate capability of supercapacitors can be greatly improved. Finally, the emergent challenges and future development directions in hollow nanostructures for surface/interface chemical energy storage are provided.
