Coral reef-like PANI nanotubes composed of nanopaticles were successfully synthesized by a reactive template of manganese oxide. The structure was characterized by using SEM, TEM, and FT-IR, and the supercapacitive behaviors of these nanotubes were investigated with cyclic voltammetry (CV), and charge-discharge tests, respectively. A maximum specific capacitance of 533 F/g could be achieved in 1 mol/L aqueous H2SO4 with the potential range of -0.2 to 0.8 V (vs. the saturated calomel electrode) in a half-cell setup configuration for PANI electrode, suggesting its potential application in the electrode material for electrochemical capacitors.
