The article examines a system for conversion and storage of energy, consisting of photovoltaic panels, ultracapacitor and LED lighting. A bidirectional Cukconverter is used for a matching converter for energy transfer between the different components. The transfer of the energy can be from the photovoltaic panels to the ultracapacitor or from the ultracapacitor to the LED lighting. An photorelay is used to determine the direction of transmission. The advantage of the system is the use of only one converter. Here are presented schematic diagrams and results of research by computer simulation in the following cases: energy transfer from the photovoltaic panels to the ultracapacitor in Cukconverter step-down and step-up modes, energy transfer from the ultracapacitor to the LED lighting in Cuk-converter stepdown and step-up modes.
