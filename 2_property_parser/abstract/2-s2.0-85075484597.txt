To construct 3D hierarchical structures with the synergy effect is an effective strategy to improve the electrochemical properties of electrode materials as high-performance supercapacitors. Herein, a sandwich-like VO2(B)/carbon nanotube/reduced graphene oxide (abbreviated as VO2(B)/CNT/rGO) ternary nanocomposite is synthesized by a facile hydrothermal process. VO2(B) nanoribbons cover on the 3D CNT/rGO networks to form a novel 3D hierarchical porous sandwich-like structure. Thanks to the improved electric conductivity, abundant porosity, optimized accessibility and firm framework yielded from the synergy effect and unique structure, the produced ternary nanocomposite exhibits exceptional electrochemical properties including a high specific capacitance up to 649.1 F路g-1 at 0.5 A路g-1, a maximum energy density of 32.5 W路h路kg-1 as well as long-term lifespan of 81.6 % after 10,000 cycles. Results imply a great potential of VO2(B)/CNT/rGO ternary nanocomposite for practical applications as a supercapacitor electrode material.
