This study presents the successful synthesis of praseodymium oxide, Pr 6 O 11 and hausmannite manganese oxide, Mn 3 O 4 nanoparticles, along with a novel synthesis of (Pr 6 O 11 /Mn 3 O 4 ) nanocomposites by employing the hydrothermal route followed by post thermal annealing. X-ray Diffraction, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-ray characterization techniques are being adapted to analyze the physical characteristics of all the synthesized materials. XRD results reveal the crystalline nature of the synthesized materials. FE-SEM results display the irregular nanograins of Mn 3 O 4 and a regular network of interconnected Pr 6 O 11 nanoparticles. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption tests confirm the mesoporous nature of all the synthesized electrode materials. The Pr 6 O 11 /Mn 3 O 4 âˆ’ 2 electrode material exhibits an outstanding specific capacitance of 794.58 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g, as compared to the 521.24 F/g for the Pr 6 O 11 electrode material. These investigations provide an easy and efficient method to develop nanocomposites (Pr 6 O 11 /Mn 3 O 4 ) with better electrochemical characteristics, as electrode materials for supercapacitor applications.
