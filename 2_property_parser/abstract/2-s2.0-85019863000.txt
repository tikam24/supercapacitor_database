Effective utilization of ultracapacitor for energy management and on-board power applications requires a thorough analysis of energy storage and delivery efficiency. Due to the presence of fractional-order dynamics, the power and energy behavior in ultracapacitors deviate significantly from standard dielectric capacitors, which follow the conventional integer-order calculus. In this regard, present work focuses on the energy efficiency analysis of ultracapacitor while considering fractional-order dynamics. A generalized approach based on the hybridization of an evolutionary seeker optimization algorithm and a local search technique has been proposed to investigate the effect of charging/discharging excitation by constant current and hence the fractional-order behavior for efficient power utilization. The proposed approach has been validated by suitable experiments on a commercially available ultracapacitor for different operating conditions.
