A facile chemical method for Co doping Ni-CNTs@α-Ni(OH)2 combining with an in situ phase transformation process is successfully proposed and employed to synthesize three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical Ni-CNTs@β-(Ni, Co) binary hydroxides. This strategy can effectively maintain the coaxial-cable-like structure of Ni-CNTs@α-Ni(OH)2 and meanwhile increase the content of Co as much as possible. Eventually, the specific capacitances and electrical conductivity of the composites are remarkably enhanced. The optimized composite exhibits high specific capacitances of 2861.8 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 (39.48 F cm−2 at 15 mA cm−2), good rate capabilities of 1221.8 F g−1 at 20 A g−1 and cycling stabilities (87.6% of capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1). The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) constructed with the as-synthesized composite and activated carbon as positive and negative electrode delivers a high specific capacitance of 287.7 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. The device demonstrates remarkable energy density (96 W h kg−1) and high power density (15829.4 W kg−1). The retention of capacitance remains 83.5% at the current density of 5 A g−1 after 5000 cycles. The charged and discharged samples are further studied by ex situ electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis, XRD and SEM to figure out the reasons of capacitance fading. Overall, it is believable that this facile synthetic strategy can be applied to prepare various nanostructured metal hydroxide/CNT composites for high performance supercapacitor electrode materials.
