Supercapacitors are extremely capable electrochemical energy storage devices owing to their high power density, long cyclability, rapid charge-discharge rates, and environmentally benign nature. They are equipped with absolutely demanding commercial features, thus employed in a wide range of applications including convenient electronics to electric automobiles. Electrode materials are considered an important feature in the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors, among which tin-based electrode materials (Sn oxides and sulfides) are quite attractive electrode materials. Their unique features involve numerous valence states, good redox chemistry, high thermal and mechanical stability, enriching conductivity, and long cyclability. This review tries to summarize the importance and contribution of Sn-based electrode materials for supercapacitors to date via organizing them into various sections based on chemical composition. Also, the role of different nanoarchitectures in deciding the electrochemical performance is discussed. A brief history of the supercapacitor background, involving the charge storage mechanism is presented. The summary of the results intricates the association between the synthesis and the properties as well as the performance of the supercapacitor that would be helpful to set a guide for future research relying on the suitable preparation route for the variety of applications which is aimed. Although Sn-based electrode materials for supercapacitors are not so much explored, highlighting the potential aspects of these materials with future perspectives and challenges is the main purpose of this review.
