Supercapacitors have emerged as the most attractive complementary devices between batteries and conventional capacitors, while a high performance electrode material is key to their energy storage advancement. In recent years, research on electrode materials for supercapacitors has mainly focused on the field of positive electrode materials. Compared with the positive electrode, the research on negative electrode materials is mainly focused on carbon materials, and there are fewer types. As a negative electrode material under aqueous alkaline test conditions, vanadium nitride has many attractive advantages, such as a large potential window (in the range from âˆ’1.2 V to 0 V in alkaline aqueous solution), high electrical conductivity, and high specific capacitance. In this review, we focus on vanadium nitride based anode materials and carefully summary their energy storage mechanisms, applications, advantages and disadvantages, and future development prospects.
