Improving the energy storage performance of supercapacitor electrodes based on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) is one of the main subjects in this research field. However, when a zirconia bowl and zirconia balls were used for ball-mill mixing of the active materials for RGO supercapacitors, the energy storage performance deteriorated over time. Our study revealed that the source of the problem was the inclusion of zirconia bits from abrasion of the bowl and the balls during the ballmill mixing, which increased during a period of ~ 1 year. We probed two solutions to this problem: 1) hydrofluoric (HF) acid treatment of the RGO supercapacitors and 2) use of a tempered steel bowl and tempered steel balls for the mixing. For both cases, the energy storage performance was restored to near the initial level, showing a specific capacitance (Csp) of ~ 200 F/g. Our results should lead to progress in research on RGO supercapacitors.
