Nitrogen-doped graphene or graphene derivatives have been proven superior electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors. Synchronous N doping and reduction of graphene oxide (GO) is an effective approach to prepare such electrode materials. However, current strategies are limited to the use of liquid or vapor doping agents, making the preparation process complex and less environmentally friendly. We here report a facile way to prepare nitrogen-rich carbon nanoparticles (NCNPs), which can be employed as a solid-state doping agent for efficient N-doping of GO through direct laser writing photoreduction. The doping degree was tuned by varying the mass ratios of the NCNPs in the composites. After laser treatment, the composites show N concentration as high as 7.78 atom %. With the N-doped graphene composites as electrodes, the as-fabricated supercapacitors show high rate performance and obvious enhanced capacitance, revealing great potential for energy storage and conversion devices.
