Graphene nanosheets have been prepared by facile and simple electrochemical exfoliation method in the acidic media. Then, graphene nanosheets have been used as scaffold for synthesis of graphene/polyaniline (G/PANI) nanocomposite by rapid mixing route. Various techniques such as FE-SEM, TEM, FT-IR, XRD, TGA and also electrochemical techniques have been used for characterization of composite. The nanocomposite exhibited high specific capacitance of 453.75 F g-1 at a current density of 1.5 A g-1 which preserved higher than 74% of its primary capacitance at high current density of 15 A g-1. These values are higher than those of polyaniline nanofibers (PANI) which prepared in similar way but without addition of graphene nanosheets (252.5 F g-1 for polyaniline sample at current density of 1 A g-1 which retained lower than 55% of this capacitance at high current density of 10 A g-1). Nanocomposite prepared by this method retained 91% of its capacitive behavior at a scan rate of 100 mV s-1 after 2000 cycles. EIS measurement showed lower values of internal resistance (R s) and charge transfer resistance (R ct) for the composite electrode in comparison to PANI sample electrode, indicating that the prepared nanocomposite could be suitable for supercapacitor applications.
