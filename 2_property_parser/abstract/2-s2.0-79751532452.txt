A simple circuit model is developed to describe supercapacitor behavior, which uses two resistor-capacitor branches with different time constants to characterize the charging and redistribution processes, and a variable leakage resistance to characterize the self-discharge process. The parameter values of a supercapacitor can be determined by a charging-redistribution experiment and a self-discharge experiment. The modeling and characterization procedures are illustrated using a 22F supercapacitor. The accuracy of the model is compared with that of other models often used in power electronics applications. The results show that the proposed model has better accuracy in characterizing the self-discharge process while maintaining similar performance as other models during charging and redistribution processes. Additionally, the proposed model is evaluated in a simplified energy storage system for self-powered wireless sensors. The model performance is compared with that of a commonly used energy recursive equation (ERE) model. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can predict the evolution profile of voltage across the supercapacitor more accurately than the ERE model, and therefore provides a better alternative for supporting research on storage system design and power management for wireless sensor networks.
