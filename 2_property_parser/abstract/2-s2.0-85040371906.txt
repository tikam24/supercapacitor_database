Owing to the metalloid characteristic and superior electrical conductivity, the metal phosphides have received increasing interests in energy storage systems. Here, xrGO/Ni 2 P composites are successfully synthesized via an In-situ phosphorization process with GO/Ni-MOF as precursors. Compared to pure Ni 2 P, the xrGO/Ni 2 P composites appear enhanced electrochemical properties in terms of the specific capacitance and cycling performance as electrodes for supercapacitors. Especially, the 2rGO/Ni 2 P electrode shows a highest specific capacitance of 890 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 among the obtained composites. The enhancement can be attributed to the inherited structure from Ni-MOF and the well assembled of rGO and Ni 2 P through the In-situ conversion process. Moreover, when applied as positive electrode in a hybrid supercapacitor, an energy density of 35.9 W h kg −1 at a power density of 752 W kg −1 has been achieved. This work provides an In-situ conversion strategy for the synthesis of rGO/Ni 2 P composite which might be a promising electrode material for SCs.
