This paper presents a survey on supercapacitors and their application as power supply in microgrids (MGs) and electric vehicles (EVs). The importance of efficient dc-dc converters in this case is also discussed. One of the main topologies adequate for this purpose is discussed in detail i.e. the bidirectional interleaved boost converter. Finally, the design of a 2-kW prototype is presented so that a 165-F/48-V supercapacitor module can be connected to a 96-V dc link. Simulation and experimental results are also presented to validate the theoretical assumptions.
