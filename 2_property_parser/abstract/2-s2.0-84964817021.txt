Nanoporous NiCo2O4 thin films have been deposited on ITO glass by a sol-gel approach and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy has been employed to characterize their crystalline structure showing the successful synthesis of spinel phase. Scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscope demonstrate the nanoporous surface morphologies. The electrochemical properties of nanoporous NiCo2O4 thin films investigated as supercapacitor electrodes by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge in 2 M KOH aqueous solution, show the nanoporous NiCo2O4 thin films to exhibit a high areal specific capacitance of 40.6 mF cm-2 (corresponding to mass specific capacitance of 2157 F g-1) at a current density of 0.133 mA cm-2 and a long-term cyclic stability (96.5% retention of initial specific capacitance after 10,000 cycles). Both the nanoporous morphology and binder-free frame have been experienced to play an important role for the enhancement of electrochemical performance.
