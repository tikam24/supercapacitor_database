Supercapacitors and batteries are among the most promising electrochemical energy storage technologies available today. Indeed, high demands in energy storage devices require cost-effective fabrication and robust electroactive materials. In this review, we summarized recent progress and challenges made in the development of mostly nanostructured materials as well as fabrication routes for energy storage devices. Indeed, we systematically sorted out the design principles of electrode materials such as lithium-ion, lead-acid, lithium-sulfur, nickel-cadmium, nickel-metal hydride, and sodium-ion for rechargeable batteries electrode and supercapacitors (SCs) electrode materials following by systematic discussions on electric double-layer capacitors, pseudocapacitors, and hybrid SCs behavior.
