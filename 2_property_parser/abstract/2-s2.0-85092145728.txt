Zeolitic analcime/functionalized spongy graphene (FG/ANA) nanocomposites have been prepared using a facile hydrothermal-aided process. The electron microscopy imaging revealed the formation of 3-dimensional (3D) crumpled graphene sheets intercalated with analcime nanoneedles beneath the graphene layers. The intercalated ANA prevented the aggregation of FG sheets and allowed the diffusion of electrolyte ions into the FG layers. Upon electrochemical testing, the synthesized FG/ANA nanocomposite electrodes exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 652 Fg−1 at 5 mV/s and 1061.95 Fg−1 at 0.5 A/g with 92% cycling stability at 1.5 A/g over 2000 cycles. The assembled symmetric supercapacitor device consisting of FG/ANA composite delivered a specific energy (E) and specific power (P) of 60.23 Wh/kg and 350 W/kg, respectively at 0.5 Ag−1. Therefore, the FG/ ANA composites demonstrate outstanding potential for use in constructing high-performance supercapacitors. The excellent capacitive performance can be ascribed to the improved wettability owing to the existence of oxygen and nitrogen as well as the spongy structure of the synthesized 3D graphene.
