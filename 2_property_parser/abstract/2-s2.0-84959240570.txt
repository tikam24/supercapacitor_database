Carbon fiber (CF) produced at different heat treatment temperatures (HTT) of 1000, 1500, and 2000Â°C was activated by electrochemical and chemical oxidation pre-treatments. These treated CF samples were morphologically and electrochemically characterized by scanning electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry, charge/discharge response at different current densities, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Both activation pre-treatments improved the specific capacitance values for all samples in the three HTT studied showing their viability as electrodes for supercapacitor. Nonetheless, chemically pre-treated CF-1000 showed the best result mainly considering the charge/discharge response.
