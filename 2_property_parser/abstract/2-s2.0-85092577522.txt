Glucose monitoring devices for diabetes mellitus, which is a worldwide significant health issue, have attracted attention of many researchers. Herein, we report a hollow Mn-Cu-Al oxide nanocomposite (HMCA) by a microwave-assisted technique showing excellent sensing abilities toward glucose. Also, it possesses a superb supercapacitor activity described in our previous paper. The sensitivity value of the nanocomposite is 2.194 mA mM-1 cm-2 with a low detection limit of 0.43 Î¼M (S/N = 3). The high sensitivity and low detection limit were the results of the large surface area of the nanocomposite and the redox nature of CuO and MnO2. It shows a selective detection of glucose levels in blood serum. The hollow nanocomposite has been useful for monitoring the glucose level in blood serum and holds great potential for diabetes mellitus and clinical diagnosis.
