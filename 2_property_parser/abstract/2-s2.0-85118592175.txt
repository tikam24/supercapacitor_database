In this work, we report a high-performance self-standing supercapacitor electrode of mixed nickel manganese sulfides (NMSs) with a cracked-bark shape grown by one-step electrochemical deposition on activated carbon cloth (ACC). The electrode possesses outstanding electrochemical properties, including a high specific capacitance of up to 3142.8 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1, the high-rate performance (∼ 1206.8 F g−1 at 60.0 A g−1), and cycle stability (∼ 92.3% capacitance retention after 8000 cycles at 8 A g−1). An asymmetric supercapacitor assembled using NMSs on ACC as the cathode, activated carbon on carbon cloth as the anode and 1.0 mol L−1 KOH as the electrolyte delivers a high energy density of 111.2 W h kg−1 at 800.0 W kg−1 and the prominent cycling performance of ∼ 93.2% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles at 5 A g−1 with the Columbic efficiency of around 100% during these 10000 cycles. The high performance and facile preparation indicate that the NMSs on ACC hold a huge potential as the electrode for supercapacitors.
