Cobalt hydroxide (Co(OH)2) has received extensive attention for its exceptional splendid electrical properties as a promising supercapacitor electrode material. Co(OH)2 study so far prefers to crystal instead of amorphous, in spite of amorphous impressive electrochemical properties including the ability to improve the electrochemical efficiency based on the disorder structure. The amorphous Co(OH)2 nanostructures with excellent electrochemical behaviors were successfully synthesized by a simple and green electrochemistry. Our as-prepared Co(OH)2 electrode exhibited ultrahigh capacitance of 1094 F g-1 and super long cycle life of 95% retention over 8000 cycle numbers at a nominal 100 mV s-1 scan rate. The united pseudo-capacitive performances of the amorphous Co(OH)2 nanostructures in electrochemical capacitors are totally comparable to those of the crystalline Co(OH)2 nanomaterials. These findings actually open a door to applications of amorphous nanomaterials in the field of energy storage as superior electrochemical pseudocapacitors materials. Â© 2014 American Chemical Society.
