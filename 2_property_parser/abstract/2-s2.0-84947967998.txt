A new graphene (GA)/nitrogen-doped ordered mesoporous carbon (NMC) nanosheet was synthesized in situ by a triblock-copolymer assembly directly on graphene oxide. The strong interaction of NMC and GA in the form of N-O bonding limits GA aggregation. The resulting composite GA/NMC-95% with the NMC mass content of 95% shows a high surface area (1569 m2 g-1) and good electronic conductivity. As an electrode material for supercapacitor in 1mol L-1 H2SO4 electrolyte, it delivers specific capacitance as high as 377 F g-1 at 0.2 A g-1, outstanding rate capability and excellent cycling stability.
