The present work describes an efficient method to engineer advanced electrode materials for application in high-performing supercapacitors. First, a ternary composite electrode comprised of a nanocomposite of graphene oxide (GO), spinel zinc ferrite (ZnFe2O4), and polyaniline (PANi) as a conductive polymer was synthesized through in situ polymerization. The electrochemical and energy storage properties of the synthesized electrode were analyzed following the galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The intercalation of polyaniline between GO and ZnFe2O4 in the synthesized material was confirmed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The synthesized ternary composite electrode displayed a remarkably enhanced area capacitance of 2169.71 mF/g at the current density of 1 mA/cm, indicating the synergistic impact of the PANi additive. Highlights: Graphene oxide/spinel zinc ferrite/polyaniline nanocomposite was synthesized using in situ polymerization. Polyaniline concentration affected the surface area, particle size, and agglomeration. Spinel zinc ferrite nanoparticles played a significant role in the nanocomposite. Graphene oxide/spinel zinc ferrite/polyaniline nanocomposite demonstrated superior rate performance.
