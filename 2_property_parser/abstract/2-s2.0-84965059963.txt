The development approach for an energy storage system focuses on optimal sized double-layer capacitor modules to reduce peak power and to avoid malfunctions of production machinery caused by voltage interruptions. The required kind of charging for the energy storage system and adjustment of voltage control parameters was executed for line-side converters of drive groups in production machinery. The energy efficiency of electric drives with and without such an energy storage system was investigated by means of active power measurements and simulations of electric power flows in Mat-lab/SimPowerSystems.
