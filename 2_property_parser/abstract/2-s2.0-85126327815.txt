In this work, a three dimensional porous h-MoO3 architecture (NMO) was successfully synthesized by a simple hydrothermal process and used as electrode materials for supercapacitors. The results indicated that CrCl3⋅6H2O can effectively regulate the morphology of h-MoO3 and the specific surface area can be as high as 149.3 m2 g−1. Moreover, the as-fabricated NMO electrode exhibited a superior electrochemical performance of 229.0 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1. This research reveals that this unique porous h-MoO3 can work as a prospective candidate for supercapacitors electrode materials.
