Mesoporous nickel cobaltite supercapacitor electrodes with ultra-high capacitance were developed by simultaneously tailoring electrode conductivity, pore size dispersion, and crystallinity. High active mass loading (>10 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>) enables the feasibility for such electrodes being used in practical devices. At a current density of 28.6 A g<sup>-1</sup> (equivalent to 10 kW kg<sup>-1</sup> power density), the best performance of 8.2 F cm <sup>-2</sup> was achieved. The principles illustrated as the motivation of the current work are believed to be able to serve as guidelines for designing future high-performance electrodes.
