Single-material electrodes do not satisfy the demands of high-performance supercapacitors. To exploit the advantages of both oxides and carbon-based materials, a tightly packed Co3O4/NiCo2O4/NiO/C&S nanocomposite is fabricated by sintering a Co/Ni-based coordination complex precursor at 400 °C. The composites and basic components are characterized using various techniques, namely, X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller specific surface area analysis, and elemental analysis. The electrochemical performance is analyzed by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling, and electrochemical impedance spectrometry. A uniform nanocomposite was found to be formed of NiCo2O4, NiO, and Co3O4 nanoparticles, incompletely carbonized C, and incompletely vulcanized S. When used as supercapacitor electrodes, the synthesized composites show extra-long cycling stability (>20,000 cycles) during the charge/discharge process. This improvement in the cycle life of the composites is attributed to its highly stable structure. The roles of C and S in forming a stable structure are investigated. The results show that a supercapacitor with electrodes made from the as-prepared Co3O4/NiCo2O4/NiO/C&S composite will be promising for commercial applications.
