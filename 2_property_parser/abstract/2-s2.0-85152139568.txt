An optimal charging strategy for supercapacitors based on the integrated objective function of charging loss and time is proposed. The optimal charging current under different operating conditions is determined online according to the resistance-current characteristics of the capacitor. The Maxwell 2.7 V／10 F supercapacitor is tested to verify the feasibility of the proposed strategy. On this basis，the 1 kV／6.7 kW·h supercapacitor is taken as an example，and the influence of charging mode，state of charge（SOC） interval and capacitor aging on the optimal charging performance is quantitatively analyzed through MATLAB simulation. The results show that the proposed strategy can effectively improve the charging efficiency of the system under different charging modes，SOC intervals and aging states.
