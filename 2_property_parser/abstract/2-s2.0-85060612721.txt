We report the preparation of 3D binder-free Si@Ti@TiN thin film array electrodes for supercapacitors using deep silicon etching and magnetron sputtering for the first time. This work not only offers the 3D array structure of Si@Ti@TiN thin films, but also paves a promising way for the construction of high-energy storage systems.
