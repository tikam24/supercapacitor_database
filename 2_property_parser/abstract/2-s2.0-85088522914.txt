NiMnO3 nanosheets with high specific capacitance were fabricated on carbon cloth (CC) substrates using a facile hydrothermal method. The composition, morphology, and structure of the products were characterized using x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. In addition, cyclic voltammetry and constant current charge-discharge tests revealed that NiMnO3@CC electrodes presented excellent capacitive properties, and the specific capacitance reached 2330 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g. Moreover, after 1000 charge-discharge cycles at the current density of 10 A/g, the composites still maintained 67.8% of their initial capacity. Our results indicated that the NiMnO3@CC electrodes presented good electrochemical properties with potential application in the energy storage field.
