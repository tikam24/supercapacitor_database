Polyaniline (PANI)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composites were synthesized by in situ oxidative polymerization of aniline on reduced graphene sheets. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize the composites. The results indicated PANI/rGO composites were produced and contained covalent bonds between the functional groups of PANI and rGO. A uniform coating of PANI on the rGO sheets had a synergistic effect on the properties of the composites. The electrochemical properties of the PANI/rGO composites produced using different feed ratios of aniline to rGO were studied. The results showed that the composites exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 797.5 F/g at 0.5 A/g and minimum charge transfer resistance of 0.98 Ω when the feed ratio of aniline to rGO was 2:1. These values were superior to those of pure PANI and rGO. The composites also displayed excellent cycling stability, with specific capacitance retention of 92.43% after 1000 cycles. These stable structural composites show promise for the development of new supercapacitor applications. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2018, 135, 46103.
