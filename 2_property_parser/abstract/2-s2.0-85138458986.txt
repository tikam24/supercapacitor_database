For portable and transparent electronic applications, transparent supercapacitor (T-SC) is developed to act as an energy storing device. Because electric and optical characteristics of the supercapacitor are strongly dependent on its thickness, all solid state T-SC was developed based on sensitively controllable fabrication process. We were able to attain an optimum thickness for the T-SC such that it exhibited an excellent transparency as well as capacity. Thus, the transparency-capacity dilemma, that is, the thickness of a T-SC increases with respect to its capacity while it is inversely proportional to its transparency, was solved through our proposed T-SC structure. Consequently, more than 60% transparency and 80% capacitance retention of 1500 charge/discharge cycles were achieved. The overcoming of transparency-capacity dilemma can enhance the T-SC applicability as a core energy storage device.
