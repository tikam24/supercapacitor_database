The microflower-like Si/MoS2 composites were fabricated using Si quantum dots (QDs) to assist a facile hydrothermal method. The electrochemical performance of Si/MoS2 composite in symmetric and asymmetric systems was studied. Electrochemical characterization revealed that the Si/MoS2 composite electrode in a three-electrode system has a high specific capacitance of 574.4 F·g−1 at 5 A·g−1. Furthermore, the Si/MoS2 composite electrode in a two-electrode system had the maximum energy density of 27.2 Wh·kg−1 when a power density of 749.1 W·kg−1 was achieved. Therefore, this investigation proves the Si/MoS2 composite microflower-like structure should be a promising candidate electrode material for supercapacitors.
