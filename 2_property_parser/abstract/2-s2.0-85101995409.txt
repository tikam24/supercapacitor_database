Based on the analysis of the influence of timetable on traction power supply system, this paper proposes a control strategy for stationary hybrid energy storage system (SHESS) that considers train timetable and battery life. The control strategy is divided into two parts, off-line optimization and on-line adjustment. In the off-line optimization part, NSGA-II optimization algorithm is used to optimize the control parameters with the minimum energy supply of the substation and the number of effective throughput cycles of the battery as the optimization objective. On-line adjustment is based on the control parameters obtained from off-line optimization, the charging and discharging voltage threshold of HESS is adjusted in real time by the perturbation observation method through the energy change of supercapacitor. Finally, the simulation results of Beijing Batong line and 1MW HESS are given to verify the proposed strategy.
