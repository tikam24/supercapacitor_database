Novel MnO2-CuO-BaO (MCB) spherical nanocomposite was synthesized by facile hydrothermal method at 80 Â°C from aqueous solutions. The sample was primarily characterized by Powder X-ray Diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy and Dynamic Light scattering measurements. XRD showed the existence of MnO2, CuO and BaO in crystalline form with average crystallite size 16 nm. SEM and DLS studies demonstrated a wide particle size distribution. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance (EIS) measurements were recorded to examine the electrochemical characteristics. CV profile revealed a pseudocapacitance behavior of the nanocomposite. A noticeably high specific capacitance of 198 F/g was established at a scan rate of 10 mV/sec in aqueous 1 M KOH electrolyte. This strongly suggested Mn-Cu-Ba mixed metal oxide nanocomposite as a promising electrode material in supercapacitor technology.
