Energy management and control are two crucial tasks for a stable operation in islanded DC microgrids (MG). This paper outlines a new composition of a decentralized hierarchical multi-level control structure for a DC residential microgrid, using a model free super twisting sliding mode control (MF-STSMC) equipped with an anti-windup technique for saturation, together with a rate-limiter based energy management system (EMS). The EMS is responsible of sharing power between the energy storage system (ESS) units, in a more efficient way comparing with the commonly known frequency filtering technique. The principal control goals are to sustain the DC bus voltage at a desired value, also to insure robustness against disturbances, parameters variation and uncertainty, while maintaining the system power balance. The adopted DC microgrid is composed of a photovoltaic system (PV) as a primary source and a hybrid ESS formed of two different time scale units, a battery (Bat) and a supercapacitor (Sc). Simulations on MATLAB/Simulink are carried out to enhance the proposed control structure.
