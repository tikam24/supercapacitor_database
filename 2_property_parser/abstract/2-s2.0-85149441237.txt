The core task of high performance flexible supercapacitor is to generate flexible electrode material with high performance, light weight, and easy machining. Supercritical fluid technology is introduced, going beyond electrochemical deposition method, to solve the problems of low specific capacity and poor interface compatibility. An integrated polyaniline/carbon foam electrode material with improved electrochemical performance is constructed, by using supercritical fluid with high diffusivity, strong permeability, and superior solvation ability, to realize the controllable construction of composite microstructure and active interface regulation. The specific capacitance reaches 856.07 F/g at 1 A/g and high specific energy density of 96.3 Wh/kg at a power density of 3600 W/kg. This work makes possible the innovative experiment design of polymer and carbon-based materials integration with higher specific capacity and better interface compatibility. Therefore, the flexible electrode with high specific and high stability can be constructed by using the high diffusivity, strong permeability, and superior solvation ability of supercritical fluid.
