The performance difference among the series supercapacitors (SCs) will lead to performance degradation and service life shortening of the series SCs. Based on the equalization system using flyback transformer circuit, a multi-dimensional fuzzy control (MFC) strategy is studied in this paper to balance the SCs in series. According to the different states of the series SCs, the MFC strategy uses the parameters of the unit's terminal voltage, cutoff voltage of SC and operating current as inputs and calculates the equalization current required for each SC unit as an output. So, the MOSFETs of the equalization circuit are controlled according to equalization current to adjust the energy in the SC unit to be transferred in or out. And the difference of the SC units is kept within a controllable and reasonable range, which reduces the inconsistency of the SCs in series. The simulation analysis is carried out by using the SIMULINK software, which verifies the feasibility of this equalization strategy. The equalization experiment was carried out in the SC series. The experimental results prove the effectiveness of MFC strategy.
