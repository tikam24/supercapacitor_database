A simple synthesize method of hybrid transition metal oxides is important for the application of electrodes materials. In this work, we report one-pot hydrothermal method to synthesize 3D hierarchical MnMoO4/NiWO4 microspheres. Notably, the 3D hierarchical MnMoO4/NiWO4 microspheres electrodes with a MnMoO4/NiWO4 molar ratio of 4:3 present outstanding electrochemical performance. The excellent specific capacitance of the hybrid materials is 598 F g-1 at a discharge current density of 1 A gâˆ’1 and the capacitance retains 82% of its initial capacitance even after 5000 cycles, which are attributed to the obtained 3D hierarchical MnMoO4/NiWO4 microspheres are constituted by self-assembly MnMoO4 nanoflakes and NiWO4 nanoparticals and feature with abundant transportation shortcuts for electrolyte ions and excellent electrochemical performance. The results reveal that the 3D hierarchical MnMoO4/NiWO4 microspheres have great application prospect for electrochemical energy storage and the quick and facile method provides a new avenue for the preparation of hybrid materials.
