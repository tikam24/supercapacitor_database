High performing porous nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4) nanomaterial is prepared using novel cost effective auto combustion technique. Physical characterization reveals the formation of nickel rich spinel cobaltitie with average crystallite size of 17 nm. Electrochemical evaluation of the sample is carried using cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronopotentiometry (CP) and AC impedance techniques. The Pseudocapacitive nature of the material is observed from CV and CP studies exhibiting a high specific capacitance of 772 Fg-1 at a current density of 1 Ag-1. The low resistive behavior of the material is seen from the impedance spectra, projecting nickel cobaltite as promising material for supercapcitor applications. Â© 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.
