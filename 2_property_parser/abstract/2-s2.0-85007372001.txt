The effects of urea on microstructures of SnO2during hydrothermal process and its supercapacitor performance were investigated. The sphere SnO2was formed on Ti plate in hydrothermal solution without urea, while the SnO2micro-flowers were assembled by numerous few-layered nanopetals due to adding to urea during hydrothermal process. The separated SnO2nanopetals arrays showed better electrochemical performance than sphere SnO2. The gap between SnO2nanopetals promoted penetration of the electrolyte and induced high supercapacitive performance.
