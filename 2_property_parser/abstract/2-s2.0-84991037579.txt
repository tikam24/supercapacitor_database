Graphene has attracted great attention for supercapacitor electrode materials owing to unique electrochemical properties. The electrochemical capacitance of graphene supercapacitor is highly in dependence on the substrate and graphene. This overview mainly focuses on the preparation and electrochemical capacitance of the electroactive graphene supported on porous substrate of microporous nickel foam and nanoporous titanium nitride. The graphene includes the chemical-reduced graphene oxide, hydrothermal-reduced graphene oxide and thermal-reduced graphene oxide. The porous supporting substrates include micro-structured porous nickel foam and nano-structured titanium nitride nanotube array. The supercapacitance performance of porous graphene electrode materials has been fully summarised involving chemical-reduced graphene oxide/nickel foam, hydrothermal-reduced graphene oxide/nickel foam, chemical-reduced graphene oxide/titanium nitride and thermal-reduced graphene oxide/titanium nitride. The porous substrate structure of nickel foam and titanium nitride along with the graphene reduction degree could coordinately influence the supercapacitance performance.
