SnS2 is a promising candidate for an electrode material in lithium-ion batteries and photocatalysts due to its high accessible surface area and significant interlayer nanostructure. Here, we have synthesized hierarchically SnS2 layered nanostructure developed on nickel foam through a facile one-step template-free solvothermal process. FESEM images show the two-dimensional (2D) layer structure of SnS2 arranged in a flower petallike configuration. Further, the electrochemical properties of hierarchically SnS2 were investigated in 1 M KOH electrolyte for supercapacitor (SC) implementation. Synthesized SnS2 electrode material shows excellent specific capacitance of 604F g−1 at 1 mVs−1 and better cyclic stability of 86.2 % over 3000 cycles because the unique layered nanostructure increases the active sites and ion/electron transfer at the electrolyte/electrode interface. The hierarchically structured SnS2 electrode and its potential practical applications were tested by fabricating an SSC device to effectively light a commercial light-emitting diode (LED). This research shows that layered 3D SnS2 electrodes are a promising technology for sustainable energy storage applications. The above results indicated that hierarchically SnS2 with a 2D layered structure has a huge capability as an electrode material for high-performance SC applications and a promising potential for future energy storage devices.
