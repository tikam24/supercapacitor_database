This work presents a scalable method to produce robust all-solid electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs), compatible with roll-to-roll processes and structural laminate composite fabrication. It consists in sandwiching and pressing an ionic liquid-based polymer electrolyte membrane between two carbon nanotube (CNT) fiber sheet electrodes at room temperature, and laminating with ordinary plastic film. This fabrication method is demonstrated by assembling large-area devices of up to 100 cm2 with electrodes fabricated in-house, as well as with commercial CNT fiber sheets. Freestanding flexible devices operating at 3.5 V exhibit 28 F g−1 of specific capacitance, 11.4 W h kg−1 of energy density, and 46 kW kg−1 of power density. These values are nearly identical to control samples with pure ionic liquid. The solid EDLCs could be repeatedly bent and folded 180° without degradation of their properties, with a reversible 25% increase in energy density in the bent state. Devices produced using CNT fiber electrodes with a higher degree of orientation and therefore better mechanical properties show similar electrochemical properties combined with composite specific strength and modulus of 39 and 577 MPa SG−1 for a fiber mass fraction of 11 wt%, similar to a structural thermoplastic and with higher specific strength than copper.
