Currently, the vehicle manufacturers use the high power Li-ion technology to supply the electric and hybrid vehicles. This technology is able to ensure the power needed to propel the vehicle. Unfortunately, the lifetime of this technology is very low compared to that given by the energetic technology which can't ensure the needed power. So, to resolve the power limit of the energetic technology without decreasing its lifetime, this technology is associated with high power component (supercapacitor). This association (hybridization) requires the use of more power electronic components to ensure the good operating of these storage systems. This paper deals with the study of the hybrid supply sizing (weight, volume, autonomy and cost) including the size and cost of the DC/DC converter. Â© 2012 IEEE.
