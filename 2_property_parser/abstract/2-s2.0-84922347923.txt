Electrochemical supercapacitors (SCs) have received much attention since their high power density, short charge/discharge duration and long cycle life. Heteroatom-doped carbonaceous materials have been investigated due to their exceptional electrochemical properties. In this study, boron-doped multi-walled carbon nanotubes (B-MWCNT) were synthesized by a novel ammonia-assisted substitution reaction. Argon atmosphere with ammonia was utilized as etching gas to create defects on MWCNT surface and boron trioxide was applied as boron source. The specific capacitance is much larger for the SC with B-MWCNT (40.00 F/g) than that with MWCNT (8.35 F/g), owing to the better conductivity for the former case.
