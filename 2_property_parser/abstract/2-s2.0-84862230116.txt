An experimental hybrid power generation platform for the design and assessment of advanced control systems has been developed. It is specifically intended as a flexible development tool for the implementation and refinement of real-time novel control algorithms, aimed to maximize energy efficiency and optimize the electrical power management of hybrid generation systems based on fuel cells. The platform consists of two generation modules and storage module. The main one is based on a PEM fuel cell stack. The second one, implemented with a programmable electronic source, allows to emulate an alternative energy module, particularly a wind energy generation system. The storage module is built with Supercapacitors. Finally, a variable electronic load represents the lumped energy demand, with profiles that can be programmed in accordance with the user requirements. All modules of the system are connected to a common DC bus through intermediary electronic converters, which are controlled by a dedicated digital signal processor. The complete system is supervised through a Personal Computer, resulting into a highly versatile platform. Experimental results are presented to validate the whole system performance.
