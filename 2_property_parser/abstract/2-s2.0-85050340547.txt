The MPSS (multiport power supply system) is consist of fuel cell, super capacitor and two DC/DC converters. The energy management scheme, along with the allocation principle of energy storage unit is analyzed. The paper establishes the mathematical model and proposes a composite control strategy. The strategy fuses subsection PI (Proportional and Integral) control and SMC (Sliding Mode Control) based on super capacitor energy storage device. It also realizes the current sharing control, the rapid energy transfer control and the voltage stability control based on voltage and current double closed-loop control strategy. The bidirectional DC/DC converter provides instantaneous energy; the unidirectional DC/DC converter transfers energy from fuel cell to loads and capacitor energy storage unit. Both of the converters circuit component parameters are designed for the system need. The simulation and experimental analysis verify the effectiveness of the composite control strategy for the MPSS.
