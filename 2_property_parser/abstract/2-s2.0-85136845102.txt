An advanced type of CuCdS composite is synthesized using a one-step synthesis method. Nanomaterials of CdS, CuS, and their bimetal sulphides were synthesized using hydrothermal method and employed as an electrode for supercapacitor applications. The optimized Cu/Cd cations ratio with S (at %: 29:29:42) of bimetallic CuCdS composites have an improved electrochemical capacitance of 180 F/g at 0.5 A/g with 80.2% retention and 88% coulombic efficiency after 2000 cycles at 1 mA cm−2, which is much greater than that of other Cu/Cd ratio altered composites and bare metal sulphides. This bimetallic Cu0.5Cd0.5S composite has the lowest Rs and Rct value of 0.245 and 6.3 Ω than other electrodes. The synergistic benefits of two metal ions with an optimal ratio and their distinctive structural advantages provide numerous active sites with enhanced electron transfer and intercalation processes, resulting in a considerable improvement. Furthermore, this technique is highly universal and can be adapted to virtually all transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD)-related investigations to develop ideal electrode materials with significant structural and electrochemical fitting benefits, hence increasing the electrochemical performances of supercapacitor devices.
