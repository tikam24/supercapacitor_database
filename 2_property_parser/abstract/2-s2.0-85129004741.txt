In the present study, pristine ZnO, Y2O3, binary PANI-Y2O3, PANI-ZnO, Y2O3–ZnO, and novel ternary PANI-Y2O3–ZnO nanocomposites were prepared via co-precipitation and ultra-sonication techniques. The XRD pattern evident the formation of pristine oxides and binary/ternary nanocomposites. FTIR analysis showed the benzenoid ring stretching, C–H, and C–N in-plane/out-of-plane vibrations due to PANI and metal-oxygen bonds vibrations, which confirmed nanocomposite formation with PANI. FE-SEM images revealed that PANI covered on Y2O3–ZnO nanocomposite and EDX exhibited the existence of zinc and yttrium in synthesized products. The DC conductivity of ternary nanocomposites is higher than others. The Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) exhibited that PANI-Y2O3–ZnO nanocomposite has greater specific capacitance (Csp) 412 Fg-1 at the scan rate of 10 mVs−1. The Galvanostatic Charge-Discharge (GCD) also evident the maximum specific capacitance 873 Fg-1 of ternary nanocomposite at an applied current density of 3 A/g with increased energy density 73 Wh/kg and power density 9.1 kW/kg. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) showed that PANI-Y2O3–ZnO nanocomposite has the lowest value of polarization (Rp) resistance and solution (Rs) resistance. The highest value of specific capacitance of novel ternary nanocomposite is due to the rapid charge transfer rate and the enhanced surface-dependent electrochemical properties by PANI. Furthermore, the present findings introduce a novel electrode material for high-performance supercapacitor application.
