The preparation of nanostructured metal oxide decorated on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) nanohybrid films through simple, scalable, additive-free, binderless, and cost-effective route has fascinated significant attention not only in fundamental research areas but also its commercial applications, in order to reduce the growing environmental pollution and the cost of electrode fabrication. Here, we report the fabrication of highly flexible electrode with NiO/MWCNTs nanohybrid thin films directly on stainless steel substrate using successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. The impact of ratio of adsorption and reaction cycles on structural, surface areas and electrochemical properties of NiO/MWCNTs nanohybrids was investigated. X-ray diffraction measurements confirm the hybridization and face centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure of NiO in NiO/MWCNTs nanohybrids. In addition, these nanohybrids exhibit excellent surface properties such as uniform surface morphology, good surface area, pore volume, and uniform pore size distribution. The electrochemical tests demonstrate the highest specific capacitance of 1727 F g-1 at 5 mA cm-2 of current density with 91% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles. In addition, the Ragone plot confirms the better power and energy densities for all NiO/MWCNTs nanohybrids. The attractive electrochemical capacitive activity revealed by NiO/MWCNTs nanohybrid electrode proposes that it is an auspicious respondent for future energy storage application.
