The graphene and LiNO3 composites (GLs) were produced by a new facility method: burning the mixture of graphene and LiNO3. The electrochemical properties of GLs as supercapacitor electrode materials were evaluated roundly, and results showed that GLs possess much high specific capacitance at a high current density and scan rate (3339.7 F/g at 1 mV/s and 80.07 F/g at 20 A/g, respectively) with excellent cycling stability, which are superior to other reported graphene/metals composites thus far. The achievements of such high performance GLs composites may open up a new window for energy storage applications and wearable electronics in the future.
