Battery/Supercapacitor (SC) hybrid energy storage system (HESS) is widely researched due to the superiority of SC in high power density, high cycle capability, and long life time. The repetitive charge for HESS via Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) is a potential solution for reduction of battery size on board. For WPT charging, the load impedance control using DC-DC converter was proposed to improve the transmission efficiency. The charge power control is also necessary because of the limited capacity of HESS. Moreover, the power control should be done on the receiver side to simplify the configuration of transmission side. In this paper, charge power control via WPT without communication between transmitter and receiver side is proposed. The proposed method applied the feedforward controller is verified by experiments.
