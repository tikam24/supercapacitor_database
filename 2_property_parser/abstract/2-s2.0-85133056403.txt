Porous graphitic carbon materials have been regarded as promising candidates as the electrode for supercapacitors. However, the high porosity and electrical conductivity usually have a competitive relationship in a carbon material. Therefore, constructing the hierarchically porous graphitic carbon materials poses a challenge. We report a simple one-pot synthesis strategy using a Mn complex both as the hard template and the graphitization catalyst. The pore size distribution of porous carbon can be adjusted, and MnCx can be produced by the combination of MnO with amorphous carbon atoms. The as-prepared carbon materials show a high graphitization degree and surface area of 1545 m2 g−1 with micro-/mesopores, which boosts the rate performance with capacitance retention up to 90 % at 50 A g−1 and gives super cycle performance with 100 % capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles for the electrode of symmetric supercapacitor. This work reveals a novel strategy to construct porous graphitic carbon materials for supercapacitors applications.
