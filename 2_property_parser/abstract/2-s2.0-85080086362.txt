Over the recent times, sustainable advances in the metal oxides nanomaterials to develop effective and efficient supercapacitor electrode is critically investigated. In this regard, we have tailored the surface chemistry and nano scaled morphology of MoO3[sbnd]NiMoO4 nanocomposite via organic functional groups of E. cognata and scrutinized it as an electrode for supercapacitor. MoO3[sbnd]NiMoO4 nanocomposite was synthesized by the sol gel synthesis route using bioactive compounds of E. cognata. The phase formation of nanocomposite was confirmed by X-ray diffraction and energy dispersive spectroscopy while the morphology was examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy. The organic functional groups were revealed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Moreover, Gas chromatography–mass Spectroscopy (GC–MS) affirmed the presences of organic compounds in the synthesized nanocomposite. The optical band gap energy of functionalized MoO3[sbnd]NiMoO4 was 3.34 eV, demonstrated by Tauc plot. The organic framework derived MoO3[sbnd]NiMoO4 revealed specific capacitance of 204 Fg−1 and maximum energy density of 9.4 Wh kg−1, calculated by galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements. Consequently, the nano-scale and organic species of E. cognata were found to enhance the electrochemical behavior of MoO3[sbnd]NiMoO4 electrode towards supercapacitor.
