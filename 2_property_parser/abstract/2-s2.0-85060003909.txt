Fuel cells (FC) are a clean energy source that are capable of powering a vehicle's electrical energy requirements whilst providing zero operating emissions. In this study, a full-scaled computer model FC/supercapacitor (SC) hybrid has been developed to investigate the performance of the hybrid propulsion system under real-world performance conditions. A control strategy focused on maintaining a constant FC output at a user-defined value has been developed and applied to the FC/SC hybrid model. Driving cycles collected from a practical double-decker bus have been utilised to evaluate the developed model. It has been demonstrated that the proposed control strategy is capable of maintaining a constant and stable FC output while meeting a real world dynamic load. Based on the obtained results, a general strategy to identify the degree of hybridisation between the FC and the SC in a FC hybrid system has been developed and demonstrated.
