In this reported study, novel multiple dimensional ZIF-67/rGO/NiPc composite materials were prepared for supercapacitors. The electrochemical test showed that the ZIF-67/rGO/NiPc electrode achieved a remarkable specific capacitance of 860 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, which was superior to that of the rGO/NiPc and ZIF-67/rGO electrodes. An asymmetric supercapacitor based on ZIF-67/rGO/NiPc//activated carbon exhibited a high specific capacitance of 200.67 F g−1 and an extraordinary energy density of 62.7 Wh kg−1 at a corresponding power density of 750 W kg−1. In addition, the device demonstrated 94.6% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles. The assembled asymmetric supercapacitors could easily powered a green light-emitting diode. This work revealed a promising research route for the rational construction of multiple dimensioned high-performance electrodes materials for use in new energy storage devices.
