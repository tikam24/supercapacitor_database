A novel approach to reduce poly (sodium 4-styrene sulfonate) graphite oxide (PSSGO) film by ambient plasma is introduced. The film after the plasma treatment shows a significant change in morphology with many pores, leading to increased surface area. Oxygen functional groups existing in the film are removed, resulting in higher electric conductivity after the plasma treatment. The enhancement of the surface area and conductivity of the film results in better electrochemical performance for supercapacitor applications. The ambient plasma method is effective, easy, economical, and non-toxic when applied to the effective reduction of films.
