Fe3O4/graphite nanocomposites are prepared using readily available graphite powder, iron(III) and iron(II) chloride by a low-cost, one-pot chemical co-precipitation method. The chemical content, surface structure and morphology of the composites are analyzed and characterized by atomic absorption, powder X-ray diffraction, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda nitrogen adsorption-desorption and scanning electron microscopy methods. The cyclic voltagrams of the prepared nanocomposites show excellent specific capacitance (>450 F/g for the sample containing 60% Fe3O4) which is several times higher than pure Fe3O4 (∼55 F/g) and pure graphite (∼42 F/g) at potential window −0.9 to 0.4 V. Besides, the fabricated electrodes display significant capacitive retention at high cut off potential (−0.9–1.4 V), even after 1000 cycles galvanostatic charge/discharge (>92%) at current density of 3 A/g. The comparison of these supercapacitive performances with other iron oxide/carbon based nanocomposites in the literature shows that these novel composites exhibit noticeable electrochemical energy storage ability. The high performance of these supercapacitor electrodes along with their cost-effective fabrication route may be considered as a valuable asset to sustainable manufacturing.
