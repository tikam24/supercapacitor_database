Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) have been intensively researched due to their good electrochemical and mechanical stabilities, compared to liquid electrolytes showing safety issues. Here, we prepare lithium-ion conducting GPEs via dual cross-linking of lithium acrylate (LiA), vinyl silica nanoparticle (VSNP), and lithium alginate (LiAlg). The P(LiA)-VSNP/LiAlg-based GPE has high stretchability, flexibility, and good self-recovery ability. The introduction of VSNP into GPE achieves high room temperature ionic conductivity of ~ 10–2 S/cm. Furthermore, the addition of LiAlg enhances the GPE mechanical property due to physical cross-linking between LiAlg and LiA chains, thereby showing high storage modulus of G′–105 Pa. Consequently, we fabricate flexible supercapacitors based on the as-prepared GPE and activated carbon electrodes. This VSNP-containing GPE-based supercapacitor shows a higher capacitance (Cs = 4.5 F/g) than the VSNP-free GPE-based supercapacitor (Cs = 2.1 F/g) at the scan rate of 5 mV/s. This study can offer a new perspective for developing tough, flexible, and high-conducting electrolytes that can simultaneously exhibit high electrochemical properties for energy storage devices. Graphical abstract: Dual-crosslinking gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) have relatively high ionic conductivity of ~ 3 × 10−2 S/cm and good mechanical strength of G′ ~ 3 × 104 Pa at room temperature. In addition, the resultant GPE-based solid-state supercapacitors show reasonable electrochemical properties. These results provide a novel possibility for developing new electrolyte materials in the field of energy storage devices. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
