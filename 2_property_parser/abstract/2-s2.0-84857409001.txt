Carbon nanocoils (CNCs) are coiled carbon nanofibers of ca. 10 nm in fiber diameter, and 10-20 nm in internal coil diameter. They are prepared through several oxidation treatments, which lead to a graduate content in surface oxygen groups evolving as either CO or CO 2 in temperature-programmed desorption. The CNCs show a moderate surface area (40-240 m 2 g -1) and a relatively high electrical conductivity (0.1-0.2 S cm -1). Some CNCs are activated to develop surface area. The electrochemical behaviour of CNCs as supercapacitor electrode is studied in the electrolytes H 2SO 4 and Et 4NBF 4. From the parameters C 1 (overall specific capacitance measured at 1 mA cm -2), S BET (BET specific surface area), and CO and CO 2 content, the plots of C 1S BET vs. COS BET and vs. CO 2S BET are analyzed. In the acidic electrolyte, the oxygen groups evolving as CO 2 contribute significantly to enhance C 1 in addition to the groups evolving as CO. C 1S BET shows a linear dependence, with high slope, on CO 2S BET, and an exponential dependence on COS BET. In the organic electrolyte, the two kinds of oxygen groups contribute less to C 1. The specific pseudocapacitance and double layer capacitance are determined and discussed in relation to the CO and CO 2 content and the S BET value. Â© 2012 The Electrochemical Society.
