In response to the changing global landscape, energy has become a primary focus of the major world powers and scientific community. There has been great interest in developing and refining more efficient energy storage devices. Owing to their outstanding physical properties, perovskite nanostructures continue to attract considerable scientific and commercial interest. Hence, in this present study, La 2 SrV 2 O 9 perovskites are synthesized using ball milling technique with different milling time such as 10, 15, 20 and 25 h. Thermogravimetric and Differential scanning analysis were performed in order to find its thermal properties. The structural and morphological characterizations such as XRD, SEM and FT-IR are performed in order to find out the crystalline nature, surface morphology and functional groups of the samples. X-ray diffraction studies further ensure that 20 h milled sample shows good crystallization nature. The electrochemical properties of La 2 SrV 2 O 9 perovskites were studied by using Cyclic Voltammetry. This reveals that the sample (20 h milled) shows higher specific capacitance compared to other samples which could be due to the formation of good crystallization. In addition, we noticed better capacitance even after 500 cycles from the capacitance retention study. Our results strongly demonstrate that the novel La 2 SrV 2 O 9 perovskites are suitable and potential candidate in the development of futuristic electrode materials for supercapacitor applications.
