The current energy problem and the pursuit of sustainable development goals are being addressed by the “Waste to Energy” movement. Recycling is a good technique to turn waste into useful material, and the production of sustainable energy materials from recycling has attracted a lot of attention. Growing population, industrialization, dwindling fossil fuel supplies, environmental contamination, and a need for sustainable, renewable energy storage technologies. In this context, supercapacitors have promising properties like superior power density and cyclability and are highly stable at high temperatures. This mini-review focuses on the basic concepts of supercapacitors and the production of electrode material from bio-waste and industrial solid wastes. This article compares supercapacitive behavior of activated carbon material derived from biomass and industrial solid wastes.
