Silicon carbide precursors were synthesized by pyrolysis of polycarbosilane (PCS) at higher temperature. Subsequently, silicon carbide-derived carbons (SiC-CDCs) were obtained via chlorination of the SiC precursors at 1 000â„ƒ. The microstructure and morphology of the SiC-CDCs were characterized by X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD), Raman spectra, Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and N2 adsorption-desorption method. The effects of pyrolysis temperature on the crystal phase, morphology, pore size and distribution of the SiC-CDCs were investigated and the electrochemical performances as the electrode of supercapacitors were evaluated. The results show that SiC-CDCs with larger specific surface areas and sub-nanometer pores can be successfully prepared by chlorination of SiC precursors. Meanwhile, the SiC-CDCs exhibit better specific capacitances and supercapacitive performances at different current densities.
