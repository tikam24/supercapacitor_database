Flexible energy storage electronics are gaining increasing attention in recent years, but challenge still remains in obtaining fiber-shaped devices with both high specific capacitance to provide a high energy density and mechanical stretchability/flexibility to be able to integrate under extensive bending, stretching and twisting. Here, an all-in-one fiber high performance stretchable supercapacitor is constructed based on high performance bead-like NiCo2S4@carbon nanotube and Ti3C2Tx@N/O enriched carbon cloth threads electrodes. The assembled stretchable supercapacitor demonstrates a voltage output of 1.5 V and a specific areal capacitance of 559.3 mF cm−2, resulting in a high energy density of 174.78 μWh cm−2, outperforming most of previously reported stretchable fiber-shaped supercapacitors. Moreover, the high energy storage performances are well preserved under repeatedly stretching and bending. This unique design opens up a new direction in the development of stretchable fiber-shaped energy storage devices.
