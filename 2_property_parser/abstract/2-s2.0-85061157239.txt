Covalent functionalization of reduced graphene oxide aerogel (RGOA), which has undergone diazotization and amidation, was achieved by grafting polyaniline (PANI) onto the surface of RGOA. Diazotization and amidation could introduce amino groups, which were directly responsible for the chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline on the surface of RGOA. The resultant PANI-grafted RGOA (RGOA-PANI) could be used for high performance supercapacitors.
