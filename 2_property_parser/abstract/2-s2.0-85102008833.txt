Hybrid electric vehicles are considered to be the future of the mobility, in particular fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles are believed to be a promising solution. As for every hybrid system, a good energy management strategy is fundamental to improve the efficiency and preserve the sources. This paper presents a new, simple energy management strategy, developed for the IEEE VTS Motor Challenge 2020, an international contest focused on the energy management of a fuel cell/ lead acid battery/ ultracapacitor electric vehicle.
