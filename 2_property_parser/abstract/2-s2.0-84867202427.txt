The Energy Storage Sub-program was selected as one of the programs of the National Science and Technology Program-Energy (NSTPE) following several resolutions: resolutions from meetings held by the Guiding Squad of Energy Policy and Technology Development and the Executive Yuan in Taiwan, 15 master plans on energy technology development drafted during the National Industrial Technology Meeting in November 2007, and the resolution passed during the 23 rd Technology Meeting of the Executive Yuan in December 2007. The aims of the Energy Storage Sub-program are as follows: (1) reduce the cost of production and develop high-performance lithium ion battery, (2) construct an industry alliance among companies involved in the production of lithium-ion batteries, (3) establish platforms for the evaluation, testing, and certification of energy storage technology and (4) develop key techniques for next-generation supercapacitors while minimizing cost.
