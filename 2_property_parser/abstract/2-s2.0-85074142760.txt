The capacity of electric double layer capacitor is dependent on specific surface area of electrodes. The purpose of this study is to prepare porous electrode materials using polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) blends by electrospinning and carbonization process. PMMA from PAN/PMMA nanofiber webs were selectively removed by immersing in methylene chloride. Morphology and diameter of fibers were investigated using scanning electron microscope (SEM). Morphology of webs was controlled using various blend ratios of PAN/PMMA and average diameters of fiber webs slightly decreased by increasing the ratio of PMMA after carbonization. Morphologically controlled PAN/PMMA nanofiber webs were used for carbon electrode materials after carbonization.
