In order to study the effects caused by the mass fractions of activated carbon and neutral electrolyte in the electrochemical performance of a supercapacitor electrode, we chose activated carbon as the electrode material, acetylene black as the conductive agent, PTFE as the binder solution and isopropanol as the additive. We used powder compression technology to prepare electrodes of differing mass fractions of activated carbon. We characterised the electrode by cyclic voltammetry and constant current charge-discharge tests under a three-electrode system, and we obtained the specific capacitance and the specific power of the electrode by curve analysis and calculation. The results show that the specific capacitance, the specific energy and the specific power reached 331.4 F/g, 37.28 Wh/kg and 556.4 W/kg, respectively, when the activated carbon mass fraction was 70% and the scan rate was 2 mV/s.
