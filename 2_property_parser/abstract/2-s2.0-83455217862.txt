High-precisely and quickly measuring supercapaci-tor capacitance is necessary to improve the performance and quality of super capacitors, to decrease capacitance deviation and to enhance reliability and life expectancy of groups of supercapacitor. Based on the equivalent model of super capacitor, using the measuring method of direct and constant current charging and discharging, time of measurement was shortened by means of larger, direct and constant current discharging, applying discrete sum of software, the requirement of constant current was debased and accuracy was maintained, because of environmental temperature's influence, the errors resulting from temperature variations of environment was lowered by corresponding compensation process. After measurement comparison experiments, the results show that capacitance error is less than 0.5F by measuring 350F supercapacitor. The requirement of measurement can be met. Â© 2011 IEEE.
