Amorphous carbon nanotube (a-CNTs)-MnO2 nano hybrids were synthesized by simple low temperature chemical route with varying MnO2 concentration. The as prepared pure and hybrid samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, field emission scanning and high resolution transmission electron microscope, Raman spectrometer, Fourier transformed infrared and UVâ€“Vis spectrometer. Also it has been shown that the electrochemical performance of the pure a-CNTs was enhanced significantly when being coated with MnO2 nanoflakes. The specific capacitance of the hybrid sample becomes as high as 145.6 F/g. The result is even better compared to pure MnO2. The detail optical study of such hybrids has been reported for the first time showing a monotonic decrease of optical gap with increasing manganese concentration. Other constants like refractive index, extinction coefficient have also been calculated that in turn helped in calculating different dielectric parameters like dielectric constants, loss etc. All these results collectively showed hybrid samples are more promising regarding different fields of energy storage applications. Study of electrochemical performance of the as synthesized samples ensured the same. These studies can well speculate the existence of another supercapacitor hybrid for the use in environment friendly battery and thus a pollution free nature.
