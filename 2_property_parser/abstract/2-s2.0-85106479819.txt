Vehicles have become an integral part of the modern era, but unfortunately conventional vehicles consume non-renewable energy resources which have associated issue of air pollution. In addition to that, global warming and the shortage of fossil fuels have provided motivation to look for alternative to conventional vehicles. In the recent era, hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) is becoming popular due to their attractive features of energy saving and less air pollution. This paper aimed at designing a hybrid electric vehicle control scheme with an effective energy management system under varying load conditions. The proposed hybrid energy storage system of the HEV in this work consists of two energy sources: (1) main source: fuel cell and (2) auxiliary source: ultra-capacitor and battery. Furthermore, a fuzzy logic-based nonlinear controller has been developed to effectively control the management of energy sources according to load demand. The proposed HEV model has been developed using MATLAB/Simulink environment and the simulation results verify that the proposed fuzzy logic-based controller provides better voltage regulation and efficient energy management for the complete drive range of the HEV. Moreover, a comparative study of the proposed controller with existing control methods affirms its better reference tracking with minimum overshoot, faster convergence, better stability, and enhanced regulation of DC bus bar voltages under varying load conditions.
