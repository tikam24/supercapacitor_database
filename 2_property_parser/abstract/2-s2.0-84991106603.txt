The design of bimetallic Co–Fe oxide structures has attracted considerable research attention in magnetic, electrochemical and catalyst materials. This paper reports the production of unique multi crystal-phase Co/Fe/CoFe2O4 by the water–gas shift reaction. The metallic Co and Fe lower the interfacial resistance, resulting in facial charge/ion transport and a dramatic enhancement in the specific capacitance. The multi-phase Co–Fe oxide structures are also found to be applicable to the water–gas shift reaction and CO oxidation. The unique water–gas shift reaction-induced method can be very useful to the design of highly efficient new multi crystal-phase nanostructures.
