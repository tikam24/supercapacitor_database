Multiple supercapacitors constituting of a serial-parallel structure are usually used as energy storage system as the voltage of single supercapacitor is relatively low. In the discharging process, there is voltage imbalance among supercapacitors caused by their different properties, which will affect the system's discharge efficiency and energy utilization ratio, and even the service life of the supercapacitors. To solve this problem, voltage balance control strategy is proposed to minimize the voltage imbalance and to achieve high efficiency and high energy utilization of the supercapacitors. Through theoretical analysis and experiment, the feasibility of the strategy is verified.
