Metal-doped tin oxide is gathering interest in the field of energy storage and power supply devices, particularly in supercapacitors applications. In the present study, we adopt a hydrothermal method to synthesis SnO2, Zn-SnO2, Ag-SnO2 nanoparticles at suitable conditions of temperature, pH, reaction time, and capping agents (CTAB). SnO2, Zn-SnO2, Ag-SnO2 nanoparticles were synthesized at 160 °C for 12 h and characterized by employing X-ray Diffraction to confirm the regular crystalline formation with tetragonal structure. Initial analyses by employing CV and GCD results exhibited specific capacitance of 308.2 Ag−1 for Ag-SnO2 nanoparticles at current density 0.5 A/g and can be considered as suitable candidate as positive electrode for supercapacitor device applications.
