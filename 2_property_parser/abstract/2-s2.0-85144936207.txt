Supercapacitors are important storage devices that display high specific capacitance much faster than batteries. They are emerging class of technology that offer higher density than traditional capacitors. This chapter is based on the review of Polyaniline (PANI)-based nanocomposite as supercapacitor electrode materials. PANI is one of the widely studied candidates for supercapacitors for one decade simply because of its eco-friendly nature, high electrical conductivity, inherently electrochemical property, extraordinary specific capacitance, and low cycling stability. The main limitation of PANI as a supercapacitor is its low cycle life. Because of this limitation, there are recent developments in PANI-based nanocomposites with carbon, activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, metal oxide, transition metal oxides, etc. This chapter will focus on achieving the high performance of the newly cultivated PANI‚Äêbased supercapacitors with and without binder addition into the PANI network. In addition, the chapter includes a brief fundamental concept of the standard synthesis and the analysis of the electrochemical properties of PANI with and without binder-based supercapacitors. Moreover, many new interesting advanced PANI composites/nanocomposites supercapacitors have also been included in this chapter.
