Cobalt nitrides have great potential in energy storage due to their excellent electrical conductivity and thermal stability. To prepare high-performance cobalt nitride supercapacitor materials, Co-MFF (cobalt formic acid framework material) obtained by liquid phase deposition method was adopted as Co precursor, and COx.N@ C was prepared by pyrolysis of the Co-MFF in ammonia and argon mixing atmosphere. The effects of pyrolysis atmosphere and temperature on the structure and electrical properties of CoxN@C were studied. The results show that CoxN@C consists of CoN and Co4N in mixed phases and amorphous N-doped carbon, and the pore structure of CoxN@C can be changed by adjusting pyrolysis conditions. When the content of ammonia was 10% and the calcination temperature was 450 Â°C, the specific capacity of CoxN@C was as high as 208.5 and 171.4 F/g at the current density of 1 and 10 A/g, respectively, which reveals good rate capability. Meanwhile, the specific capacitance remains 100% even after 1 000 cycles of charge and discharge, suggesting good cycle stability. These results obtained in this work provide a new way for preparing cobalt nitride supercapacitor electrode materials.
