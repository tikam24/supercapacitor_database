A facile approach has been established to prepare PPy via in situ polymerization with different metal sulfate as dopants. The morphology and structure of PPy and doped PPy were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fourier transform infrared (FT-IR). It was found that doped PPy has different morphology and a slight structure change. The electrochemical performance of the samples has been illustrated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) and AC impedance measurements. Compared with the PPy, the specific capacitance of PPy/Cu2+ has been improved to 224 F g–1 at the current density of 0.6 A g–1. Also, the relationship between electrochemical properties of doped PPy and various parameters of metal ions has been investigated.
