Electrical vehicles are the really important innovation for improved environmental conditions in the world. Electrical vehicle involves many hardware inside like battery pack. Battery pack has significant role for getting distance and it should be used carefully. Therefore, it is necessary to use additional device for recovering battery from high energy flow. When ultracapacitor technology combined with battery, energy will be used more efficiently and the life of the battery is increased. A solution to the rapid change in power cycle of the vehicle on uneven path is the use of hybrid electric vehicle which gets power from battery and ultracapacitor where battery satisfies energy requirement and ultracapacitor satisfies power requirement. High energy demand of the driver can be fulfilled through the ultracapacitor, which is connected in shunt with battery. Because high energy means high current and ultracapacitor structure is available to ensure this state instead of battery. In this paper, motoring, regenerative braking and several energy management methods are discussed for hybrid electric vehicle with the help of MATLAB. The results of this scheme are being compared with only battery and combination of battery and ultracapacitor. The speed control of DC motor is also compared at different reference speeds and load torque using bi-directional converter and PI controller.
