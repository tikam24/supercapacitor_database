Abstract: The rapid development of wearable and smart electronics for environmental sensors, Internet of things and implantable medical devices has accelerated the demand for high-performance electrochemical energy storage devices (EESDs) that possess high safety and diverse form factors. Of these devices, printable EESDs including batteries and supercapacitors are regarded as a novel class of highly competitive candidates to meet the demands to future wearable, portable and integrated power sources due to their low costs, scalability and outstanding compatibility with industrial processes. In addition, printable EESDs can enable the design of various form factors, including tailored sizes and shapes, miniaturization, flexibility, esthetic versatility and integration. Based on this, this review will provide a topical overview of recent advancements in printable EESDs with a focus on representative printing techniques and their intriguing features, including rheological requirements to component inks, printing resolutions, compatible substrates and potential applications for the fabrication of high-performance EESDs. This review will also discuss the diversified form factors and functionalities of printable EESDs that allow for designable shapes, mechanical robustness and integration toward unconventional, customized, flexible and smart applications in future electronics and present the existing challenges and perspective of printed power sources with multiple form factors.
