The evolution of wearable technologies boosted the development of energy storage textiles that can be charged faster and store energy for longer time. Achieving multifunctionality on textiles is a key milestone towards higher value-added smart products. Herein, we report on the fabrication of a novel dual-functional textile device merging enhanced energy storage performance with optical properties. A redox-active solid-gel electrolyte based on fluorescent manganese(II)-doped zinc(II) sulfide was for the first time used to endow the dual functionality to the device when combined with MWCNT-coated textile electrodes. The textile electrodes were prepared through an eco-sustainable straightforward dip-pad-dry process using a natural cotton fabric substrate. The fluorescent hybrid textile supercapacitor exhibited enhanced energy storage performance relative to the EDLC-type analogue containing the undoped electrolyte, namely 20% higher working voltage (1.64 V), 48% higher energy density (1.63 W h kg−1) and 74% higher power density (641.6 W kg−1). Additionally, it presented excellent cycling stability (100%) after 8000 charge/discharge cycles. The device exhibited intense yellow-orange fluorescence under UV light, while preserving the energy storage functionality. This work demonstrated the versatility of this type of devices for dark environment applications, namely in reflective/safety electronic clothing for nighttime users.
