A novel ternary polymer composite comprising prussian blue (PB) based polypyrrole (PPy) incorporated with TiO2, PPy–PB/TiO2 is synthesized via chemical oxidative polymerization and is fabricated as an active electrode material for supercapacitor applications. Physico-chemical characterization of the as-prepared ternary composite was carried out using XRD, Raman spectroscopy, XPS, FESEM, HRTEM, EDAX and TGA techniques. The electrochemical properties of PPy–PB/TiO2 are investigated using cyclic voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy, and charge/discharge measurements in a three-electrode configuration, employing different aqueous electrolytes namely acidic (1 M H2SO4), alkaline (1 M KOH), and neutral (1 M KCl). The highest specific capacitance of 429 F g−1 has been obtained in an acidic electrolyte (H2SO4) which is superior to alkaline and neutral electrolyte with capacitance retention of 98.87% of their initial capacitance after 2500 charge/discharge cycles, which indicates the good electrochemical stability of the polymer composite. The present work demonstrates PPy–PB/TiO2 nanocomposite as an excellent candidate for supercapacitor electrode material.
