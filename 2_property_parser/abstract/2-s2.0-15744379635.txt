Ru/C nanocomposite was prepared by microwave heating. TEM imaging shows a high dispersion of Ru particles with a mean diameter of 3.2 nm and uniform size on the carbon support. After electrochemical oxidation of the Ru nanoparticles to ruthenium oxide nanoparticles, the resulting RuOx/C nanocomposite could be used as an electrochemical supercapacitor material to increase the specific capacitance of carbon (XC-72) from 31 F/g to 144 F/g.
