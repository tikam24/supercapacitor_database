In general, one of the most important goals of smart grids; the establishment of networks that allow for more distributed generation and energy storage at the end-user side. Energy storage technology; It has great potential to improve electric power systems, increase renewable electricity generation and offer alternatives to petroleum-derived fuels in the transportation sector. This study sheds light on the advantages offered by energy storage technologies, which play an active role in solving the problems encountered during the grid integration of renewable energy sources in smart grid applications. In addition, different solutions offered by different energy storage technologies such as Vanadium are also evaluated in this study. In this study, an energy storage unit with high energy and high power density was designed with the Hybrid Energy Storage System (V-HEES) consisting of vanadium and ultra-capacitor. In addition, the results of the hybrid energy storage system consisting of vanadium and ultra-capacitors and the application areas of these technologies in smart grids are also included.
