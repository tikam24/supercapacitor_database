Accurate state estimation is crucial to the control and management of the hybrid energy storage system (HESS). Although there have been many studies on state estimation of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and ultracapacitors (UCs), state estimation for HESS is scarce and poorly defined. To fill this gap, this article aims to propose a co-estimation framework of the state-of-charge (SoC) and remaining discharging time (RDT) for the HESS based on fractional-order theory. First, considering the impedance characteristics of the LIB and UC, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiment is conducted to establish the fractional-order models (FOMs). The grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is used to identify the model parameters. Then the fractional extended Kalman filter (FEKF) is used to obtain the SoC for the LIB and UC. A statistical method with the forgetting factor is used for load current forecasting. Finally, the co-estimation framework of the SoC and RDT for the HESS is presented and verified with experimental data. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the SoC estimation for the HESS is less than 0.92% in two cases. The experimental results indicate that the proposed co-estimation method of the HESS has achieved high precision and a fast convergence rate under the typical current working condition. This work can be used for a better energy management strategy development.
