Carbon gels are a kind of porous organic polymer, which play pivotal roles in electrode, supercapacitor, hydrogen storage, and catalysis. Carbon gels are commonly prepared by the condensation of resorcinol and formaldehyde. The as-prepared polymers are further aged and sintered at a high temperature in an inert atmosphere to form cross-linked and intertwined porous structures. Owing to its large specific area and narrow pore size distribution, this kind of material is very appropriate for mass transfer, substrate absorption, and product desorption from the pores. In recent years, carbon gels have been discovered to function as effective hybrid materials with TiO2 for photocatalytic applications. They could act as efficient deep-traps for photo-induced holes, which decreases the recombination probability of photo-induced carriers and lengthens their lifetime. In this mini-review, we will discuss the state-of-the-art paragon examples of carbon gels/TiO2 composite materials applied in photo(electro)catalysis. The major challenges and gaps of its application in this field will also be emphasized.
