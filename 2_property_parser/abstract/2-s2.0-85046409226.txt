In modern transport industry there is a tendency for electric vehicles with independent power supply to increase their amount, particularly it seems to appear in the fast development of electric cars. Nevertheless, there are still some flaws in electric vehicle drives to be improved. The element of an electric drive that limits the performance of the vehicle is almost always power supply. Li-Ion accumulators, which are most often chosen for this role, despite their good energy characteristics, have high impedance that causes great heat losses on the battery. Connecting a super capacitor, which has lower dc resistance, in-parallel with the accumulator can eliminate this drawback. In this work the study of the efficiency of energy transformation in induction motor electric drives has been conducted for both options of power supply: with supercapacitor and without it. The results of this study help to evaluate the benefits of using supercapacitor and to suggest the area of implementing supercapacitor in electric drives.
