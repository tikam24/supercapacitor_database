Nowadays, many scientific communities and researchers are disparate towards the development of new and advanced energy storage/conversion devices to fulfill the increasing energy demands. Supercapacitors have considered as attractive energy storage devices because of their tremendous features. But their low conductivity creates a barrier to their practical applications, which is a consequence of the presence of binder in the formation of electrode material. Herein, a binder-free flexible supercapacitor electrode based on polypyrrole/fluorinated graphene (PFG) nanocomposite hydrogel on carbon cloth has been designed using in-situ oxidative polymerization. The resultant composite hydrogel possessed excellent electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance of 1372 F/g in 1 M H2SO4 at a current density of 0.5 A/g. The maximum specific energy and specific power were estimated to be 20.13 Wh/kg and 176 W/kg, respectively. The outstanding electrochemical performance may be attributed to the combined effect of polypyrrole, fluorinated graphene as well as porous morphology of hydrogel. The resultant flexible and binder-free supercapacitor electrode with outstanding electrochemical performance will play a significant role in the field of wearable electronics, touch screens, electronic papers and roll up displays.
