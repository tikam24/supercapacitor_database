This article shows that carbon dots (CQDs), polystyrene sphere (PS) or silica sphere (SiO2) assembled on MoS2 have been successfully synthesized as electrode materials (CQDs/MoS2, PS/MoS2 and SiO2/MoS2) for supercapacitors by a simple hydrothermal process. It can be observed that SiO2 is distributed in the periphery of the flower-like MoS2, and the special morphology has a positive effect on electrochemical performance. As expected, SiO2/MoS2 as a promising electrode material for supercapacitor, exhibiting a higher specific capacitance of 1448.53 F g−1 at a current density of 5 A g−1 and good cycle stability of 70.10% retention after 2000 cycles. This method also provides a reference for the electrode material of supercapacitors with better performance in the future.
