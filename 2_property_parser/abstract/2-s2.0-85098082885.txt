Three-dimensional MoS2 (3D-MoS2) microflowers consisting electrode of few-layered nanoflakes synthesized via a hydrothermal approach is a promising material for ultrahigh-performance symmetric supercapacitors. A three-electrode configuration of the 3D-MoS2 microflowers exhibited a remarkable electrolytic specific capacitance of 243.31F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and 98.71% retention after 2000 charge/discharge sequences at 8 A g−1. The fabricated coin cell-type symmetric supercapacitor devices (SSDs) showed an ultrahigh power density (Pd) of 2412.15 W Kg−1 at an energy density (Ed) of 1.06 Wh Kg−1, exhibiting the high energy storage capability of the 3D-MoS2 microflowers, thus enabling their application to electrodes in hybrid energy storage devices.
