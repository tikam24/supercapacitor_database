Currently, there is a majority of interest in developing low-cost, lightweight, environmentally friendly electronics that are flexible, wearable, and have a long lifetime in the energy field. Supercapacitors (SCs), particularly those with integrated designs, have drawn a lot of attentiveness since their long cycle life and high power density. MOFs have been used in the bulk of energy storage devices to date, and they have proven to be crucial. MOFs also have unique characteristics such as unrestricted structural variation, a highly organized crystalline framework, massive internal surface areas, great with easily accessible pores. As a result, MOFs have gotten a lot of significant importance in the field of SCs. This featured review, covered 37th pristine MOFs which contains nickel, cobalt, copper, manganese, UiO, ZIF, IRMOF, and HKUST MOFs. This study focuses on using solely pristine MOFs as a platform for SCs, dividing them into three dimensionalities: one (1D), two (2D), and three (3D) -dimensional MOFs. For better understanding about dimensionalities based performance of pristine MOF, only one pristine MOF is listed out from each dimensions and compared the specific capacitance with each other. Because of their unique features of large SSA, high adsorption, high Cs, high porosity, and high conductivity, energy storage applications have received a great deal of attention. Finally, the summary and future perspective are also described briefly.
