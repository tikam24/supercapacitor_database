The versatile technological applications of molybdenum oxides requires the efficient synthesis of various stoichiometric molybdenum oxides. Thus, herein, a controlled method to synthesize both MoO3 and MoO2 from MoS2 via quantum dot intermediates is reported. Microscopic, spectroscopic, and X-ray studies corroborate the formation of orthorhombic α-MoO3 with a microbelt structure and monoclinic MoO2 nanoparticles that self-assemble into hollow tubes. Quantitative investigations into charge-storage kinetics reveal that MoO2 exhibits an excellent pseudocapacitive response up to a mass loading of 5 mg cm−2 with an areal capacity of 327.2 mC cm−2 at 5 mV s−1, with 41.9 % retention at 100 mV s−1. In contrast, above a mass loading of 0.5 mg cm−2, the charge-storage nature of MoO3 electrodes switches from that of a supercapacitor to battery type. At a sweep rate of 50 mV s−1, 87.2 % of the total charge is contributed by a capacitive response in a 1 mg cm−2 MoO2 electrode. The charge-storage kinetics of MoO3 and MoO2 reflect on the respective asymmetric supercapacitors. A MoO2//graphite asymmetric supercapacitor holds an outstanding energy density of 341 mW h m−2 at a power density of 4949 mW m−2 and delivers an ultrahigh power density of 28140 mW m−2 with an energy density 142 mW h m−2 and energy efficiency of 87 %.
