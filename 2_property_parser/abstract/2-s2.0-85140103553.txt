Copper oxide nanoparticles (CuONPs) have received much interest among metal oxide nanoparticles due to their various features and utilities in many disciplines, particularly electrical conductivity and energy trends. This study used sugarcane molasses as a reducing and capping agent for CuONP biosynthesis in electrical conductivity and supercapacitor applications. These nanoparticles were characterized by UV/Vis, TEM, EDX, SEM, FTIR spectra, TGA, and BET. TEM pictures revealed the development of CuONPs with mean diameters ranging from 29 to 55 nm, while SEM revealed the formation of CuONPs in nanorods. FTIR spectra confirmed the biomolecule functional moieties, which act as reducing agents for the CuONPs synthesis. Furthermore, at 417 °C, the CuONP nanocomposite produced a total weight loss of approximately 34.8%. Also, the development of copper oxide on the nanocomposite is seen in the diffraction peaks of 2 = 36.7° and 61.4°. The results reveal that the AC/CuONPs electrode has exhibited the highest capacitance and the lowest resistance among the different AC/CuONPs nanocomposites prepared at different current densities. At 1 A g−1, the specific capacitance of the AC and AC/CuONPs electrodes was 166 and 245 F g−1, respectively, and the capacitance retention was 99.5 and 100% of its initial value after 2000 cycles.
