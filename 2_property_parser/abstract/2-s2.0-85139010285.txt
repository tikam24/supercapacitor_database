In modern electric vehicles, more and more attention is paid to recuperation. This requires the implementation of bidirectional converter topologies. The usage of dual active bridge topology can be implemented for the construction of a charging station with the ability to store energy in the grid or other energy storage element such as a supercapacitor or battery. The usage of the one topology would improve the energy efficiency and optimal use of the power electronic converter. This research presents a mathematical model, realized in PSIM environment, of dual active bridge converter for charging station application. That environment is oriented towards the design of different electronic circuits and allows for various simulation studies.
