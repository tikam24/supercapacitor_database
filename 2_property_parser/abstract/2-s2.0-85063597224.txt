Hierarchical porous textures of carbon-based electrode materials are advantageous for applications in supercapacitors, owing to their reasonable pore size distribution and large surface area. In this work, a facile yet effective one-step carbonization method for the preparation of hierarchical porous carbons (HPCs) derived from interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) of phenol-formaldehyde resin (PF) and sodium polyacrylate (PAAS) is proposed. Phenol-formaldehyde prepolymer can be introduced into the inter network space of PAAS to form IPNs in which only hydrogen-bonding interactions exist between them. During the carbonization process of IPNs, the PF networks tend to form a carbon matrix, which generates large amounts of micropores. While the PAAS evaporates into gaseous products, serving as a template for micro-, meso-, and macropores. Due to such synergistic effects, a carbon material with a large surface area of 1764 m2 g−1 and a large pore volume of 1.111 cm3 g−1 is constructed with an interconnected hierarchical porous carbon network structure. With such unique carbon structure characteristics, the electrode material of HPC delivers a high specific capacitance of 201 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and excellent cyclability of approximately 100 % of capacitance retention after 10000 cycles. The ideal capacitive behavior from IPNs provides new insights for the production of carbonaceous materials for high-performance supercapacitors applications.
