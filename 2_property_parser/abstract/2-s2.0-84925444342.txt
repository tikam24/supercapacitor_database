A supercapacitor electrode assembled from activated carbon (AC) and (NH4)6[P2Mo18O62]Â·14.2H2O (P2Mo18) was fabricated for the first time, and showed remarkable electrochemical performance ascribed to the synergy of the double layer capacitance of AC and the pseudocapacitance of P2Mo18. The investigations indicate that the AC/P2Mo18 electrode exhibits a specific capacitance of 275 F g- 1 at a high current density of 6 A g- 1, which is substantially larger than the 182 F g- 1 of the AC electrode. In addition, the AC/P2Mo18 electrode possesses a remarkable rate capability (89%) when the current density is increased from 2 to 6 A g- 1.
