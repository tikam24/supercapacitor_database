The present study deals with the intensified synthesis of starch-polyaniline (starch-PANI) nanocomposite using an ultrasound-assisted method. Starch is a key component in this nanocomposite, which acts as a backbone of the nucleation of PANI. The Electrochemical property of the nanocomposite arises due to the addition of PANI. This is one of green approach for the synthesis of bio nanocomposite using ultrasound. The crystallinity of the composite is evaluated using the Scherrer Formula. The starch-PANI nanocomposite was characterized by XRD, FT-IR, Raman, XPS and TEM. The composite nanoparticles show spherical morphology. The elemental composition of starch-PANI showed O 1s peak at 546 eV, N 1s peak at 416 eV, C 1s peak at 286 eV and S 1s peak at 176 eV. The electrochemical studies of the starch-PANI electrodes are evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Starch-PANI electrode has shown the maximum specific capacitance of 499.5 F/g at 5 mV/s scan rate.
