The Li-ion battery (BT)/supercapacitor (SC) hybrid system (HESS) electric vehicle (EV) has advantages compared to the BT only used EV. Simulation is an essential step in the analysis and design of a BT /SC HESS EV. The secondary development of ADVISOR (advanced vehicle simulator) for a BT/SCHESS EV is studied. The BT/SC model and energy management strategy are introduced. A SAFT li-ion BT and a Maxwell SC tested data are used in the HESS EV. The simulation results are given.
