Two types of double-layer capacitors, based on carbon materials, were analysed: (1) an imaginary nano-capacitor assembled from single graphene sheets, separated by electrolyte layers (thickness of nanometers) and (2) a capacitor based on porous carbons. It has been shown that the maximum specific surface of a porous carbon material which may be used for the construction of a capacitor is ca. 2600 m2 g-1. The maximum energy density of an imaginary double-layer 'nano-capacitor', is close to 10 kJ kg-1 at a voltage of U = 1 V (aqueous electrolyte) of ca. 40-45 kJ kg-1 at U ≈ 2.3-2.5 V (organic electrolytes), and at the order of 100 kJ kg-1 at voltages close to 4 V (ionic liquids as electrolytes). The real device consists of porous electrodes and a separator, both soaked with the electrolyte, as well as current collectors. Consequently, the maximum electric capacity expressed versus the mass of the device (ca. 20-30 F g-1), is much smaller than the corresponding value expressed versus the mass of the carbon material (ca. 300 F g-1). In order to obtain the energy density of the device at a level of 100 kJ kg-1 (characteristic for the lead-acid battery), the capacitor with porous carbon electrodes should operate at voltages of ca. 4 V (ionic liquids as electrolytes). However, the specific power density of such a capacitor having an acceptable energy density (ca. 100 kJ kg-1) is relatively low (ca. 1 kW kg-1). © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
