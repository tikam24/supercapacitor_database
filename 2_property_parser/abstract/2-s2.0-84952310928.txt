Two-dimensional (2D) graphene oxide/polypyrrole (GO/PPy) hybrid materials derived from in-situ polymerization are used as precursors for constructing functionalized three-dimensional (3D) porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheet frameworks (FT-PNCNFs) through a one-step activation strategy. In the formation process of FT-PNCNFs, PPY is directly converted into hierarchical porous nitrogen-doped carbon layers, while GO is simultaneously reduced to become electrically conductive. The complementary functions of individual components endow the FT-PNCNFs with excellent properties for both supercapacitors (SCs) and sodium ion batteries (SIBs) applications. When tested in symmetrical SC, the FT-PNCNFs demonstrate superior energy storage behaviour. At an extremely high scan rate of 3000 mV s-1, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve retains an inspiring quasi-rectangle shape in KOH solution. Meanwhile, high capacitances (∼247 F g-1 at 10 mV s-1; ∼146 F g-1 at 3000 mV s-1) and good cycling stability (∼95% retention after 8000 cycles) are achieved. In addition, an attractive SIB anode performance could be achieved. The FT-PNCNFs electrode delivers a reversible capacity of 187 mAh g-1 during 160th cycle at 100 mA g-1. Its reversible capacity retains 144 mAh g-1 after extending the number of cycles to 500 at 500 mA g-1.
