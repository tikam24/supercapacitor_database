Solvent-in-salt(SIS), as a new type of electrolyte, is highly concerned, where the electrolyte ions and solvent form a special solvated structure to passivate solvent and further inhibit solvent decomposition/polarization as well as reduce its reactivity. Benefiting from these characteristics including well electrochemical stability, wide work voltage window, SIS features unique and superior merits in supercapacitor, offering prospects of unprecedented advances in device performance. This article focuses on the principles and advantages of SIS-type electrolytes, combs the research progress of SIS as an electrolyte for supercapacitors in recent years, summarizes its existing problems, and looks forward to the future development direction of SIS-type electrolyte.
