This paper concentrates on the design and control of a DC microgrid with PV, controlled Energy Storage System consists of battery, supercapacitor, DC loads, Electric Vehicle and Energy Management System (EMS). The main objective is to effectively manage the load requirements. A simple Adaptive energy management control is implemented. The system is simulated under different input and load condition in MATLAB/Simulink and the results are taken. It is observed from the obtained results that the dc microgrid with proposed energy management control satisfies the requirement under all conditions.
