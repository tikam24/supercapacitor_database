Electrochemical supercapacitors (ECs) with high energy density and power capability have demonstrated promising potential in various energy applications. In this study, 3D MnO2/rGO aerogels with excellent electrical conductivity was successfully prepared with a simple hydrothermal method. The as-prepared 3D aerogels could be applied for constructing the electrode of supercapacitor directly without the demand of other additives. Asymmetric supercapacitors were then constructed with Na2SO4 aqueous solution as electrolyte, MnO2/rGO aerogel and rGO aerogel as positive and negative electrode, respectively. The asymmetric supercapacitor demonstrated maximum energy density of 18.2 Wh/kg with power density of 400 W/kg and excellent cycle stability as well.
