A highly porous sponge like cobalt oxide decorated Bauhinia vahlii dry fruits derived activated carbon composite (Co3O4@BVFC) was synthesized by hydrothermal method. The as-fabricated (Co3O4@BVFC/Ni foil) electrode was tested for supercapacitor (SC) applications.1 ​M KOH aqueous solution was used as electrolyte. The Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Galvanostatic Charge – Discharge (GCD) techniques were adopted for the supercapacitor measurements. The as-fabricated Co3O4@BVFC/Ni electrode displayed a specific capacitance value of 653 ​F/g at 1 A/g. In addition, 91 % of capacitance retention achieved by Co3O4@ BVFC composite even after 8000 GCD cycles. Thus, Co3O4@BVFC with highly porous spongy microsphere morphology demonstrated itself as a suitable electrode material for supercapacitors.
