Batteries and supercapacitors have become the two most important technologies in the forefront of the electrochemical energy storage (EES) systems due to their important roles in hybrid vehicles, portable electronic devices, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The exploitation of efficient electrode materials is a key strategy for manufacturing high-performance batteries and supercapacitors, which is also one of the major motivations for the development of EES. As emerging advanced functional materials, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and MOF-derived materials are recognized as ideal candidate materials for EES. They not only have porosity to boost the ions/electron transfer and withstand the volume changes of electrodes during cycling, but also possess design characteristics of easy functionalization to obtain the required electrochemical properties. In this review, the recent progresses of MOFs and MOF-derived materials in various batteries and supercapacitors are systematically summarized. Furthermore, the universal design principle of MOF-based materials for EES system is extracted, in the hope of establishing a roadmap for the design of materials.
