Herein present work, we are reporting sol–gel citrate method for synthesis of MgFe2O4 nanocrystals doped with different concentrations (0, 2, 3 and 4 wt%) of zinc (Zn). The as-synthesized material is used as an electrode material for supercapacitor which demonstrated large specific capacitance, high energy density and cyclic stability. Experimental results revealed the highest specific capacitance of 484.6 Fg−1 and energy density 10.8 WhKg−1 at the current density 1 mAcm−2 using as-synthesized 2 wt% Zn doped MgFe2O4. These values demonstrates the best performance of the Zn doped MgFe2O4 nanocrystals as the electrodes in the supercapacitor application. Such excellent electrochemical properties are attributed to the intrinsic characteristics of Zn doped MgFe2O4 material including its crystal structure, morphology, high temperature stability and surface area.
