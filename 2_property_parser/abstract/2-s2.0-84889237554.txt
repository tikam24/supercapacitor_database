The electrodeposition of hydrated ruthenium dioxide (hRuO2) on Ti interdigitated current collectors deposited onto silicon substrate has been investigated with the objective of preparing a high capacitance and high power micro-supercapacitor (μ-SC) device. Ti current collectors were synthesised by typical photolithography processes, and hRuO2 thin films were electrodeposited from ruthenium chloride precursors. Device specific capacitances exceeding 20 mF·cm-2 were obtained, and more than 80% of that value is retained even at scan rate as high as 1 V·s -1 in 0.5 M H2SO4. The mean specific power per active surface area of the device is 368 mW·cm-2. The device is stable and 90% of the initial capacity is retained after 105 cycles (1 V potential window). The characteristic response time of the hRuO 2 μ-SC is 250 ms, with low ESR (0.61 Ω cm-2) and EDR (0.07 £2 cm-2) values. All these characteristics demonstrate the potential of such μ-SC devices to be part of the next generation of micro-supercapacitors. © 2013 Materials Research Society.
