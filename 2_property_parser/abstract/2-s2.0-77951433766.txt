The supercapacitive properties of flexible Nafion-doped polypyrrole(PPy/Nafion) electrodes prepared using a flexible gold coated porous PVDF substrate were investigated in the presence of an ionic liquid, N-methyl-N-propylpyridinium trifluoromethanesulfonyl imide(P1,3TFSI), by means of cyclic voltammetry for supercapacitors. The PPy/Nafion showed capacitance values in the range of 350-450F/g at the scan rates of 50-300mV/s, indicating the ionic liquid is suitable for the electrolyte in supercapacitor.
