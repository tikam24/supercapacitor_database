Supercapacitor fibers are rapidly produced in minutes by an integrated one-step fabrication process. This method is simple and efficient for large production. A variety of pseudocapacitive active materials including graphene oxide, metal oxide, and conducting polymers can be incorporated. The resulting all-solid-state supercapacitor fibers show remarkable energy-storage capabilities with both high power and energy densities.
