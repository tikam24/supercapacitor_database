Herein, we reported a facile, cost efficient, synthesis of Gr@NiCu NCs nanocomposite and explored their application in supercapacitor and antibacterial applications. The Graphene sheets in the NiCu based electrode showed a high specific surface area and supports conductive networks decorated with oxygen groups, which synergistically improve charge storage capability. Furthermore, Gr@NiCu NCs contain hydrophilic oxygen groups of chemically reduced graphene oxide, which allows easy access of the electrolyte to the electrode's pores. An electrochemical study demonstrated the highest specific capacitance of 977 Fg−1 at 10 Ag-1 and remarkable cyclic retentiveness ∼90% even after 1000 cycles. A noteworthy energy density of the Gr@NiCu NCs achieves approximately 542 KWh kg−1 and a power density of 21 kW kg−1 acquired through the CD description utilizing a current density of 10 Ag-1. The antimicrobial activity of synthesized Gr@NiCu NCs was performed against S. Aureus, E. coli, and MRSA ATCC BAA 1708, P.Aeroginosa (ATCC 27853), S.Mutans (MTCC SM 497) strains compared with ampicillin antibiotic drug. This potent antibacterial activity is attributable to the synergistic apoptosis from Cu2+ and bacteriostatic effect Ni2+ ions with graphene sheet (enhance ROS production), released from Gr@NiCu NCs.
