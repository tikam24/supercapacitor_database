Nano layer thin-film of silver (Ag) has been synthesized using a thermal vapor deposition technique on copper (Cu) substrate to study the potential application of silver as a supercapacitor electrode material. X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization of the deposited film was performed to identify and confirm the proper phase formation of the crystalline materialh. Surface characterization has been performed using atomic force microscopy (AFM) to see the physical structure and skewness of the surface. The surface to volume ratio of the nanolayer structure is quite high and this property can be useful as the electrode material of supercapacitor. The electrochemical performance of the synthesized thin films as supercapacitor electrodes has been studied using Cyclic Voltammetry. The specific capacitance of the supercapacitor was observed to be 14.5 F/g.
