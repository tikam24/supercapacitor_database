The binder-free deposition facilitates fast electron transfer and smoothens the diffusion path of electrolyte ions into the matrix of electrode material. Herein, the ternary metal oxides, such as manganese vanadium molybdenum oxide (MnVMo-oxide) is directly deposited on nickel foam by a single-step hydrothermal method. X-ray diffraction study confirms formation of MnVMo-oxide phase. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the Mn, V, and Mo are in the +2 (and +3), +5, and +6 oxidation states. Deposition time variation results, change in nanostructures from nanoparticle-assembled sheets to rectangular nanosheets, also the size of micro rods. The porous microrods formed with uneven quasi-rectangular shaped nanosheets of MnVMo-oxide exhibit high areal capacitance of 814.5 mFcm−2 (as compared to other electrodes) measured in 1 M KOH electrolyte at 3 mAcm−2 current density. The enhanced capacitance of the MnVMo-8 electrode is due to the dominance of the diffusion process over the capacitive-controlled contribution and high diffusion coefficient. The fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor device MnVMo-oxide//activated carbon shows good areal capacitance of 40 mFcm−2 with 0.025 mWhcm−2 energy at 1.5 mWcm−2 power density measured at 2 mAcm−2 current density, and cyclic stability of about 71.45 % (Coulombic efficiency of 98 %) quantified up to ∼9000 consecutive cycles.
