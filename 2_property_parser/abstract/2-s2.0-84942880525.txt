MnCO3 nanospheres and nanocubes have been successfully synthesized by a facile precipitation method utilizing ethylene glycol. When these MnCO3 samples were employed as electrodes in the pseudocapacitor with an aqueous NaClO4 electrolyte, they exhibited excellent supercapacitor characteristics. The MnCO3 nanospheres showed a specific capacitance of 129 F g-1 at 0.15 A g-1, while the nanocube electrode had a specific capacitance of 91 F g-1 at the same current density. The as-prepared MnCO3 electrode materials had a high retention of 87% and 92% after 1000 cycles at 0.3 A g-1, indicating a high-rate electrochemical cycling life. This study has highlighted the promising prospects of MnCO3 as a novel electrode material used for supercapacitors.
