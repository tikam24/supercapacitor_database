In this report, the effect of annealing temperature on the structure and supercapacitive properties of copper tungstate was investigated. For this purpose, the precursor was prepared by the ultrasonic bath method and using Cu (CH3COO)2·H2O and Na2WO4 2H2O reactants. This precursor was calcined for 1 h to obtain the nanoparticles of CuWO4 and CuWO4·2H2O at 500 and 200 °C, respectively. Then, the structural parameters affecting the supercapacitive properties affected by the annealing temperature of the two prepared samples, such as morphology, specific surface area, etc., as well as the supercapacitive properties of the two samples were analyzed and compared. The results showed the highest specific capacitance of 360 Fg−1 at a current density of 1 Ag−1 for the CuWO4 electrode.
