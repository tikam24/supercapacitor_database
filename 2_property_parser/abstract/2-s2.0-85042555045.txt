This paper essentially analyses graphene/Mo9Se11 nanocomposites routes to supercapacitor applications which is one of the prominent devices for high power storage. Graphene and Mo9Se11 are coupled together by attrition followed by ultrasonification. The reduction of graphene oxide to graphene as well as the coupling of graphene with Mo9Se11 and the formation of their nanocomposites is confirmed through X-ray diffraction pattern, FTIR spectra and Raman spectra analysis of these materials. The surface morphology of the entire samples is imaged through SEM while their electrochemical performances are analysed by cyclic voltametry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The nanocomposite, having three parts of Mo9Se11 and one part of graphene, displayed the higher areal capacitance of 438 mF at a scan rate of 5 mV sâˆ’1. Finally, the solution resistance and charge transfer resistance are obtained from EIS measurements and reported.
