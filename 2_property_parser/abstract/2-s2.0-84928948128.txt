The development of porous yet densely packed nanomaterials with high ion-accessible surface area and long cycling life is critical to the realization of high-density electrochemical capacitive energy storage. In this paper, we report a facile hydrothermal method to fabricate Co3O4/CeO2 hybrid nanowire arrays (NWAs). Supercapacitors based on the as-prepared mesoporous Co3O4/CeO2 hybrid NWAs exhibit excellent pseudocapacitive performance with a capacitance of 4.98 F cm-2 at 10 mA cm-2 (1037.5 F g-1 at 2.08 A g-1) and only a small capacitance loss of 5.6% after 5000 charge/discharge cycles. The remarkable pseudocapacitance and superior stability suggest that mesoporous Co3O4/CeO2 hybrid NWAs are promising candidates for supercapacitor applications.
