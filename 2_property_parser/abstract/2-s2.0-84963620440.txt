Considerable progress has been achieved in developing supercapacitor materials with desirable charge storage properties; however, uniting energy density (ES) and power density (PS) in a single device is an elusive issue. We have explored diverse range of materials and structures such as (i) activated carbon from bio-resources, (ii) ceramic electrochemical materials as nanoparticles, nanowires, and nanoribbons, and (iii) layered materials to overcome this issue. An ES of ~52.6 Wh kg-1 at PS of ~15000 W kg-1 is delivered using nanowire nanocomposites based device which appear to be the best ever achieved in supercapacitor charge storage mode employing aqueous alkaline electrolytes.
