In electrochemical synthesis of manganese oxide, current density has a substantial influence on redox behavior, but less effect on the film morphology. Here we report that a small amount (even not detectable by electron microscopy) of carbon nanotubes can significantly affect the film growth pathway. Although, the galvanostatic syntheses of manganese oxide were similar in the absence and presence of carbon nanotubes, the morphological structures are totally different. This difference is also valid for electrochemical behavior in favor of the formation of a single redox couple. The influence of carbon nanotubes on potentiodynamic electrodeposition of manganese oxide was also similar, leading to the appearance of a strong redox couple without any noticeable capacitive behavior. It should be emphasized that this influence is only valid for the experimental condition under consideration (i.e., low current densities), and electrodeposition at higher current densities in the presence of carbon nanotubes may strengthen the capacitive behavior in favor of supercapacitors (as discussed in the second part). The interesting point is that this tiny additive can predominantly control the electrochemical properties of the system under consideration: supercapacitor or battery.
