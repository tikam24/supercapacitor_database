The aqueous zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitor (ZHSC) is a prospective energy storage device for next-generation wearable electronics due to its high safety, low cost, and high energy density. However, the preparation of gel electrolytes reported in the literature is complex and time-consuming, which limits their application in practice. Herein, we developed a robust and stretchable eutectogel electrolyte through a one-step gelation process in situ without introducing additional initiators and cross-linkers. The eutectogel electrolyte consists of ternary deep eutectic solvent (DES) based on Zn(ClO4)2, AM(acrylamide), and H2O, among which ClO4-triggers the free-radical polymerization of AM monomer and Zn2+cross-links the polymer chains. The prepared Zn-PAM-1 gel exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 51.7 mS cm-1. Due to the inhibition of the free water activity in DES, the voltage window of the constructed flexible ZHSC was extended to 0-2.2 V. Moreover, the ZHSC in situ formed manifests a maximum energy density of 117.5 W h kg-1at a power density of 833.8 W kg-1and shows admirable cycling stability, retaining 87.6% of its capacitance after 4000 cycles. In addition, the supercapacitor possesses remarkable temperature stability within a range of -20 to 70 °C. Furthermore, the assembled flexible device illustrates favorable bendability from 0° to 180° without scarifying capacitance, displaying great promise as flexible wearable electronic devices. In summary, such a feasible approach provides further insight into the exploration of innovative eutectogel electrolyte systems for assembling quasi-solid-state pliable high energy storing devices.
