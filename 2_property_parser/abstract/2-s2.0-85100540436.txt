This paper proposes an energy storage system (ESS) for recycling the regenerative braking energy in the high-speed railway. In this case, a supercapacitor-based storage system is integrated at the DC bus of the back to back converter that is connected to the two power phases of the traction power system (TPS). In order to ensure the suitability of the ESS in the TPS, the operation modes are classified by considering the load conditions of the TPS and the state-of-charge limit of the supercapacitor. Then, a master-slave control strategy with a central controller is proposed. In which, the central controller realizes the flexible management for all operation modes, by means of the state machine logic. Meanwhile, the master-slave control serves for coordinating the operation of the multiple converters according to the commands from the central controller. Finally, the capabilities of the proposed ESS are validated by sufficient experiments under different operation modes and the simulation based on the field data.
