Herein, we systematically demonstrate the synergistic behavior of GNP/CNT composite as an electrode material. Uniform dispersion of CNTs effectively inhibits the restacking of GNP sheets, resulting in enhanced specific surface area, porosity, and conductivity. Moreover, CNT intercalation provides a porous and interconnected network for electrolyte ion transportation. As a result, GNP composite having 1.0 wt% multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNTs) shows specific capacitance up to 143 Fg−1 at 5 mVs−1, an improvement of 150% compared to pristine GNPs. The improved electrochemical performance implies that the proposed composite electrode is a promising candidate for supercapacitor application.
