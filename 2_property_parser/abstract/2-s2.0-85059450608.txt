A flexible NiCo 2 O 4 @Carbon/Carbon nanofiber (NiCo 2 O 4 @C/CNFs) composite was fabricated by the combined electrospray/electrospinning technique. The NiCo 2 O 4 clusters were coated with an amorphous carbon layer to form NiCo 2 O 4 @C core-shell structure and homogeneously trapped in the CNFs net. The NiCo 2 O 4 @C/CNFs electrodes exhibited a high specific capacitance (1586 Fg −1 at 1 Ag −1 ), good rate performance (51% retention even at 32 Ag −1 ), and superior cycling life (92.5% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 10 Ag −1 ). The combined electrospray/electrospinning technique is a promising method to produce flexible electrodes with enhanced performance.
