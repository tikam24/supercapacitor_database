The development of supramolecular structures (conducting hydrogels) obtained from the charge–charge interaction of sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles and oppositely charged polypyrrole chains represents an important step to obtain self-supported and flexible electrodes for supercapacitors. Herein, the energy density of polypyrrole hydrogel-based supercapacitors is enhanced by the incorporation of graphene nanoplatelets that introduced the electrical double capacitance contribution to the overall response. The electrochemical performance of synthesized electrodes was optimized from the relative variation in the concentration of supramolecular arrangements (micelles of sodium dodecyl sulfate), pyrrole, and graphene nanoplatelets. As result, higher capacitive retention is observed for modified electrodes (with the incorporation of graphene) – in order of 90% after 1000 cycles of use, preserving the high conductivity and intrinsic mechanical properties (flexibility and stretchability) reaching an areal capacitance of 210.7 mFcm−2.
