Hollow multishelled structures(HoMSs) Co3O4 with specially appointed shell number(double-, triple- and quadruple-) were accurately prepared by a sequential templating approach. Due to the superiorities of inimitable porous multishelled structure, triple-HoMSs Co3O4 achieved the best performance among all the samples with a specific capacitance of 1028.9 F/g at 10 mV/s and 688.2 F/g at 0.5 A/g, respectively. Furthermore, the electrode delivered a high rate performance(89.8% retention at 10 A/g) and excellent cycle stability(6.8% loss over 2000 cycles), showing a great promise for practical application in the future.
