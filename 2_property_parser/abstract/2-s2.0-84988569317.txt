The honeycomb-like porous Co3O4grown on three dimensional graphene networks/nickel foam (3DGN/NF) has been successfully prepared by a facile solution growth process with subsequent annealing treatment, in which the Co-based metal organic framework (ZIF-67) act as the precursor of the metal oxide. The Co3O4/three-dimensional graphene networks/Ni foam (Co3O4/3DGN/NF) hybrid as the electrode for supercapacitor can deliver high specific capacitance (321 F g−1at 1 A g−1) and excellent long-cycling stability (88% of the maximum capacitance after 2000 charge-discharge cycles). Furthermore, the Co3O4/3DGN/NF hybrid exhibits the maximum energy density of 7.5 W h kg−1with the power density of 794 W kg−1and remain 4.1 W h kg−1with the power density of 15 kW kg−1in the two-electrode system. The enhanced electrochemical properties can be attributed to the unique nanostructure of Co3O4with admirable pseudocapacitance performance and the intimate integration of graphene with the Co3O4and the Ni foam matrix, which not only enhances the electron conductivity for fast electron and ion transport but also provides high specific surface area and excellent structural stability.
