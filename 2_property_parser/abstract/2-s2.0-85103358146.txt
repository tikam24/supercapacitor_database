The effective implementation of energy storage systems within flexible structures has recently become of particular interest. Here, the fabrication of inexpensive flexible electrodes via a number of straightforward methods formed the motivation for this research. Thin film-based Fe-Cu alloys were cathodically electrodeposited on a graphite substrate. As ionic liquids consist purely of ions (not solvent), they have recently been used in some electrochemical applications. In this study, therefore, Fe-Cu alloy coatings were prepared from an ethaline ionic liquid containing iron and copper salts. The electrochemical behaviour of Fe-Cu alloy films was determined by scanning between − 1.0 V and − 0.3 V in 1 M KOH at various scan rates ranging from 5 mV s−1 to 200 mV s−1. These films were characterised in terms of their structural and morphological properties by means of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and x-ray diffraction (XRD). Formation of iron and copper alloy was differentiated depending on applied potential. The supercapacitive ability of Fe-Cu-coated film observed in 1 M KOH electrolyte demonstrated a specific capacitance of 304 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1. The reaction between the alloy and the electrolyte was mainly controlled by a surface-controlled reaction. An asymmetric supercapacitor was constructed with an Fe-Cu-coated graphite negative electrode and a non-woven graphite positive electrode. Four asymmetric supercapacitors were connected in series and used to light up a blue light-emitting diode. This study shows that ethaline ionic liquid is a promising medium for the preparation of alloy-based electrodes in energy storage applications.
