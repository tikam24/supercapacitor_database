In this work, ZnO is prepared using glycine based auto-combustion synthesis with advantages of nanoparticles with mesoporosity. x-ray diffraction and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy were used to investigate the structural and bond formation of ZnO. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method was employed to calculate the surface area of ZnO nanoparticles. The surface area was determined to be 6.098 m2 g-1 having pore width lying of 121.389 Ã…. Chemical bonding of ZnO nanoparticles was studied using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and results revealed successful formation of Zn-O bond. The morphology was investigated using scanning electron microscopy and the particles were noticed in 100-500 nm with cylindrical, spherical, and random shaped sharp-edged particles. The electrochemical properties of ZnO were investigated as anode for supercapacitor. ZnO electrode exhibits capacitance of 209.8 F g-1, 186.2 F g-1, 170.6 F g-1, and 167 F g-1 at current densities of 0.25 A g-1, 0.5 A g-1, 1 A g-1, and 2 A g-1, respectively.
