Electrode materials with specific morphologies and microstructures can help to speed up the charge transfer to a certain extent and provide more electrochemically active sites in electrochemical reactions. In this work, NiFe2O4/Fe3O4 nanotube arrays were synthesized on the stainless steel mesh through an ion-exchange reaction involving Zn(OH)2 nanorods under the hydrothermal condition. By analyzing the electrochemical performances of the supercapacitor electrodes, the optimal electrode could be obtained by the hydrothermal process at 160 Â°C. It has a specific capacity of 258.8 F g-1 at a current density of 1.25 A g-1 as a negative electrode. This work provides a new strategy to prepare nickel-iron oxide as negative electrode materials in supercapacitor applications.
