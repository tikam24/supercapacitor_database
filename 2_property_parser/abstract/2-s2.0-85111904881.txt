This study aims at demonstrating that wastes from anaerobic biodigester plants can be effectively valorized as functional materials to be implemented in technologies that enable efficient energy management and water treatment, therefore simultaneously addressing the Water-Energy-Waste Nexus challenges. Lignin, the main solid residue of the biodigester plant, has been valorized into activated biochar with a mild activation agent, like KHCO3, to produce electrode of supercapacitors and microbial fuel cells. In addition, the same sludge that is the liquid effluent of the biodigester plant has been exploited as inoculum and electrolyte for the MFC. The lignin-derived carbons obtained at lignin/KHCO3 mass ratios of 1:0.5 (LAC-0.5) and 1:2 (LAC-2) comprised of mesopores and micropores displaying BETs of 1558 m2g−1 and 1879 m2g−1, respectively. LAC-2 carbon exhibited a superior specific capacitance of 114 F g−1 in 2.5 M KNO3 with respect to LAC-0.5. A supercapacitor with LAC-2 electrodes was built displaying specific energy specific power up to 10 Wh kg−1 and 6.9 kW kg−1, respectively. Durability tests showed that the device was able to maintain a capacitance retention of 84.5% after 15,000 charge-discharge cycles. The lignin-derived carbons were also studied as electrocatalysts for ORR in a neutral medium. The LAC-2 showed higher ORR electrocatalytic activity than LAC-0.5. The interconnected porous network and the high surface area made the lignin-derived porous carbons suitable electrode materials for dual applications. The feasibility of the use of LAC 2 carbon incorporated in an air breathing cathode for MFC applications is also reported.
