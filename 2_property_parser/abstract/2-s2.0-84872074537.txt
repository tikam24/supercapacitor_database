Graphene has wide potential applications in energy-related systems, mainly because of its unique atom-thick two-dimensional structure, high electrical or thermal conductivity, optical transparency, great mechanical strength, inherent flexibility, and huge specific surface area. For this purpose, graphene materials are frequently blended with polymers to form composites, especially when fabricating flexible devices. Graphene/polymer composites have been explored as electrodes of supercapacitors or lithium ion batteries, counter electrodes of dye-sensitized solar cells, transparent conducting electrodes and active layers of organic solar cells, catalytic electrodes, and polymer electrolyte membranes of fuel cells. In this review, we summarize the recent advances on the synthesis and applications of graphene/polymer composites for energy applications. The challenges and prospects in this field have also been discussed. Copyright Â© 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
