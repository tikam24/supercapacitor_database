In this paper, two control strategies for two parallel hybrid fuel cell/supercapacitors power source are described. First, different hybrid architectures using fuel cells for automotive applications are analyzed. Two parallel hybrid configurations are more precisely detailed and their control strategies are explained. Then, experimental validations using a Nexa Ballard PEM-FC as main source and BOOSTCAP Maxwell supercapacitors as auxiliary source are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategies.
