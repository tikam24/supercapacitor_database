Mesoporous MnO2 for supercapacitors was prepared by using Na2S2O3 as the reducing agents and KMnO4 as the oxidant. The samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM), N2 adsorption-desorption and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge were used to characterize the electrochemical performance. The results showed that the as prepared nanomaterial was amorphous MnO2 with a diameter of 20-40nm. The specific surface area and mean pore diameter was 182.6m2/g and 6.2nm, respectively. In an electrolyte of 1mol/L (NH4)2SO4, the MnO2 had typical capacitive characterization and high power in the potential region of -0.4-0.5V(vs SCE). At a current density of 10mA/cm2, a specific capacitance of 397F/g was achieved. The Mesoporous MnO2 exhibited high cycling efficiency.
