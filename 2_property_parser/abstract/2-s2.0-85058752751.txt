High performance of an electrode relies largely on scrupulous design of nanoarchitectures and smart hybridization of bespoke active materials. Here, a 3D heterostructured core-shell architecture was fabricated as a supercapacitor electrode, in which Co 3 O 4 nanowire cores were grown on nickel foam prior to the in situ deposition of layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheet shells. Owing to the unique configuration and hybridization, the as-fabricated Co 3 O 4 @LDH core-shell electrode exhibited high capacities of 818.6 C g −1 at 2 A g −1 and 479.3 C g −1 at 40 A g −1 (3.2 C cm −2 at 7.8 mA cm −2 and 1.87 C cm −2 at 156 mA cm −2 ), which were much higher than those of the individual components, namely, Co 3 O 4 and LDH. A hybrid supercapacitor with Co 3 O 4 @LDH as the positive electrode and graphene nanosheets as the negative electrode yielded an energy density of 53.2 W h kg −1 and a power density of 16.4 kW kg −1 , which outperformed devices reported in the literature; the device also exhibited long-term cycling stability and retained 71% of its initial capacity even after 10 000 cycles at 6 A g −1 . The rational design of the core-shell architecture may lead to the development of new strategies for fabricating promising electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage.
