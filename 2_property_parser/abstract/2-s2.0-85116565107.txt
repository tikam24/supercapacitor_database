Uniform perovskite type SmFeO3 and SmCoO3 nanofibers have been prepared by a simple electrospinning approach and calcination process. The obtained samples had orthorhombic structure and strong absorbance behaviors in UV-vis regions. The diameters of SmFeO3 and SmCoO3 nanofibers were 220 and 300 nm, respectively. The electrochemical and magnetic properties of SmFeO3 and SmCoO3 were investigated. SmFeO3 and SmCoO3 electrodes exhibited typical pseudocapacitive behaviors owing to the redox reactions of Fe3+/Fe2+ and Co3+/Co2+. At 0.5 A g-1, the specific capacitances of SmFeO3 and SmCoO3 nanofibers were 90.8 and 126.6 F g-1, respectively. The high-performance nanostructured SmFeO3 and SmCoO3 have significantly potential application in supercapacitors. SmFeO3 nanofibers exhibited weak ferromagnetic behavior. SmCoO3 nanofibers presented paramagnetism at high temperature and ferromagnetism at 5 K.
