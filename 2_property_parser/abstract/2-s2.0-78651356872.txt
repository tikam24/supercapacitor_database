In present investigation MnO 2 thin films have been prepared by potentiodynamic (PD), potentiostatic (PS) and galvanostatic (GS) modes of electrodeposition. The effects of different modes on structural, surface morphological and supercapacitive properties of MnO 2 thin films have been investigated. Formation of amorphous phase of MnO 2 by all three modes is confirmed from X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. Significant change in the surface morphologies of MnO 2 thin films due to different modes has been observed. The supercapacitive properties of MnO 2 thin films have been studied in 1 M Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte. The maximum supercapacitance obtained for potentiodynamic, potentiostatic and galvanostatic modes is 237, 196 and 184 F g -1 , respectively. Additionally charge-discharge and impedance of MnO 2 thin films have been investigated. Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
