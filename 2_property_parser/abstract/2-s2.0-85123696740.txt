This paper proposes an energy management strategy for an electrical hybrid vehicle which is composed of a Proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell and a supercapacitor storage device. In this paper, the mathematical model for the proposed driving chain, comprising the PEM Fuel Cell, boost converter, inverter and vehicular structure, was modeled in MATLAB/Simulink. The proposed algorithm is evaluated for the Highway Fuel Economy Test (HWFET) driving cycle. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed energy management strategy in reduction of the hydrogen consumption
