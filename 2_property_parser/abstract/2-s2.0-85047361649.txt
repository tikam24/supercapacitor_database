In this work, polyaniline/mesocarbon microbeads (PANI/MCMB) composite was prepared by situ chemical polymerization in room tempetarure, using manganese dioxide or ammonium persulfate as oxidizing agents, respectively. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) were carried out to characterize the structure and morphology of PANI/MCMB composite. Symmetric redox supercapacitor was assembled with PANI/MCMB composite as active electrode material and 1.0 mol/L H2SO4 aqueous solution as electrolyte. The electrochemical characteristics of these supercapacitors were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests. These results show that single specific capacitance of MPANI/MCMB composite electrode prepared by manganese dioxides is 336.4 F/g in current density for 0.1 A/g, which is higher than NPANI/MCMB electrode prepared by ammonium persulfate. After 1 000 charge/discharge cycles, the capacity retention of MPANI/MCMB composite is 92.3%, which is better than NPANI-MCMB electrode materials.
