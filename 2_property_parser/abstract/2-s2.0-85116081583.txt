The utility of multivalent metal ions with aqueous electrolyte increases the electrochemical performances of supercapacitors. These compounds are non- toxic, low cost and provide accessible ionic potential towards the application's scenario. Herein, we report a facile and effective combination of magnesium and iron layered double hydroxides (L-MFH) synthesized by industrially applicable electrodeposition technique. As of now, the bulky compositions between the metals, poor ionic conductivity and deteriorated nanostructure limits the innovation in supercapacitors. Interestingly, L-MFH dendritic structure delivers high specific capacity, 610 Cg−1 at 10 mV/s in 1 M NaOH electrolyte. The derived material retains 80% specific capacity over 3000 cycles, further the asymmetric device through the combination of L-MFH//ACC (activated carbon cloth) delivered a high energy and power densities of 39.86 Whkg−1 and 1206.03 Wkg−1, respectively. Our prescribed methodology encourages the reliability of electrode preparations, which promotes high performances of many hybrid devices.
