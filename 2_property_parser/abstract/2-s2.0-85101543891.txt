Transition metal vanadates (MxVyOz, M = Co, Zn, Ni, Cu, Fe), also called binary metal oxides, are one of the members of the mixed metal oxide (AxByOz) family. This kind of material has become a subject of great interest in being active electrode materials in the area of pseudo-supercapacitors these years due to their multiple oxidation states, layered structure, and the synergistic effect between transition metal and vanadium. Furthermore, nanostructured transition metal vanadates can provide a high specific surface area and sufficient electroactive sites and shorten the ion diffusion pathway. With these benefits, electrochemical performance in pseudo-supercapacitors can be significantly improved. In this review, the recent progress of various nanostructures of transition metal vanadates was focused on. The detailed literatures mainly included three typical types, namely cobalt vanadates, zinc vanadates, and nickel vanadates. Moreover, some key concerns on these materials were illustrated, including fabrication approaches, morphology structures, and electrochemical performance. In addition, two typical designed strategies to obtain various transition metal vanadates with good specific capacitance and high cyclic performance were summarized. One was the design and preparation of various nanostructures with different dimensions from 0 dimension (0D) to 3 dimension (3D). The other was the hybridization of metal vanadates with carbonaceous material, metal oxide, and some other chemical components. At last, possible thoughts of promoting future breakthroughs in this field were provided.
