Owing to their graphene-like structure and available oxidation valence states, transition metal sulfides are promising candidates for supercapacitors. Herein, we report the application of MoS3 as a new negative electrode for supercapacitors. MoS3 was fabricated by the facile thermal decomposition of a (NH4)2MoS4 precursor. For comparison, samples of MoS3&MoS2 and MoS2 were also synthesized by using the same method. Moreover, this is the first report of the application of MoS3 as a negative electrode for supercapacitors. MoS3 displayed a high specific capacitance of 455.6 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. The capacitance retention of the MoS3 electrode was 92 % after 1500 cycles, and even 71 % after 5000 cycles. In addition, an asymmetric supercapacitor assembly of MoS3 as the negative electrode demonstrated a high energy density at a high potential of 2.0 V in aqueous electrolyte. These notable results show that MoS3 has significant potential in energy-storage devices.
