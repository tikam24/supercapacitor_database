Carbon nanotubes (CNT) are a material with unique properties (mechanical, electrical, electrochemical, etc) allied with low density and high specific area. The present paper studied the electrochemical properties of carbon nanotubes growth by Chemical Vapor Depostion (CVD) technique. The samples were characterized by SEM, Raman Spectroscopy and the double layer capacitance of the powders was evaluated in a Teflon capacitor system with a Ag/AgCl (3M) as reference electrode. The catalyst remotion is provided in Hydrochloric acid washing and the wet oxidative treatments promotes the CNT oxidation and increase the pseudocapacitive response.
