An energy storage device-a coaxial single fibre supercapacitor-was developed using a dip coating method and characterised using electrochemical methods. The specific capacitance per unit area and length were calculated to be 3.18 mF cm-2 and 0.1 mF cm-1, respectively, for a 2.6 cm supercapacitor. A 70 cm long fibre supercapacitor was then woven into a piece of fabric. Following characterisation using cyclic voltammetry, we found that this device had the same capacitance as its original value before integration into the fabric. Â© 2013 the Owner Societies.
