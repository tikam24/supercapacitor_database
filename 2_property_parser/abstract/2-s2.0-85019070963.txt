Researchers have introduced an approach to synthesize free standing, structurally stable, binder and additive free high surface area rGO-MWCNT/polyaniline (PANI) composite electrode via in situ polymerization of PANI on MWCNT grown rGO coated Ni Foam. Their aim is to take the advantage of individual material to obtain better capacitive performance. Larger GO flakes are arranged between the pores of the Ni foam and increases effective surface area while smaller flakes are coated over Ni foam. rGO coating and CNT growth serves the basic purpose of carbon-based materials in supercapacitor and provides bonus functionality.
