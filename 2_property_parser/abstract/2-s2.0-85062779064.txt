The C@Ni0.9Cu0.1-S supercapacitor electrode material with good electrochemical performance was successfully prepared by a simple hydrothermal method. C@Ni0.9Cu0.1-S obtained by adding glucose has better electrochemical performance than single Ni0.9Cu0.1-S. In this work, the electrochemical properties of C@Ni0.9Cu0.1-S electrode materials and asymmetric supercapacitors were studied in detail. This single-electrode specific capacity in the 6 M KOH solution reaches 1986 F g–1 and the potential window is 0 to 0.49 V. In order to increase the energy density and potential window of the supercapacitor, C@Ni0.9Cu0.1-S is used as a positive electrode, and AC is used as a negative electrode to assemble asymmetric supercapacitors. The results show that the working voltage of C@Ni0.9Cu0.1-S∥ AC asymmetric supercapacitor increases to 1.6 V, and the specific capacitance and energy density can reach 184.4 F g–1 and 65.6 Wh kg–1, respectively, and has excellent cycling stability. These excellent electrochemical properties indicate that C@Ni0.9Cu0.1-S is a promising supercapacitor electrode material.
