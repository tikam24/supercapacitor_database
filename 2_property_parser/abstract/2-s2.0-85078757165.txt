In recent years, supercapacitors have attracted much attention due to their excellent charge–discharge performance, long-term cycle lifetimes, and high specific power. Transition metal oxides are promising candidates for environmentally friendly, low-cost, and high-powered energy storage materials. In addition, the use of one-dimensional nanostructures can markedly enhance the characteristic properties of the transition metal oxides. In this work, ZnCo2O4/C composite nanofibers were successfully fabricated by using a simple electrospinning method. The nanofibers have an average diameter of 300–500 nm and consist of many ZnCo2O4 and carbon nanoparticles. A supercapacitor fabricated using the ZnCo2O4/C nanofibers was found to exhibit a high specific capacitance of 90.0 F/g at a current density of 8.0 A/g and good rate capability under current densities in the range 0.5–8.0 A/g at a voltage of 0.4 V. It also has superior working stability with a capacitance retention of 125% after 1000 cycles in air.
