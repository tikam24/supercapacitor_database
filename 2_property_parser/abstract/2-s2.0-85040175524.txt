Nitrogen-enriched (N-enriched) carbon nanofiber aerogels (NCNAs) with an ultrafine nanofiber network structure were designed and prepared by using chitin nanofiber aerogels as the precursor. Because of the uniform nanofibrous architecture and nitrogen-rich composition of chitin nanofiber aerogels, the NCNAs exhibited large specific surface area (490-1597 m2 g-1) and a high nitrogen content (2.07-7.65%). As a consequence, supercapacitor electrodes prepared from NCNA-900 showed specific capacitances as high as 221 F g-1 at the current density of 1.0 A g-1 and good capacitance retention of 92% over 8000 cycles in a 6.0 mol L-1 KOH electrolyte without further activation. Moreover, the NCNA-900 could also be applied as an effective adsorbent for dye adsorption, such as Congo red (496 mg g-1) and Rhodanine B (489 mg g-1). In view of an excellent electrochemical performance and high adsorption capacities for dyes as well as cost-effective and eco-friendly approaches, NCNAs derived from marine chitin show great potential for application in energy storage and environmental remediation.
