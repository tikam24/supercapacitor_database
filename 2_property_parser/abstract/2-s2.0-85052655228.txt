Flexible conductive polymer hydrogels are unique material that synergize the features of conductive polymers and hydrogels. They are excellent candidates for the flexible supercapacitor electrodes. In this paper, flexible conductive polymer hydrogels were prepared with poly(vinyl alcohol) as soft skeleton through cyclic freezing-thawing method. Firstly, phytic acid-doped polyaniline with crosslinked network was prepared using phytic acid as the dopant and crosslinking agents. Hydrogels with interpenetrating binary network nanostructure were then formed by freezing-thawing method. The interpenetrating binary network structure endowed the hydrogel reliable mechanical properties with decent flexibility and compressive strength of 3.64 MPa. More importantly, this unique structure enable them to maintain highly specific capacitance (314 F/g at the current density of 0.5 A/g).
