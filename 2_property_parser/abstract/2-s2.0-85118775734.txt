The proliferation of Converter-Interfaced Renewable Energy Sources (CIRES), which are inertia-less, and the gradual decommissioning of synchronous generation have posed several challenges to the electric power system. This has motivated a complete a shift in the CIRES design and its corresponding control philosophy. Integrating Energy Storage Systems (ESS) within CIRES enables the implementation of different operating modes allowing them to provide ancillary services (AS) in a similar way to the synchronous generation. In order to tackle with those short-term response AS, such as virtual inertia, fast ESS (FESS) solutions with high power-to-energy ratio, particularly flywheels and supercapacitors, are preferred. In spite of several control algorithms have been proposed to provide such fast AS, very little research effort has been paid on the proper FESS energy recovery after the AS provision. This task is particularly challenging, since supercapacitors must be operated at a certain state of charge to guarantee that the required AS can be provided within its operational limits. This paper aims to fill this gap by proposing a new energy recovery control scheme for supercapacitors after the provision of short-term AS, such as virtual inertia. The proposed control is validated via simulations which clearly highlights its adequate performance.
