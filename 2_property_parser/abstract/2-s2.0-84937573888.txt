A solid-state flexible supercapacitor (SC) based on organic-inorganic composite structure was fabricated through an ''in situ growth for conductive wrapping'' and an electrode material of polypyrrole (PPy)-MnO2 nanoflakes-carbon fiber (CF) hybrid structure was obtained. The conductive organic material of PPy greatly improved the electrochemical performance of the device. With a high specific capacitance of 69.3 F cm23 at a discharge current density of 0.1 A cm23 and an energy density of 6.1631023 Whcm23 at a power density of 0.04 W cm23, the device can drive a commercial liquid crystal display (LCD) after being charged. The organic-inorganic composite active materials have enormous potential in energy management and the ''in situ growth for conductive wrapping'' method might be generalized to open up new strategies for designing next-generation energy storage devices.
