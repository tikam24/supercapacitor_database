Due to their high power density, long cycle stability, and quick charge/discharge rates, supercapacitors are gaining popularity in the field of energy storage devices. These distinct features have “enabled supercapacitors to create their own space in the energy storage device realm”. This review addresses contemporary ways to increase not just the power density, rate capability, cycle stability, and other properties of supercapacitors, but also their energy density utilising hybrid topologies. Because electrodes are the most significant component of a supercapacitor cell and the last decade mainly focused on the material realm, this paper focuses on the design of hybrid supercapacitor electrodes with high specific capacitance, as well as the explication of the mechanisms involved. We have also given an insight about the merits and demerits of various electrode materials that have been employed till date. The new trends and improvement in supercapacitor development are also summarized.
