β-Ni(OH)2 nanoplates are synthesized by a hydrothermal process with sodium hydroxide as precipitator and nickel nitrate as nickel source. The effects are investigated with different reactant concentrations, reaction time, precipitators, pH values, and total concentrations. Phase structure and morphology of the samples are characterized by XRD and FESEM respectively. Supercapacitor performances are investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests. © 2012 by ESG.
