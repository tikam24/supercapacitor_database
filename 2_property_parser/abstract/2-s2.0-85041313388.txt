Graphene is synthesized by electrochemical exfoliation of graphite in sulfuric acid electrolyte. The characterization of the synthesized graphene is done by Raman, SEM, TEM and UV-Vis spectroscopy techniques. Graphene based paper electrodes are prepared by brush coating method on A4 size paper. The graphene based electrodes are used for making flexible supercapacitors and its performance was analyzed using cyclovoltammetry(CV) and galvanostatic charge discharge (CD) curves. Seven different gel electrolytes PVA/KCL, PVA/H2SO4, PVA/LiCl, PVA/KOH, PVA/NaOH, PVA/NaNO2 and PVA/KNO3 are explored for making flexible supercapacitors. It is observed that graphene based flexible supercapacitor exhibited maximum specific capacitance of 250 Î¼F/cm2 with PVA/NaNO2 gel electrolyte which is greater than acidic electrolyte PVA/H2SO4.
