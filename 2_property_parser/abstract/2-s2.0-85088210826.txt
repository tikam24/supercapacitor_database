Sugarcane leaves (SLs) are a bio-waste from sugar production industry. To explore the value-added SLs, the SLs were used raw materials of activated carbons (ACs) by steam activation and their electrochemial properties were investigated for supercapacitor applications. The synthesis of ACs from the SLs consisted of two steps; carbonization at 500ºC and steam activation. The synthesis condition was optimized by varying activation temperature (800 and 850ºC) The porous structures were thoroughly formed on the surface after steam activation and the surface areas were reached to 630 and 639 m2 g-1 at the activation temperature of 800 and 850ºC, respectively. The SLs-derived ACs activated at 800ºC assembled in coin cell using organic electrolyte showed the highest specific capacitance of approximately 16 F g-1 with a capacitance retention of 62% when the current density increased to 1.5 A g-1. Even though there is a room to improve the electrochemical properties such as optimization of porosity and removal of inorganic component, the SLs show a potential use as raw materials of ACs for supercapacitor applications.
