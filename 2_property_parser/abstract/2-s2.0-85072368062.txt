The power requirements of future vehicle electrical distribution systems will increase considerably. Consequently, electrical energy has a major impact on the overall vehicle energy balance, so its generation and storage must be as efficient as possible. The presented concept is based on a voltage-controlled alternator in combination with super capacitors and a corresponding energy management system. The focus is energy efficiency, recuperation, and the use of standard components. A specific hardware in the loop based test set-up was built that allows the control and monitoring of the mechanical and electrical energy flows. Besides the theoretical description, the paper presents first experimental data and results followed by a discussion of the next steps and future potentials. Copyright Â© 2009 SAE International.
