A simple continuous hydrothermal method was used to synthesize a NiFe2O4@Ni-Mn LDH/NF composite. The layered structure provides a large void to transfer the electron effectively, and the composite materials exhibit remarkable electrochemical performance including excellent specific capacitance (1265 F g-1 at 1 A g-1) and remarkable cycling stability (the specific capacitance remains at 80.9% after 5000 cycles). In addition, the asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits a high energy density of 96.2 W h kg-1 at a power density of 700 W kg-1, and there is an extraordinarily good cycling stability with a capacity retention rate of 92.5% after 4000 cycles. The outcomes indicate that the NiFe2O4@Ni-Mn LDH/NF composite electrode has potential application as a high-performance supercapacitor. This journal is
