Architectural design of nitrogenous polymer-based carbons represents a facile and efficient strategy to improve performance because of their morphological diversity, tailorability, and N-containing structure. In this research, 0D and 1D forms of polypyrrole-derived porous carbons (A-PCS and A-PCT, respectively) are first integrated into nitrogen-doped hierarchically porous A-PCS/PCT hybrids by applying an easy multistep method. This integration, along with chemical activation, prevents serious agglomeration of carbon particles or tubes and creates a connected porous network structure, leading to improved textural properties (high surface area of 1684 m2 g−1, high pore volume of 1.57 cm3 g−1, and hierarchical porosity). Thus, A-PCS/PCT hybrids in a three-electrode setup reach high specific capacitances of 224 and 206 F g−1 at 1 and 20 A g−1, respectively, with high rate capability (92 % capacitance retention). A symmetrical supercapacitor with A-PCS/PCT electrodes presents the highest power and energy densities of 12.6 kW kg−1 and 8.58 Wh kg−1, respectively, and exceptional cycling life and stability with 92.4 % retention for up to 20 000 cycles. This study on conductive polymer-based hybrid materials may guide the design of architectures with new structures for applications in energy storage and conversion technologies.
