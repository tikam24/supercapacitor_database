This paper describes a two quadrant bidirectional soft switching converter for ultra capacitor interface circuits. The total efficiency of the energy storage system in terms of size and cost can be increased by a combination of batteries and ultra capacitors. The required system energy is provided by a battery, while an ultra capacitor is used at high load power pulses. The ultra capacitor voltage changes during charge and discharge modes, therefore an interface circuit is required between the ultra capacitor and the battery. This interface circuit must have good efficiency while providing bidirectional power conversion to capture energy from regenerative braking, downhill driving and the protecting ultra capacitor from immediate discharge. In this paper a fully soft switched two quadrant bidirectional soft switching converter for ultra capacitor interface circuits is introduced and the elements of the converter are reduced considerably. In this paper, zero voltage transient (ZVT) and zero current transient (ZCT) techniques are applied to increase efficiency. The proposed converter acts as a ZCT Buck to charge the ultra capacitor. On the other hand, it acts as a ZVT Boost to discharge the ultra capacitor. A laboratory prototype converter is designed and realized for hybrid vehicle applications. The experimental results presented confirm the theoretical and simulation results.
