Co 3O 4@graphene nanocomposite (Co 3O 4@GE) was prepared by a facile hydrothermal route. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscope proved Co 3O 4 nanoparticles with an average size of 5.8 nm were homogeneously dispersed on sonication-exfoliated graphene sheets. X-ray photoelectron spectra indicated a low oxidation degree of graphene in Co 3O 4@GE. Small amount of functional groups on graphene sheets not only worked as anchor sites for Co 3O 4 nanoparticles, but also kept the carbon framework with lower defect density. Electrochemical experiments on Co 3O 4@GE showed high specific capacitance of 415 F/g at a large current density of 3 A/g in 6 M KOH electrolyte, which is valuable for practical application in supercapacitors.
