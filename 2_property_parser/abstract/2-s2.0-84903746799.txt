Tungsten oxide quantum dots (QDs) with an average size down to 1.6 nm are developed, serving as a new class of promising electrode materials, which yield efficient and fast electron/ion transport in the charge/discharge process. With a visually impressive display, the QDs present coloration/bleaching times within 1 s, which is much superior to inorganic analogues and even competitive to organic-related materials.
