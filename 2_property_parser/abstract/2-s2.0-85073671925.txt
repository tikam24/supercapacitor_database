A high-performance graphene aerogel/cerium oxide nanoparticle composite was prepared by a simple hydrothermal technique using para phenylenediamine as a structure-modifying agent. The morphological and structural features of the composite were determined by field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Also, the specific surface area is obtained by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The supercapacitive function of all composites is assayed by a variety of electrochemical procedures, essentially cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Also, continuous cyclic voltammetry is done to estimate the stability of the introduced supercapacitor, and the maximum specific capacitance was obtained for the modified graphene aerogel/cerium oxide nanoparticle nanocomposite. The specific capacitance amounts 365 F g−1 and 376.2 F g−1 were calculated by cyclic voltammetry at ν = 5 mV/s and by charge/discharge curves at the current density of 0.5 A g−1, respectively. The composite exhibits high cycling stability (only 8.6% reduction of its specific capacitance after recording 4000 cycles in cyclic voltammetry measurements). According to the results, this kind of composite is a promising candidate to improve energy density and supercapacitor performance.
