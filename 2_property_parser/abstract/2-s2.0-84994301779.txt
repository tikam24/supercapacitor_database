In this paper, application of battery and supercapacitor units based hybrid energy storage system (HESS) integrated to the grid interactive microgrid environment is presented. HESS is nowadays most widely used in the electric vehicles, energy reserves, renewable energy sources (RES)based applications. These energy storage systems can also be added to the existing power conditioning units to improve their inherent compensation capabilities. Effective voltage and current compensation are achieved using a single inverter topology with the usage of HESS into the system. Also the current stresses occurred due to dynamic changes in load and RES are diverted to supercapacitor packs, which relieves the battery units and improves its lifespan. The participation of these HESS is controlled based on the state of charge (SoC) status to have safe and reliable operation. A control strategy is being formulated to tackle the compensation performance using the HESS units. The proposed strategy is tested and validated using MATLAB based simulink environment.
