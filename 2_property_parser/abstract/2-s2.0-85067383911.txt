Super capacitors have emerged as a promising substitute for batteries and conventional capacitors which have played a key role as energy storage devices. The continuous concerns over green and low-cost concepts have motivated the consideration of natural materials as they are non-toxic and low cost. On the other hand, the realization of the dangers of liquid electrolytes has promoted the attention on gel polymer electrolytes to be used for devices. The prime objective of the present study is fabricating an electrochemical double-layer capacitor (EDLC) which is a type of super capacitor make using natural graphite and a gel polymer electrolyte. The electrolyte having the composition 0.5 PVdF-Co-HFP:0.70 MgTF:1 EC:1 DEC showed an optimum room temperature conductivity of 3.45 × 10−3 S cm−1. It was purely an ionic conductor having improved amorphous nature. EDLCs were fabricated with two identical natural graphite electrodes. Evaluation of EDLC was carried out using cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and galvanostatic charge-discharge test. The proposed electrode/electrolyte combination seemed to be suitable for the application in EDLCs. Specific capacitance values obtained are satisfactory to carry forward further investigations to improve performance.
