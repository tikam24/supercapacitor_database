This study presents the capacitive behavior of a supercapacitor (SC) having mesoporous graphitized Ketjenblack (KB) (modified KB (MKB)) as a conductive nanofiller in its polarized electrodes. Galvanostatic charge/discharge and cyclic voltammogram tests were conducted for SCs containing MKB and normal KB (for reference). The SC containing MKB required long charging periods under constant-current charging. This was due to its higher energy density and anode capacitance (181 F g-1), as compared to that of the SC containing KB. Moreover, the SC containing MKB retained its high capacitance better at higher scan rates. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.
