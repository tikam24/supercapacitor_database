Copper oxide has aroused great concern in energy storage fields due to its properties of high theoretical capacitance, low cost and mild toxicity. However, its wide application still remains challenges owing to its poor electrical conductivity and unstable cycling life. Binder-free foam electrodes possess abundant porous structures and high specific surface area, which could get good contact with electrolyte. Herein, we demonstrate Ag nanoparticles decorated CuxO nanowires grown spontaneously on copper foam (CF) electrode for asymmetric supercapacitor. The skeleton structure of CF provides large amounts of active sites for the growth of CuxO nanowires. Moreover, Ag nanoparticles further decrease the internal resistance and enhance the electrochemical performance. Ag/CuxO/CF-40 electrode presents a high area specific capacitance of 1192 mF cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2 and the influence of surface capacitance-dominated process and diffusion-controlled process are discussed in detail. Besides, the energy density of the as-prepared asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) reaches 46.32 μWh cm−2 at a power density of 3.00 mW cm−2. A 2V LED is lighted successfully by two ASC in series. This work provides a new strategy to prepare low internal resistance and binder-free flexible Ag/CuxO/CF electrode, which demonstrates a good potential application in flexible supercapacitors or other wearable electronic devices.
