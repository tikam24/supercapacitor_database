High volumetric capacitance electrode materials are highly desirable for miniaturized and portable capacitive storage devices. Herein, a spatially confined strategy to prepare 0D-in-2D pillared lamellar hybrid comprising vanadium nitride nanodots intercalated carbon nanosheets (VNNDs/CNSs) is proposed for promising capacitive material with high volumetric capacitance. The VNNDs/CNSs shows an ultrahigh volumetric capacitance of 1203.6 F cm−3 at 1.1 A cm−3 and rate capability of 703.1 F cm−3 at 210 A cm−3 surpassing those of carbon, transition metal oxides/nitrides. Even the 150 μm-thick film electrode comprising VNNDs/CNSs has a volumetric capacitance of 867.1 F cm−3. Moreover, the VNNDs/CNSs electrode exhibits extraordinary cycling stability with 90% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles. The all-solid-state symmetric flexible supercapacitor based on VNNDs/CNSs electrodes boasts a high volumetric energy density/power density of 30.9 Wh L−1/64,500 W L−1 with 91% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles, rendering promising applications in high-performance flexible supercapacitors. The strategy provides an insight into the rational design of compact, robust and highly conductive electrode materials with high volumetric capacitances and long life.
