To endow knitted cotton fabrics with new function such as conductance and electricity storage for wearable devices, pyrrole monomers were in-situ polymerized on a knitted cotton fabric to fabricate the polypyrrole/cotton knitted fabric. Scanning electron microscope and Fourier transform infrared spectra were used to detect the morphologies and chemical structures of the polypyrrole/cotton knitted fabric. The surface resistances and the electrochemical performances of polypyrrole/cotton knitted fabric at different tensile strain were also measured. The results show that sufficient polypyrrole is coated on knitted cotton fibers, and the surface resistances decreases from 429.2 Ω to 231.4 Ω when the strain is changed from 0% to 40%. The areal capacitance of the polypyrrole/cotton knitted fabric is 680.6 mF/cm2 at the scan rate of 5 mV/s, and is 1 014.2 mF/cm2 at the current density of 2 mA/cm2. The symmetric supercapacitor device prepared from the polypyrrole/cotton knitted fabric shows an areal capacitance of 229.8 mF/cm2 at 1 mA/cm2 and 161.5 mF/cm2 at 5 mA/cm2, and this device exhibits a capacitance retention of 76.3% after 10 000 galvanostatic charging/discharging cycles.
