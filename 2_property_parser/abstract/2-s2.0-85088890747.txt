In order to improve the efficiency of absorbing the braking energy for hybrid trams, an energy management strategy is proposed, which takes into account the initial and final states of charge (SOC) of an energy storage system. The strategy allocates the load power for the hybrid power system by using the minimum principle from the tram start to the braking, which achieves the effective control on the safety range of the supercapacitor SOC, and ensures sufficient remaining SOC to absorb the braking energy as the tram brakes. Furthermore, the strategy combines the tram traction control during start and traction operation with the energy recovery during the braking process, and uses an integrated device composed of the insulated gate bipolar transistor chopper and braking resistor to suppress the bus voltage rise. Finally, based on the actual tram operating conditions, a simulation test is conducted with the MATLAB/Simulink platform. The results show that at the moment of tram braking, the supercapacitor SOC can reach about 0.4 as expected, and during the entire braking process, the bus voltage can always lie below 875 V, which meets the requirements of bus voltage control.
