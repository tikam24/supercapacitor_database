Globally increasing amenities of living for achieving a convenient route towards life that solely depends on the energy miniatures upsurge the essentiality of energy storage devices. So, there is a need for sustainable energy sources that have high energy density and power density and do not create any harm to the atmosphere; with this approach, supercapacitors find a more appropriate place among similar energy appliances. In today’s epoch, one-dimensional polymeric nanofibers are one of the most intriguing materials for supercapacitors’ device fabrication. Polymeric nanofibers have unique characteristics such as their controllable porous nature, high surface area, high electrical conductivity with stress and strain tolerance potential, and, with these properties, they have an excellent bending ability i.e., intrinsic flexibility of polymer shackles, self-healable tendency also that make them better material for the wearable electronic devices in electronic watches, toys, electric guitar, grill, electric pressure cooker, etc. In this chapter, different techniques for synthesizing polymeric nanofibers along with their advantages and a few disadvantages are given and various polymers used for the synthesis of polymeric nanofibers are also studied. These nanofibers’ hybrids/composites in supercapacitor application are deliberately examined with their brief explanations. Indubitably, a supercapacitor can make a remarkable place in the world of electronic devices through polymeric nanofibers, at the same time, despite the noteworthy progress in the development of flexible polymeric nanofibers based supercapacitors, their power and energy densities still need to further be enhanced for practical appliances with effective cost so come into range of a common person.
