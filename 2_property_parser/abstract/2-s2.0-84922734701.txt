A stable and effective redox-mediator gel electrolyte has been prepared by doping indigo carmine (IC) into a polyvinyl alcohol sulfuric acid polymer system (PVA-H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf>), and a high performance solid state supercapacitor is fabricated by utilizing activated carbon as electrodes and the prepared gel polymer (PVA-H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf>-IC) as an electrolyte and separator. The PVA-H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf>-IC gel polymer has excellent bending, compressing and stretching mechanical properties. As expected, the ionic conductivity of the gel polymer electrolyte increased by 188% up to 20.27 mS cm<sup>-1</sup> while introducing IC as the redox mediator in the PVA-H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> gel electrolyte. Simultaneously, specific capacitance is increased by 112.2% (382 F g<sup>-1</sup>) and energy density (13.26 W h kg<sup>-1</sup>) is also increased. Furthermore, the fabricated device shows superior charge-discharge stability. After 3000 cycles, its capacitive retention ratio is still as high as 80.3%. This result may be due to the fact that the IC can act as a plasticizer and redox mediator, and the supercapacitor combines the double-layer characteristic of carbon-based supercapacitors and the faradaic reaction characteristic of batteries energy-storage processes.
