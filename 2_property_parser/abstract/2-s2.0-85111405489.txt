Supercapacitors have the characteristics of high specific capacitance, long cycle life and fast charging ability, which have shown extremely valuable applications in energy storage fields. Improving the electrode materials is a crucial approach to achieve high capacity. Vanadium nitride (VN) has higher theoretical capacitance than noble metal oxides, as well as better chemical stability and good electrical conductivity. Herein, a composite of VN nanowires with multiple cavities encapsulated in N-doped reduced graphene oxide lamellar layers (VNNWs@rGO) has been synthesized by facile freeze-casting and subsequent nitridation technique. The hierarchical VNNWs@rGO composite exhibited excellent supercapacitor performance: high capacitances of 222 and 65 F g−1 were achieved at current densities of 0.5 and 10 A g−1, respectively. The improved electrochemical performance is associated with the unique structural design: the N-doped rGO sheets endowed enhanced electric conductivity and chemical stability for VN, the interconnected laminar network of VNNWs@rGO are crucial for electrolyte penetration and charge transfer, and the cavities and nanoparticles inside the VN nanowires can provide abundant active sites for electric double-layer capacitor and pseudocapacitance.
