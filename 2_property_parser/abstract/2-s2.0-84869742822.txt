Carbide derived carbons (CDCs) are porous carbons produced by extraction metals from metal carbides. In this paper, nanoporous carbon with large surface area of above 1000 m2/g has been prepared by thermo-chemical etching of titanium carbide (TiC) in chlorine atmosphere. An improved design of accurate control on the reaction time with high yield percentage above 98% is reported. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed the existence of ordered graphite phase in this mostly amorphous titanium carbide derived carbon (TiC-CDC), and the degree of ordering increased with chlorination temperature. Raman spectra study demonstrated that the TiC-CDC consisted of both D-band and G band of graphitic carbon, and the ratio of the integrated intensities ID/IG decreased with chlorination temperature. T-plot nitrogen sorption measurements proved the co-existence of micropores (<2 nm) and mesopores (2-50 nm), while the highest specific surface area was achieved from sample synthesized at 400 °C. Cyclic voltammetry measurements on the TiC-CDC did not show any major Faradic reactions within the experimental voltage range. A specific capacitance of 138.3 F/g was achieved from sample synthesized at 400 °C. The specific capacitance increased with increasing the amount of microporous area.
