The charge/discharge, electrochemical impedance, cyclic voltammogram, and cycling behaviors of crystalline K xMnO 2·nH 2O as cathode material for supercapacitors in Li 2SO 4, Na 2SO 4, and K 2SO 4 electrolytes were compared. The different power and cycling performance of K xMnO 2·nH 2O during charge/discharge in the three electrolytes were elucidated by analyzing its composition and structure evolution. Compared with the Li 2SO 4 and Na 2SO 4 electrolytes, the highest ionic conductivity of K 2SO 4 electrolyte, the fastest charge-transfer process and slightest structural evolution of K xMnO 2·nH 2O during charge/discharge in the K 2SO 4 electrolyte lead to a superior power and cycling behavior for supercapacitor application. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.
