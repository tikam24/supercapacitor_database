A high-performance supercapacitor electrode NiCo2S4 (NCS) nanosheet on SiO2@C core-shell nanospheres (SiO2@C-NCS nanocomposite) is prepared via simple an effective solution-based method. Benefiting from compositional and structural advantages, the as-prepared SiO2@C-NCS nanocomposite exhibits a high specific capacitance (625 F g-1 at 1 mA cm-2) and a stable cycling performance. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) assembled with SiO2@C-NCS nanocomposite as a positive electrode and carbon nanotube paper as a negative electrode in aqueous KOH solution demonstrated a high energy density of 16 Wh kg-1 at an ultra-high specific power of 7200 W kg-1. These promising results suggest the possible application of mixed transition metal sulfides-based composites as advanced electrode materials for high-performance ASCs.
