A novel self-supported structure of Ce-UiO-66/TNF was firstly synthesized by growing Ce-UiO-66 on a TNF substrate. This novel Ce-UiO-66/TNF material was proved to possess a high supercapacitive performance in the redox electrolyte of Fe(CN)6 3−/4−, and it was also the first study for Ce-UiO-66 material on the supercapacitor application. High specific capacitances of 6.9 and 2.5 Fcm−2 can be achieved at large current densities of 20 and 80 mAcm−2, respectively. After 10,000 charge-discharge cycles, the capacitance retention can be kept at 95% and the coulomb efficiency can be maintained over 98%. Such outstanding electrochemical performance may be related to the redox property of the electrolyte, high specific surface area of the Ce-UiO-66 material, porous characteristic of the TNF substrate and self-supported structure of the whole electrode.
