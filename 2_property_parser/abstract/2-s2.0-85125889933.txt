Optimal reduction of graphene oxide (GO) to reduced graphene oxide (rGO) through strategically planned chemical synthesis with suitable reducing agents and combining materials, prevents restacking and enhances the conductivity of the rGO sheets. The present work demonstrates such a tailoring approach towards the synthesis of rGO using aniline as a mild reducing agent. The obtained rGO with residual oxygen bearing functional groups provides adequate sites that facilitates synergistic interaction with p-toluene sulphonic acid (pTSA) doped polyaniline (PANI) chains. The resultant PANI-rGO nanocomposite exhibits a well-ordered and expanded morphology due to the organic acid dopant, pTSA that separates the interlayers of rGO sheets and the PANI chains leading to enhanced thermal stability and electrical conductivity. Modified nanocomposite electrode shows a higher specific capacitance value (450 F/g) compared to plain rGO (132.5 F/g) and pTSA doped PANI (300 F/g) at a current density of 0.8 A/g with enhanced cycling stability up to 5000 cycles. The results reveal the suitability of the nanocomposite as a potential electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
