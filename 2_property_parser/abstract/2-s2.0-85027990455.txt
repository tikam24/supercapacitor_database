Transition metal sulfides have received increasing attention as promising battery-type electrode materials in hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs). Here, nickel cobalt sulfides (NCS) with three dimensional non spherical hollow structures are successfully synthesized via a facile two-step hydrothermal process. In virtue of the special structural merits, these NCS microtubes have an impressive specific capacity as high as 574 C g−1 at 1 A g−1 and excellent rate capability. Furthermore, when used as a battery-type electrode for assembling hybrid supercapacitor, a high-energy density (25.7 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 150 W kg−1) can be attained after activated by the initial cycling process. This work provides a mild vulcanization process for hydroxides, and the synthesized NCS material with a unique 3D hollow structure is a promising electrode material for HSCs.
