Carbon material is the largest material used as electrode on advanced energy storage devices. The modern lifestyle requires more energy, consequently, more smart energy use and efficient devices are needed. The constant evolution of materials technologies looking for green material and renewable raw material, that have minimal impact on the environment, is one of the most important subjects studied in recent years. The scientific and industry community are paying more attention to new forms of carbon such as nanotubes, graphene, and activated carbon fiber. The purpose of this work is to convert human hair into a hollow carbon filament to be used as a supercapacitor electrode. The human hair needs 3 stages to be converted into carbon filament: textile manufacture, oxidation, and carbonization. The electrochemical behavior was analyzed in a three-electrode electrochemical cell system with 2 M of H2SO4 electrolyte medium. The behavior of the electrode was characterized electrochemically by galvanostatic charge/discharge curves, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, showing 163 F g-1 of a maximum value of specific capacitance.
