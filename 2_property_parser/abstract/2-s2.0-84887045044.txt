New nanoporous carbon materials were synthesized from organic precursors, and their electrochemical properties were investigated by cyclic voltammetry in acid and alkali electrolytes (6 M KOH or 1 M H2SO4). A correlation between specific capacitance and specific surface area was observed. Because of higher specific capacitance values (130-335 F/g), the carbon materials under study may be regarded as promising materials for electrochemical supercapacitors. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.
