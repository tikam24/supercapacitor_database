A new composite cupric bound Activated carbon synthesized by pyrolysis and sol–gel methods. In this metal bound activated carbon precursor studied the electrochemical properties for supercapacitor and OER. The MBAC excellent capacitance values of 313F g−1 at current density of 1 A g−1. MBAC good cycle stability (capacitance retention of 96% after 5000 cycle at current density of 5 A g−1), possesses a sheet like morphology and high surface area it improves to ion transport the electrode/electrolyte interface the discharge and charge process to great electrical conductivity. Moreover MBAC electrode assembled of asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device produces an extreme voltage up to 1.2 V a specific energy of 39.16 Wh kg−1 at a power of 718 W kg−1, with an excellent cycle stability of 2.6% capacitance loss after 11,000 cycles. In addition MBAC only shows good electro catalytic performance with low over potential and high current density. This electrode smallest tafel slope value of 82.6 mV dec1 reveals that superior reaction kinetics for OER catalyst. Also might be a hopeful candidate for high performance of supercapacitors.
