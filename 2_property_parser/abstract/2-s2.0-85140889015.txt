In present days, supercapacitors become focal point of the most favorable electrochemical energy storage system. Among various supercapacitive materials, the nickel-based metal-organic framework (Ni-MOF) is a new category of rigid electrodes with very large specific capacitance. However, scientists working on Ni MOF materials have shown that there are some limitations that need to be overcome, such as their low conductivity and cyclic stability. Notable improvements have been received through different strategies such as build synergetic structures, improving the active sites by composites with other metal oxides and improve electrical conductivity as well as specific surface area by using carbonaceous electrode materials. We reviewed the progress of the current study to improve the electrochemical performance of the Ni-MOF electrode and specifically focused on the requirement of the desired metal synergistic and doping effects on the electrical activity of MOFs.
