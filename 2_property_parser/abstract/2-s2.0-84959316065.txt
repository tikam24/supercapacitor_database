Nano-Diamond was mixed with ethylic cellulose and other Material to form to paste. A series of sol-gel Nano-Diamond film with different proportions were designed test intentionally. Nano-Diamond film was fabricated on Aluminum substrates using two-steps sintering process. The moving terminal of the variable super-capacitor was the shaft which throughout each of monolithic capacitor plate. The low melting point glass powder possesses giant permittivity, low dielectric loss, good thermal stability and dielectric constant in a wide temperature range which applied very broad prospects in microelectronics. The low melting point glass powder was mixed with carboxymethyl cellulose and deionized water to paste. The low melting point glass powder insulation thick-film was fixed on Nano-Diamond film.In this paper, the insulation thick-film preparation: sintering at 578K to 588K and keeping 11.5 h to 12.5 h. A variable super-capacitor was designed based on Nano-Diamond film electrode and low melting point glass powder insulation thick. Insulation thickness was prepared on uniform nano-diamond film to increase insulation super-capacitor between the two plates.
