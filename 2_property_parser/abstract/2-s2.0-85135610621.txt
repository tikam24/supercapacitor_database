The goal of this research is to employ synthesized mono- and binuclear boron-containing compounds (C16H12BF6NO2·HCl (B) and C42H34B2Cl2F12N4O4 (B ← N)) as electrodes in supercapacitor applications for the first time and test their specific capacitances in the presence of various electrolyte solutions. Experimental findings show that the specific capacitance value of the binuclear boron-based (B ← N) electrode is larger than that of the mononuclear boron-based (B) electrode in the presence of both distinct electrolyte solutions as a consequence of the electrochemical tests. Moreover, when the morphological qualities of both substances are evaluated, it is discovered that binuclear boron-based (B ← N) has a more porous structure and, as a result of the surface area measurement, has a greater surface area than mononuclear boron-based (B). As a part of this experiment, it has been established that binuclear boron-based (B ← N) is a viable material for future supercapacitor energy storage applications.
