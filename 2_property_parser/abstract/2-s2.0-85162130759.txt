To satiate the steadily increasing demand for energy, futuristic materials for energy storage devices are to be discovered. The rheological phase reaction method has been reported as the state of the art for producing polycrystalline powders of ZnV3O8. Three distinct calcination temperatures 450 째C, 500 째C, and 550 째C were used to synthesize ZnV3O8. Different structural, morphological, and electrochemical properties were studied. To carefully examine the electrochemical behavioral traits of ZnV3O8 as an electrode, a three electrode cell was assembled using a 1 M Zn(NO3)2 aqueous electrolyte. At a current density of 1 A/g, ZnV3O8 synthesized at 500 째C had a high specific capacitance of 428 F/g. The fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor with ZVO-500 showed an impressive specific capacitance of 121 F/g at 0.125 A/g. Cyclic studies showed 63.84 % specific capacitance retention after 200 cycles at 1 A/g. The fabricated supercapacitor demonstrates an exorbitant energy density of 11.6 Wh/kg and a high power density of 1800 W/kg at a current density of 1 and 0.125 A/g respectively. These high electrochemical performances of ZnV3O8 prove this as a potential candidate as an electrode for aqueous supercapacitor application.
