In this paper, a self-adaptive multi-mode dynamic proportional control strategy for hybrid-energy-storage tramcar is proposed. With battery life and system efficiency as optimization objectives, power distribution between two sources is carried out by pseudo-spectral method. According to the optimization results, an on-line dynamic proportional EMS is extracted. Furthermore, in order to make the control strategy change with the actual situation, the EMS is improved to a self-adaptive dynamic proportional EMS. The simulation results show that compared with the traditional proportional control strategy, the multi-mode dynamic proportional control strategy greatly improves the battery life and efficiency.
