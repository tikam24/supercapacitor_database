Transition metal oxide-based pseudocapacitors fundamentally involve fast chargeâ€“discharge processes due to the fast-Faradaic redox reactions occurring at the interface between the active material and electrolyte. Thus, they exhibit high specific capacity and energy density compared to electrical double-layer capacitors. However, their poor conductivity and low surface area restricted their advanced application in supercapacitors. Therefore, to improve conductivity and surface area without losing pseudocapacity, a synergistic effect of transition metal oxides and electronically conducting polymers has been recognized to design composite electrode materials for supercapacitor. The formation of transition metal oxide-conducting polymer composite electrodes can achieve better electrical conductivity and electrochemical accessibility of redox sites for high-performance supercapacitors. Therefore, this chapter provides decent and updated coverage on synthesis, structure, properties, and supercapacitor performance of conducting polymers and their composites of transition metal oxides.
