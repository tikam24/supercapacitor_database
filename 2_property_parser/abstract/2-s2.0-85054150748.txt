This work reports the synthesis of coaxial carbon@NiMoO4 nanofibers for supercapacitor electrode applications. Thin NiMoO4 nanosheets are uniformly coated on the conductive electrospun carbon nanofibers by a microwave assisted hydrothermal method to form a hierarchical structure, which increases the porosity as well as the conductivity of the electrode. The thickness of the NiMoO4 can be easily adjusted by varying the precursor concentrations. The high specific surface area (over 280 m2 g-1) and conductive carbon nanofiber backbone increase the utilization of the active pseudocapacitive NiMoO4 phase, resulting a high specific capacitance of 1840 F g-1.
