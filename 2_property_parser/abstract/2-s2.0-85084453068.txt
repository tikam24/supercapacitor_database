The article discusses the analysis of transients in the energy storage device as an element of a frequency-controlled electric drive. The energy storage device, based on supercapacitors, is connected to the DC link of a frequency converter through a bi-directional DC-DC converter and has a single-loop control system of external current. The aim of research is to identify the dynamics characteristics of the energy storage device with accounting the discrete properties of DC-DC converter. Simulation was carried out both with and without accounting the discreteness of the DC-DC converter. In the first case, the mathematical model of the DC-DC converter power part was built with using the SimPowerSystems library of Matlab application. In the second case, the averaged DC-DC converter model was used. In the article the influence of control system performance, the PWM frequency of the DC-DC converter and the capacitance of the DC link capacitor on the accuracy of inverter voltage stabilization is also considered. The article shows that the using of a double-integrating current control system with high performance and an increasing the PWM frequency of DCDC converter allows to obtain high accuracy of voltage stabilization in transition modes at the level of 5%.
