Supercapacitors have attracted great attention in the field of energy storage due to their advantages of high-power density, fast storage efficiency, fast discharge speed and long cycle life, etc. Electrode materials are the key factor of supercapacitor to improve their performance. As an excellent electrode material for supercapacitors, g-C3N4 with high nitrogen content, abundant active sites and good stability is favored by researchers. In this paper, the structural characteristics and energy storage mechanism of g-C3N4based electrode materials for supercapacitor were reviewed, and the performance improvement strategies of the composites were elaborated. Finally, the application research progress of g-C3N4 based supercapacitor electrode materials was summarized. It was indicated that g-C3N4 based materials had excellent application prospects for supercapacitor use.
