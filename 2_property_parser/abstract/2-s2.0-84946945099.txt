A nickel-based compound layer was prepared on a nickel plate by anodization in a 75 wt% H3PO4 solution containing NH4F. This layer was then treated by galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) until a black outer layer was detached, leaving behind a film on the nickel plate as a binder-free electrode material for supercapacitors. The microstructural characterization shows that the film consists of Ni(OH)2 and NiO, and no fluoride is found in the as-obtained film. Electrochemical tests demonstrate that this fluoride-free film electrode exhibits a high capacitance of 954 F·g−1 at 7.5 A·g−1, excellent rate capability (a 19.5 % capacitance reduction with the current density increasing to 120 A·g−1) and cycling stability. Within 3500 cycles, the specific capacitance does not decrease, but rather increases from 840 F·g−1 to approximately 1092 F·g−1 in the first 100 cycles at 60 A·g−1, and remains stable until the aforementioned layer is detached.
