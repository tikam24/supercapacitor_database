We report the synthesis of citrate stabilized iron oxide (C-Fe3O4) spherical nanoparticles for supercapacitor electrodes. The citrate functional group present in the surface of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles effectively controls the morphology and the surface area of the nanostructures. The C-Fe3O4 electrodes exhibited a battery-like energy storage properties with a maximum specific capacity of 146 Cg−1 (242 Fg−1) which is much higher than the specific capacity of citrate free Fe3O4 electrode (62 Cg−1; 112 Fg−1). Moreover, the C-Fe3O4 electrode showed better cyclic stability (75%) than the citrate free Fe3O4 electrode (~35%) after 1000 charge/discharge cycles.
