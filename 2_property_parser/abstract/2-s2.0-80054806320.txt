Mesoporous RuO2 films were electrochemically fabricated on ITO-coated glass substrate from aqueous ruthenium chloride (RuCl 3·nH2O) solution. To achieve highly stable mesoporous structure, an aqueous mixture of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was used as a templating agent. The mesoporous structure was confirmed by small angle X-ray diffraction (SAXRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The addition of small amount (10wt%) of CTAB significantly improved the stability of porous structure. The crystallinity of synthesized RuO2 thin film was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Specific capacitance of the synthesized films was evaluated by measuring cyclic voltammetry (CV) and charge-discharge curves in 0.5 M H2SO4. Compared with non-porous electrode, mesoporous RuO2 showed higher supercapacitor performance. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
