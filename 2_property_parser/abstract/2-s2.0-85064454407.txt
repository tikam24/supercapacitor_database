Ever increasing energy demand lead to the power generation by using renewable Energy Sources. Fuel cells are new source of energy that converts chemical energy to electrical energy with high efficiency, low noise and negligible emission. Out of different types of fuel cells, proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is commonly used because of its advantages like low operating temperature, fast start up, zero gas emission and long cell and stack life. The proposed work focuses grid synchronized PEMFC with electrolyser and ultra-capacitor. The model is developed and simulated in the Matlab/Simulink environment. To overcome the slow thermodynamic response of the fuel cell to load variations, ultra-capacitor is connected. The DC low voltage output of the PEMFC is boosted and inverted using PWM technique to have grid interaction. The system also incorporates a PI controller to regulate the inverter output at desired level of grid voltage and grid frequency. The simulation results validate the presence of ultra-capacitor (UC) with PEMFC and demonstrate the mitigation of load transients.
