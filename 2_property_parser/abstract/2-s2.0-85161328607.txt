For medical electronic devices, batteries and capacitors are crucial power sources. However, several challenges are associated with these power sources, such as their inflexibility, poor performance, and non-biocompatibility. In this work, a flexible and biocompatible supercapacitor device was fabricated with niobium nitride (NbN) and titanium nitride (TiN) electrodes. Magnetron sputtering was used to deposit NbN and TiN directly on stainless steel-304 (SS). The fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor device (NbN@SS||TiN@SS) demonstrated efficient electrochemical stability, with excellent electrode material adhesion on the substrate, high capacitive performance, and excellent cyclic stability (87.11 % capacitive retention after 10,000 cycles at 0.2 mAcm−2 current density) in physiological fluid (phosphate buffer saline). The device delivered a voltage window of 1.2 V, with superb electrochemical performance (areal energy and power density of 1.86 µWhcm−2 and 239.14 mWcm−2 respectively). Cell viability studies were performed to establish the in-vitro biocompatibility of the electrodes. There was significant cell growth (93 % for TiN@SS and 94 % for NbN@SS) and excellent protein adsorption after 72 h incubation of L929 fibroblasts. These astounding outcomes and the ideal bending electrochemical performance make it a potential candidate for powering medical and implantable electronic devices by directly utilizing physiological fluid.
