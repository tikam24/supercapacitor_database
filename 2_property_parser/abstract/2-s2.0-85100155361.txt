This article reports the preparation of new ZnMn2O4/Mn2O3 composites by ultrasonication and microwave irradiation assisted hydrothermal method. The composite formation (ZnMn2O4/Mn2O3) is confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and micro-Raman spectroscopy. The four ‘petals’ flower and six ‘petals’ flower-shaped morphology of composite material are confirmed through scanning electron microscopic analysis. The synthesis method directly influences the morphology of the composites. Further, nanosized composite formation is confirmed through transmission electron microscopic analysis. The prepared composite materials' electrochemical properties are studied using a three-electrode system and it shows a pseudocapacitance nature. The high specific capacitance of 380 F/g @ 0.5 A/g is found for the composite material in galvanostatic charge-discharge studies. The prepared ZnMn2O4/Mn2O3 composite shows an excellent cycling stability of 92% of the initial specific capacitance at current density of 3 A/g after 2000 cycles. Electrochemical studies of the composite reveal that the ZnMn2O4/Mn2O3 composite can be used for supercapacitor applications.
