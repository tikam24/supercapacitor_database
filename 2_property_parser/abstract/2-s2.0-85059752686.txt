The hierarchical of NiCo2O4@MnO2 core-shell nanotubes arrays anchored on 3D hierarchical porous carbon aerogels scaffold (NiCo2O4@MnO2-CAS) are prepared through a facile hydrothermal method combined with a simple thermal treatment. Such unique array nanoarchitectures and the synergistic effects of component nanomaterials exhibit remarkable electrochemical performance. The results show high specific capacitance of 786.0 F/g at current densities of 0.5 A/g, excellent rate performance and good cycling stability with capacitance retention of 84.9% after 2,000 cycles. An asymmetric supercapacitor with operating potential at 1.4 V is configured with NiCo2O4@MnO2 composites against active carbon, and exhibits a specific capacitance of 145.0 F/g at current density of 1.0 A/g and a high energy density of 39.0 Wh/kg at a power density of 350.0 W/kg.
