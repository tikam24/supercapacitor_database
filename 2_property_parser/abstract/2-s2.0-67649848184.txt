This paper shows how a back-to-back asynchronous interconnection can be used to turn part of the utility network into an advanced Smartgrid or Microgrid, which behaves like a model citizen as seen from the main network and offers uninterruptible supply functionality to its loads or microsources. Additionally energy storage can be integrated on to the DC link of the AC:DC:AC connection interface. The basic control of such a system is discussed and simulation results of its operation are presented.
