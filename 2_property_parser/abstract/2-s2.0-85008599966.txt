Sonochemical irradiation method was attempted to synthesize monodisperse spherical CuMn(OH)3NO3nanoparticles for energy storage applications. Scanning and Transmission electron microscopic images, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) analyses were performed to illustrate the formation of monodisperse spherical CuMn(OH)3NO3nanoparticles. The electrochemical performance of spherical CuMn(OH)3NO3nanoparticles were examined as a better candidate for supercapacitor electrode material compared to pristine Cu2(OH)3NO3nanoparticles, i.e., CuMn(OH)3NO3nanoparticles exhibit specific capacitance of 258 Fg−1at a current density of 1 mA cm−2in the potential range between 0.0 and + 1.0 V in 1 M Na2SO4aqueous solution whereas pristine Cu2(OH)3NO3, exhibit specific capacitance of 81 Fg−1only.
