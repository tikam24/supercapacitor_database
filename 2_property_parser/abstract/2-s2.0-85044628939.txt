The surfactant and template free Co3O4 and NiO nanoplates have synthesized using microwave assisted method. Synthesized Co3O4 and NiO nanoplates were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) for their Structural, morphological and elemental analysis respectively. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of both samples were recorded for the oxide compound confirmation. Optical and magnetic characterizations were studied by using UV–Visible absorption spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL) and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) respectively. Average crystallite sizes for Co3O4 and NiO nanoplates were found to be 21 nm and 17 nm respectively by using Debye–Scherrer's formula. The energy band gaps for Co3O4 and NiO nanoplates were calculated using Tauc plot and values are 3.3 eV and 3.1 eV respectively. BET surface areas of Co3O4 and NiO nanoplates were measured to be 29 m2/g and 92 m2/g respectively. The magnetization of Co3O4 and NiO nanoplates as a function of magnetic field were recorded at room temperature showing a small hysteresis loop with coercivity of ∼534 and ∼152 Oe respectively. Microwave assisted method can be useful for the synthesis of Co3O4 and NiO nano morphological materials for supercapacitor application.
