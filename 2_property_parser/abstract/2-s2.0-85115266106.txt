The development of simple preparation and excellent capacity performance electrode materials is the key to energy conversion and storage for supercapacitors. Based on the growth mechanism of crystal, Zn induced NiCo nanosheets and nanoneedles composite structure deposed on Ni foam (ZNC) are successfully attained by a facile one-step method, the growth mechanism of the composite structure is further discussed. Because of its unique composites structure and additional modification of carbon, the carbon modified ZNC (ZNC@C) delivers better energy storage ability (2280 mC cm-2 at 2 mA cm-2) compare to ZNC. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is assembled by ZNC@C as the positive electrode and carbonized popcorn as the negative electrode. The ASC exhibits good energy storage performance. Zn also positively affects the adsorption energy to enhance the capacitance property based on Density Functional theory calculation. The simple method for the composite structure by tuning the kinetics behaver of the crystal can provide a new strategy in synthesizing the materials, and the material with a unique structure and high performance will have potential applications in the field of energy storage.
