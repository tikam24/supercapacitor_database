Two-dimensional nano materials like Graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides are the suitable choice for the supercapacitor application due to their interesting properties including high surface area. Here we report a high performance thin film supercapacitor based on hybrid nanostructures of 2D - MoS2/rGO nanosheets. MoS2 nanosheets and MoS2/rGO hybrid were synthesized by simple hydrothermal route. Electrochemical properties of hybrid electrode have been investigated systematically in 1M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte using three electrode systems. The hybrid material exhibits a high areal capacitance of 14.09mF/cm2 (âˆ¼ 607 F/g) at 5mV/s, with high energy density of 5.71mWh/cm2 and a power density of 54.1mW/cm2.
