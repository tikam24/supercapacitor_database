Rapidly changing demand on energy storage systems makes it essential to redesign the device architecture and materials required to fabricate the devices. It is crucial to introduce capacitive behaviour in a conventional energy storage device (batteries) to improve the lifetime and power efficiency of the hole energy storage system. The charge storing nature of electrode material primarily depends on particle size, grain size, the electrode's chemical structure, and effective diffusion lengths for electrolytes within the electrode. Here V2O5 based Li-ion battery electrode is transformed into a Li-ion pseudocapacitive electrode by structural modifications. The modified structures are achieved by optimizing reaction pressure to obtain larger, medium and smaller V2O5 particles (namely, V2O5-L, V2O5-M and V2O5-S). As a result, the plateau regions in galvanostatic charge-discharge plots and highly intense redox peaks in the CV plots of V2O5-L get flattened for V2O5-S. Also, the lucrative improvement in rate capabilities and stability for V2O5-S indicates induced pseudocapacitance in V2O5. Some devices are fabricated with the extrinsic pseudocapacitive material (V2O5-S), providing 4.36 mWh cm-3 volumetric energy density with 125 mW cm-3 volumetric power density. The device retains around 95% of its initial capacitance after 10k cycles and holds up to 63% after 25k stability cycles.
