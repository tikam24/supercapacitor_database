Reasonably constructed complex electrode materials are crucial for enhancing the performance of supercapacitors. In this work, polypyrrole (PPy)-modified Ni3S2 nanosheet electrodes are obtained by a hydrothermal approach and a subsequent electrodeposition method. In addition, a composite electrode can shorten the ion diffusion path and enhance its conductivity. The optimal product delivers a capacity of 1484 C g–1 at 1 A g–1 and high cycling stability. In addition, the assembled hybrid supercapacitor achieves an energy density of 74.9 W h kg–1 at 1356.4 W kg–1 and a capacity of 91.7% after 10 000 cycles. Also, the device shows excellent mechanical stability under different bending angles.
