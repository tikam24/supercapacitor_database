The influence of La content on the ferroelectric properties of HfO2-ZrO2 thin films was examined for integrated electrostatic supercapacitor applications. A transition from ferroelectric to antiferroelectric-like behavior, accompanied by a significant increase of energy storage density value and efficiency, was observed with the increasing La concentration in La-doped HfO2-ZrO2-based capacitor structures, where the processing temperature remained below 400 Â°C. The combination of high energy storage density value (?50 J/cm3) with high efficiency (70%) was obtained for the film with the highest La content (2.0 mol. %). The 2.0 mol. % La-doped HfO2-ZrO2-based capacitor structures were field cycled up to 109 times and were found to provide >40 J/cm3 energy storage density along with up to 80% efficiency. Moreover, the high thermal stability of such capacitors was confirmed. The founded property combination makes the La-doped HfO2-ZrO2 thin films suitable for integrated energy storage and pulse-power devices.
