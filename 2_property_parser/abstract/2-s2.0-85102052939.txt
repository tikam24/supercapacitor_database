With the rapid development of intelligent portable electronics, the multifunction requirements for electronic devices get higher and higher. Here, we introduce a novel electrochemical-driven asymmetric supercapacitor-type tactile sensor using cross-linked honeycomb CoV2O6/rGO nanofoam as positive electrode and 1D Ag nanowires integrated with resilient graphene aerogel framework as negative electrode. The novel sensor is integrated with electrochemical-storing and sensing functions, simultaneously. The positive honeycomb CoV2O6/rGO naofoam reveals a high specific capacitance of 1687.7 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, meanwhile negative porous graphene aerogel framework demonstrates high reversible compressibility under strain from 10% to 90%. This electrochemical-driven sensor can realize self-driven and behaves rapid sensitive responses current in the case of detecting strain. The elastic electrochemical-driven sensor not only realizes multi-functionalization of supercapacitor storage devices, but also offers a promising candidate for flexible sensor devices.
