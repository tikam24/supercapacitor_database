Supercapacitor, as a new type of energy storage device, has broad application prospect in the power system and others. It is very significant to establish an accurate model to reflect the actual job characteristics for supercapacitor reasonable use, performance optimization and system simulation. This article summarizes all kinds of supercapacitor model, points out the characteristics of the existing model, and looks forward to the supercapacitor modeling research development trend.
