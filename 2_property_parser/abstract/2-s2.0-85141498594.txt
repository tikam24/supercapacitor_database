Energy access, renewable energy share and energy efficiency are the indicators of the Sustainable Development Goal 7 for universal access to energy in 2030. This can be supported by implementing microgrids with renewable sources in remote areas. One of the issues is system oversizing, which could result in an inefficient system and high production costs. Therefore, system sizing is often correlated with cost optimization. Focusing on the other indicator, this paper investigates renewable energy share and system oversizing through power balance calculation. The study was conducted on a system with PV panels, battery energy storage system and diesel generators. It shows a nonlinear correlation between the capacity of PV, battery and the renewable energy share. Furthermore, higher load factor, higher power rating of the battery storage system and implementation of supercapacitor could increase the renewable energy share. It could also partially address the oversizing issue by reducing the curtailed power.
