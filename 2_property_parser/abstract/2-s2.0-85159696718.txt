Porous carbon with high specific surface and excellent conductivity has attracted more and more attention for supercapacitor application. Biomass-based carbon materials with low cost and abundant resources are widely used to prepare porous carbon. In this work, pectin and melamine are used as precursors, Ni2+ and Co2+ are used as doped metals sources. The porous carbon spheres with Ni/Co codoped are prepared through a hydrothermal method at 120℃ and are carbonized under N2 atmosphere at 900℃. The obtained materials exhibited an excellent capacity of 312 F.g−1 at 1 A.g−1 with a good stability for a long time test.
