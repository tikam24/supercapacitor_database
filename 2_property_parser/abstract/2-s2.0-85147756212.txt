By designing the composition of transition elements and combining the adjustable structure of MOFs, it is reported that the synthesis of bimetallic ZnCo-MOFs based on different Zn/Co molar ratios, then the NiZn1Co2-LDH nanospheres are synthesized by Ni2+ hydrolysis. Compared with the bimetallic NiZn-LDH and NiCo-LDH, the trimetallic layered hydroxide NiZn1Co2-LDH after adding Zn2+ reached a high specific capacity of 217.3 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1. Additionally, both have excellent cycle stability (84.6% capacity retention after 5000 charge–discharge cycles at 10 A g−1) and strong rate performance (72.47% capacity retention rate at 10 A g−1) as well. Furthermore, a hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) with NiZn1Co2-LDH as positive electrodes and activated carbon as negative electrodes was fabricated. The HSC device delivered a high energy density of 45 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 774.1 W kg−1 and excellent cycling stability (specific capacity retention of 92% after 10,000 cycles).
