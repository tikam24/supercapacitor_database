Nickel doped CuS nanostructures has been successfully synthesized using copper nitrate, thiourea as sulfur source and CTAB as cationic surfactant by hydrothermal route and their structural, optical and electrochemical properties are proposed in this work. The effect of cationic surfactant (CTAB) for adjusting the shape/size, porosity and electrochemical properties of CuS nanostructures was examined. The resulting samples were characterized by XRD, FT-IR, UV–Vis, SEM/EDS, TEM, XPS and BET. Then the synthesized samples were utilized for electrochemical performance to modify the glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The electrochemical test reveals that Ni doped CuS exhibits a high specific capacitance of 753 Fg−1 in a 2 M KOH electrolyte solution. This work confirms the as-obtained Ni doped CuS can serve as superior electrode material for future generation supercapacitor device. The better capacity of the modified GCE electrode may bring novel opportunities in the expansion of economical, elevated performance and flexible supercapacitors.
