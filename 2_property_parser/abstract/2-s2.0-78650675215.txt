Manganese dioxides (MnO2) are promising supercapacitor materials because of their high performance, low cost, and environmental friendliness [1]. Usually, the complicated fabrication process of supercapacitor consists of two steps [2]: MnO2 powder preparation and electrode preparation. Recently, facile growth of birnessite MnO2 film on substrates, Pt and Si, for example, has been reported. But pure Si has poor electrical conductivity and Pt costs a lot. By contrast, titanium (Ti) has much better conductivity than Si and costs less than Pt. Here we report a method to synthesize 2-dimensional honeycomb-like birnessite film by a hydrothermal reaction between potassium permanganate (KMnO4) and hydrochloric acid. With a Ti substrate submerged into the reaction solution, the nanostructured MnO2 can be directly deposited on the Ti substrate. Â© 2010 IEEE.
