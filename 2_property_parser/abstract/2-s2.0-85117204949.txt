In this work, NiSe2 was fabricated uniformly on carbonized melamine sponge (CMS) via microwave method, which could be directly used as electrode without any binder and conductive agent. Given these advantages, NiSe2­CMS could achieve an excellent capacitance of 1045 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, and retain 86.3% of the initial capacitance after 15,000 charge/discharge cycles. The asymmetric supercapacitor (NiSe2­CMS-cathode, AC-anode) offered high capacitance of 63.5 F g−1, retained 76% of the initial value after 16,000 cycles, and revealed an energy density of 22.58 W h kg−1 at a power density of 800 W kg−1 at 1 A g−1. Moreover, six small white bulbs were lit for 15 min successfully, indicated good application prospects.
