Supercapacitors can be viewed as energy storage devices. Like every component in the electronic circuitry, they can cause failures in electronic equipment and therefore are subject of reliability studies. The main factors affecting supercapacitor reliability are operating temperature, operating voltage and equivalent series resistance (ESR). Those three performance parameters of supercapacitors should be embedded in the model for calculating parameters such as failure rates, mean time to failure and reliability.
