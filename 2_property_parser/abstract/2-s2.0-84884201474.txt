In this paper a brief overview of research in the field of electrode materials for solar cells and supercapacitors is presented, which the authors dealt with for years. In addition to the standard electrode material (graphite and silicon in supercapacitor with solar cells), different materials were examined, particularly oxides and sulfides of copper. Copper (I) oxide or cuprous oxide is an oxide semiconductor which is used as the anodic material in the form of thin film in lithium batteries and solar cells. The cathodic process of synthesis of cuprous oxide thin film is carried out in a potentiostatic mode from the organic electrolyte. The electrochemical characterization was carried out by cyclic voltammetry. The electro deposition techniques are particularly well suited for the deposition of single elements, but it is also possible to carry out simultaneous depositions of several elements and syntheses of well-defined alternating layers of metals and oxides with thicknesses down to a few nanometers. Electrochemical characteristics of covellite (CuS) are of importance from flotation and metallurgical point of view, due to its potential application in solid state solar cells and in photocatalytic reactions. Also, the compound CuS appears as an intermediary product or a final product in electrochemical oxidation reactions of chalcocite (Cu2S) which exhibits supercapacitor characteristics. Natural copper mineral covellite has been investigated in inorganic sulfate acid electrolytes, as well as in strong alkaline electrolyte. Different electrochemical methods (galvanostatic, potentiostatic, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) have been used in these investigations. Â© 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.
