The activated carbon materials from the corn stalk core raw materials were prepared through the carbonization and activation process and applied as electrode in supercapacitor. The biomass carbon materials activated under different temperatures were tested by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling method. The corn stalk core-derived material activated at 700 °C with the highest specific surface area (2349.89 m2 g−1) has exhibited the maximum specific capacitance of 140 F g−1. Further detailed characterization and theoretical analysis have demonstrated that the corn stalk core derived activated carbon anode material can not only enhance the capacity of supercapacitor but also realize the comprehensive utilization of corn stalks.
