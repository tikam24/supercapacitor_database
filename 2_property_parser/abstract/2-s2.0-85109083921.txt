Porous carbons are widely used as electrode materials for electrical double layer (EDL)-type supercapacitors. Differentiation of capacitance contributions from micropores and mesopores is important to understand porous carbon capacitive behavior. However, this remains challenging to accomplish. Here, we present an improved step potential electrochemical spectroscopy method to investigate the contributions to capacitance from hierarchical pores and redox processes.
