MXene has been identified as a new emerging material for various applications including energy storage, electronics, and bio-related due to its wider physicochemical characteristics. Further the formation of hybrid composites of MXene with other materials makes them interesting to utilize in multifunctional applications. The selection of magnetic nanomaterials for the formation of nanocomposite with MXene would be interesting for the utilization of magnetic characteristics along with MXene. However, the selection of the magnetic nanomaterials is important, as the magnetic characteristics of the ferrites vary with the stoichiometric composition of metal ions, particle shape and size. The selection of the electrolyte is also important for electrochemical energy storage applications, as the electrolyte could influence the electrochemical performance. Further, the external magnetic field also could influence the electrochemical performance. This review briefly discusses the synthesis method of MXene, and ferrite magnetic nanoparticles and their composite formation. We also discussed the recent progress made on the MXene/ferrite nanocomposite for potential applications in electrochemical supercapacitor applications. The possibility of magnetic field-assisted supercapacitor applications with electrolyte and electrode materials are discussed.
