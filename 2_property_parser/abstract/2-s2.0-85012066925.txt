Three-dimensional (3-D) graphene foam/PANI nanorods were fabricated by hydrothermal treatment of graphene oxide (GO) solution and sequentially in-situ synthesis of PANI nanorods on the surface of graphene hydrogel. 3-D graphene foam was used as substrate for the growth of PANI nanorods and it increases the specific surface area as well as the double layer capacitance performance of the graphene foam/PANI nanorod composite. The length of the PANI nanorod is about 340 nm. PANI nanorods exhibited a short stick shape. These PANI nanorods agglomerate together and the growth orientation is anisotropic. The highest specific capacitance of 3-D graphene/PANI nanorod composite electrodes is 352 F g−1 at the scan rate of 10 mV s−1.
