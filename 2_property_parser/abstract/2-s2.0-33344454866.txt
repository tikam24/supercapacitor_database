The fabrication of activated carbon laminated stacked supercapacitor electrodes and their electrochemical properties are described. The material cost can be reduced to a commercially acceptable level by using activated carbon. In addition, the introduction of continuous spread technology for preparing activated carbon electrodes provides mass production capability. Supercapacitors with good electrochemical performance were confirmed by experimental charge-discharge with low internal resistance and leakage current. The energy density of the supercapacitors with KOH as electrolyte is 1.16 Wh/Kg and the capacitance decay less than 20% after over 50000 cycles is obtained under large discharge current condition. They can work at temperatures from-20°C to 80°C. After 500 days on the shelf, the capacitance remains unchanged.
