This paper presents the supercapacitor parameters variations due to state of charge (SOC), the number of cycles (NbCy), the frequency of DC-current combined to temperature. The goal of this study consists to show the parameters evolution which can serve to determine the lifetime of supercapacitor for different conditions of use. The contribution of the paper is focused on the impacts of charge/discharge current's frequency and the temperature coupled to number of cycles on supercapacitor resistance and capacitance. The proposed method uses several DC-current profiles based on fluctuations and no fluctuations consideration. To do the supercapacitors characterization, the experimental tests based on charge and discharge operations with fluctuating DC-current are done. The experimental tests results are presented and the impacts of state of charge, the number of cycles, the frequency of DC-current and the temperature are analyzed.
