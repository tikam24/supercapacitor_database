This study explores the modification of lignin with surfactants, which can be used as a template to make mesoporous structures, and can also be used in combination with manganese oxide to produce manganese oxide/lignin-derived carbon. Organosolv extraction, using ethanol (70%) at 150◦ C, was carried out to extract lignin from oil palm wood. Lignin was then mixed with Pluronic F-127, with and without Mn(NO3 )2, and then crosslinked with acidic formaldehyde, resulting in a carbon precursor-based modified lignin. Carbonization was carried out at 900◦ C to produce lignin-derived carbon and manganese oxide/lignin-derived carbon. The characterization materials included Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) mapping, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and N2-sorption analysis. FTIR curves displayed the vibration bands of lignin and manganese oxide. SEM images exhibited the different morphological characteristics of carbon from LS120% (lignin with a Pluronic surfactant of 120%) and LS120%Mn20% (lignin with a Pluronic of 120% and Mn oxide of 20%). Carbon LS120% (C-LS120%) showed the highest specific surface area of 1425 m2 /g with a mean pore size of 3.14 nm. The largest mean pore size of 5.23 nm with a specific surface area of 922 m2 /g was exhibited by carbon LS120%-Mn20% (C-LS120%-Mn20%). C-LS120%Mn20% features two phases of Mn oxide crystals. The highest specific capacitance of 345 F/g was exhibited by C-LS120%-Mn20%.
