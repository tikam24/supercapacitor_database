Supercapacitors with cobalt oxide (Co3O4) electrode are a kind of strong candidates for achieving high-capacity storage energy devices. However, the reported capacitances lower than the theoretical values are undesirable. In this study, a high-performance supercapacitor by using the Co3O4 electrode with a porous nanostructure is enabled by the calcination treatment of metal organic framework ZIF-67. Of note, the resulting Co3O4 electrodes shows high specific capacitance of 1015 F/g under a current density of 1 A/g. Additionally, it exhibits energy density of 36.6 Wh/kg at a power density of 189.5 W/kg and maintains capacitance retention of 78.2% after 5000 cycles at 8 A/g. The strategy proposed here provides a good way to synthesize nanostructured Co3O4, a candidate for constructing high-capacitance energy storage devices.
