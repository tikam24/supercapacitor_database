A Li4Ti5O12 nanorod/carbon nanotube/reduced graphene oxide self-supporting and flexible composite film is prepared through a facile vacuum filtration approach. The Li4Ti5O12 nanorod/carbon nanotube/reduced graphene oxide composite film electrode is able to deliver a reversible specific capacity of 207 mAh g−1, and retains a capacity retention of 90% after 1000 cycles at the current density of 0.35 A g−1. Moreover, a hybrid lithium ion capacitor consisting of an active carbon/carbon nanotube/reduced graphene oxide composite film cathode and the as-prepared Li4Ti5O12 nanorod/carbon nanotube/reduced graphene oxide composite film anode presents high energy density of 67 Wh kg−1 and power density of 1589 W kg−1, respectively. The hierarchically structured Li4Ti5O12 nanorod/carbon nanotube/reduced graphene oxide composite film electrode is lightweight, flexible, conductive additive/binder free, which is a highly desirable feature for wide applications in the wearable energy storage devices.
