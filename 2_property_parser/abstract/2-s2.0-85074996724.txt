Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) with two dimensional (2D) nanosheets have attracted special attention for supercapacitor application due to their exceptional large surface area and high surface-To-volume atom ratios. However, their electrochemical performance is greatly hindered by their poor electrical conductivity. Herein, we report a 2D nanosheet nickel cobalt based MOF (NiCo-MOF)/reduced graphene oxide heterostructure as an electrode material for supercapacitors. The NiCo-MOF 2D nanosheets are in situ grown on rGO surfaces by simple room temperature precipitation. In such hybrid structure the MOF ultrathin nanosheets provide large surface area with abundant channels for fast mass transport of ions while the rGO conductive and physical support provides rapid electron transport. Thus, using the synergistic advantage of rGO and NiCo-MOF nanosheets an excellent specific capacitance of 1553 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 is obtained. Additionally, the as synthesized hybrid material showed excellent cycling capacity of 83.6% after 5000 cycles of charge-discharge. Interestingly, the assembled asymmetric device showed an excellent energy density of 44 W h kg-1 at a power density of 3168 W kg-1. The electrochemical performance obtained in this report illustrates hybridization of MOF nanosheets with carbon materials is promising for next generation supercapacitors.
