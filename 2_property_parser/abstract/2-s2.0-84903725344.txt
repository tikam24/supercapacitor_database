A peculiar architecture of a novel class one dimensional β-Ni(OH)2 nanorods synthesized by an optimized surfactant-free aqueous precipitation route has been lucratively exploited to fabricate highly efficient microporous electrodes for supercapacitors. These fabricated electrodes comprised of a highly porous overlay of interconnected nanoscale units with rod-shaped profile which terminates into jagged-like morphology. The surface area of these nanorods was found to be ~91m2g-1. This architecture transcribes into a superior cycling performance (capacitance of 1150Fg-1 was achieved) with more than 99% of the initial capacitance being retained after 5000 charging/discharging cycles. Their outstanding intercalation/de-intercalation prerogatives have also been exploited to fabricate supercapacitor coin cells which reveal a significant power density of 52kWkg-1 and energy density of 4Whkg-1 with extremely fast response time of 1.2ms. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.
