This paper aims to develop a high-performance electrode material for supercapacitor applications. A facile hydrothermal, environment-friendly, and low-cost technique was used for synthesizing hexagonal (2H) phase MoS2. Structural and morphological characterizations were studied using XRD, Raman spectroscopy, SEM, EDX, and HRTEM. The results demonstrate that high-quality flower-like of MoS2 microsphere that provides a very high surface area has been well synthesized. Symmetric supercapacitors (SCs) based on MoS2 with Ag-doped reduced graphene oxide (RGO-Ag) additive was fabricated and electrochemically tested using three alkaline hydroxides electrolyte namely NaOH, LiOH, and KOH. The effect of different electrolytes has been investigated using multichannel galvanostats where cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments were carried out. Despite the weak alkaline nature of LiOH electrolyte, it reveals convenient electrochemical performances with a relatively large specific capacitance of 120 F.g-1 at 5 mV.s-1, a high power density of about 20 KW.Kg-1, and excellent durability with 90.3 % capacitance retention after more than 10000 cycles. The high-power capability and retention rate of the MoS2 based SC indicate that it is a candidate material for high-performance SCs applications.
