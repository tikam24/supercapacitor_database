In situ hydrogenation of orthorhombic molybdenum trioxide (α-MoO <inf>3</inf>) nanowires has been achieved on a large scale by introducing alcohol during the hydrothermal synthesis for electrochemical energy storage supercapacitor devices. The hydrogenated molybdenum trioxide (H <inf>x</inf>MoO<inf>3</inf>) nanowires yield a specific capacitance of 168 F g<sup>-1</sup> at 0.5 A g<sup>-1</sup> and maintain 108 F g<sup>-1</sup> at 10 A g<sup>-1</sup>, which is 36-fold higher than the capacitance obtained from pristine MoO<inf>3</inf> nanowires at the same conditions. The electrochemical devices made with H<inf>x</inf>MoO<inf>3</inf> nanowires exhibit excellent cycling stability by retaining 97% of their capacitance after 3000 cycles due to an enhanced electronic conductivity and increased density of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the MoO<inf>3</inf> nanowires. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.
