Graphene-based materials are intriguing from the perspective of fundamental science and technology because they are non-toxic, chemically and thermally tolerant, and mechanically robust. Graphene exhibits superior electrical conductivity, high surface area and a broad electrochemical window that may be particularly advantageous for their applications in energy storage devices. In addition, graphene can be prepared in the form of a colloidal suspension with adjustable solubility and thus is suitable for printing applications and offers both transparency and good conductivity at the same time. In this review, applications of graphene in solar cells, batteries, supercapacitors and fuel cells are summarized with the latest developments. Furthermore, graphene as a conductive ink for printed electronics is also discussed. Â© 2011 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
