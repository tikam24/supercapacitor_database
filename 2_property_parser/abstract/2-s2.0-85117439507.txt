Hydroxides of transition metals are interesting electrode materials for energy storage due to their unique properties as well as creating a synergistic effect. In this project, seven electrodes with hydroxides of transition metals were made. Among them, CoNiFeTH@G electrode (graphite electrode modified with hydroxides of cobalt, nickel, and iron) had the best performance. In the following, the iron salt used in the alloy was changed and nitroprusside (NP) salt, which is a vasodilator drug, was used to make the CoNiDH-NP@G electrode (graphite electrode modified with hydroxides of cobalt and nickel and sodium nitroprusside (SNP)) by electrochemical method. Based on the results, the presence of nitroprusside increased the specific capacity. Since the performance of the supercapacitor is highly dependent on the morphology of the electrode surface, high performance of that can be due to the formation of a special crystal structure. CoNiDH-NP@G electrode was characterized by different techniques. The X-ray diffraction spectra show that the average size of the particles formed on the graphite electrode is 18.98 nm. Accordingly, this supercapacitor at the current density of 4.4 A/g had a specific capacity of 1340 F/g which is a very good capacity compared to similar research. All of the above, as well as the cost-effectiveness of the materials used and the ease of making the electrode, indicating that the introduced electrode can have high performance and efficiency in energy storage systems.
