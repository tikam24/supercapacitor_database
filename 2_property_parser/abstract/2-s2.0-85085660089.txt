In practical settings, the supercapacitor is often used as the storage battery, which is composed of several supercapacitor cells in series. In order to accurately estimate the State of Charge (SoC) in the supercapacitor cell module, an equivalent model of supercapacitor cell module is invoked, which is expected to reflect the characteristics of supercapacitor cell module, especially the self-discharge characteristics during standing. The results of parameter identification directly affect the model accuracy. Hitherto, most supercapacitor equivalent models have been proposed for supercapacitor cells, but if the module equivalent model is characterized by connecting many equivalent models of supercapacitor cells in series, it would lead to the cumulative errors and the additional errors, which would incur errors in the parameter identification, and directly affect the model accuracy. The paper aims to obtain the accurate equivalent model parameters, the supercapacitor cell module is regarded as the object, the three-branch equivalent circuit model is established for the supercapacitor cell module, a discussion is given on the parameter identification methods about Circuit Analysis Method (CA) and Recursive Least Squares Method (RLS). This paper establishes the Simulink simulation model for the multi-method parameter identification of supercapacitor cell module, the simulation and analysis are performed to illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of CA and Circuit Analysis-Recursive Least Squares Method (CA-RLS). Then, it proposes a parameters identification method of the equivalent circuit model of supercapacitor cell module based on Segmentation Optimization (SO). The effectiveness of SO is verified by simulation and error analysis, the results indicate that SO can more effectively reflect the charging characteristics and self-discharge characteristics of the supercapacitor cell module. In particular, the comprehensive error in the static self-discharge phase is 0.28%, which is 6.83% and 0.64% lower than CA and CA-RLS, respectively.
