Photo-supercapacitors (PSCs) are environmentally friendly devices that directly convert and store solar energy into electricity and have a high potential to eliminate the need for grid electricity for a sustainable future. In this study, lithiated (Li+) biphenol-based disulfonated poly (arylene ether sulfone) random copolymer (BPS) membrane has been successfully integrated into graphitic carbon nitride/zinc oxide nanowire composite-based PSC to increase the efficiency and to offer simpler and more cost-effective designs. It has been observed that after UV illumination specific capacitance (Cp) and energy density (Ed) increased 2.8 and 2.7-fold, respectively, indicating that the PSC with BPS-Li+performs approximately 3 times better under illumination than dark conditions. Furthermore, at elevated temperatures and 100% relative humidity Cp and Ed of the PSC increased to 23.61 Fg−1 and 47.22 Whkg−1 at 85 °C, respectively. This enhancement can be linked to the temperature-boosted ionic conductivity of the membrane.
