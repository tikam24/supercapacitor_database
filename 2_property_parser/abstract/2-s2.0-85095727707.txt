A pillared nickel-based MOFs, Ni2(bdc)2P (bdc is the 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid and P is dabco(1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]-octane)), and Zn-doped pillared (Zn/Ni)2(bdc)2P are synthesized and their electrochemical properties as an electrode material are firstly evaluated. The Ni2(bdc)2P electrode material has a specific capacity of 177.6C g−1 and 48C g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and 10 A g−1, respectively. Much higher specific capacities of 298.5C g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and 104 C g−1 at 10 A g−1 are obtained for the (Zn/Ni)2(bdc)2P, indicating good rate capability. In addition, the pillared (Zn/Ni)2(bdc)2P also possesses more stable cycling performance than the pillared Ni2(bdc)2P. The excellent electrochemical performance of both Ni2(bdc)2P and (Zn/Ni)2(bdc)2P can be attributed to their 3D framework structure with open channels and large surface area, hierarchical porous structure and high electrical conductivity. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) (Zn/Ni)2(bdc)2P//AC is assembled to evaluate the practical application of (Zn/Ni)2(bdc)2P electrode. The assembled ASC possesses a high energy density of 12.2 W h kg−1 at a power density of 371.5 W kg−1 and excellent cycling performance. Furthermore, two assembled ASCs in series are used to light up a red and a yellow light-emitting diode (LED).
