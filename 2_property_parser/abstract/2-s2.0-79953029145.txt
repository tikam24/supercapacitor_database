In this section, syntheses and applications of zirconia and ruthenium oxide nanotubes are described. The zirconia nanotubes are synthesized by the anodization of zirconium metal and the template synthesis method using carbon nanotube, anodic porous alumina membrane, porous polycarbonate membrane, and organic molecules as templates. Several applications of the zirconia nanotubes are also presented. Furthermore, the ruthenium oxide nanotubes are synthesized by the template synthesis method using anodic porous alumina membrane and the homogeneous precipitation method. Luminescence property and application to supercapacitor of the ruthenium oxide nanotubes are presented. Synthesis of ruthenium metal nanotube is also introduced.
