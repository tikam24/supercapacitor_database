The caCTF-1 derived from CTF-1 by carbonization is introduced into the multi-step heat treatment carbon repaired pC-C3N4 to form a 3D interconnected nitrogen-rich carbon structure (caC@pC). Through carbon repairing process, the obtained pC-C3N4 has an extended π-conjugate plane and it is closely interconnected with the nitrogen-rich caCTF-1, thereby accelerating charge transfer, improving energy storage, and exhibiting high specific capacitance (535.8 F·g−1 under 1 A·g−1) and good rate performance. In addition, by employing MOF with diphenyl semicarbazide structural unit as a precursor, NiCoTe2 is prepared by a simple hydrothermal process, which exhibits high redox activity with a high specific capacitance of 2006.0 F·g−1 at 1 A·g−1 and good cycle stability. The hybrid supercapacitor NiCoTe2//caC@pC HSC is assembled with caC@pC as the negative electrode and NiCoTe2 as the positive electrode. When the power density is 790.05 W·kg−1, it exhibits a high energy density of 50.84 Wh·kg−1 and high cycle stability. After 25,000 cycles, the capacitance retention rate is 87.88%.
