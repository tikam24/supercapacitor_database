An alternative and effective route to prepare conducting polyaniline-grafted reduced graphene oxide (PANi-g-rGO) composite with highly enhanced properties is reported. In order to prepare PANi-g-rGO, amine-protected 4-aminophenol was initially grafted to graphite oxide (GO) via acyl chemistry where a concomitant partial reduction of GO occurred due to the refluxing and exposure of GO to thionyl chloride vapors and heating. Following the deprotection of amine groups, an in situ chemical oxidative grafting of aniline in the presence of an oxidizing agent was carried out to yield highly conducting PANi-g-rGO. Electron microscopic studies demonstrated that the resultant composite has fibrillar morphology with a room-temperature electrical conductivity as high as 8.66 S/cm and capacitance of 250 F/g with good cycling stability.
