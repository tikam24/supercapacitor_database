The nanoporous honeycomb like binary α-Sm2S3 material is used as supercapacitor electrode. The soft chemical, successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method is employed for the α-Sm2S3 thin film growth. The synthesised films are characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for structural and morphological studies. Electrochemical behaviour is studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The observed specific and interfacial capacitance (Cs and Ci) values in 1 M LiClO4-propylene carbonate (PC) electrolyte are 294 F g-1 and 0.0238 F cm-2, respectively at the scan rate of 5 mV s -1. An electrode stability of 89% retained after 1000 cycles. A galvanostatic charge-discharge and EIS study show ideal capacitive behaviour of α-Sm2S3 electrode. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
