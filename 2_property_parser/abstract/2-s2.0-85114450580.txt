AB2O4-type binary-transition metal oxides (BTMOs) of CuCo2O4 and MnCo2O4 were successfully prepared on ordered macroporous electrode plates (OMEP) for supercapacitors. Under the current density of 5 mA cm−2, the CuCo2O4/OMEP electrode achieved a specific capacitance of 1199 F g−1. The asymmetric supercapacitor device prepared using CuCo2O4/OMEP as the positive electrode and carbon-based materials as the negative electrode (CuCo2O4/OMEP//AC) achieved the power density of 14.58 kW kg−1 under the energy density of 11.7 Wh kg−1. After 10,000 GCD cycles, the loss capacitance of CuCo2O4/OMEP//AC is only 7.5% (the retention is 92.5%). The MnCo2O4/OMEP electrode shows the specific and area capacitance of 843 F g−1 and 5.39 F cm−2 at 5 mA cm−2. The MnCo2O4/OMEP-based supercapacitor device (MnCo2O4/OMEP//AC) has a power density of 8.33 kW kg−1 under the energy density of 11.6 Wh kg−1 and the cycle stability was 90.2% after 10,000 cycles. The excellent power density and cycle stability prove that the prepared hybrid supercapacitor fabricated under silicon process has a good prospect as the power buffer device for solar cells.
