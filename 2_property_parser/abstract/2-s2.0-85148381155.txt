Recent research has focused on the search for new electrode materials to improve the specific capacitance of supercapacitors. Conductive polymers and metal oxides have been extensively tested as electrode materials for supercapacitors. Incorporating both conductive polymers and metal oxides into a composite provides excellent results for the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors. In this present work, we have fabricated the nanoscale α-NiMoO4 particles that enwrapped on electronically conducting polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) based on Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/Poly(vinyl) pyrrolidone (PVP) for supercapacitor applications. The different concentrations of PVA/PVP with α-NiMoO4 loaded polymer nanocomposites were developed by using a solution casting method. All the polymer nanocomposites have been subjected to Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transforms Infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and electrochemical studies. The prepared PNCs surface morphology has been acquired as a non-uniform rod-like structure. The electrochemical performances of the prepared PNCs have been investigated and the resultant value of the maximum specific capacitance is 15.56 F g−1 for 1 wt % of α-NiMoO4 nanoparticles(NPs) loaded polymer blended electrode at a scan rate of 5 mVs−1. The prepared PNCs exhibit 97.12% of columbic efficiency studied by using two electrode systems at room temperature in an aqueous electrolyte solution of 3 M KOH. From these investigation, it has been revealed that the PVA/PVP/α-NiMoO4 composites could be portable and flexible electrodes for energy storage applications.
