In this study, S, N co-doped graphene-based electrodes were synthesized by a one-step, environmentally friendly and low−Cost method known as Yucel's method in the solutions consisting of different concentration ratios of sulfuric and nitric acids and different cycles in the certain potential range for the first time in the literature. The prepared S, N co-doped graphene-based electrodes were characterized by spectroscopic, microscopic and electrochemical methods. In electrochemical characterization, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used. The supercapacitor performances were examined by cyclic charge-discharge tests of the electrodes in the specified supporting electrolyte solution. Areal capacitance values varied from 71.48 mF.cm−2 to 893.2 mF.cm−2 at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in the prepared electrodes.
