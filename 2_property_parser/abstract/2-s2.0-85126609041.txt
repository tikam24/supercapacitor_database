Supercapacitors play a vital role in the storage of energy devices and in systems that assist in energy conversion. Currently, researchers focus on developing advanced materials to improve overall performance of the supercapacitors, and extensive efforts have been made towards scientific and technological advancements. The continuous progress towards composite materials hold enormous potential to circumvent present limitations, such as better architecture design of the materials to make it more durable, long cycle life, higher energy density, higher power density and better stability as well as being environment friendly to combat climate change. To address these limitations, the scope of advance electrode materials composed of copper nanostructures for the supercapacitor applications has been concentrated on this review. Apart from the versatile nature of copper oxide, it can be easily mixed with polarized liquids and polymers, thereby has very stable physical and chemical properties. We highlighting the numerous copper oxide hybrid metal oxide electrodes available to develop such supercapacitors. Consequent sections covered recent studies on composite nanostructures and electrodes based on copper oxide combined with organic compounds. Furthermore, we concluded the review and presented the challenges and prospects of this promising field.
