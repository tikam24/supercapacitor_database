In this work, three-dimensional (3D) nanostructures of polyaniline nano-sheets, nano-particles, nano-nets and nano-flowers were synthesized with valine, sulfuric acid, sodium acetate and L-phenylalanine as doping acids, respectively. Conductive polyaniline with 3D nanostructure was proven as an excellent energy storage material because of its superior electrical properties and unique structure. The porous structure not only greatly improved the charge transfer efficiency and reduced the resistance, but also improved the cycle stability and energy storage of the electrode material. Polyaniline nano-flowers doped with L-phenylalanine (PANI-NF) showed a maximum specific capacitance of 580 F g−1(I=0.5 A g−1), a maximum energy density of 53.9 Wh kg−1, and excellent cycle stability at high current density.
