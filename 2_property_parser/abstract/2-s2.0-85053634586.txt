We have synthesized cobalt metal-organic framework (Co-MOF) at different temperatures through solvothermal route as metal-organic frameworks which can be used for supercapacitors. The effect of synthesizing temperature on Co-MOF’s structure and porous behavior were analyzed with various characterization techniques like X-ray diffraction, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface analyzer, scanning electron microscope, and transmission electron microscope. The charge storage performance of the as-prepared Co-MOF’s was carried out in 3 M KOH. The results proved the excellent redox behavior of Co-MOFs, and a maximum specific capacitance of 952.5 F g−1 was obtained for Co-MOF/150 (synthesized at 150 °C) at a current density of 0.25 A g−1. The higher specific surface area and micropore of Co-MOF/150 significantly heightened the electrolyte ion transport during the electrochemical performance. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
