Presently, a porous carbons (PC) derived from Metal-organic framework (MOF) has shown ewith excellent electrochemical performance for supercapacitor due to their special morphology and richly micro/mesoporous structure. Here a new activated PC (APC) derived from Al-MOF is reported via facile combined carbonization and KOH treatment. It is found that the morphology of Al-MOF is influenced by the different compositions of solutions. The shape of Al-MOF was gradually transformed from spherical to hexagonal by the addition of DMF content. The carbon electrode provides an advantageous specific capacitance (SC) of 342 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 in the 3 electrode system. Correspondingly, it also exhibits excellent durability with superior capacitance retention of 96% after 150,000 cycles at 50 A g-1. This work suggests a new strategy to prepare electrode material with extreme performance for energy storage.
