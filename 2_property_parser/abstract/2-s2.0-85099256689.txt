Carbon nanocoil is spiral/helix like nanostructure. It is a unique nanocarbon having high surface area, electrical conductivity, low resistivity, capacitance, stretchability, and mechanical characteristics. The nanocoil nanostructure is useful in capacitors, sensors, electronics, and energy devices. The review essentially focuses on progress to date in field of polymer/carbon nanocoil nanocomposites. Variety of polymers including polyaniline, polypyrrole, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), poly(dimethyl siloxane), poly(vinyl alcohol), poly(ethylene glycol), etc., were reinforced with carbon nanocoil through solution, in-situ, electropolymerization, blending, peel off, and other techniques. Emerging features and applications of polymer/carbon nanocoil nanocomposite in technical fields of supercapacitor, fuel cell, damping, and antibacterial materials are also considered.
