In this work, we convert coal extraction waste into functional carbon fiber electrodes. Detailed experimental and modeling studies reveal the importance of surface properties and dramatic increase (162%) in capacitance with adding small amount of 0.01 M K3Fe(CN)6 to 6 M KOH (referred to as mixed electrolyte). Molecular dynamics (MD) modeling reveals that ferricyanide ions in the mixed electrolyte contributed to the increase of both pseudocapacitance and electric double layer capacitance. With the mixed electrolyte, a symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) using coal-derived carbon fiber mat electrodes can deliver energy density as high as16.8 Wh kg–1 at a power density of 362.2 W kg–1, with excellent cycling stability (∼95.83% at 10,000 cycles). This study provides an insightful perspective on the strategic efforts of nonthermal usage of coal as we transition to renewable energy economy. Additionally, the mixed electrolyte effect and MD modeling results shed light on carbon electrodes from biomass, such as lignin, for various electrochemical energy devices.
