The massive global consumption and discarded face masks drove by the ongoing spread of COVID-19. Meantime, incineration and landfill discarded face masks would result in severe environmental pollution and infectious hazards. Herein a suggestion to recycle polypropylene waste masks into CNTs by an environmentally friendly and high-added value disposal process was proposed, and which was prepared as supercapacitor electrode materials for energy storage attempting. The CNTs were prepared from waste masks by catalysis pyrolysis with Niâ€“Fe bimetallic catalysts. Especially, the bamboo-like structure CNT was obtained with Ni/Fe molar ratio is 3. This structure owned a high specific capacitance compared to other standard CNTs. Its specific capacitance could reach 56.04 F/g (1 A/g) and has excellent cycling stability with a capacitance retention rate of the material is 85.41% after 10,000 cycles. Besides, the assembled capacitor possesses a good energy density of 4.78 Wh/kg at a power density of 900 W/kg. Thus, this work provides a sustainable and cost-effective strategy for disposing waste masks into high-valuable CNT, and their potential application for supercapacitors was also studied and exploited. It would provide a new idea for recycling and utilizing other polypropylene wastes such as medical devices. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
