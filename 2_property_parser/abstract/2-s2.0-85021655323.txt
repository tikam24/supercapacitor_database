The inﬂuence of ultrasonic irradiation in pre-cavitation and cavitation mode on the properties of wood activated carbon is investigated. The objects of research were 10-15 % dispersion of activated carbon in degassed water which was radiated in an ultrasonic reactor with frequency 42 kHz and variable power and time of inﬂuence. The total number of surface acid groups was determined by Boehm’s method. The proportion of hydrophilic pores was determined by the amount of water absorbed by the pressed sample of activated carbon with a long maceration. Supercapacitors consist of electrodes made of 40—63 um fractions of initial and dried after the activated carbon modiﬁcation and of 30 % the aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide. It has been shown that ultrasound radiation can not only grind particles of carbon, but also change the properties of surface effectively, this applies, in particular, to the composition and content of oxygen-containing surface groups. The total amount of surface oxygen groups on the carbon surface is inversely proportional to the specific capacitance of supercapacitors. The increase of speciﬁc capacity correlated with increase of bio-carbonic materials hydrophilicity. The optimum mode of ultrasound treatment was determined, speciﬁc capacity of supercapacitors was increased from 52 F/g to 151 F/g.
