Subunits of one-dimensional (1D) NiCo2-xFexO4 nanotube and two-dimensional (2D) Ni2CoS4 nanosheet are integrated on carbon textile substrates through a hydrothermal method. With a unique structure and efficient usage of active materials, the prepared NiCo2-xFexO4/Ni2CoS4/carbon textile nanocomposites possess a high specific capacitance of 2220 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and 91.8% of capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles. The prepared nanocomposites as positive electrode and the biomass carbon as negative electrode are assembled to form an asymmetric supercapacitor, with a maximum energy density of 62.63 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 160.82 W kg-1. The supercapacitor possesses an outstanding cycling stability of 81.6% retention after 10,000 cycles. Tailor-made hollow structure, which could provide sufficient space for the electrode to buffer volume changes due to expansion/contraction of the active material, holds a potential application for high-performance supercapacitors. The superior performance of the hierarchical nanocomposites makes it a promising electrode material for practical application in supercapacitors.
