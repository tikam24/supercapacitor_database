As an emerging urban public transport, energy storage trams are the major electricity consumers in the city. Most of the trams use distributed power supply, and the traction substations are derived from the urban medium-voltage network. Therefore, it is of great significance to establish a model that can predict the energy consumption distribution at each site. Existing models mostly use regression methods, focusing on analyzing the correlation between various influencing factors and energy consumption, and forecasting the total energy consumption of tram lines through a large amount of statistical data. Analyze the complete operation process of the tram between the stations, use MATLAB/Simulink to build its operation model, simulate the operating conditions of the tram, and obtain the traction energy consumption model of the energy storage tram. Regarding the vehicle air conditioning energy consumption model, the vehicle energy consumption model was further obtained. By verifying the model with the existing operating data, the error is within the allowable range, which has certain practicality and provides a basis for energy-saving analysis.
