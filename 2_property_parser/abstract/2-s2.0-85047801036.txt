SnO2/Co3O4 (BTMO) with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposite were synthesized by co-precipitation method to determine its electrochemical properties for the betterment of Supercapacitor applications. The XRD pattern of BTMO/rGO nanocomposite shows tetragonal rutile and spinal cubic structure. The XRD peak of BTMO/rGO nanocomposite is comparatively broader than the BTMO nanocomposite and bare nanoparticles due to the presence of high surface area rGO. From the SEM image it is observed that the BTMO nanocomposite has comparatively larger particles than the bare nanoparticles and BTMO/rGO nanocomposites. Hence, the BTMO/rGO nanocomposite has alteration in surface to volume ratio and improved electron conductivity were observed with increased integral area and current such as 2.5117 × 10−4 A/s and 3.1686 × 10−4 A respectively in CV behavior, when it is compared to BTMO nanocomposite and bare nanoparticles. The BTMO/rGO nanocomposite also has an increased specific capacitance value of 317.2 F/g at 1 A/g. The increased specific capacitance value of BTMO/rGO nanocomposites are mainly due to the synergistic effect between SnO2/Co3O4 and rGO. Hence, it may be responsible for the improved electron conductivity, due to the free diffusion pathway for the fast ion movement and also it has easily ion accessibility nature to the storage sites makes the materials with both the electric double layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance behavior. Hence, BTMO/rGO nanocomposite would be a promising candidate material for energy storage supercapacitor application.
