We report a combination method of microwave-assisted chemical reduction with NaBH4 and electrochemical deposition to fabricate high-performance polyaniline/bulk abundant Ti3+ self-doped TiO2 nanotubes (PANI/MR-TiO2NTs) for supercapacitor. At the current density of 0.6 A g−1, PANI/MR-TiO2 NTs nano-composite exhibits high specific capacitance of 1084 F g−1, which is the best value based on TiO2 nanotubes (TiO2 NTs) or its composites with PANI (PANI/TiO2 NTs) using as supercapacitor electrodes as we know. With the current density increased by 30 times, the specific capacitance of PANI/MR-TiO2 NTs still remains at 616 F g−1 denoting good rate capability. PANI/MR-TiO2 NTs also shows a good long-life cycle performance with a low reduction of 13.3% of the initial capacitance after 2000 cycles at a high current density of 18.0 A g−1. The EIS measurement reveals that compared with PANI/TiO2 NTs, PANI/MR-TiO2 NTs exhibits lower solution resistance and charge-transport but higher pseudocapacitance (CPE1), indicating a superior electron transport ability and charge-transfer rate. The data indicate great promise for the PANI/MR-TiO2 NTs used as a supercapacitor electrode.
