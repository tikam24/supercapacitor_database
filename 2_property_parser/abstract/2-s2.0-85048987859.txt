This Paper analyses the integration of a super capacitor with fuel cell in grid connected mode. A super capacitor is a fast charging and discharging device. In a fault condition super capacitor will discharge and maintain the voltage of the DC bus. In this paper a mathematical model of the fuel cell power system is designed. A super capacitor and a grid are modeled in PSCAD simulation environment. The fuel cell power system is integrated with the grid using model predictive control technique. A fault is applied at the DC bus to study the impact of integrating a super capacitor with the fuel cell. The simulation results show the super capacitor can maintain the voltage at DC bus at fault condition.
