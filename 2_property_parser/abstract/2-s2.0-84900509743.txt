In this work, dandelion-like NiCo2O4 mesoporous microspheres were uniformly assembled from slim nanowires via a large-scale and template-free method. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of NiCo 2O4 microspheres was determined to be about 35.2 m 2 g-1 with dominant pore diameter of 10.9 nm and narrow size distribution of 8-20 nm. Furthermore, the electrochemical properties of NiCo2O4 microspheres were evaluated by cycle voltammetric (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) measurements. The results demonstrated that the NiCo2O4 microspheres exhibited high specific capacitance (372 F g-1 at 1 A g-1), good rate capability, and excellent cycling stability (88.3% retention after 2000 cycles). In principle, this synthetic approach could be extended for the fabrication of other microstructure materials for promising electrode candidates in energy storage devices.
