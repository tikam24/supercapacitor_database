In the present work, a one-step synthetic method was implemented in an effective way to synthezise aminophenol-modified zinc oxide (Ap-modified ZnO). The as-prepared sample was characterized by various spectral and analytical tools. The electrochemical performance of Ap-modified ZnO demonstrated that the electrode material can be used in supercapacitors. The pronounced capacitive behaviour of Ap-modified ZnO was proved by cyclic voltammetric studies (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge test (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques in 1 M H2SO4. The newly developed Ap-modified ZnO electrode displayed an excellent gravimetric capacitance (Cg) of 427 Fg−1 at current density of 1 mA cm−2, which may be attributed to its unique structure, existence of abundant pores and large electroactive sites, supportive for facile electron, ion transport and enhanced electrical conductivity.
