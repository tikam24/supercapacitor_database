The major challenges in power systems are driven by the energy shortage and environmental concerns, namely facilitating the penetration of renewable energy and improving the efficiency of the renewable powers. Due to the variable nature of renewables, the generated power profile may not be able to match the load requirement. Accordingly, much attention has been focused on the development of energy storage technologies to guarantee renewable power penetrations. Recently, advances in the supercapacitor (SC) have made the SC and battery hybrid energy storage systems (HESS) technically attractive. Compared with other energy storage technologies the principal advantages of SC are: the high power density, high cycling life, and high peak current handling capacities. However, SC is also deficient in low energy density. The battery is characterised by large energy density but low in power capacity. In the microgrid systems, high-frequency power fluctuations will cause a significant degree of battery power cycling. This, in turn, has been shown to lead to a significant reduction in battery service life. Therefore, the concept of the SC and battery hybrid scheme is proposed. A case study of the HESS based on a microgrid is introduced in this paper. A simplified microgrid system is established to test the performance of the proposed design.
