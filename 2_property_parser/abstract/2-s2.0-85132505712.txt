Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted extensive attention as electrode material for supercapacitor in view of their rich active sites and excellent chemical compatibility. However, the insufficient conductivity and easy agglomeration make the directly use of MOFs show impoverished electrochemical performance. Thus, constructing unique nanostructured electrode materials of MOFs or their derivatives remains a great challenge. Here, the ZIF-67-derived CoSe2/Ni3Se4 nanosheets anchored vertically on the MXene nanosheets substrate, effectively alleviating the agglomeration of CoSe2/Ni3Se4 nanosheets. Meanwhile, the introduction of highly conductive MXene enhances the holistic conductivity, and in turn prevents the restacking of MXene flakes. Furthermore, the close combination between CoSe2/Ni3Se4 nanosheets and MXene nanosheets promotes faster charge transfer rate and improves the durability of the structure. Consequently, as an electrode materials for supercapacitors, the honeycomb-like MXene@CoSe2/Ni3Se4 achieves a high specific capacitance (283 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1) and an outstanding capacitance retention rate with 80% after 5000 cycles. The design strategy proposed by this work provides a novel method for developing high-performance two-dimensional nanostructured electrode materials.
