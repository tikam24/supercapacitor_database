In this research, we focused on the design and construction of spherical-like samarium cobalt oxide (SCO) decorated on hexagonal tungsten sulfide (WS) nanostructure for use as a robust energy storage electrode material. The prepared materials underwent comprehensive physicochemical characterizations. The SCO/WS composite exhibited a BET surface area of 3.92 m2 gâˆ’1, indicating a high surface area available for electrochemical reactions. The effective interaction between SCO and WS led to improved electrochemical performance, as evidenced by a high specific capacitance of 1196.7 F/g at 1.0 A/g and good cycle stability of 96.57% when compared to standalone SCO and WS electrodes in a three-electrode cell. Moreover, the fabricated symmetric supercapacitors (SSCs) using the SCO/WS/NF//SCO/WS/NF configuration, which demonstrated superior performance. The SSC device delivered a high power density of 699.78 W/kg within the 1.4 V working potential window. Additionally, the constructed device successfully powered a red and yellow light-emitting diode (LED) when connected in series, highlighting its practical application potential. The exceptional performance of the SCO/WS composite can be attributed to the strong interaction between the rare earth, transition metal, and sulfide ions. This interaction significantly enhanced the redox activity, rate capability, and cycling stability of the electrode material. As a result, our findings provide a promising avenue for the development of high-performance supercapacitors suitable for electric automobiles and portable electronic displays and pave the way for next-generation supercapacitor applications.
