To improve the driving performance of the electric vehicles, batteries or ultracapacitors (UCs) are frequently preferred in the energizing systems. In hybrid structures with multiple supply sources, an energy management system (EMS) is needed to improve the system efficiency, and to provide the optimum power sharing between a battery and a UC. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of the Jaya optimization method for the urban use of the EMS of an ultralight electric vehicle powered by battery/UC. The performance of the proposed method is compared with dynamic programming (DP) that is one of the global optimization methods and particle swarm optimization (PSO) that is one of the other heuristic methods for real-time applications. The simulation results show that Jaya-EMS approached 3.1% to the DP, which yields the optimum result with respect to the total energy loss. In addition, the proposed method yields a loss of less than 1.9% from the PSO-EMS. If all the above situations are considered, the proposed EMS method has less lossy alternative solution for the real-time applications.
