Nowadays the control and automation persuade the severe economic issues on expertise high rating equipments. Especially in distribution sector, it is required to provide elevated quality electrical services to improve the most significant issues of Power Quality (PQ) called Voltage Profile at load end, namely, Voltage Sags and Swells. The drive system failures, tripping of equipment, industrial, and domestic equipment shutdowns are the foremost occurrences by PQ issues. To attain a superlative dynamic capability of a distribution system, a Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR) is connected in series to it for voltage reparation of sensitive loads. The voltage sags and swells are mitigated with the help of Ultra-Capacitor (UCap) which will give more superlative characteristics because of low energy density, high power, and an efficiency of 85â€“90%. The UCap is selected because of the finest energy source device in terms of allowing for long life, safety in operation time, wide temperature range, and less maintenance cost. A bidirectional DC to DC converter is used to integrate the DVR and UCap which results a stiff dc-link voltage and compensates the temporary voltage sag and voltage swell. The Simulink model has been designed for the proposed system with PI Controller and Fuzzy Logic Controller for enhancing power quality in distribution sector and it is compared.
