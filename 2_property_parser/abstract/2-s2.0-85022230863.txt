An innovative one-pot approach for the scalable production of novel interconnected reduced graphene oxide (IC-RGO) is demonstrated, and we name it the streamlined Hummers method (SHM). The formed IC-RGO represents a new type of three-dimensional platform, promising for many graphene related energy, environmental and medical applications.
