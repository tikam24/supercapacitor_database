A carbon/CoFe2O4 composite was synthesized by precipitation method. The morphology of the composite was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectra, and vibrating sample magnetometry. The electrocapacitive behaviors of the composite has been studies by cycle voltammogram and galvanic charge/discharge. The size of the nanoparticles carbon composite of CoFe2O4 was uniform and 209 nm. Due to a high percent of carbon, electrochemical measurements showed electrical double layer mechanism. Specifically, the carbon/cobalt ferrite electrode exhibited high specific capacitance of 102.5 F g−1 at a current density of 0.16 A g−1, and high rate capability with 30% retention of capacitance even up to 20 A g−1, and excellent cycling stability with 81.5% retention of the initial capacitance after 6000 charge/discharge cycles, supporting that the carbon cobalt ferrite composite electrode could be a potential candidate for supercapacitor application.
