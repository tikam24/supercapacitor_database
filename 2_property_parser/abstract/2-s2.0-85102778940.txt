Aqueous rechargeable batteries (ARB) offer reasonably higher energy density and cycle life than their non-aqueous counterparts. Yet, the bottleneck is a limited choice of positive electrodes coupled with low-rate capability and inadequate cycle life. We report here a wet chemical approach to synthesize in-situ three-dimensional (3D) ‘cotton-ball’ shaped porous iron-nickel sulfide (FeNi2S4) (henceforth referred to as PINS) as a diffusion-controlled ARB electrode. It shows a high specific capacity of 177 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 vs Pt in the alkaline electrolyte with excellent rate capability (89 mA h g−1 at 40 A g−1) and ultra-long cycle life (10,000 cycles). Furthermore, a pouch-type full-cell ARB (FeNi2S4//AC) delivers an energy density of 56.7 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 871.5 W kg−1 with high cycling stability (10,000 cycles). The present study offers a straightforward and efficient approach for developing nanostructured transition metal sulfide-based cathode materials for practical ARB.
