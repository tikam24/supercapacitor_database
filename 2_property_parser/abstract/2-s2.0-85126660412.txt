NiCo2S4 nanotubes were fabricated time-dependently and hydrothermally at 180 Â°C and investigated electrochemically as electrode materials. The results show that the as-synthesized NiCo2S4 nanotube as anode for lithium ion battery deliver an initial specific capacity of as high as 1780 mAh g-1 at the current density of 100 mA g-1 with poor cycling stability and rate capacity, indicating the potential pseudocapacitive features of NiCo2S4 nanotube. Furthermore, the NiCo2S4 nanotube electrode for supercapacitor demonstrates superior electrochemical performance with superb cycling stability and rate capability, testifying NiCo2S4 nanotube as pseudocapacitance due to the surface diffusion-controlled mechanism of charge storage. These results enable a promise of NiCo2S4 nanotube as intercalation pseudocapacitance rather than as anode for lithium ion battery
