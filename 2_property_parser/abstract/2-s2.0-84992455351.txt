An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was assembled by using an activated carbon as positive electrode and WO3 nanowire as negative electrode, and its electrical performances were tested in voltage windows ranging from 0 to 1.5 V. A high specific capacitance of 51 F•g−1 could be achieved at the current density of 0.25 A•g−1. Moreover, the ASC displays a good cycling stability with 86% of capacitance retention after 800 cycles, its energy density can be up to 11.9 Wh•kg−1 at the power density of 210 W•kg−1, and remains 7.7 Wh•kg−1 at a power density of 1250 W• kg−1. The excellent electrical performance is perhaps due to the crystal orientation of (001) planes for the WO3 nanowire, which favors the rapid reaction between W(VI) and H+ cations. This aqueous asymmetric WO3//AC supercapacitor is promising for practical applications due to its easy preparation of WO3.
