Hierarchical mesoporous nickel hydroxide (α-Ni(OH)2) nanoparticles have been prepared by an inexpensive, simple, and green co-precipitation technique. The α-Ni(OH)2-activated carbon (AC) composite films have been fabricated onto a stainless steel substrate by the doctor blade method through the incorporation of AC into α-Ni(OH)2 nanoparticles. The electrochemical performance of the composite electrode material is evaluated by varying the concentration of AC in the composite. As compared to pure α-Ni(OH)2, the α-Ni(OH)2–AC composite exhibits a more specific capacitance of 436 Fg−1 and noteworthy long-term capacitance retention of 81% after 1500 cycles. The α-Ni(OH)2–AC composite electrode materials will be the potential candidates for fabrication of next generation electrochemical supercapacitors.
