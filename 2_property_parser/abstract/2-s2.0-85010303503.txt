In this study, a pulse-mode electrochemical deposition technique was employed to deposit dense and homogeneous Ni nanoparticles on the three-dimensional graphene network (3DGN) as the catalysts for growing the vertical aligned one-dimensional carbon nanofibers (CNFs) to fabricate the full-carbon hybrid nanoarchitecture of CNFs/3DGN for the supercapacitors. When tested as electrode for a supercapacitor, the CNFs/3DGN hybrid nanoarchitecture demonstrated to possess a large surface area and showed an excellent specific capacitance of 59.28 F g−1 at a current density of 0.17 mA cm−2, also displayed good cycle stability with capacitance retention of 93.9% after 10,000 cycles in 6 M KOH electrolyte.
