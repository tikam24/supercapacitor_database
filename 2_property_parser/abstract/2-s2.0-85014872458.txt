Fiber-shaped supercapacitors (FSCs) are a promising candidate as power source or energy storage unit in wearable/stretchable electronics. However, it is still a significant challenge to design FSCs with excellent electrochemical performance while maintaining good flexibility to meet the requirement of wearable/stretchable electronics. Here, a flexible all-solid-state asymmetric FSCs has been rationally designed and successfully prepared with coaxial human hair/Ni/Graphene/MnO2 fiber as positive electrode and coaxial human hair/Ni/Graphene fiber as negative electrode. Importantly, the as-obtained FSCs show extraordinary flexibility and outstanding electrochemical performance with a wide potential window (1.8 V), excellent rate capability (up to 20,000 mV s−1), fast frequency response (τ0=55 ms), high volumetric energy density (1.81 mWh cm−3), long cycle stability. With the facile fabrication technology and low-cost raw materials, this strategy not only provides a reference for the construction of high-performance flexible FSCs, but also paves a new way to explore the next-generation portable/wearable energy storage devices.
