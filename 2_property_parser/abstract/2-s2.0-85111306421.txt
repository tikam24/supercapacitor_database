The metal oxides nanocomposites spanned as high-capacity electrode materials in both battery and supercapacitor applications. In this paper, Graphene composite with metal oxide has been explored as a platform for energy storage devices by decorating graphene sheets with SnO2 nanostructures. Facile and efficient synthesis process has been used to prepare the composites of SnO2-nanocrystal/graphene-nanosheets i.e. chemical reduction (GNs/SnO2) which was simply based on the reduction of graphene oxide (GO) by Sn2+ ion. X-ray diffraction (XRD). The mean crystallite size was calculated to be about 4.0 nm. Dielectric properties show the decrease of dielectric loss with increase in frequency and at higher frequency it shows the constant behavior. AC conductivity of GNs/SnO2 nanocomposite was calculated as 4.3*10-4 (ohm m)-1. The electrochemical analysis shows the GNs/SnO2 nanocomposite has the capacitance of 1.06348 mF at the scan rate of 50 mV/sec which was evaluated from the cyclic voltammetry.
