This paper presents an efficient energy management scheme for an islanded DC microgrid included with vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) with supercapacitor based hybrid energy storage system for a 3-phase variable load profile. The analysed islanded DC microgrid system is composed with sources such as lithium-ion batteries, fuel cell, supercapacitors, and vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB), along with involved DC/DC (buck, boost, and bidirectional) and DC/DC converters. In this paper, an adaptive proportional plus integral (PI) control based energy management scheme is implemented. The main theme on which the performance of this system is analysed is the state of charge of energy storage devices (VRFB, supercapacitor, and Li-ion battery) and the overall efficiency of system. The voltage spikes due to sudden change in load have been regulated by using supercapacitor and Li-ion battery with VRFB. To minimize the fuel consumption, an adaptive proportional plus integral control strategy is being used. In this paper the modelling and simulations are carried out by using MATLAB/SIMULINK software to demonstrate minimizing the effect of load fluctuations with the help of supercapacitor and batteries by synchronizing it to the DC microgrid.
