Supercapacitors have been extensively used in power storage and power management components for its outstanding performances in recent years. In this paper, the novel 3D rose-like β-Ni(OH)2/rGO nanohybrid is prepared as supercapacitor electrode through one-step hydrothermal method. The prepared Ni(OH)2/rGO nanohybrid exhibited a rose-like morphology with a diameter of about 3 μm, which were assembled from sheets of nickel hydroxide and reduced graphene oxide layered overlap uniformly. In this state, graphene distributed uniformly around the interior of nanohybrid instead of acting as a substrate. The results of electrochemical test show that the specific capacity of Ni(OH)2/rGO nanohybrid could achieve to 802 F/g at 2 A/g. Furthermore, when the current density is 8 A/g, the capacitance still preserved 94.55% after 1000 times constant current charge and discharge. It displays superior cycle stability. Additionally, 3D Ni(OH)2/rGO nanohybrid could be simply transmitted to NiO/rGO nanohybrid. These works are of crucial importance for the research and development of novel supercapacitor electrodes and power storage components.
