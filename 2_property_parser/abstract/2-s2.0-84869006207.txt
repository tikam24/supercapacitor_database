A wireless sensor node (WSN) powered by the energy harvested from an ambient electric field was demonstrated. A WSN consists of an energy harvester, rechargeable battery (or supercapacitor) to store harvested energy, electronics to measure the parameters of interest, and a wireless transmitter and receiver. By the principle of induction, a current proportional to the electrical field, scaled by the transformer ratio, is induced in the secondary coil. The large voltage generated at the CT output corresponding to the secondary current is rectified and clamped using Schottky diodes and Zener diodes, respectively. The clamped voltage is filtered by the output capacitor to produce a dc-voltage. The rectified dc-voltage can be used to drive a load. To extract the maximum power from the harvester, the rectified voltage must be regulated to the MPP. Also, the voltage must be boosted up to charge a battery. To increase the power harvested, a full-wave rectifier or a transformer with a lower turns ratio can be use.
