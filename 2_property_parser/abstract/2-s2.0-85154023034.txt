The sprayed carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and cobalt hydroxide (Co(OH)2) were successfully prepared by a simple low-temperature hydrothermal method as supercapacitor electrode. With the hydrothermal time of 120 min, highest specific capacitance of 1154.01 F/g at a scan rate of 20 m Vsâˆ’1 in 3 M KOH was observed. The CNTs/Co(OH)2 hybrid structures demonstrates an enhanced specific capacitance and the best cycling stability with capacitance retention of 82% after 1000 cycles. Thus, this study exhibited that the CNTs/Co(OH)2 has great potential application as electrode materials for electrochemical supercapacitors.
