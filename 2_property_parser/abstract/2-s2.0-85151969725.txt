Bimetal–organic frameworks (BMOFs) have attracted considerable attention as electrode materials for energy storage devices because of the precise control of their porous structure, surface area, and pore volume. BMOFs can promote multiple redox reactions because of the enhanced charge transfer between different metal ions. Therefore, the electroactivity of the electrodes can be significantly improved. Herein, we report a NiCo-MOF (NCMF) with a three-dimensional hierarchical nanorod-like structure prepared using a facile solvo-hydrothermal method. The as-prepared NCMF was used as the positive electrode in a hybrid pouch-type asymmetric supercapacitor device (HPASD) with a gel electrolyte (KOH+PVA) and activated carbon as the negative electrode. Because of the matchable potential windows and specific capacitances of the two electrodes, the assembled HPASD exhibits a specific capacitance of 161 F·g−1 at 0.5 A·g−1, an energy density of 50.3 Wh·kg−1 at a power density of 375 W·kg−1, and a cycling stability of 87.6% after 6000 cycles. The reported unique synthesis strategy is promising for producing high-energy-density electrode materials for supercapacitors.
