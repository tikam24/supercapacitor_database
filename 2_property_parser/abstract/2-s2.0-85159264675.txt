Large pore volume, exceptional chemical stability, and a high specific surface area are all characteristics that can be achieved in metal organic frameworks (MOFs), and unique class of porous materials if the constituents are carefully chosen. In this study, the electrochemical characteristics of a CoTe/ZIF-67 nanocomposite produced using a straightforward hydrothermal process for usage in supercapacitor systems are analysed. Surface investigation is used to learn about the synthesised materials' surface morphology, and structural analysis has demonstrated that the generated ZIF-67 nanoplates have crystalline structure with particle sizes less than 500 nm, and that they are surrounded by the CoTe and CoTe/ZIF-67 composites. The electrochemical characteristics of the samples were CV, GCD and EIS. Specific capacitance of 2021 Fg−1, energy density of 49.4 W hkg−1, power density of 791 W kg−1, and good cycle stability (remaining at 92% after 5000 cycles) are all indicators that CoTe/ZIF-67 nanocomposite possesses high electrochemical performance, as shown in this study. According to the findings, CoTe/ZIF-67 may serve as a novel electrode material in supercapacitor electrodes, allowing for the creation of high-performance and stable devices for energy storage.
