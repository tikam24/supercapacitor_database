The past decade has witnessed increasing attention in the synthesis, properties, and applications of one-dimensional (1D) conducting polymer nanostructures. This overview first summarizes the synthetic strategies for various 1D nanostructures of conjugated polypyrrole (PPy), polyaniline (PANI), polythiophene (PTh), poly(p-phenylenevinylene) (PPV) and derivatives thereof. By using template-directed or template-free methods, nanoscale rods, wires/fibers, belts/ribbons, tubes, arrays, or composites have been successfully synthesized. With their unique structures and advantageous characteristics (e.g., high conductivity, high carrier mobility, good electrochemical activity, large specific surface area, short and direct path for charge/ion transportation, good mechanical properties), 1D conducting polymer nanostructures are demonstrated to be very useful for energy applications. Next, their applications in solar cells, fuel cells, rechargeable lithium batteries, and electrochemical supercapacitors are highlighted, with a strong emphasis on recent literature examples. Finally, this review ends with a summary and some perspectives on the challenges and opportunities in this emerging area of research. Â© 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
