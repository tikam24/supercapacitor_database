Hexagonal hydrohausmannite plates with lateral length of several microns and thickness of about 30 nm were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method. The plates are composed of several porous thin sheets and each sheet is formed by self-assembled nanoparticles of about 50 nm. Electrochemical tests reveal that the sample has a high specific capacitance (222.4 F/g at 0.1 A/g) and good rate capability (66.7 F/g at 6 A/g), which can be attributed to its unique structure. The capacitance retention reaches 74.5% after 2500 cycles at a current density of 3 A/g. Interestingly, its performance becomes even better after cycling because of the formation of birnessite. These results show that hydrohausmannite may have great potential applications in supercapacitor electrode material. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.
