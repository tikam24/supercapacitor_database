This paper presents a cyber energy system design for electric vehicle applications. The aim is to show more autonomy with superior efficiency of electric vehicles. In this paper, we have used four main energy sources: Battery, super capacitor, fuel cell and solar panel. Moreover, we use in this architecture a low voltage 12V battery to supply the accessories in the vehicle. This battery can be recharged by solar panel put on the vehicle roof. Thus, we proposed in this study for the first step, a design of cyber energy system for electric vehicle applications then, we present an approach to model energy sources in vehicles and finally provide the simulation results.
