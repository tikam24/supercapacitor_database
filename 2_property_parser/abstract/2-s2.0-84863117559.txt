In this communication, we explore the cobalt based metal-organic-frameworks (Co-MOF) as a promising material for supercapacitors. The doctor bladed Co-MOF film exhibits a good pseudocapacitor behavior with the specific capacitance up to 206.76 F g -1. The electrochemical redox switching is reversible perfectly for a long run which leads to the loss of only 1.5% in capacitance for 1000 electrochemical life cycle stability test.
