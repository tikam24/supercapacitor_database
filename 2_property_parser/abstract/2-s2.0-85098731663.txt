One of the important binary metal oxides, hetarolite (ZnMn2O4) was synthesized using the extract of Corallocarpus Epigaeus. The green synthesized nanoparticles have showed the tetragonal crystalline phase of ZnMn2O4 with the average crystalline size of 32 nm. The FT-IR study revealed the majorly presenting the Zn-O and Mn-O vibration peaks in the specimens. The band gap energy for the obtained nanoparticles through the Taucâ€™s plot method is 1.45 eV. The electron microscopic images revealed the particulate nature of the green synthesized ZnMn2O4 nanoparticles with an average particle size of 35 nm. Cyclic Voltammetry technique verified and validated the electrochemical properties of the prepared ZnMn2O4 nanoparticle. The examined electrochemical studies revealed the capacitance behavior as 380 F/g in aqueous electrolyte solution. The above studies has provided a splendid efficiency and proven that ZnMn2O4 can withstand as a prominent material for the super capacitor applications.
