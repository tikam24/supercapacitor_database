The use of supercapacitors in a battery system could be a solution to eliminate the need for short-term frequent replacement of batteries and to reduce size, resources and maintenance fees during frequency regulation (F/R) of a power grid. Furthermore, the electrochemical properties of graphene are different from those of commercial active carbon and still need additional verification in order to be applied to large-scale electrodes. In this study, we used spray-dry processed 3D crumpled graphene in order to improve energy density, which is directly connected to both the performance and the inhibition of electrode active-material restacking. We evaluated the charge/discharge electro chemical performance of graphene electrodes under various process conditions for the purpose of designing a proper electrode composition and electrolyte. As a result, the power density of graphene electrodes could be maintained between 17 kW/kg and 26 kW/kg by decreasing the binder content from 10 wt% to 5 wt%. In addition, the electrical capacity per volume was increased to 500% by using a 2-roll press, and the power density was confirmed to have been improved by more than 370% when SBPBF4 was used instead of TEABF4. Finally, we suggest an efficient process for the manufacture of large-scale electrodes. This process will allow entire of the capacitance and the electrochemical stability of a graphene supercapacitor.
