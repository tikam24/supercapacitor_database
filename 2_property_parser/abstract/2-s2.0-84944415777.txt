In this paper, we report CoNi2S4 nanowire arrays (NWAs) on 3D nickel foams based on an anion-exchange reaction which involved the pseudo Kirkendall effect. Due to the low electronegativity of sulfur, CoNi2S4 NWAs exhibit higher conductivity compared with Ni-Co oxide NWAs when used as active materials in supercapacitors. The electrochemistry tests show that these self-supported electrodes are able to deliver ultrahigh specific capacitance (1250 F g-1 at a current density of 5 mA cm-2), together with a considerable areal capacitance (2.5 F cm-2 at a current density of 5 mA cm-2), Furthermore, a capacitance retention of 72% after 5000 charge-discharge cycles at 5 mA cm-2 is obtained, indicating the excellent cycling stability of the CoNi2S4 NWA/nickel foam electrode. The superior electrochemistry capacity demonstrates that CoNi2S4 NWAs are promising electrode materials for supercapacitor applications.
