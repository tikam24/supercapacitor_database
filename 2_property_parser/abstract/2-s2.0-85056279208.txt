We report on the combination of several functional properties in semiconducting films interfaced to a wide range of electrolytes, such as modulation of the electrical conduction in the electrolyte-gated transistor configuration and electrochemical energy storage (supercapacitor). The monolithic integration of the transistor and supercapacitor functions generates the TransCap device.
