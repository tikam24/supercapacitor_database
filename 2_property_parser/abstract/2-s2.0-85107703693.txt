Supercapacitors (SCs) have attracted extensive attention due to their ultrahigh power density, fast charging/discharging rate, excellent electrochemical stability and environmental friendliness. Currently, the main commercial electrode materials for SCs are carbon materials in term of low cost, excellent conductivity, large specific surface area and good electrochemical stability. Recently, various dimensional carbon materials including zero dimensional (0D) carbon materials (nanosphere, dot etc.), 1D carbon materials (nanotube, nanofiber etc.), 2D carbon materials (nanosheet) as well as 3D carbon materials have been developed for SCs. Carbon materials with different spatial dimensions have their unique properties when used as the electrode materials for SCs. In this review, recent advances in the fabrication of different dimensional carbons for SCs are summarized. Several key issues for enhancing the electrochemical properties of carbon-based SCs and some mutual relationships among various influence parameters are reviewed, and challenges and perspectives in this field are also discussed.
