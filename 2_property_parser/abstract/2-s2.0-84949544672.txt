The unique properties of graphene, such as high electrical conductivity, high thermal conductivity and excellent mechanical properties, have made graphene not only a gelator to self-assemble into the graphene hydrogel with extraordinary electromechanical performance, but also a filler to blend with small molecules and macromolecules for the preparation of multifunctional graphene-based hybrid hydrogels, which fully exploits the practical applications of traditional hydrogels. Herein, recent progress in graphene-based hybrid hydrogels has been reviewed and the whole article can be divided into four sections. In the first section, a brief introduction on the development of graphene as well as the significance of the fabrication of graphene-based hydrogels is devoted. In the second section, the graphene-based hybrid hydrogels are roughly divided into three categories: graphene hydrogel, graphene/small molecules and graphene/macromolecules hybrid hydrogels according to their composition. The preparation methods of various hydrogels, as well as the mechanisms of their gelation process and the hydrogels' performance, are also presented. With the presentation of graphene/small molecules hybrid hydrogels, emphasis is given to the development of graphene-based supramolecular hydrogels, while with the presentation of graphene/macromolecules hybrid hydrogels, graphene-based intelligent hydrogels contributed a much higher proportion. In the third section, the applications of graphene-based hybrid hydrogels in supercapacitor, water purification, controlled release drug, microfluidic switch, catalyst support, etc., are introduced respectively. Finally, challenges in the development of graphene-based hydrogels are summarized briefly and future prospect is given as well.
