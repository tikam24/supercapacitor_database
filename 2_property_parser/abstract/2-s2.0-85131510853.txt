Transition metal sulfide (TMSs) combined with conductive carbon matrixes have been developed and show potential for use as energy storage devices. In this report, gel like active material of cupper-manganese-sulfide (CMS) loaded on reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/carbon nanotube (CNTs) (CMS@GCs) composites were synthesized using a one-step hydrothermal method which produced a porous structure after freeze-drying. The CMS@GCs have globular morphology assembled from Nano sheets/tube with porous structure. The as-prepared CMS@GCs composites showed a surface area of 29.96 m2/g which possessed excellent electrochemical properties. The CMS@GCs’ were investigated as super capacitor electrodes having symmetrical coin cell structure. The electrochemical results revealed that the CMS@GCs active materials exhibited the specific capacitance of 174 Fg−1 at 0.1 Ag−1 (maintains 68 Fg−1 at 1 Ag−1) and they delivered the energy density of 5.5 Whkg−1 with power density of 48 Wkg−1. Additional stability testing showed that the cell displays lifetime with 78.94% retention after 2,500 charge/discharge cycles in coin cell. These results demonstrated that the synthesized material fabricated in present study can be expected to be a promising as an electrode material for potential application in energy storage devices.
