In the following paperwork a photovoltaic power supplying system for telecommunication equipment has been modelled. The power supplied equipment can be radio communication equipment, active equipment for optic networks and other. The model is developed in LabView. The chosen capacities of the energy storage elements (ESE) can be determined by using the developed model. The model can be used to determine if the capacity of the ESE is enough or not.
