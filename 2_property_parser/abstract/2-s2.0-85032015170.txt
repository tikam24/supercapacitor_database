The first report, on tuberose surface morphology of strontium hydroxide (Sr(OH)2) has been achieved on stainless-steel (SS) substrate in the form of thin film by easy, economical efficient and less time consuming successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) technique at room temperature. X-ray diffraction analysis reveals polycrystalline nature of film with orthorhombic crystal structure. Fourier Transmission Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and Raman analyses reveal the composition and phase purity of the active material. The morphology of the prepared sample was characterized by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM), Higher Resolution Transmission Emission Microscopy (HR-TEM) which confirms the tuberose morphology of the Sr(OH)2 thin film. Furthermore, tuberose surface architecture has been successfully utilized as supercapacitive electrode with high specific capacity of 413C g−1 in 1 M NaOH aqueous electrolyte at 2 Ag−1 current density. Also, the electrode has emerged with 45.95 Whkg−1 of energy density and 2.6 kWkg−1 as power density at 2 Ag−1 current density.
