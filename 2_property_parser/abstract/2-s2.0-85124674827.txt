A simple, cost-effective, scalable, one step synthesis method for obtaining a hydrophilic poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) sponge using an effervescence template and surfactant is provided here. The porosity of the sponge can be tuned (∼25% to ∼60%) by varying the yeast concentration, volume, and curing temperature. A confined dispersion for standard deviation of pore parameters from statistical analysis shows good repeatability, homogeneity, and convergence of sponge porosity and pore area. A contact angle study shows the hydrophilic nature of the obtained sponge with the introduction of the surfactant. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirms the single-step process with the absence of alive yeast cell constituents with the synergetic effect of PDMS backbone and hydrophilic moieties alone. In-situ tomography compression study shows little deviation (∼4%) in pore structure for before and after load applied conditions of sponge with good resilience. The sponge exhibits negative piezopermittivity with applied pressure due to the densification of pores leading to dipole cancellation. The bare sponge is applied to capacitive sensing for large pressure range sensing (sensitivity ∼0.03 kPa-1, < 45 kPa) and modified as a resistive pressure sensor (sensitivity ∼0.3 kPa-1, < 10 kPa; ∼0.02 kPa-1, <50 kPa), to human-machine interfacing, and as supercapacitor (∼11.43 mF/g) electrode.
