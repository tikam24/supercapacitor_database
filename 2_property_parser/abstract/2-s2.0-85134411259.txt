The novel class of porous materials, metal-organic-framework (MOF) emerges as an efficient electrode material for energy storage applications. MOFs affirms to be effective materials for the fabrication of electrodes with unique structural diversity owing to its porosity, high surface area, and strong pore dimension control. MOF based electrodes for supercapattery are widely explored and are destined to be adapted by electrochemical energy storage devices (EEDs). Therefore, a comprehensive overview of MOFs is an utmost requirement to influence advanced research in materials for energy storage. In this regard, MOFs with dual metal (binary metal oxide), composites derived from carbon/metal oxide or graphene, and hybrid structures are promising candidates for energy storage applications and therefore discussed in this review. Numerous techniques for the synthesis of MOFs composites as well as enhancement in MOFs functionality and its utilization for energy storage devices are discussed. Later we state various MOF properties for energy storage applications. Furthermore, various electrochemical techniques such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) for various MOFs are reviewed.
