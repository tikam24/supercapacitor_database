A hybrid electric vehicle simulation tool (IBZ-Simulator) has been developed at the Fuel Cell Institute of the University of Applied Sciences Esslingen to study the fuel economy potential of a Fuel Cell hybrid urban bus. In this paper, the fundamental architecture of the FC urban buses was described, as well as the control strategy to manage the power flow between the different elements of the drive train. A comparison of the hybrid with the conventional type and ICE-hybrid type is performed, and important factors relating to the vehicle efficiency (accessory loads, vehicle mass, Fuel Cell system ramping rate and battery capacity) were assessed. The using of supercapacitor (or ultracapacitors) as peak power buffer has been investigated. Copyright Â© 2009 SAE International.
