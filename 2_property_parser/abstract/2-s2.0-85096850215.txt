Design and engineering of low-cost and high-efficiency functional carbonaceous electrode materials for supercapacitor has attracted increasing interest in energy storage. Herein, N-doped porous carbon block (N-PCB) was prepared via self-deposition of pyrolysis gas derived from directly degradation of typical resin monomer 3-aminophenol (AP) under the assistance of ZSM-5. In this monomer self-deposition approach, the rich pore channels of ZSM-5 promote the capture and deposition of pyrolysis gas from AP on ZSM-5 and the acidic surface of ZSM-5 catalyzes the pyrolysis gas conversion to carbon. This method realizes conversion of AP to porous carbonaceous material simply by grinding of AP and ZSM-5 mixture followed by routine pyrolysis treatment, without utilization of solvent and polymerization of resin, which simplifies the operation process and enhances the environmental friendliness. The prepared N-PCB replicates the bulk morphology of ZSM-5 and has a high specific surface area and a certain of nitrogen content, which provides favorable conditions for improving electrochemical performance.
