A conventional hydrothermal deposition process is used to graft ruthenium oxide (RuO 2) nanoparticles onto carbon nanofibers (CNFs). The obtained RuO 2 nanoparticles have an average diameter of 2nm and are homogenously distributed on the CNF surfaces. Supercapacitors are fabricated using the resulting RuO 2 grafted CNFs nanocomposite as the electrodes. The existence of CNFs leads to reduced contact resistance among the RuO 2 nanoparticles and provides a network for fast electron transport, which then contributes to enhanced electrochemical performance. The enhancement is proportional to the RuO 2 content and can be as high as 638% at a high sweep rate of 200mVs -1, at which a capacitance is 155Fg -1. Stability of the RuO 2-grafted CNF capacitor is also demonstrated by subjecting the capacitor to a potential sweep at 500mVs -1 for 1000 cycles. Furthermore, the RuO 2 grafted CNF capacitor exhibits a very short relaxation time of 0.17s, which is desirable for high rate charge and discharge. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
