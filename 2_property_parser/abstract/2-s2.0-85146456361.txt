A flexible laterally-configured electrochromic supercapacitor was designed and fabricated through a fully-solution process. The laterally-configured transparent conductive electrode PEDOT:PSS-AgNWs/PET was prepared by spraying technology and then the magenta electrochromic polymer (PProDOT) and gel electrolyte were cast sequentially onto the laterally-configured electrode. The as-prepared device exhibits alternative color changes between magenta and transparent within the potential range −0.9 V and 0.9 V, and the electrochromic behavior is retained even if bent, proving its excellent flexible display properties. As expected, a “ZJUT” patterned flexible display device works clearly when applying driving potentials to the two circuits simultaneously. In addition, the asymmetric device (PProDOT||PEDOT:PSS) integrates excellent electrochromic and electrochemical energy storage properties in terms of high optical contrast of 59.5 %, large coloration efficiency of 423.5 cm2·C−1, fast switching time (7.4 s and 3.9 s), reasonable areal capacitance of 2.15 mF/cm2 at a current density of 0.05 mA/cm2 and robust cyclic stability which can retain 85.65 % and 77.42 % of its initial optical contrast and capacitance even after 1000 cycles of mechanical deformation. Hence, this work demonstrates the flexible laterally-configured electrochromic supercapacitor has great potential in the portable and wearable display fields, such as smart watches and electronic paper.
