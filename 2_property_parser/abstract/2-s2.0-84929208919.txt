A combination of electrospinning and a frozen section has been used to gradually lower the scale of the active materials, thus effectively avoiding nano-reunion, to a certain extent, during electrode fabrication. The as-fabricated electrode-based supercapacitor possesses high electrochemical capacitance and good stability. Our results demonstrate a universal top-down route for the controllable fabrication of homodisperse nanoparticle electrodes for use in high performance electrochemical devices. This journal is
