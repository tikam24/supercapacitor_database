Preservation of environment and energy conservation has caused the advancement of Electric Vehicles (EVs), Energy Storage System (ESS) plays an essential role in superior and durable performance of EV. In peak power demand condition battery will have to provide more power in a short duration. For which battery is not entirely capable of. To meet the peak power demand of the vehicle battery is combined with Ultracapacitor (UC). UC has a high power density than the battery. In this paper, battery/UC HESS is discussed. Ultracapacitor voltage is kept higher than the battery voltage in this Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS). Battery will only provide power when ultracapacitor voltage goes below battery voltage. By using adequate power management, maximum system performance along with less power consumption can lead to extended battery life.
