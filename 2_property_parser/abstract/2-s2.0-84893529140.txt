This paper investigates the effects on voltage stability of a converter based STATCOM integrated with a Supercapacitor into a low voltage (LV) distribution network. An Average Model of a STATCOM was simulated, where the IGBT Voltage-Source Converter was represented by equivalent controlled voltage sources. The STATCOM was modeled in the Real Time Digital Simulator's (RTDS ®) dedicated software RSCAD. Subsequently, Power Hardware- in- the -Loop (PHIL) tests were executed with an impedance load as Hardware under Test (HuT) in order to validate the system's performance. Simulations and PHIL experimental results are outlined to demonstrate the STATCOM's contribution on nodal voltage regulation, whereas the integration and control of an energy storage system (ESS) such as a Supercapacitor is further discussed throughout this paper. © 2013 IEEE.
