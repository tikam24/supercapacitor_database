The NiS2/reduced graphene oxide(3D rGO) composite with the 3D porous structure was successfully synthesized via a facile one-step solvothermal method using a suitable soft template. The surface morphology, valence of the elements and electrochemical performance of the samples were characterized by FESEM, TEM, XPS and the electrochemical workstation. The results show that the NiS2/3D rGO composite has a three-dimensional stacked pore structure of graphene and high specific surface areas. The specific surface area is 57.51 m2•g-1. Electrochemical measurements show that the NiS2/3D rGO microsphere electrode reveals amazing pseudocapacitive properties with high specific capacitance (1 116.7 F•g-1 at current density of 1 A•g-1) and a favorable rate capability (74.5% from 1 to 5 A•g-1), Moreover, the specific capacitance remains 91.2% of its initial value after 1 000 cycles at current density of 4 A•g-1. Therefore, NiS2/3D rGO composite can be used as a promising electrode material for the supercapacitor.
