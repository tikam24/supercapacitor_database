There is an intense interest for utilization of self-assembly to fabricate high-density hybrid films for practical energy storage. In this paper, high-density (1.5 mg/cm2) hybrid Na0.44MnO2 nanorod (average diameter 70 nm and average aspect ratio 10)/active carbon films (with area of 9 cm2) were fabricated by direct toluene/water interfacial assembly, achieving the binder-free supercapacitor electrode with advanced electrochemical performance. The density of interfacial films can be precisely controlled by regulating the dosage of assembled nano-units. We showed that the hybrid films can be easily transferred onto a Ni foam and subsequently use as binder-free supercapacitor electrode. The electrochemical testing of film electrode exhibited a high specific capacitance of 189.6 F/g and good capacitance retention at high charge-discharge rates as well as cycling stability. It is suggested that this direct interfacial assembly approach paves the way for the fabrication of 2D functional nanomaterials, particularly useful in practical applications, such as advanced supercapacitor electrode.
