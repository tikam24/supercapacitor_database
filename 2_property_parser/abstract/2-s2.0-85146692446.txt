Recent developments in embedded electronics require the development of micro sources of energy. In this paper, the fabrication of an on-chip interdigitated all-solid-state supercapacitor, using porous gold electrodes and a PVA/KOH quasisolid electrolyte, is demonstrated. The fabrication of the interdigitated porous gold electrode is performed using an original bottom-up approach. A templating method is used for porosity, using a wet chemistry process followed by microfabrication techniques. This paper reports the first example of an all-gold electrode micro-supercapacitor. The supercapacitor exhibits a specific capacitance equal to 0.28 mF·cm−2 and a specific energy of 0.14 mJ·cm−2. The capacitance value remains stable up to more than 8000 cycles.
