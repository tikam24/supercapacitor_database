Hybrid supercapacitors have been studied as a next generation energy storage device that combines the advantages of supercapacitors and batteries. One important challenge of hybrid supercapacitors is to improve energy density (8.9–42 Wh/kg) with maintaining excellent power density (800–7989 W/kg) and cyclability (98.9% after 9000 cycles). Herein, we demonstrate an approach to design hybrid supercapacitors based on LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 (NMC)/activated carbon (AC) cathode and AC anode (NMC/AC//AC). The NMC/AC//AC hybrid supercapacitors shows outstanding electrochemical performances due to the enhanced energy and power densities. These findings suggest that the NMC/AC cathode is an effective method for high performance hybrid supercapacitors.
