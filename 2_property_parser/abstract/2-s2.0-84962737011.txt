An innovative propulsion and power supply topology for Personal Rapid Transit is presented. The concept is based on application of linear induction motor for propulsion and hybrid power supply using Contactless Energy Transfer supported by a supercapacitor energy storage. Proposed solution is based on the application of linear induction motor as a propulsion and inductive contactless energy transfer.
