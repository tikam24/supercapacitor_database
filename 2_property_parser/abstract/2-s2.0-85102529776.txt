Green synthesis has grabbed appreciable attention to eliminate the negative effects associated with various chemical processes. Due to the unparalleled electrical, mechanical, thermal and excellent physical properties, graphene, as the thinnest two-dimensional material with high surface area, has the unfathomable potential in the domain of green chemistry in terms of both synthesis and application. In this regard, we present an overview of the research progresses on the greener synthesis of graphene, including micromechanical exfoliation, chemical reduction of graphene oxide (GO), chemical vapor synthesis and popping of GO. Meanwhile, various applications of graphene pertinent to sustainable developments, such as energy storage, catalysis, electrochemistry, fuel cell, supercapacitor and biomedicine have also been highlighted.
