New materials can be developed using a known compound with enhanced properties modifying and controlling its microstructure, morphology, and density of defects. In this work, a new material was produced by the addition of ionic liquid (IL) to the poly(o-methoxyaniline) (POMA) conductive polymer, in the form of esmeraldine salt. The polymer impregnated with IL was tested as an electrode for use in supercapacitors. The results show that the charge storage properties of the materials are dependent on the length of the alquil substituent of imidazolium ring of ionic liquid cation. The best results, obtained by the addition of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium triflate IL to the polymer, improved electrical charge storage and electrochemical stability, making the material a promising electrode for supercapacitor devices. This compound has specific capacitance of 205 F/g, five times larger than pure POMA and was stable for 3000 cycles of charge/discharge experiments carried out at 1.0 A/g.
