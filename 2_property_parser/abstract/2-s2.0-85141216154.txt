A very simple, convenient and low-cost method has been developed to obtain carbon-dispersed FeS as the anode material for supercapacitors. Firstly a uniformly dispersed FeS precipitate was made from the reaction of FeSO4 and Na2S in a thick starch slurry. In the presence of FeS particles, the carbonization of starch takes place at a temperature of about 200 °C, giving the FeS/C composites high electrochemical performance. The prepared FeS particles are uniformly surrounded by amorphous carbon layers. It shows the highest specific capacitance of 275.65 F g−1 when the molar ratios of FeS:C is 1:5 and the current density is 30 mA cm−2. After 1000 cycles, the specific capacitance retention was about 90% of the initial value, with good long-term cycle stability. Additionally, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was assembled using the FeS/C-1:5 composite electrode and an Ni(OH)2 electrode. This ASC exhibited maximum power density and energy density of 19,600 W kg−1 and 40.96 Wh kg−1, respectively. It is testified that both Fe(II) and S(II) can be oxidized, suggesting the FeS/C is a promising electrode material for supercapacitors with high performance.
