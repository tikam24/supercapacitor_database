A new 3D binder-free ternary Fe–Ni–Co oxide nanoflake arrays on Ni foam was synthesized using a simple facile two-step process. The as-prepared supercapacitor electrode showed excellent electrochemical performance, such as a high specific capacitance of 867 F g−1 and excellent cycling stability (92.3% capacitance retention after 10,000 charge–discharge cycles). In addition, an aqueous hybrid asymmetric supercapacitor device based on this material exhibited high energy density of 40 Wh kg−1 and excellent capacitance retention of 87.4% after 5000 cycles. This outstanding electrochemical performance highlights the potential of this 3D mesoporous ternary mixed-metal oxide electrode in commercial high performance supercapacitors.
