In this work, a facile method has been developed to prepare 3D foam-like MnO2film/multilayer graphene film/Ni foam (MnO2/MGF/NF) hybrid structure for flexible supercapacitors. In this method, the MGF is grown by ambient pressure chemical vapor deposition on NF and the MnO2is fabricated by an improved chemical bath deposition under neutral condition. In hybrid structure, the MGF serves as a buffer layer to improve the conductivity of MnO2and enhance the interface contact between MnO2and NF. The hybrid structure can give full play to their respective advantages of each component and has high electrical conductive, large surface area, and close interface contact. The flexible supercapacitor based on MnO2/MGF/NF hybrid structure exhibits good electrochemical performance, extraordinary flexibility and superior cycle lifetime. Area (volumetric) capacitance of the flexible supercapacitor reaches 714 mF/cm2(14.28 F/cm3). Maximum volumetric energy (power) density reaches 0.634 mWh/cm3(126 mW/cm3). Furthermore, the flexible supercapacitor has high cycle life and exhibits minimal change in capacitance under dynamic bending.
