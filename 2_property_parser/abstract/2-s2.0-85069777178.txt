On account of being simple and cost effective, the precipitation route has been frequently employed in material synthesis towards electrochemical supercapacitor applications. Herein, we describe the synthesis of zirconia nanoparticles via simple and affordable precipitation method. Crystal structure and phase purity of prepared particles were examined using XRD which clearly reveals the formation of cubic ZrO2. SEM studies on ZrO2 particles confirm the formation of stone like particles. The electrochemical performance of ZrO2 electrodes was tested using three electrode cell set up in 2 M H2SO4 aqueous solution. The Faradic peaks in CV curves and non-linear charge-discharge profile in GCD technique reveals that the ZrO2 particles exhibit the pseudocapacitance nature of the energy storage process. ZrO2 electrodes deliver a maximum specific capacitance of 264 F g-1 at a specific current of 2 A g-1. Moreover, ZrO2 electrodes could reveal energy density of 23W h kg-1 at power density of 700W kg-1. These superior electrochemical features suggest that ZrO2 nanoparticles are a suitable electrode material for electrochemical capacitors.
