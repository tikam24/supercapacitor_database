α-MnO2·nH2O as electrode material for supercapacitor was prepared by chemical coprecipitation. The material was characterized by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), surface area analysis (BET) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The results show that the material has amorphous structure with particle diameter range from 40 nm to 50 nm, and the BET specific surface area reaches 160.5 m2/g. Electrochemical characterizations were earned out by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and constant current charge/discharge with a three-electrode system. The results show that within the potential window range from 0 to 0.8 V (vs. SCE) amorphous α-MnO2·nH2O exhibits excellent capacitance and high power characteristics in 0.5 mol/L K2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. A maximum specific capacitance of 140 F/g is obtained at the sweep rate of 4 mV/s. Effect of different sweep rates on the specific capacitance of α-MnO2·nH2O was also studied.
