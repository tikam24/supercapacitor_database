This paper presents a comparative evaluation of partially-decoupled battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system (HESS) topologies for electric vehicles, from the battery pack capacity fading point of view. The effects of the HESS topology and drive cycle type on battery life are quantified based on an empirically-derived lithium-ion battery capacity fading model. Simulation results are presented to support the analysis.
