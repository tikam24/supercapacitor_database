Ag-ion-modified titanium nanotube (Ag/TiO2-NT) arrays were designed and fabricated as the electrode material of supercapacitors for electrochemical energy storage. TiO2 nanotube (NT) arrays were prepared by electrochemical anodic oxidation and then treated by Ag metal vapor vacuum arc (MEVVA) implantation. The Ag amount was controlled via adjusting ion implantation parameters. The morphology, crystallinity, and electrochemistry properties of as-obtained Ag/TiO2-NT electrodes were distinguished based on various characterizations. Compared with different doses of Ag/TiO2-NTs, the electrode with the dose of 5.0 × 1017 ions·cm-2 exhibited much higher electrode capacity and greatly enhanced activity in comparison to the pure TiO2-NTs. The modified electrode showed a high capacitance of 9324.6 mF·cm-3 (86.9 mF·g, 1.2 mF·cm-2), energy density of 82.8 μWh·cm-3 (0.8 μWh·g, 0.0103 μWh·cm-2), and power density of 161.0 mW·cm-3 (150.4 μW·g, 2.00 μW·cm-2) at the current density of 0.05 mA. Therefore, Ag/TiO2-NTs could act as a feasible electrode material of supercapacitors.
