Electrical Vehicles (EVs) require a mix of high power density and high energy density capable energy sources. The available individual energy sources like a battery, fuel cells, and ultracapacitor (UC) cannot meet both the energy and power demand. This paper presents a Dual-Energy Storage System (DESS) using a combination of battery and UC as an onboard source for EV. An algorithm is proposed to split the required current between the DESS and it is controlled with Average Current Mode Control (ACM). In addition to current sharing, the controller maintains the DC link voltage constant. The proposed algorithm also overcomes the drawback of a filter based deterministic algorithm. To test the feasibility of the proposed algorithm for a DESS, a motor-dynamometer setup has been simulated by using MATLAB/Simulink to emulate the EV atmosphere. It shows the necessity of high power density energy sources for the vehicle for life enhancement of the battery storage system.
