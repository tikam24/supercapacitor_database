Fe2 O3 nanoparticle was prepared by a hydrothermal method, and the influence of rare earth elements (Y3+, Nd3+ and La3+) on the electrochemical performance was studied. The crystal structure and microstructure of the synthesized lithium zinc ferrite were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results show that the powder is well crystallized and the particles are mostly irregular. The electrochemical property was characterized via cyclic voltammetry (CV) and constant current charge-discharge method. The capacitance of the Fe2 O3 nanoparticle is 258.3 F/g, 342.7 F/g after doping Y3+,337.1 F/g after doping Nd3+and 331.2 F/g after doping La3 +. The results show that the rare earth elements (Y3+, Nd3+ and La3+) after the specific capacitance has increased, more suitable for super capacitor materials.
