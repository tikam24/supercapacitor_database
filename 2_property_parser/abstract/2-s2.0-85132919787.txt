This article deals with explores to review of the recent advances in wearable electronics using textile-based flexible and printable materials (TFPMs) for the next generation of wearable and flexible electronic devices. Among different types of wearable electronics, flexible electronics, and electronic sensors, which integrate flexible textiles with the better functions of electronic devices as well as printable energy storage devices. Firstly, we review recent progress in electronic devices, focusing on newly improved the design of TFPMs and fabrication strategies. Their applications and performances in sensors, supercapacitors, flexible conductive electrodes, and triboelectric nanogenerators are discussed as presented in various articles. Then, the manufacturing methods and applications of TFPMs are outlined in detail. Moreover, the integration of versatile e-textiles has significantly improved with enhanced optic-electrical, electrochemical, and mechanical properties. Finally, we discuss the challenges that exist and the future work opportunities to develop electronic textiles through experimental and simulation research.
