Supercapacitors are a kind of energy storage devices and have recently gained a lot of researcher’s interest. However, it is still difficult to create supercapacitors material based on mixed transition metal oxides with large specific capacitance, structural strength, and great energy efficiency at an attractive cost. The simple co-precipitation method was employed to make dysprosium-doped nickel manganese oxide with different concentrations for the energy conversion system. The electrochemical performance of the Dy-doped NiMnO3 on Copper foam (CF) as a conductive substrate was investigated under a 2.0 M KOH electrolyte. The experiments are conducted using cyclic voltammetry (CV) using various ranging scan rates from 5 to 40 mV s−1, galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) at various current densities of 0.07, 0.05, and 0.1 Ag−1, and (EIS) Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy at frequencies between 100 Hz and 100 kHz. The resultant specific capacitance and energy density of the 0.05 M Dy-doped NMO/CF electrode are 2006 F/g and 72.35 W/kg, separately. Consequently, large amounts of the Dy-doped NiMnO3 have been suggested as a material for applications involving next-generation supercapacitors. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
