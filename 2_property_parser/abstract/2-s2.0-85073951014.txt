Potassium-ion hybrid capacitors (PIHCs) hold the advantages of high-energy density of batteries and high-power output of supercapacitors and thus present great promise for the next generation of electrochemical energy storage devices. One of the most crucial tasks for developing a high-performance PIHCs is to explore a favorable anode material with capability to balance the kinetics mismatch between battery-type anodes and capacitor-type cathode. Herein, a reliable route for fabricating sulfur and nitrogen codoped 3D porous carbon nanosheets (S-N-PCNs) is reported. Systematic characterizations coupled with kinetics analysis indicate that the doped heteroatoms of sulfur and nitrogen and the amplified graphite interlayer can provide ample structural defects and redox active sites that are beneficial for improving pseudocapacitive activity, enabling fast kinetics toward efficient potassium-ion storage. The S-N-PCNs are demonstrated to exhibit superior potassium storage capability with a high capacity of 107 mAh g−1 at 20 A g−1 and long cycle stability. The as-developed PIHCs present impressive electrochemical performance with an operating voltage as high as 4.0 V, an energy density of 187 Wh kg−1, a power density of 5136 W kg−1, and a capacity retention of 86.4% after 3000 cycles.
