Electrical double layer supercapacitors have been constructed from a poly(urethane) electrolyte, [Poly(urethane):ethylene carbonate:propylene carbonate:lithium perchlorate in the ratio of 1:2:2:0.1 based on the mass of the polymer as the electrolyte], using both the high surface area carbon cloth and carbon composite electrodes. The cells have been characterised using the AC impedance spectroscopy, galvanostatic charge-discharge experiments, and cyclic voltammetry. Capacitance values of up to 35 and 5.5 F g-1 for the composite and carbon cloth electrodes were respectively attained. The supercapacitor cells showed a good stability up to 1000 charge-discharge cycles, retaining 80% of their original capacity at 1000 cycles. Â© 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
