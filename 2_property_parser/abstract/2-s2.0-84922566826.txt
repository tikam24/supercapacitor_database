Electrical double layer capacitors (supercapacitors) were fabricated using activated carbon as the active material and polyvinylidine fluoride (PVDF) as a binder with a suitable conductive additive (MWCNTs) together in an optimized ratio. The supercapacitor cells were assembled using an aqueous solution of 0.5M Na2SO4 as the electrolyte. These cells had an average capacitance of 1.7F each as measured by the constant current charging method. The two electrode symmetric cell had a specific capacitance of 23.05 F/g. The fabrication methodology has been discussed as well as the potential applications of the supercapacitor in piezoelectric element based energy harvesting systems have been elucidated.
