Nano-sized high entropy oxides (particle size < 10 nm) are expected to possess enhanced stability, electrochemical properties and increased potential in versatile applications than bulk metal oxides. In this study, nano-sized high entropy oxides incorporated surface functionalized coconut shell derived activated carbon (HEO/f-CSAC) is synthesized, characterised and used as an advanced multifunctional material for electrochemical energy storage and desalination. Attributed to its unique microstructure and extraordinary properties, HEO/f-CSAC shows an excellent salt adsorption capacity of 241 mg g−1 at 1.2 V in 500 mg L−1 concentration of NaCl solution, which is very high as compared to previous reports. The reason behind high salt adsorption capacity is its outstanding specific capacitance of 147.5 F g−1 at current density 1 A g−1. Moreover, the assembled lab-scale CDI unit demonstrates extremely good performance upto 20 adsorption-desorption cycles due to the long cycle life with good capacitance retention of fabricated HEO/f-CSAC based two-electrode supercapacitor. Additionally, a red light-emitting diode illumination by connecting three supercapacitors in series, indicates the high efficiency and potential of HEO/f-CSAC for real life energy-related application. These results prove that HEO/f-CSAC can be implemented for water desalination with enhanced supercapacitive performance manifesting its multifunctionality for energy and environmental applications.
