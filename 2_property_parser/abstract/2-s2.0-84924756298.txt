Three dimensional reduced graphene oxide were prepared by one-step hydrothermal method using graphene oxide sols prepared from graphite oxide gels as precursor. The structure and morphology were analyzed by XRD, Raman, XPS, SEM and TEM. In addition, the work electrodes of materials for supercapacitor were prepared by direct tabletting and the supercapacitive performance of the electrodes were tested by using a three electrodes system. The results show that most oxygen-containing groups of graphene oxide sols can be removed by one-step hydrothermal reduction, and the three dimensional reduced graphene oxide presents porous network which is consist of 3 to 7 graphene layers; the specific capacitance can reach 294 F·g-1 at the current density of 0.5 A·g-1, and also 247 F·g-1 can be attained at the current density of 1 A·g-1 after 1000 cycles, so the retention rate is 88.85%. The ohm resistor is about 0.52 Ω while the interface resistance is about 1.53 Ω. In comparison, the obtained three dimensional reduced graphene oxide owns much better supercapacitive performance than those prepared by thermal reduction and chemical reduction methods.
