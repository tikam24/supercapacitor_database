Wireless sensor networks have emerged extremely in humanity life in the last decade. They have emerged substantially in many applications such as factories, industrial facilities, buildings, military applications, security, disaster management and predictable, weather sounding and forecasting, environment and wildlife observation, hospitals and health applications, agricultural, various means of transportation and automobile, smart cities and civilian areas. The short energy lifetime of the sensor nodes and the difficulty of the maintenance are critical problems hinder the development of this technology. Intelligent Wireless Sensor Network (IWSN) is a new technology which uses energy harvesting system with an energy storage system (ESS) to solve the energy consumption problem and gives the sensor node a long lifetime. This paper will explain the energy storage devices which are used in IWSN as a solution for frequent maintenance and the short lifetime of the sensor nodes beside to the advantages and disadvantages of this devices. And, it will introduce a comparison between the batteries and the supercapacitors which are used in such applications and illustrate the reasons for choosing the supercapacitor as a preferred energy storage device. Also, it will introduce the method of modelling and sizing the supercapacitors as an energy storage device for IWSN mathematically and by using MATLAB.
