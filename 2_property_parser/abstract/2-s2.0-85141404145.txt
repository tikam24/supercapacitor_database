The semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDCs) materials, tungsten disulfide (WS2) and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), holding a hexagonal structure, acquiring much attention for energy storage applications. Herein, various film thicknesses of silver sputtered molybdenumâ€‘tungsten-disulfide (MoWS2@Ag) were deposited via magnetron sputtering technique. The surface and structural morphology of MoWS2@Ag samples were analyzed via scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray, and atomic force microscopy. MoWS2@Ag exhibits the best performance in three electrode configuration by showing a maximum specific capacity of 367C/g. A hybrid supercapacitor device was assembled using MoWS2@Ag and activated carbon as the electrodes. The device possessed maximum energy and power of 35 Wh/kg and 5950 W/kg, respectively. To confirm the hybrid nature of the device, b values were calculated. The remarkable performance of MoWS2@Ag makes it an excellent electrode for hybrid supercapacitors.
