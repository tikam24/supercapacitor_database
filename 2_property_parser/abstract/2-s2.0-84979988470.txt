Electrochemical energy storage devices often require high performance electrode materials. Rational materials design need to systematically study the structure-morphology-performance relationship. In this review, structure design, chemical reaction design, and performance design are proposed to grow high quality Cu-based materials with different morphologies, structures and electrochemical performances. We systematically studied the synthesis of Cu metal, Cu2O, CuO and Cu(OH)2 electrode materials, their electrochemical performances of Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors were also evaluated. The chemical bonding theory of single crystal growth and ionic electronegativity scale can be used to design novel electrode materials with specific structures and morphologies. The review would to provide a critical discussion of the rational design of high-performance Cu-based electrode materials.
