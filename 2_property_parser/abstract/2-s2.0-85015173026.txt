In this paper, the research progress on preparation of polyacrylonitrile fiber by electrostatic spinning method and its application in electrochemical supercapacitor was summarized. According to the morphology and composition of the obtained materials, the obtained materials have be divided into three kinds, porous carbon nanofibers based on PAN, doped carbon nanofibers based PAN and carbon nanofiber composite based PAN. This paper focuses on how to carry out the works of pore forming, doping and compounding on the PAN fibers with different methods and thus how to enhance their electrochemical energy storage performances. And at the same time, the improvement directions are brought out based on the discussion in detail on the advantages and disadvantages of the methods mentioned above.
