The purpose of this study is to report an effective approach to improve the electrochemical performance of polyaniline electrode by fabricating para-aminophenyl graphene/polyaniline cross-linking nanocomposites (PAG/PANI). The chemical graft between PAG and PANI, and the electrostatic incorporation between PANI inter-chains could provide the stable structural foundation for the improvement of cyclic stability. HCl and 1,5-naphthalene sulfonic acid (NSA) were both used as dopants to guarantee high doping level of PANI. The PAG/PANI electrode had a high specific capacitance of 1092.3 F g −1 at 5 mV s −1 , and also showed a high cyclic stability after 3000 cycles. These results indicated that the PAG/PANI electrode would have a broad application prospect in energy storage device.
