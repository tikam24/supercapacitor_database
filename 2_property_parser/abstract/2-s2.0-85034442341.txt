Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were nano-coated onto single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) by in situ polymerization of TpPa-COFs together with SWCNTs under solvothermal conditions. At the molecular level, the COF/SWCNT interface can be efficiently controlled. Thus, the TpPa-COF-SWCNTs nano-hybrid wire, which combines the excellent conductivity of SWCNTs and the high porosity and good redox activity of TpPa-COFs, was employed as active electrode materials for supercapacitors. The strategy reported in this work can give guidance for the design of other similar COF-based electrodes, and hold a great potential in energy storages
