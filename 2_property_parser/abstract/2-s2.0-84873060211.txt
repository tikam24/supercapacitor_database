Nitrogen-doped porous carbon electrodes with remarkable specific capacitance have been fabricated by the rational carbonization of zinc(II)-bis(8-hydroxyquinoline) (abbr. Znq2) coordination polymer, and heating treatment with CO(NH2)2. The experimental results demonstrate that the mass ratio of carbon precursor and CO(NH2)2 plays a key role in the formation of porous carbon with various nitrogen content as well as specific surface areas and pore structures. The cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements show that the capacitive performance has been remarkably improved by doping with nitrogen. The specific capacitance of 219.2Fg-1 is achieved at the current density of 1Ag-1 with nitrogen-doped porous carbon, increasing up to ca. 56.8% compared to that with pristine porous carbon. The nitrogen-doped porous carbon electrode exhibits enhance capacitance retention as ca. 45.2% at 20Ag-1 as well as cycling stability (ca. 7.6% loss after 3000cycles). The present carbonization method as well as the nitrogen-doping method for porous carbon from coordination polymer can enrich the strategies for the production of carbon-based electrodes materials in the application of electrochemical capacitors.
