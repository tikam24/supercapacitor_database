The performance and cycling stability of stretchable energy storage devices, such as supercapacitors and batteries, are limited by the structural breakdown arising from the stretch imposed and large volumetric swelling/shrinking. This work demonstrates a very facile and low-cost approach to fabricate stretchable supercapacitors with high performance and excellent cycling stability by electrochemical deposition of polypyrrole (PPy) on smartly-tailored stretchable stainless steel meshes. The fabricated solid-state supercapacitors possess a capacitance up to 170. F/g at a specific current of 0.5. A/g and it can be effectively enhanced to 214. F/g with a 20% strain. Moreover, they can be operated at a very high scan rate up to 10. V/s, which are 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than most rates for the PPy electrodes measured even in aqueous electrolytes. Even significantly, the fabricated solid-state supercapacitors under 0% and 20% strains achieve remarkable capacitance retentions of 98% and 87% at a very high specific current of 10. A/g after 10,000 cycles, respectively, which are the best for PPy-based solid-state flexible supercapacitors, to the best of our knowledge. The key factors and mechanisms to achieve such high performance are discussed. This facile and low-cost approach developed for fabricating stable and stretchable supercapacitors with high performances could pave the way for next-generation stretchable electronics.
