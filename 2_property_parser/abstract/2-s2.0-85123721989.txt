Bio-wastes are a great source of carbon possessing good electrical conductivity and high specific surface area for non-faradic charge adsorption. Unlike, metal oxides provide faradic type charge storage due to their high redox activity. Herein, we have utilized the neem leaves (Azadirachta Indica) derived activated carbon (NDAC) and UiO-66 (Zr-based metal-organic framework) derived zirconium oxide ZrO2 (ZO) based electrodes for hybrid supercapacitors. In a three-electrode system, the NDAC as a negative electrode shows a high specific capacitance of 262 F/g at 1A/g using 1M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Besides, ZO as a positive electrode material delivered a high specific capacitance of 337 F/g at a current density of 0.25 A/g using the same electrolyte. Furthermore, an asymmetrical supercapacitor is assembled using charged balanced NDAC and ZO electrodes using 1M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The NDAC//ZO based asymmetrical device delivers a maximum energy density of 49.2 Wh/kg at a high-power density of 540 W/kg along with a long cycle life of âˆ¼78% (after 5000 cycles). These results give new directions for the application of low-cost bio-wastes and MOF-derived metal oxides for next-generation high-energy-density hybrid supercapacitors.
