According to the complementary characteristics of batteries and supercapacitors, different semi-active hybrid energy storage systems using just one dc/dc converter have been exploited in hybrid electric vehicles. To minimize the amplitude of the current in battery and energy loss in the system, this paper proposes an optimization scheme for the semi-active hybrid energy storage system under the traction mode and the regenerative braking mode. The energy distribution optimization is formulated as a convex problem and the primal-dual interior-point method is leveraged to acquire the optimal solution. The simulation results validate that the proposed scheme is efficient to minimize the amplitude of the current in battery with a reduced energy loss.
