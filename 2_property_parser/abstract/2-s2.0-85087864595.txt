The study reports on the preparation of boron-doped diamond nanospikes (BDD-NSs), supported on porous titanium (Ti) substrate, using reactive ion etching (RIE) with oxygen plasma and their investigation as an electrode material for supercapacitors. The above architecture contributes to an ideal pathway for supercapacitors with good stability and high specific capacitance. As a result, the BDD electrode etched for 5 min (BDD-NSs-5) achieved good performance with a high specific capacitance of 70.6 mF cm−2 at a current density of 0.32 mA cm−2 and a capacitance retention of 84.3% after 15,000 cycles. Moreover, the BDD-NSs-5 electrode was assembled into a symmetric supercapacitor device. The device achieved high energy and power densities of 9.24 mJ cm−2 and 1.26 mW cm−2, respectively, implying enhanced potential for real-time applications. For practical application, the BDD-NSs-5 electrode was used for rotating a home-designed windmill device and the solid-state symmetric supercapacitor device can light up a red LED for 20 s after being charged to 3.0 V.
