A series of flexible nanocomposite electrodes were fabricated by facile electro-deposition of cobalt and nickel double hydroxide (DH) nanosheets on porous NiCo2O4 nanowires grown radially on carbon fiber paper (CFP) for high capacity, high energy, and power density supercapacitors. Among different stoichiometries of CoxNi1-xDH nanosheets studied, Co0.67Ni0.33 DHs/NiCo2O 4/CFP hybrid nanoarchitecture showed the best cycling stability while maintaining high capacitance of ∼1.64 F/cm2 at 2 mA/cm 2. This hybrid composite electrode also exhibited excellent rate capability; the areal capacitance decreased less than 33% as the current density was increased from 2 to 90 mA/cm2, offering excellent specific energy density (∼33 Wh/kg) and power density (∼41.25 kW/kg) at high cycling rates (up to150 mA/cm2). © 2013 American Chemical Society.
