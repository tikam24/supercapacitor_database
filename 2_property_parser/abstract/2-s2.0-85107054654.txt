In recent years, humans' increasing necessity and consumption of energy and the lack of energy-related issues have drawn considerable attention due to high power density, cyclic performance, and highly safe. Herein, we have designed and reported new Olive-Bismuth vanadate (O-BV) electrodes serving as excellent electrochemical materials for supercapacitors prepared by a simple solvothermal method. The supercapacitive features were examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronopotentiometry (CP) techniques. The cyclic voltammetric analyses were performed using three different electrolytes, including aqueous Na2SO4, KOH, and NaOH electrolyte solution in 1 M concentration. The as-prepared O-BV electrode exhibits a significant specific capacitance of 977 Fg-1 at a scan of 5 m Vâˆ’1 in 1 M NaOH electrolyte solution. Furthermore, the Olive-Bismuth vanadate electrode was achieved outstanding performance of cyclic stability after 2000 cycles and retained 86% of its initial capacitance. The excellent specific capacitance and superior cyclic stability highlight the potential of the Olive-Bismuth vanadate material as an active electrode for high-performance supercapacitors.
