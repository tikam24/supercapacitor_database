A cost-effective, simple and non-hazardous route for synthesis of few-layered graphene from waste zinc carbon battery (ZCB) electrodes via electrochemical expansion (ECE) has been reported. In this synthesis, we have electrochemically exfoliated the graphene layers, by intercalating sodium dodecyl benzenesulfonate (SDBS) surfactant into graphitic layers at different D.C. voltages with a constant SDBS concentration. The graphene sheets were isolated, purified and characterized by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectrometry, Ultraviolet absorption (UV), Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and Cyclic voltammetry. Best result was obtained at 4.5 V of D.C. A possible mechanism for the intercalation process has been proposed. A promising application of the produced material for supercapacitor application has also been explored in combination with polyaniline.
