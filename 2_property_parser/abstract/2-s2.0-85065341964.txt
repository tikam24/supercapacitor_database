Nowadays there are growing need of energy in every aspect of human living. That is the reason of searching for a highly efficient sources of energy. Supercapacitors or ultracapacitors (how supercapacitors are also described) can be used as ones. Main reason is high energy and power density of those devices. The possibility of using supercapacitors grow along with a reduction in their size while maintaining the above mentioned parameters. Accomplishing of that goal imposes the use of modern materials especially nanomaterials during supercapacitors manufacturing. One of materials recently raising scientists' interest, as material for ultracapacitors electrodes are carbon nanotubes (CNTs). It is due to the great electrical and mechanical properties and high specific surface. This article presents results of parameters calculation based on finite element method, obtained for supercapacitors models. In the described models used for simulation, electrodes are made of carbon nanotubes, obtained by synthesis using LSCVD method.
