At present, mining electric locomotive with lead-acid battery energy storage, when accelerating or braking, the battery bank (BT bank) in a short period of time is difficult to discharge large power and absorb feedback power, which affects the running efficiency and cruise mileage of electric locomotive. In view of the above problems, the hybrid energy storage system of storage battery and super capacitor is applied to the motor of mine car, and the complementary power distribution scheme of static power output by storage battery and dynamic power output by super capacitor is proposed. In order to realize the power sharing of the two energy storage devices, a bi-directional three-level DC/DC converter is proposed to realize the current and power control of the SC bank. The analysis and experiment show that the HESS can not only output large current and improve the acceleration performance of electric locomotive, but also can save electric energy and improve the running efficiency and cruise mileage of electric locomotive.
