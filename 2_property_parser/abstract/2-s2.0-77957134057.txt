Fluorinated activated carbon cloth was prepared by impregnating a commercial activated carbon cloth in a pitch fluoride solution followed by carbonization. The surface properties of samples before and after treatment were characterized by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy, Constant Current Charge-Discharge were employed to investigate the electrochemical properties of the samples. After the fluorination, the element fluorine was introduced to the surface of the activated carbon cloth. The electrical conductivity was improved from 2.51 to 33.21 Scm- 1. As the electrodes of a supercapacitor, the equivalent series resistance of as-prepared sample was substantially decreased compared with the pristine material. The improvement of conductivity is ascribed to the creation of ionic fluorine-carbon bonds after fluorination, indicating the high power characteristics of this material. Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V.
