The microwave-hydrothermal method for synthesizing γ-MnO2 has been investigated for the first time. The dandelion-like γ-MnO 2 active material with 1.0-5.0μm in diameter was obtained from KBrO3and MnSO4 via the novel method. Compared with traditional low-temperature hydrothermal method, this approach lowers the temperature by 30-40 °C, and shorts the reaction time 6-14 h. Electrochemical properties of dandelion-like γ-MnO2 were elucidated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests. The synthesized material shows a relative high specific capacitance, and the MnO2 obtained at the condition of 75 °C for 2 h shows the best electrochemical properties with a specific capacitance of 239.3 Fg-1 at the current density of 100 mA·g-1in 6 M KOH electrolyte solution. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
