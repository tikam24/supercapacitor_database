Lithium niobate (LiNb3O8) nanoflakes with ultra-large specific surface area have been successfully synthesized by using thermal annealing process at 950 C in Ar atmosphere (50 sccm) for electrochemical energy storage supercapacitor devices. The electrochemical properties of nanoflakes were analyzed by using cyclic voltammetry and the effects of electrolyte, scan rate and different scan cycles on the cyclic voltammograms were also systematically investigated. The cycling stability measurements of nanoflakes showed that the decrease in the specific capacitance is negligible even after 15,000 cycles which shows their excellent cyclic stability.
