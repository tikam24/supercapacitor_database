One of the key challenges for wearable electronics, is the ability to power them without cumbersome or bulky battery packs. In recent years, much work has been done on wearable textile batteries and supercapacitors [1-3], as well as various energy harvesting technologies, such as triboelectric generators, piezoelectric devices, solar textiles and wireless harvesting [4]. In this work, we demonstrate a fully knitted energy harvesting antenna and energy storing supercapacitor for powering e-textiles. Because the energy harvesting and storage are combined, other devices can receive power directly from the antenna while in an area with wifi. When there is no wifi available, the device can draw power from the supercapacitor.
