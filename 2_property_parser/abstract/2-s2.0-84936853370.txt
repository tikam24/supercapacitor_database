A nitrogen- and oxygen-enriched hierarchical porous carbon fiber was fabricated by phase-separable wet-spinning and the subsequent chemical activation of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) precursors. The wet-spinning could readily offer an interpenetrating 3D meso-/macro-porous network owing to the phase-separation of PAN in the coagulation bath (DMSO/H2O), caused by the different solubility of PAN in DMSO and H2O, and the different content of PAN in the fiber and the coagulation bath. The latter chemical activation introduced abundant small-sized nanopores within the meso-/macro-porous network skeleton. The obtained hierarchical porous carbon fiber exhibited a high specific surface area of 2176.6 m2 g-1 and a large pore volume of 1.272 cm3 g-1, and was highly doped with heteroatoms of nitrogen and oxygen. When it was used as a supercapacitor electrode, high performance of reversible specific capacitances of 329 F g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and 223 F g-1 at 20 A g-1 as well as the capacitance retention of 97.6% after 2000 cycles were achieved in a two-electrode cell.
