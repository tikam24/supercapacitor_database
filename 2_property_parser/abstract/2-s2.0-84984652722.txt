In this work, Ni nanoparticles were directly decorated on graphene (G) nanosheets via mechanical ball milling. Based on transmission electron microscopy observations, the Ni nanoparticles were well dispersed and attached to the G nanosheet without any agglomerations. Electrochemical results showed that the capacitance of a G/Ni nanocomposite was 275 F g -1 at a current density of 2 A g -1, which is higher than the capacitance of bare G (145 F g -1) and bare Ni (3 F g -1). The G/Ni electrode also showed superior performance at a high current density, exhibiting a capacitance of 190 F g -1 at a current density of 5 A g -1 and a capacitance of 144 F g -1 at a current density of 10 A g -1. The equivalent series resistance for G/Ni nanocomposites also decreased. The enhanced performance of this hybrid supercapacitor is best described by the synergistic effect, i.e. dual charge-storage mechanism, which is demonstrated by electrical double layer and pseudocapacitance materials. Moreover, a high specific surface area and electrical conductivity of the materials enhanced the capacitance. These results indicate that the G/Ni nanocomposite is a potential supercapacitor.
