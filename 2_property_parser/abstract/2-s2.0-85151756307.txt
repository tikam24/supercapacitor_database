Renewable energy systems have always been seen as an effective weapon in the battle against climate change and global warming. Wind and solar energy have grown dramatically in the recent decade, with large cost reductions, and are becoming increasingly competitive with fossil fuels. Energy storage devices, on the other hand, play a critical role in constructing flexible and reliable energy systems because of uncertainties in power generation and consumption. This chapter, discusses the future direction of supercapacitors to replace batteries and hybrid with batteries. Different types of supercapacitors have emerged so far, and hindrances are also associated with the development of energy-efficient supercapacitor devices. Furthermore, the parameters are all needed to improve their applications in large-scale commercial applications. Different types of supercapacitors are currently being developed straightaway to tune their energy storage properties (i.e.) asymmetric supercapacitor, hybrid supercapacitor, flexible supercapacitor, all-solid-state supercapacitor, and microsupercapacitors. 3D printing supercapacitors are also explained. Moreover, this chapter elaborates effective implementation of supercapacitors in electric vehicles by either hybrid type or standalone type.
