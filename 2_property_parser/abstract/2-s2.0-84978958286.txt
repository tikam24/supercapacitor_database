To get nanostructured nickel oxide (NiO) at low cost, a template-free approach (electrospinning combined with direct annealing) has been developed to prepare NiO nanofibers. The obtained NiO nanofibers not only exhibit higher stability even at high temperature (400Â°C), but also show a typical pseudocapacitive capacitance. It has been found that the value of the specific gradually decreases with the discharge current density and a highest specific capacitance of 227.5 F/g can be achieved at a constant current density of 1 A/g in 1 M KOH electrolyte.
