The hierarchical SnNi2S4 (TNS) nanocomposite synthesized via a microwave-assisted technique has been demonstrated. Sulfidation of Ni-Sn acetate hydroxide with thioacetamide was conducted in the presence of alcohol to produce SnNi2S4 nanocomposites. The SnNi2S4 nanocomposites exhibited excellent physiochemical properties with superior electrochemical performances. Owing to the improved faradaic redox reaction, enhanced surface area and exceptional mass transfer nature, the nanocomposites displayed a better charge/discharge stability, high specific capacitance and long-term cycling life. Assembled asymmetric supercapacitor constructed with SnNi2S4 nanocomposites operating at the potential 1.401 V showed a high energy density and power density. The long-term cycle life with high capacitance retention would satiate the growing demand for energy-related devices. The unique SnNi2S4 nanocomposites not only express promising roles in energy storage but also stand for an unlimited capability of heterostructured materials.
