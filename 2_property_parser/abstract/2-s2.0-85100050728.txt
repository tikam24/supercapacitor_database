Using the controllable capacity of load to simulate the energy regulation characteristics of energy storage equipment is a feasible scheme to improve the system's operation capacity on the load side. Firstly,the conversion relationship between the rotational kinetic energy of controllable load and the charging and discharging energy of DC capacitor energy storage element is established,and the definition of virtual energy storage derived from controllable load is expounded. Then,considering load revenue and battery life loss,the economic evaluation model of DC microgrid is established,and the relationship between the virtual capa-citance value and the total system revenue is analyzed. Furthermore,the economic losses in the speed regulation process of controllable load and the loss gains of energy storage in the control process of virtual energy storage are comprehensively analyzed. Particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to solve the economic model to provide the calculation basis for virtual capacitance value,and a coordinated control technology of energy storage-load for DC microgrid with virtual energy storage is proposed. Finally,based on typical examples,the virtual capacitance values at different time periods are calculated,and the economic benefits before and after installing the virtual energy storage are compared to verify that the proposed coordinated control technology can not only improve the power regulation ability of system,but also improve the operation economy of DC microgrid.
