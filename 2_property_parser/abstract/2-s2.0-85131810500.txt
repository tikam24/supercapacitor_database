In the present work, Mo2C-MoS2 heterojunction structures have been prepared by the wet impregnation method. For heterojunction species, the content of MoS2 was varied from 5 to 20% by weight. The effect of the loading content of MoS2 over Mo2C on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity and electrochemical (EC) capacitance performance has been studied in detail. The Mo-C-S junction plays a key role in enhancing the HER activity and EC capacitance performance than the individual components. The prepared structures show enhanced HER activity with high current density âˆ¼36.2-78.3 mAcm-2 at very low applied potential (0.45 V), exhibiting a lower Tafel slope of 102.4 mVdec-1. The EC capacitor performance determined by CV and galvanic charge-discharge (GCD) reveals that the synthesized samples exhibit an electrochemical double-layer capacitor (EDLC, Cdl) behavior. The higher EDLC (43.9 mFcm-2) and specific capacitance (2Fg-1) obtained for the synthesized samples determine their potential applicability for the new generation supercapacitors.
