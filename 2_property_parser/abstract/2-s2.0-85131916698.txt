Polythiophene is conjugated polymer having remarkable conducting and physical properties. Polythiophene and derivatives (poly(3-hexylthiophene), poly(3-phenylthiophene), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)) have been reinforced with graphene using solution, electrochemical, and in situ polymerization approaches. Polythiophene/graphene nanocomposites own advanced morphology, electrical, thermal, mechanical, and physical characteristics. This review portrays design, properties, and applications (photovoltaic, supercapacitor; sensor) of polythiophene/graphene nanocomposites. The polythiophene/graphene solar cells had high power conversion efficiency ~2-3%, the supercapacitors revealed high specific capacitance of 900–1000Fg−1, and the sensors exposed high sensitivity in wide analyte concentration range. High performance and properties of the nanocomposites rely on fine polythiophene solubility, graphene dispersion, and matrix-nanofiller covalent/non-covalent interactions.
