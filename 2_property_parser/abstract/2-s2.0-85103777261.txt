In the present work, we have designed a symmetric supercapacitor (SS) device by synthesizing a pseudocapacitive binder-free cobalt oxide (Co3O4) thin film based electrode using reactive DC magnetron sputtering technique. The thin film electrodes were characterized by x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to reveal the crystallographic details, stoichiometry, and electronic configuration, respectively. Furthermore, Co3O4 thin film electrode is used for pseudocapacitor and electrochemically tested in 1M aqueous KOH electrolyte solution, in addition, a symmetric supercapacitor (SS) device was fabricated. It was found that the SS device exhibits tremendous electrochemical stability in terms of high capacitance and good cycling stability. The value of specific capacitance for Co3O4 thin film electrodes and the SS device was calculated to be 392 Fg-1 and 95 Fg-1, respectively, at a scan rate of 2 mAcm-2. The SS device exhibits high specific energy (29 W-hkg-1) along with comparable good specific power (4745 Wkg-1). In this work, the fabricated SS device demonstrates 91.40% cyclic and capacitance retention at 8 mAcm-2 beyond 10 000 cycles. The excellent electrochemical stability and capacitive performance of the SS device suggest that it would be an ideal and potential candidate for energy storage applications in the future.
