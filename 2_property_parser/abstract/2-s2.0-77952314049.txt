In this paper the authors propose a reliability approach analyzing the degradation of supercapacitor based on the activated carbons and organic electrolyte technology. This approach uses the experimental measurements to develop an electric equivalent circuit model and uses the reliability analysis tools to evaluate the lifetime of the supercapacitor. The causal tree analysis is adopted to present the different possible combinations of the events involving the supercapacitor degradation. Then, the experimental identification of the circuit parameters variation intervals according to each degradation mode is presented. Therefore a diagnosis system allowing the description of failure modes and degradation states of the supercapacitor is developed. Â© 2010 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.
