In this paper, the two-step activation Eucommia wood tar-based activated carbon (ETAC), cellulose nanofibers (CNF) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) were assembled to form composite aerogel in mild condition. Impressively, the doping of optimizing ETAC greatly improved the overall specific surface area (SSA) of the aerogel, and the CNF extracted from Eucommia ulmoides wood was used to enhance the mechanical properties of graphene aerogel. Besides, the composite aerogels with high content of ETAC (67% of mass ratio) possessed efficient MnOx deposition capability (1540 mg/g), which could assemble an asymmetric free-binder supercapacitor, exhibiting an ultrahigh specific capacitance and prominent cycling stability. This work offered a feasible method to fabricate free-binder composite aerogels with excellent electrochemical property for broad applications in supercapacitors.
