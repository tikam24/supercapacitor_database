Pulse Power Loads (PPLs) are loads which are characterized by very quick discharge of energy. In a standalone DC micro-grid they are of concern because they often cause severe drop in DC bus voltage and affect the stability of the system. Usually in a standalone DC microgrid, battery is used to compensate the difference power between the load and generation, but the battery is unable to deal with high power fluctuation caused by the PPLs. Forcing battery to supply for sudden load variation may even cause aging problems. To mitigate this issue a supercapacitor is added to the system in tandem with the battery. The supercapacitor is expected to provide the high frequency power fluctuations while battery provides the low frequency power fluctuations. In this paper a Fast Terminal Sliding Mode Control (FTSMC) is used for the hybrid energy storage system (battery and supercapacitor) based low voltage DC microgird to mitigate the effect of Pulse Power Load. The performance and the effectiveness of the proposed controller has been verified based on the simulation studies using MATLAB/SIMULINK and found to be better compared to the conventional control in the presence of PPLs.
