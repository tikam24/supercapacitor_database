In order to construct an elastic mine power grid supplying high proportion renewable energy, a method of hybrid energy storage system consisting of abandoned mine pumped storage and supercapacitor to improve the frequency elasticity of the mine grid is proposed. Based on the elastic grid framework, considering the coincidence and difference between elastic force and frequency modulation characteristics, five elastic indicators are proposed in a targeted manner. Taking the state of charge of the supercapacitor into account, the technical advantages of the pumping unit and the supercapacitor are fully utilized, so that the energy storage system has the characteristics of high energy density and power density. The frequency flexibility of the system is increased from the aspects of adaptability, resilience and inertia. With this method, a closed-loop frequency control structure capable of adapting to load step change and continuous adjustment task is constructed. The effective frequency level is effectively stabilized when the high-power equipment is started intensively or underground small-power equipment frequently starts and stops, and the power supply reliability of the mine area is improved. Finally, a system model is built in MATLAB/Simulink, and effectiveness of the proposed method is verified with simulation.
