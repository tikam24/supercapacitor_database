Supercapacitors are important energy storage devices due to their long circular life and high power density. However, the low energy density of supercapacitors hinders their widespread application. Therefore, the development and research of novel electrode materials to improve their electrochemical behavior in supercapacitor applications becomes crucial. The application of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with high porosity, controllable pore structure, and large specific surface area in supercapacitors has been widely explored by researchers. In this review, we mainly conclude the latest research progress of pure MOFs and their composites (MOF composites, MOF derivatives) in the application of supercapacitors. Finally, we also provide personal insights on the current challenges and future development prospects of these materials in the application of supercapacitors.
