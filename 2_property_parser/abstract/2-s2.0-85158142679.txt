Surface modification of Ti3C2Tx greatly enhances its charge storage mechanism as an electrode material. Herein, we demonstrate the role of surface terminals and heteroatoms in the electrochemical behavior of Ti3C2Tx electrodes. The abundance of -F and -OH surface terminals may be obtained with an acidic or base medium while etching of Ti3C2Tx. Further treatment with ammonia or glucose may help to get a thin layer of N or C at the surface of Ti3C2Tx. It is found that abundant reaction sites and larger interlayer spacing can help in improving the specific capacitance by nearly 2.5 times to unmodified Ti3C2Tx electrodes. This superior performance can be achieved without sacrificing the conductivity and accordion-like structure of Ti3C2Tx MXene two-dimensional material.
