In this study, nanoporous silver with tunable porosity was fabricated by chemically dealloying Ag-based metallic glasses in HCl solution. By systematically investigating the dynamic change in pore characteristics of the nanoporous silver with dealloying condition, the correlation between ligament size and dealloying parameter was successfully established. It was also found that the evolution behavior of the ligament size can be well described by a diffusion based growth kinetic model. In addition, our study of the capacitive performance of the nanoporous silver shows that these newly developed materials are promising for applications as electrode/substrate materials in electrochemical supercapacitors.
