Carbon based electrode materials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene, exhibit an excellent potential for supercapacitor electrodes. Morphology control is an effective approach to create the abundant ion paths and highly porous structures of carbon materials. In this study, solvent-free CNTs fluid (CNTF) and graphene oxide (GO) were used to establish a facile fabrication of porous three-dimensional (3D) CNTs/graphene hybrid porous structures using a one-step self-assembly hydrothermal method. CNTF is hydrophilic and can form a homogeneous CNTF/GO aqueous solution. Moreover, CNTF acts as a cross-linker and spacer to connect adjacent graphene sheets and prevent the restacking of graphene. The unique 3D CNTF/RGO composite electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of up to 412.8 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g; further, it displays a specific capacitance of 137.3 F/g even at a high discharge rate of 10 A/g. The specific capacitance remains at 89.6% of the initial value after 10,000 charging/discharging cycles. This solvent-free fluid technique has been achieved with the direct self-assembly of 3D CNTs/graphene materials in water and can be utilized in broad applications that are potentially feasible for other 3D carbon materials.
