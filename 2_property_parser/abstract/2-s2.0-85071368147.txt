A facile and controllable synthesis approach has been established to prepare unique one-dimensional MnWO4 nanorods via cost effective CTAB-assisted sonochemical method. The variations in structure and surface morphology of MnWO4 materials with concentration of CTAB template were examined systematically through various characterization techniques. MnWO4 prepared using high concentrations (0.003 M) of CTAB displays a uniform nanorod structure. Moreover, electrochemical features of all the MnWO4 materials were assessed using cyclic voltammetric (CV) and chronopotentiometric (CP) analyses. Interestingly, the MnWO4 nanorods exhibit an outstanding performance with significantly high specific capacitance of 247 Fg-1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 and a good cycling stability with 90% retention of initial capacitance, even after 3000 continuous CV cycles at the high scan rate of 100 mV s−1 in an aqueous 1M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution. Correspondingly, the as synthesized MnWO4 materials (without calcination) exhibit the specific capacitance of 187 Fg-1 at a scan rate of 5 mVs−1 and cyclic stability analysis provides 81% of initial specific capacitance after 3000 cycles. These excellent electrochemical properties tend to formulate the possibility of utilising of calcined MnWO4 nanomaterials for advanced energy storage applications.
