Supercellulose gel and single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were used for the creation of binder-free electrode for supercapacitor application and the properties of the electrode were investigated in aqueous electrolyte. Two layers of the formed composite material were inserted on graphite current collectors and separated from each other by a separator to create a supercapacitor prototype for measurements. Different concentrations of SWCNTs were studied and 65% concentration of SWCNTs resulted in the highest specific capacitance.
