Recently new elements have been added to the distribution grids which have changed the way the grids operate; this change in performance can affect the safety and reliability of management of the distribution grids. The disadvantages due to the changes in energy production justify the search for power injection systems capable of damping these changes. It is necessary that these power injection systems change their passive performance in the grid, becoming active elements that are integrated into the management of it, obtaining not only no negative effects on the grid, but also enhancing its reliability and operating possibilities. One of the major drawbacks of renewable energy generation is the change in energy production. This justifies the search for power injection systems capable of absorbing such fluctuations. In this paper, we present an injection system capable of integrating a photovoltaic generation system as a quasi-manageable generation system, incorporating the energy storage to moderate fluctuations in the energy generated, using a set of supercapacitors. With these functions, the inverters will become active parts of the grid, developing the concept of smart grid, which is generally accepted as the evolution of the current grid towards the one that will exist in the future. The system is composed of a voltage source inverter that injects the power into the grid, while a bidirectional direct current converter regulates the charge of the supercapacitor. Â© MIDEM Society.
