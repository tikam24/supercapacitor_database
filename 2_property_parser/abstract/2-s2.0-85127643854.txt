In this paper, ZnCo2O4 nanosheets coated on nanowires were fabricated by one-step low-temperature water bath thermal method. The length of the as-prepared evenly arranged and fully separated nanowires were about 2â€“4 um. Through cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge, and other electrochemical testing methods, it is found that the structures have an excellent specific capacity and cyclic stability. At the current density of 3 A/g, the specific capacity of the structure reaches 1890 F/g and the cyclic stability of the material reaches 96.1 % after 10000 cycles at 5 A/g current density. Under the condition of the high current density of 5 A/g, the specific capacity of the ZnCo2O4//CNTs asymmetric devices is up to 180 F/g, and the cyclic stability for 10000 times is up to 97.14 %. In addition, the photocatalytic properties of the as-prepared materials were also studied, and the results show that the degradation efficiency is very good. This work provides a new strategy for preparing ZnCo2O4 materials with excellent electrode materials for supercapacitor and photocatalyst.
