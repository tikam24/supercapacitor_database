Herein, we report a facile two-step chemical bath deposition method for the preparation of NiCo2S4 nanowire arrays grown on three-dimensional graphene foams (3DGF) for advanced ECs. The porous structure of 3DGF can be used as an ideal scaffold for preparation of continuous fibrous composite electrodes and could avoid using the heavier metal collectors and binder. We realized a mixed dimensional heterostructure via direct synthesis of one-dimensional NiCo2S4 nanowires array on the seamlessly continuous spatial graphene foam, and further applied it as supercapacitor electrode materials. The unique nanowire arrays morphology results in an excellent property with a high specific capacitance of 1454.6 F g−1 (1.1 F cm−2) at 1.3 A g−1, remarkable rate performance and exceptional reversibility with a cycling efficiency of 96% after 3000 cycles at a high current density of 13 A g−1.
