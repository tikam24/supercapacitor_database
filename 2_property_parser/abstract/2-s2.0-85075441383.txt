In recent years, the tenable design and synthesis of the core/shell heterostructure as electrode for the supercapacitor, have attained a huge attention and concerns. In this article, the three-dimensional heterostructure consisting of FeCo2O4 ultrathin nanosheets grown on the space of vertical Co3O4 nanowires has been designed and synthesized onto nickel foam (NF) for pseudocapacitive electrode applications. According to previous research, the NF@ FeCo2O4 electrodes can only exhibit specific capacity of 1172 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. In addition, although the capacity of the NF@Co3O4 electrodes can reach to 1482 F g−1 and it has the disadvantage of agglomeration, which restricts the diffusion of ions and has a negative effect on the progress of electrochemical reactions. Therefore, a core-shell nanostructure is fabricated by an improved two-step hydrothermal process, which improves the probability of ion reaction with more efficient charge transfer. Furthermore, in as-prepared unique core/shell heterostructure, the resultant electrode possesses the merits of large capacitance of 1680 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, an excellent rate capability of 70.1% at 20 A g−1 and only 9.8% loss of initial capacitance at a high charge/discharge current density after 2000 cycles. These results demonstrate that this kind of distinct electrode has potential utilization for supercapacitor.
