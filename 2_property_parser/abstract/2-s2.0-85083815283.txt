The polyaniline coated CoFe Prussian blue analogue(CoFePBA@PANI) composites were synthesized to seek high electrochemical performance. The structure and morphology of CoFePBA@PANI composite were characterized by XRD, FTIR, SEM and TEM. The electrochemical properties of CoFePBA@PANI composite were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge test and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). By using phytic acid (PA) as a chelating agent, the PANI is coated on the surface of CoFePBA to form the CoFePBA@PANI composite with core-shell structures. In the mixed acidic electrolyte of 0.5 mol/L Na2SO4 and H2SO4, the CoFePBA@PANI composite exhibits specific capacitances as high as 401.2 F/g and 367.3 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g and 10 A/g, respectively.
