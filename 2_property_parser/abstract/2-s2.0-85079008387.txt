This paper presents a power management scheme of the hybrid energy storage system using a battery and a supercapacitor. The proposed control strategy saves the battery from high discharging currents during the acceleration of the electric vehicles (EV) and thereby improves the battery life. The peak current is provided by the supercapacitor. And hence saving the battery from high discharging rates and also maintaining the DC link voltage profile during transient loading.
