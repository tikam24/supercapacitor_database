This article reports the production of Mn3O4@C nanocomposites as electrodes for high-performance supercapacitor applications. A facile and low-cost synthesis method combining DC arc discharge and annealing in air at different temperatures is used. The influence of the oxidation temperatures on product microstructure and electrochemical performance is studied in detail. The Mn3O4@C nanocomposite obtained under 200 °C annealing owns the highest specific capacitance of 422 Fg-1, with a specific energy density of 36 Whkg−1 and excellent stability after 1000 cycles. The enhanced electrochemical response is attributed to a well-defined core-shell structure that has a defect-enriched carbon shell and pseudocapacitive Mn3O4 core. Carbon promotes the ion exchange with electric double-layer capacitance, while Mn3O4 contributes the pseudocapacitance during its faradaic redox reactions.
