Mixed transition metal oxides with hierarchical and porous structures are considered to be the promising electrodes for high-performance supercapacitors. Nickel-Tin-Oxide (NiSnO3) thin films are deposited by spray pyrolysis for electrochemical supercapacitors. These films are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy and UV–Vis spectrophotometer. XRD patterns confirm formation of Perovskite NiSnO3. NiSnO3 thin films show flake and spongy type of morphology. The band gap energy is found to be in the range of 3.31–3.56 eV. The pseudocapacitive behavior of NiSnO3 electrodes has been investigated through cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements in 2 M aqueous KOH. NiSnO3 electrode shows maximum specific capacitance of 386 F g− 1 at scan rate 20 mV s− 1. Further, 92.63% retention in specific capacitance is observed after 1000 charge/discharge cycles. EIS study reveals low solution and charge transfer resistance. These features make NiSnO3 electrode attractive for high-performance supercapacitors.
