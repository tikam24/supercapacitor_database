Graphene materials including porous few-layered graphenes are under focus of scientific community today. The great attention towards them is caused by their remarkable properties. Here, we use two different fluorinated graphite intercalation compounds with different fluorine content in their matrices to prepare thermally exfoliated fluorinated graphites and to investigate them in terms of their structural, spectroscopic and electrochemical properties as materials for use in supercapacitors. A higher temperature of low-fluorinated graphenes preparation resulted in higher exfoliation degree and higher gravimetric capacitance in supercapacitor appliances. More dramatic leap of gravimetric capacitance was observed after a treatment in a concentrated acid mixture of graphene material samples prepared at the highest temperature of thermolysis with highest exposition time.
