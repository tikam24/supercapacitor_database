Porous carbon materials are widely used in capacitive energy storage devices because of their chemical stability, low cost, and controllable textures. Molten salt self-template methods are powerful and sustainable synthesis strategies for preparing porous carbons with tunable pore textures and surface chemistries. Herein, we propose a self-template synthesis strategy for preparing oxygen-rich porous carbons (ORC) by directly carbonizing potassium chloroacetate (ClCH2COOK) as the single carbon source. The potassium chloride salts generated in the carbonization play the roles of the template and etchant agent in the pore formation process. The as-prepared ORC samples feature abundant mesopores (average pore sizes of 1.95-2.19 nm and mesopore ratio of 36.4%), high specific surface areas (1410-1886 m2 g-1), and high oxygen doping levels (4.3-8.2 atom %). The zinc ion hybrid capacitors with an ORC cathode exhibited an ultrahigh capacitance of 308 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 and a high energy density of 136.5 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 570 W kg-1. Density functional theory demonstrates that oxygen-containing functional groups are conducive to the adsorption of Zn ions. Our work proposes a general synthesis methodology for the synthesis of oxygen-rich porous carbons for a variety of electrochemical energy storage devices.
