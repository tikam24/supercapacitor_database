The current investigation deals about the preparation of porous graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4/GCN) nanosheets and fabrication of zinc antimonate (ZnSb2O6/ZSO) nanorods integrated porous g-C3N4 nanosheets to study their electrochemical performance as electrode materials for supercapacitors. The electrochemical properties of porous GCN nanosheets and GCN/ZSO nanocomposite electrodes were investigated using CV, GCD and EIS studies in 1.0 M Na2SO4 solution. The prepared porous GCN nanosheets delivered a maximum specific capacitance of 244.75 F g− 1 at a current density of 1.0 A g− 1 with maximum capacitance retention of 98.0% at a current density of 2.5 A g− 1, respectively. The fabricated nanohybrid electrode material exhibited substantial electrochemical performance by delivering a maximum specific capacitance of 557.5 F g− 1 at a current density of 2.5 A g− 1 with maximum capacitance retention of 100.0% at a current density of 10.0 A g− 1, respectively. These enhanced electrochemical properties are due to the synergistic interaction between porous GCN nanosheets and ZSO nanorods, and presence of more number of electrochemical active sites from nanorods as well as nanoporous structures. Hence, it is evident that porous GCN nanosheets and GCN/ZSO nanocomposites can be proficient candidates as supercapacitor electrode materials.
