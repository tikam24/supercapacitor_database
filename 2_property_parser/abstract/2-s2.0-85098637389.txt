A developing country that does not have adequate energy solutions in non-interconnected zones (ZNIs) undoubtedly experiences adverse effects in terms of its competitiveness, as well as economic and social development. The primary sources of electrical energy in these communities are diesel generators, which are expensive and not environment-friendly. This paper seeks to describe how to reduce the consumption of this fossil fuel in ZNIs. The technical and economical implementation of a small-scale photovoltaic system with and without a hybrid energy storage system connected to the grid is studied, based on the incentive policy of the Colombian regulation. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming optimization model was developed, which includes the storage costs of a lead-acid battery and supercapacitor, to analyze the benefits of the electricity tariff and to maximize the revenues of the photovoltaic generation system. The conclusions of this study offer policy suggestions and economic incentives to enhance the use of renewable energy sources in the ZNIs of Colombia.
