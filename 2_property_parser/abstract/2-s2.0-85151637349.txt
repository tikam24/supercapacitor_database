For wearable electronic devices, supercapacitors are considered a promising power source due to their excellent magnetic properties and capacitive performance as well as their rapid charging/discharging capacity and durable stability. A smart supercapacitor, compared to a conventional supercapacitor, has a healable ability that can satisfy the power needs of electronic devices, making it hot spot research. This chapter discusses the various materials for healable electrodes and their preparation methods. This chapter also focuses on various fabrication techniques and design principles. As a result, flexible and implantable electronics require supercapacitors that have intrinsic self-healing, stretchability, and biodegradability after full utilization. This chapter presents an overview of the academic literature, lectures, and publications published in recent years to provide up-to-date data on the preparation of electrodes, design, fabrication, and applications of healable supercapacitors. Further the current challenges in the development of healable supercapacitors are also discussed.
