This paper describes and analyzes a conceptual design of a bioenergy system for sustainable electricity production from low-grade biomass resources such as forest and agricultural residues, which is suitable for rural areas in developing regions susceptible to intermittent electricity supply. In order to make it a closed-loop system, the paper also identifies a bio-refining strategy focusing on production of high-grade activated carbons for energy storage using supercapacitor.
