Conjugated mesoporous/microporous polymers (CMPs) were incorporated onto the surfaces of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNT) to form MWNT@CMPs. The morphologies of MWNT@CMP composites varied with the adjustment of starting monomers for the preparation of polymers. These core-shell MWNT@CMPs composite materials have large specific areas (>1000m 2 g -1 ) and pore volume (1.3cm 3 g -1 ). The highest specific capacitance of these composite materials reaches 248.4 F/g in 6 M KOH electrolyte. It is 269% higher than the control porous carbon. By carbonization of CMPs moieties on MWNT@CMPs, N and S doped MWNT@CMP-C composite materials were obtained accordingly. The capacitance was enhanced dramatically by the carbonization treatment due to the increase of electrochemical sites during calcination. This study provides a method to enhance the electric performance of CMPs based materials, and the supercapacitor mechanism was proposed as well.
