As a novel energy storage device, supercapacitors with characteristics of large capacitance, high power density and long cycle life can meet the high requirements of energy storage units, having applied in portable instruments, data memory storage systems and electromobile, etc. However, a relatively low energy density limits the further employment of supercapacitors. This paper expounded the concept, composition and energy storage mechanism of supercapacitors in detail, and introduced the advantages and disadvantages of different types of supercapacitors as energy storage components. Meanwhile, the influence of electrode material and structure on the energy density and specific capacitance of aqueous supercapacitors were also discussed, and the problems existing in the current supercapacitors and the direction of future development were analyzed and summarized.
