The variety of load working conditions and complex energy interaction between trains, substations and energy storage systems (ESSs) in urban rail network bring challenges for improving performance of ESS. In this paper, a scene-segmentation based energy management strategy is proposed, which takes full advantage of the pre-designed train diagram and regularity of multi-train operation. This strategy adjusts charge/discharge threshold of ESS according to real-time scenario, which is classified via multi-train operation states, and supercapacitor capacity is well allocated during the complete scene sequence so as to minimize the overall energy consumption and voltage drop. The proposed strategy is validated through simulation of a specific scene sequence where two trains running towards each other. Result shows that compared with the fixed-threshold strategy, the scene-segmentation based strategy achieves better energy-saving and voltage stabilization effects.
