For microgrid with photovoltaic generation and hybrid energy storage system, if the impact load appears, the voltage and frequency fluctuation of the system will become greater due to the absence of large grid support, affecting the reliability and stability of power supply. To solve this problem, Lithium-ion capacitor with high power density characteristic is used to track and compensate the active and reactive currents of impact loads. In addition, model current predictive control method is applied to the control of Lithium Ion capacitor inverter. Through the simulation analysis, the voltage and frequency of system can fluctuate within permitted range after the hybrid energy storage tracked and compensated impact loads, which greatly ensures the system's transient stable operation. The experimental platform of distributed hybrid energy storage is constructed to verify the effectiveness of the model current predictive control method.
