We report on the development and characterization of high performance supercapacitor electrodes synthesized using electrophoretic deposition of graphene, upon which the poly(pyrrole)-layer was electropolymerised. The highly capacitive electrode had a specific capacitance of 1510 F g−1, area capacitance of 151 mF cm−2 and volume capacitance of 151 F cm−3 at 10 mV s−1. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
