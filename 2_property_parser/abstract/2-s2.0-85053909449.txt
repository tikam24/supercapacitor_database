Supercapacitor is a kind of novel environmental friendly energy storage device between battery and traditional physical capa-citor. Recently, supercapacitor has attracted widely attention from researchers. Electrode material is the core component of the supercapacitor, therefore it has higher research value. Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) based carbon nanofibers have become the hot issue of research in supercapacitor electrode materials due to their good electrospinning property, high carbonization yield, excellent nanostructure, ultrahigh specific surface area, outstanding electrical conductivity and stability. In this review, the polyacrylonitrile (PAN) based carbon nanofibers electrode materials with crosslinked structure and porous structure, electrode materials doped by other element and composite electrode materials with carbon materials, conductive polymer or metal oxide are mainly introduced. The future research directions of polyacrylonitrile based carbon nanofibers electrode materials are also proposed.
