Recently, conducting polymers (CPs) have economic importance because of their functional elements, good environmental stability, flexibility, and electrical conductivity as well as because of their useful mechanical, optical, and electronic properties. In conducting polymer nanocomposites, polymer function as a matrix and different nanofillers are embedded in the matrix results in the formation of new material and can be used in various applications as per requirement. Some of the applications of conducting polymer nanocomposite include: conducting adhesives, electrostatic materials, electromagnetic shielding materials, transistors, supercapacitors, sensors, diodes, etc. This review includes some of the important applications of conducting polymers with nanofibers and nanotubes in sensors, field effect transistors, nanodiodes, field emission, energy storage, actuators, and super capacitors.
