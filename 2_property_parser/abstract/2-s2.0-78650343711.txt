In this paper, an energy recovery system with Electric Double-Layer Capacitor (EDLC) for motor drive systems is presented. The basic principle of the proposed control scheme and the energy losses consumed in an energy recovery system are discussed in detail. Digital computer simulation results indicate that the energy-saving effect by the injection molding machine was improved by 49%. Â© 2010 IEEE.
