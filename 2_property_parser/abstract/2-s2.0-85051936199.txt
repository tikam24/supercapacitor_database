Here we proposed novel NiCo2O4 nanowires on carbon black layer that used as a superior electrode for supercapacitors, with an excellent pseudocapacitive performance. The NiCo2O4 nanowires-based electrode provide high values of specific capacitance of 3.31 F/cm2 corresponding to the current densities of 5 mA/cm2. The symmetrical supercapacitor based on NiCo2O4 nanowires-based electrode have a high areal specific capacitance of 42.6 mF/cm2 corresponding to the current densities of 0.5 mA/cm2. It exhibited good cycling life that the specific capacitance maintained with no decrease during 50000 cycles. Our work can be applied in mass applications of high-capacitance energy-storage supercapacitors.
