Composites of Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP) with Li+ ion containing polymer polyethylene oxide (PEO), viz. 5LiCF3SO3-95[PEO1−xLATPx], are prepared in a wide composition range (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.7). A maximum conductivity of ~ 10−4 Ω−1 cm−1 at 45 °C has been achieved for a composition x = 0.7 (70 LATP). With increase in LATP content, Li+ ion transport number systematically increases, i.e., from ~ 0.12 for 0 LATP to 0.46 for 70 LATP. Ionic mobility also exhibits a gradual rise with LATP content and attains a value ~ 2 orders of magnitude higher for 70 LATP than 0 LATP. Further, the K-edge energy of ether oxygen, obtained from X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectra, does emphasize decoupling of Li+ ions from PEO matrix, particularly for large LATP content. Our investigations suggest that such hybrid films are competitive candidates for solid ionic devices. All-solid-state supercapacitors fabricated using these films demonstrate a capacity of ~ 2–4 F-g−1.
