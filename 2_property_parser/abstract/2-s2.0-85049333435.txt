Abstract: In this study, we report a facile hydrothermal method for the synthesis GNS/VS2 nanosheets in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) or urea is used as the alkali agent to produce Mn-Co layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles. Then, MnCo2O4 arrays on GNS/VS2 nanosheets to form GNS/VS2/MnCo2O4 three component hybrid as an active material for suitable-performance supercapacitor electrode. This unique structural exhibiting specific capacitances of 414.76 F g−1 at current density of 1 A g−1 with long cycle stability (nearly 88.52% specific capacitance retains after successive 1000 charge/discharge cycle).
