This study involves the preparation of ruthenium oxide (RuO2) thick films by a different method than those reported in the literature and the investigation of their dielectric properties. The substrates were coated with RuO2 thick films deposited using a mixture of invertase enzyme and ruthenium ions dissolved in water. Scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was employed for surface analysis of the films. Current/potential measurements were used to examine dielectric properties and X-ray diffraction to examine structural properties. The capacitance per unit mass of RuO2 thick films produced with invertase enzyme in amorphous structure was found to be 845 F gâˆ’1. Regarding energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis, thick films were found to contain around 79.15% ruthenium, evenly distributed on the surface of the films. In addition, we performed capacitance measurements for different temperatures and got very interesting results.
