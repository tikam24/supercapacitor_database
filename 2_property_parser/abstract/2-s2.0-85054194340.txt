Hierarchically porous bowknot-like sodium doped Ni 2 P 2 O 7 -Co 2 P 2 O 7 structures have been successfully prepared via a hydrothermal route using sodium tartaric as guiding reagent and subsequent calcination in air. The bowknot-like sodium doped Ni 2 P 2 O 7 -Co 2 P 2 O 7 possesses porous characteristics building of nanoparticles. These bowknot-like sodium doped Ni 2 P 2 O 7 -Co 2 P 2 O 7 have surface area of 45.32 m 2 g −1 . The unique porous bowknot-like structures can promote the contacting area between electrode materials and electrolyte, and provide rich channels for ions and electrons transport. Electrochemical measurements reveal that the bowknot-like sodium doped Ni 2 P 2 O 7 -Co 2 P 2 O 7 exhibit a specific capacity of 295.2 C g −1 at 2.0 A g −1 , and excellent cycling performances with 98.8% initial capacity retention after 2000 continuous cycles. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor device was assembled by utilizing the sodium doped Ni 2 P 2 O 7 -Co 2 P 2 O 7 and activated carbon as cathode and anode, respectively. The device delivers a high energy density of 54.1 Wh kg −1 at a power density of 1700 W kg −1 . Impressively, the energy density can still reach up to 35.7 Wh kg −1 at 6778.5 W kg −1 . These remarkable electrochemical performances demonstrate that the bowknot-like sodium doped Ni 2 P 2 O 7 -Co 2 P 2 O 7 are promising electrode material for supercapacitors.
