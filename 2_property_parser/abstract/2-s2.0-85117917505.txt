In recent years, studies on conjugated polymers have strengthened the researchers' thought that such polymers can play an essential role in developing new generation energy storage devices. Hence conjugated polymer supercapacitor studies have accelerated. In the present work, selenophene-containing conjugated polymers previously synthesized via palladium-catalyzed Suzuki polymerization reaction were used in the preparation of conjugated polymer-based supercapacitor electrodes. The structure and surface morphology of conjugated polymers were determined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The selenophene-containing two conjugated polymer electrodes (ITO/Polymer) were fabricated. The electrochemical behavior of the conjugated polymer electrodes was evaluated through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The specific capacity of ITO/CP1 electrode at 5 mV/s are 161.2 and 47 (Fg−1) for 0.1 mg and 1.2 mg, respectively. The specific capacity of ITO/CP2 at 5 mV/s electrode are 511 and 108.85 (Fg−1) for 0.08 mg and 0.70 mg, respectively. The time constants were determined as 10 and 625 ms for ITO/CP1 and CP2/ITO electrodes, respectively.
