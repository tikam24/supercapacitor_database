A simple and cost-efficient microwave route has been adopted to synthesize CuO/MoS2/rGO (CuMG) nanostructure as a potential electrode for supercapacitor. The morphological investigation indicates that the nanoflakes of bare CuO are decorated with the layered MoS2/rGO nanostructures. CuMG composite exhibits a higher specific capacitance of 1445 F g−1 @1 A g−1 compared to 535 F g−1 @1 A g−1 for CuO. This result demonstrates that the addition of MoS2/rGO to CuO initiates the rapid migration of electrolyte ions. Moreover, this interesting nanocomposite possesses good cyclic stability; i.e. only 9.1% loss after 3000 charge-discharge cycles at the high-applied current of 30 A g−1. The excellent electrochemical properties of CuMG extend its usage as high performance electrode materials in next-generation energy storage applications.
