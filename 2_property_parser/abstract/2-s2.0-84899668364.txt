According to the grid guidelines for wind power grid integration, the grid-connected wind turbines must have low voltage ride through (LVRT) capability. However, the traditional LVRT control method with DC-bus discharge circuit consumed extra power on the resistor in the form of heat energy, and reduced the efficiency of the system, and increased the environment temperature and the difficulty in the thermal design. To deal with the problems, supercapacitor energy storage system with the features of high rate charge and discharge capabilities was applied to the squirrel cage full scale power converter wind turbine system. By utilizing these features, the power fluctuation of wind turbine could be controlled. Firstly, the parameters design of the supercapacitor energy storage system was given. Then, the coordination control strategies for each sub-systems of wind turbine system were presented. Furthermore, the switchover processes for the transient control were presented in details. Simulations and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the parameter design method and control strategy. Â© 2014 Chin. Soc. for Elec. Eng.
