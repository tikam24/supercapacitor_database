One-dimensional MnO2@C@Ni(OH)2 core–shell nanowires were successfully synthesized by simple hydrothermal and chemical bath method. The MnO2@C@Ni(OH)2 core–shell nanowires showed a high capacitance of 1595.4 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 as supercapacitor electrode material. After 6000 cycles, the cyclic reservation rate was about 82.3%, informing the good cycling stability. The asymmetric supercapacitor composed of MnO2@C@Ni(OH)2 as positive electrode and activated carbon as negative electrode exhibited high energy density of 39.78 Wh kg−1. This research provides that the fabricated MnO2@C@Ni(OH)2 core–shell nanowires will be the promising supercapacitors materials in the future.
