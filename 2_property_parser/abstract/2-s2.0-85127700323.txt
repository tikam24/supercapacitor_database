In the present study, the 1-(2-furyl)acryloylferrocene was prepared as a suited scaffold for Diels–Alder reaction with graphene oxide. In order to increasing of conductivity, the ferrocenyl functionalized graphene oxide (GO-FcFu) was physically mixed with polypyrrole. Polypyrrole as an organic polymer was obtained by oxidative polymerization of pyrrole. The obtained GO-FcFu/PPy nanocomposite were tested as hybrid supercapacitor with dual features of electrical double layer capacitance and pseudocapacitive arising from GO and ferrocene species, respectively. The improved surface area (33.41 m2 g−1), high mass specific capacity of 231.31 mAh g−1 (1 A g−1), and the capacity retains 89% of initial capacity after 5000 cycles were estimated the sufficiency of final composite for use as electrode material.
