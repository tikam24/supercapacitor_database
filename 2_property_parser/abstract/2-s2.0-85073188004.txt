Aiming at the complexity and diversity of energy management for HEV(hybrid electric vehicle) with hybrid power, taking the State of Charge of power battery and ultracapacitor as state variable, the torque distribution ratio between engine and motor, and the power distribution ratio between power battery and ultracapacitor as control variables, the fuel economy and emission performance as objective function, the Dynamic Programming (DP) control strategy for HEV with hybrid power is proposed. The working rules of the engine, motor, battery and ultracapacitor, are extracted from the results, and the rules of engine and motor and the fuzzy control of storage battery and supercapacitor are optimized. The simulation results showed that the fuel economy performance and emission performance is increased by 13% and 27.74% respectively compared with the original control strategy, which proves the accuracy and validity of proposed control strategy for HEV with hybrid power.
