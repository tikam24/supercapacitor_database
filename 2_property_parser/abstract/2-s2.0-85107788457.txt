Ambient plasma is applied to carbon nanofiber (CNF) and investigated for flexible supercapacitor applications. For the flexible supercapacitor applications, gel electrolyte and nickel foam as a supporting collector electrode were used. The plasma treatment increases active surface area of CNF by three times and decreases electrochemical charge-transfer resistance dramatically from 9.5 to 3.7 Ω. Resultant capacitances of 210 ± 3 Fg−1 and 129 ± 1 Fg−1 (0.5 Ag−1) in three-electrode system and two-electrode system, respectively, are obtained with high specific energy of 11.5 Whkg−1 and specific power of 200 Whkg−1. Finally, it shows reliable flexibility as well as high specific capacitance retention (84%) and coulombic efficiency (81%) after 10,000 cycles. The result demonstrates that the as-prepared materials may be suitable for flexible all-solid-state supercapacitor devices.
