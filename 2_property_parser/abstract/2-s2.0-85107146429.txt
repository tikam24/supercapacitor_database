Copper oxide-decorated polyaniline nanofibers (CuO@PANiNFs) nanocomposite was prepared through in situ chemical deposition of CuO nanoparticles on the PANiNFs. The results of spectroscopic analyses suggested the presence of strong interfacial interactions between CuO nanoparticles and PANiNF matrix, while X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed the formation of CuO monoclinic crystal phase on PANiNFs. SEM images displayed a uniform dispersion of CuO nanoparticles on the surface of PANiNFs. The highest specific capacitance of 486.9 F/g and area specific capacitance of 169 F/cm2 at 0.5 mA/cm2 were achieved for the CuO@PANiNFs nanocomposite. This could be ascribed to the low solution resistance and charge-transfer resistance of nanocomposite electrode as observed in the electrical impedance spectroscopic results. The CuO@PANiNFs electrode revealed good cyclic stability with ~82% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles. The CuO@PANiNFs electrode delivered a maximum energy density of 67.7 Wh/kg, which is nearly 1.8 times higher than that of the pure PANiNFs electrode. Therefore, the present CuO@PANiNFs nanocomposite with high specific capacitance and energy density could be used as a cost-effective, ecofriendly, and sustainable supercapacitor electrode material.
