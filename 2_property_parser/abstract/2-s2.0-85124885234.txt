The search for new superior electrode materials and modifications of electrolyte portions is one of the most significant responsibilities in developing supercapacitors. To enhance the cell voltage and efficiency of supercapacitors, we propose using activated Samanea saman wood shell carbon as an electrode and a new unique copper metal complex as an electrolyte for the first time. We synthesized a sheet-like structure of activated Samanea saman wood shell carbon using a pyrolysis process and synthesized a new novel copper metal complex bound with the H2SO4 electrolyte in this combination fabrication for a supercapacitor (RESC). The redox couple aided SC exhibits an outstanding electrochemical performance that is attributed to the maximum specific capacitance value of 599 F g-1 and long lifespan of 98.9% specific capacitance after 8500 charge-discharge cycles in the half (three-electrode)-cell configuration. The activated carbon as cathode, graphite as anode, and gel formation of the copper metal complex bound with H2SO4 electrolyte were used to construct the (RESC) supercapacitor device. This RESC device achieved 70.7 W h kg-1 energy density and power density of 534.75 W kg-1. The combination of activated carbon electrode material and copper metal complex mediator provided the way for the development of a more efficient material for supercapacitors (SCs).
