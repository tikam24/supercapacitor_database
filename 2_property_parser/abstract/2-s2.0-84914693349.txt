The article concerns an analysis of phase and magnitude resonance conditions for a series RLC circuit with supercapacitor. Supercapacitor behavior differs from classic dielectric capacitors, therefore their mathematical models are more complicated, using, in particular, fractional calculus. Simple, fractionalâ€” order model has been taken into analysis and simulations. Results have been verified experimentally. Proper selection of the resonance circuit parameters R, L, RS and C determines either phase or magnitude resonance.
