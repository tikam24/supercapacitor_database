Heterostructured Co(OH)2/CuCo2S4/Ni foam electrodes are prepared by using hydrothermal deposition and electrodeposition under optimized conditions and characterized systematically. The nanostructure electrode prepared on the nickel foam provides abundant reaction sites and short diffusion paths for redox reactions and delivers high energy storage performance in supercapacitors due to the suitable mass load and unique morphology. The symmetrical supercapacitor assembled with Co(OH)2/CuCo2S4 shows a high energy density of 52.2 Wh kg−1 at 1236.3 Wh kg−1 and maximum power density of 5530.9 Wh kg−1 at 16.9 Wh kg−1. The excellent properties indicate that Co(OH)2/CuCo2S4 has enormous potential in multifunctional devices such as supercapacitors.
