Based on the search for a novel method to modulate the texture properties of porous carbon, it is essential to demonstrate the relative influence of texture and fuel properties (i.e., the general term of volatile, fixed carbon, ash, elements, and calorific value) of carbonaceous matter. Herein, H3PO4 activation was applied to fabricate pine sawdust-derived porous carbons (PC-T; T can be 450, 500, 550, and 600) with various fuel and texture properties. Afterward, the pore architectures recorded for PC-T were adjusted using the CO2 activation procedure; that is, PC-T-derived porous carbons (PC-TC) were obtained. PC-TC showed a significant increase in texture properties (e.g., specific surface area and total pore volume) and specific capacitance compared to PC-T. In the three-electrode configuration, PC-550C achieved high specific capacitance values (e.g., 230.78 F/g at 0.5 A/g). The assembled PC-550C-based symmetrical supercapacitor achieved an impressive specific capacitance of 172.12 F/g upon 0.5 A/g. Interestingly, it equally delivered high energy density (23.91 Wh kg−1) and power density (47.30 kW kg−1), respectively. Further, the specific surface area of the PC-TC samples depends not only on the fuel properties of the PC-T samples but also on the texture properties of the PC-T samples. Superior fabricability and variable texture properties enable the two-pronged strategy (i.e., sequential H3PO4–CO2 activation) for producing bulk senior and multi-level porous carbons.
