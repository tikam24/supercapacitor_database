At present, nanostructures with excellent morphology have become a research hotspot. With the deepening of research and the rapid development of nanotechnology, nanosemiconductors have also made remarkable progress. In recent years, ZnWO4 in metal tungstates has been widely used in many fields, which is mainly due to its high crystal density, short radiation length, excellent optical properties, good radiation damage resistance, and non-liquefaction. Therefore, herein, the synthesis methods and applications of ZnWO4 semiconductor materials in recent years are reviewed. First, the crystal structure and characteristics of ZnWO4 are described, and then the latest research progress of ZnWO4 semiconductor materials is summarized. The synthesis methods and contributions to photocatalysis, sensors, electronic materials, and luminescent materials are highlighted. The characteristics of ZnWO4 nanoarrays and their applications in supercapacitors are particularly emphasized, which provide a reference for the development of multifunctional nanoarrays. Finally, the challenges and countermeasures of ZnWO4 semiconductor materials are summarized and prospected. In a word, a new idea and strategy to design and assemble new types of ZnWO4 nanomaterials with multiconstructional systems and multifunctional properties for their practical applications is provided.
