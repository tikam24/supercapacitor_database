Ultrathin CoMn 2 O 4 nanosheets grown on nickel foam have been prepared via a facile hydrothermal route with post-annealing treatments, and further investigated as a binder-free electrode for supercapacitors. Benefiting from the directing growth in current collector, porous structure and enough spaces between the neighbors nanosheets, CoMn 2 O 4 electrode show enhanced capacitance performance with a specific capacitance of 1529 and 670 F g -1 at current densities of 2 and 50 A g -1 , respectively, with a good cycling ability (100% of the initial specific capacitance remains after 3000 cycles). These results show that CoMn 2 O 4 nanosheets with the nickel foam substrate obtained from this cost-effective synthesis route would have great potential applications in supercapacitors.
