Hydrogen energy is an important clean energy to alleviate the global energy crisis, and photovoltaic hydrogen production is an important way to generate hydrogen. However, due to the environmental impact, photovoltaic hydrogen production has the problem of day and night intermittency. In view of the above problems, this paper adopts the combination of photovoltaic and supercapacitor to supply power to ensure that the hydrogen production system can work uninterruptedly. The system consists of photovoltaic panels, supercapacitors, DC/DC conversion devices and electrolyzers. Under the premise of smooth power supply, a photovoltaic system control strategy and a supercapacitor constant voltage control strategy to achieve maximum power point tracking are proposed to maximize the utilization of hydrogen production in photovoltaic systems. By simulating the actual light intensity, a supercapacitor photovoltaic hydrogen production system is established in matlab/Simulink simulation software. The feasibility of the system and control strategy is verified by simulation.
