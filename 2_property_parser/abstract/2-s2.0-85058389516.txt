Supercapacitors with high energy density and long cycle life without decay in the consecutive bending operation are urgently required for the next generation of wearable electronic devices. Here, we report a high-voltage flexible supercapacitor with enhanced energy density, which can be attributed to the tailored hierarchical carbon (HC) electrode materials and organic gel electrolyte. HC derived from MOF@graphene is synthesized via a facile and environmentally friendly process, where MOF derived porous carbon polyhedra are in situ anchored on the graphene surface to form a hierarchical nano-architecture. The HC shows a synergistic effect of porous nanocarbon and graphene, and possesses a large surface area (2837 m2 g−1), desired meso-/micropore distribution and superior conductivity. A 3.5 V solid-state flexible supercapacitor is constructed by employing HC electrodes and EMIMBF4/PVDF-HFP gel electrolyte, and it demonstrates a superior specific capacitance (201 F g−1) and good cycle life. The energy and power densities are significantly promoted (86 W h kg−1 at 438 W kg−1 and 61 W h kg−1 at 17 500 W kg−1). Meanwhile, the flexible supercapacitor shows excellent mechanical bending performance, exhibiting negligible capacitance decay under various bending states and repeated bending cycles, representing its promising potential for application in wearable electronics.
