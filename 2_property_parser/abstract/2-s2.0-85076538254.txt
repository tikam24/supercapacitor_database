Ionic liquid-doped poly(vinylpyrrolidone), ammonium iodide (NH4I) ion conducting polymer electrolytes are prepared by solution cast technique. Ionic liquid (IL), 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium (HMImI) is then added to increase the ionic conductivity of polymer electrolytes by reducing the crystallinity of polymer electrolyte. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirms the complex formation as well as composite nature. Polarized optical microscopy affirms the reduction of crystallinity in polymer electrolyte by IL doping. Electrochemical double layer capacitors are then assembled using maximum conducting polymer electrolyte and porous carbon-based electrodes which shows excellent specific capacitance.
