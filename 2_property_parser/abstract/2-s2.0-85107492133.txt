Polyaniline is an elite conducting/conjugated polymer widely used to form the nanocomposites. Graphene nanoplatelet is a graphene derivative consisting of few graphene nanosheets. It usually comprises of up to 30â€“40 single graphene layers stacked together by van der Waals forces. This article reviews scientific trials on important features and technological solicitations of the polyaniline/graphene nanoplatelet nanocomposites. Significant properties including morphology, thermal, mechanical, electrical conductivity, sensing, capacitance, current density, solar cell efficiency, and radiation protecting of the polyaniline/graphene nanoplatelet nanocomposites have been explored. The polyaniline/graphene nanoplatelet nanocomposites have been applied for the gas sensors, solar cells, supercapacitors, and electromagnetic interference shielding.
