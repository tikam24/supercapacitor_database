Herein, we report for the first time, the synthesis of a binder-free flexible Polyaniline (PANI) and Iron Oxide (Fe3O4) nanocomposite (PANI/Fe3O4) electrode by the direct growth of active materials over carbon cloth. The carbon cloth substrate, with its three-dimensional porous structure, provides more electrolyte accessibility and acts as an effective conductive pathway for efficient electrical transport between the active materials and the current collector. The PANI/Fe3O4 nanocomposite electrode exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 365 F g−1 in a stable potential window ranging from −1 V to 0 V. Also it retains a cycling stability of 91% even after 4000 charge-discharge cycles at a constant current density of 5 A g−1. These results indicate that PANI/Fe3O4 nanocomposite electrode has a significant potential as an inexpensive anode for future electrochemical energy storage systems.
