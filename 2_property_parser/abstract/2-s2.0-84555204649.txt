With the increasingly prominent energy crisis and environmental pollution, the solar energy as a new and clean energy, has attracted much attention. Battery has a disadvantage of over-current in the traditional topology of PV system. In this paper, a novel topology of a stand-alone hybrid PV system where battery is connected with a DC bus via a parallel controller is adopted to solve the problem. Constant-voltage and current-limited control are realized by parallel controller to meet the energy storage of the system requirement and to protect the battery. Super capacitor is used to filter the PV cell output and to reduce the small charging and discharging cycle of the battery. An energy management strategy of the PV system is proposed to achieve the normal operation of the system, and to ensure the battery working in the optimal state to extend the battery lifetime. Finally, the proposed energy management strategy is verified by the results of simulation. Â© 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
