Graphene is an ideal material for energy storage application as its excellent mechanical and physical properties. 3D printed graphene materials will be widely applied in energy storage field for its precisely controllable structure and it is easy to realize large-scale preparation. In this paper, the progress of 3D printed graphene materials synthesis technology and its application in energy storage field were reviewed. The viscosity and printability of graphene ink are key factors for realizing graphene 3D printing. Scalable preparation of graphene ink with facile process, controllable concentration and additive free will be the research focus of graphene 3D printing technologies in the future. The integrated printing of graphene energy storage devices such as graphene supercapacitor, lithium-sulfur battery and lithium ion battery is the development direction in this area.
