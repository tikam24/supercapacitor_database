High farad values of ultra capacitors (UCs) are associated with very large current during charging. This paper proposes numerous switching configurations within ultra capacitor units supplying energy to load in efficient way. This reconfiguration dealt with series–parallel connections with reference of load voltage maximum and minimum limit. By using proper switching, 99% of stored energy can be delivered to load in minimum time. In normal case, only 73% stored energy could be utilized by load. Proposed scheme shows that operation will become faster, i.e., 57.67–75.68%.
