Hydrothermal crystallization was used to synthesize an advanced hybrid system containing titania and molybdenum disulfide (with a TiO2:MoS2 molar ratio of 1:1). The way in which the conditions of hydrothermal treatment (180 °C/12 h) and thermal treatment (500 °C) affect the physicochemical properties of the products was determined. A physicochemical analysis of the fabricated materials included the determination of the microstructure and morphology (scanning and transmission electron microscopy—SEM and TEM), crystalline structure (X-ray diffraction method—XRD), chemical surface composition (energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy—EDS) and parameters of the porous structure (low-temperature N2 sorption), as well as the chemical surface concentration (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy—XPS). The MoS2@TiO2 electrode shows a high specific capacitance of 325 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 and after 5000 test cycles, 99.1% of the capacitance is retained indicating excellent cycle stability and good reversibility. Moreover, MoS2@TiO2//AC ASC presents a maximum energy density of 45.5 Wh/kg at power density of 730.7 W/kg and a high energy density of 20.8 Wh/kg is still retained even at high power density of 3700 W/kg. The presented results show an enhanced supercapacitor behavior of the MoS2@TiO2 electrodes prepared using a low-cost and simple scalable process and confirm their evident potential for energy storage/conversion applications.
