The rise of personalized flexible electronics has promoted the rapid development of flexible supercapacitors due to their long service life, fast charging-discharging rates and safe operation. Different from the traditional flexible supercapacitors, the all-in-one integrated flexible supercapacitors are more resistant to deformation and lower interface resistance, which have a broader application prospect in the field of flexible electronics. This review briefly summarizes the preparation methods and electrochemical properties of some typical all-in-one supercapacitors, represented by planar and fibrous structures in recent years. Firstly, the basic understanding of traditional flexible supercapacitors and all-in-one integrated flexible supercapacitors, and the key parameters of the performance of flexible supercapacitors are introduced. Subsequently, the hydrogel matrix all-in-one supercapacitors with different functional characteristics (stretchable, self-healing and compressible) and the nonhydrogel matrix (separator, flexible membrane) all-in-one supercapacitors are discussed. Furthermore, the challenges and future development of flexible supercapacitors are considered.
