In the present investigation, as newly synthesized carbon hollow sphere (CHS) through hydrothermal process has been intercalated with as-synthesized zinc ammonium phosphate (ZnAP) @ four mass variates. The physicochemical (XRD, FTIR, Raman, SEM) and electrochemical characterizations (CV, GCD, and EIS) confirm the appropriate mass concentration of 75 mg CHS intercalated ZnAP (ZnAPCS3) enhancing the requisite properties needed for device applications in pure H2SO4. This selective hybrid composite optimization furtherance is improved by adding ambipolar redox additive [2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl (TEMPO)] in H2SO4, and the same is studied by adding unipolar redox additive in the same H2SO4 separately and their performances are reported as a first-time investigation. In half-cell studies, the specific capacity is found to be 1023 C g−1 @ 1 A g−1 in ambipolar added 2 M H2SO4, whereas it is found to be 1399 C g−1 in unipolar added. In full-cell studies, the ambipolar-based ZnAPCS3 (positrode)//reduced graphene oxide (negatrode) device delivers 268 C g−1 @ 1 A g −1 (48 Wh kg−1/320 W kg−1), whereas unipolar-based delivers 570 C g−1 (93 Wh kg−1/282 W kg−1) in the referenced potential window 0–1.8 V with their respective capacity retentions 94% for the former and 80% for the latter noted for 5000 cycles. Thus, the physicochemical/electrochemical investigations reveal the concentration dependency of CHS @ ZnAP and its performance on unipolar as well as ambipolar in H2SO4 for Ba-EC hybrid device applications are presented.
