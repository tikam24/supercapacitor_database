Activated carbon (AC) was synthesized with various weight ratios of manganese dioxide (MO) through a simple hydrothermal approach. The electrochemical performance of the synthesized activated carbon/MnO2 composites was investigated. The effect of the activated carbon/MnO2 (AM) ratio on the electrochemical properties of the activated carbon/MnO2 composites and the pore structure was also examined. The results show that the specific capacitance of the activated carbon material has been improved after the addition of MO. The as-synthesized composite material exhibits specific capacitance of 60.3 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, as well as stable cycle performance and 99.6% capacitance retention over 5000 cycles.
