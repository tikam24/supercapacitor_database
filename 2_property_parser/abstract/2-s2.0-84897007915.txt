Hierarchical entangled Co(OH)2 nanorods (NRs) are anchored on graphene foam (GF) electrodes by using a facile chemical bath deposition (CBD) method. The porous, conducting, and higher specific area access offered by the interconnected 3D graphene framework along with unique Co(OH)2 NRs morphology of electrode displays ultrahigh specific capacitance, energy and power density. The Co(OH)2/GF electrode reveals maximum specific capacitance about 1139 F g-1 at 10 A g-1 charge-discharge current density in 1 M KOH aqueous solution. Moreover, Co(OH)2/GF electrode in the symmetric supercapacitor device, reveals a high energy (13.9 Wh kg-1) with power (18 kW kg-1) density. These results promote the potential applicability of Co(OH)2/GF electrode in the supercapacitor field with effective boosting in charge transfer and storage mechanism. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd © 2014 Elsevier B.V.
