Hierarchical α-MnO2 tube-on-tube arrays (HMNTAs) are controllably synthesized by a facile hydrothermal route. HMNTAs are comprised of single-crystal [001]-oriented tetragonal nanotubes, where the branch nanotubes are assembled onto a backbone nanotube along a specific crystallographic direction, showing a unique edge-to-edge structure. Time-dependent evolution of the morphology reveals that the formation of HMNTAs undergoes a selective dissolution of δ-MnO2 nanoflakes and a coherent growth of α-MnO2 nanotubes. Additionally, the spatial structure of HMNTAs can be easily controlled from 4-fold-symmetry to 2-fold-symmetry by varying the diameter of branch nanotubes from 80 to 180 nm. Owing to remarkable structural features, the 4-fold-symmetry HMNTAs exhibit a specific capacitance of 780 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and 98% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 10 A g-1, which is superior to that of 2-fold-symmetry HMNTAs and α-MnO2 nanotube arrays. Furthermore, the prototype symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) device based on 4-fold-symmetry HMNTAs electrode exhibits high specific capacitance (213 F g-1), higher than that of the SSCs for 2-fold-symmetry HMNTAs (182 F g-1) and α-MnO2 nanotube arrays (80 F g-1). This work demonstrates a previously undescribed level of structural and functional complexity in hierarchical nanoarrays and brings new perspectives on designing novel hierarchical nanoarrays for various structure-sensitive applications.
