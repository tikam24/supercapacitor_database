The apple-pomace-based porous biochar (APPC) was prepared as electrode materials for supercapacitors utilizing hydrothermally carbonized apple pomace as carbon source and K2FeO4 as activator and modifier with the mass ratio of 1:1 (K2FeO4 to hydrothermally carbonized apple pomace) under the nitrogen atmosphere for carbonization at 800 °C for 2 h. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis showed that the as-prepared biochar, designated as APPC1–2-800, possessed a hierarchically porous framework owning a relatively higher specific surface area of 2010.16 m2 g−1, XRD and Raman spectroscopy demonstrated some extents of graphitization occurred in APPC1–2-800. Additionally, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis manifested that heteroatoms of oxygen have been successfully doped into APPC after K2FeO4 activation and modification. Electrochemical tests show that the electrochemically active specific surface area (ECSA) of the APPC1–2-800 is calculated as 1804 cm2 per square centimeter of the electrode and the APPC1–2-800 electrode has good capacitance performance in a three-electrode system, with a specific capacitance of 360.1 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. The symmetric supercapacitor assembled using the 2 identical APPC1–2-800 electrodes, denoted as SSC-APPC1–2-800, exhibits a high energy density of 16.53 W h kg−1 at an assigned power density of 250 W kg−1 and 13.17 W h kg−1 at 10000 W kg−1. The Coulombic efficiency is noted to range from 96 % to 100 % after 5000 cycles. In addition, the specific capacitance decreased by only 4.3 % after 5000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g−1, indicating preeminent cyclic stability.
