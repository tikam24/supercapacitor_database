Flower-like Ni(OH)2 nanostructured was synthesized by using simple chemical bath deposition (CBD) method as a binder-free electrode for supercapacitor. The nanowalls with thickness 50–70 nm were connected to each other forming pores, which further results in higher electrochemical performance by the virtue of easy transportation of electrolyte and ions to active mass. The maximum specific capacitance of flower-like Ni(OH)2 is found 1065 F g−1 at current density 15 mA s−1 with excellent rate capability.
