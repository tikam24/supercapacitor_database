Green Hydrogen Microgrid System has been selected as a source of clean and renewable alternative energy because it is undergoing a global revolution and has been identified as a source of clean energy that may aid the country in achieving net-zero emissions in the coming years. The study proposes an innovative Microgrid Renewable hybrid system to achieve these targets. The proposed hybrid renewable energy system combines a photovoltaic generator (PVG), a fuel cell (FC), a supercapacitor (SC) and a home vehicle power supply (V2H) to provide energy for a predefined demand. The proposed architecture is connected to the grid and is highly dependent on solar energy during peak periods. During the night or shading period, it uses FC as a backup power source. The SC assists the FC with high charge power. SC performs this way during load transients or quick load changes. A multi-agent system (MAS) was used to build a real energy management system (RT-HEMS) for intelligent coordination between components (MAS). The scheduling algorithm reduces energy consumption by managing the required automation devices without the need for additional network power. It will meet household energy requirements regardless of weather conditions, including bright, cloudy or rainy conditions. Implementation and discussion of the RT-HEMS ensures that the GHS is functioning properly and that the charge request is satisfied.
