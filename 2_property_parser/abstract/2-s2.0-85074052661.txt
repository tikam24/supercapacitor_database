A pressing need for ultrahigh area-normalized capacitance emerges from the migration to miniaturized composite supercapacitors. Herein, an advanced electric field-assisted sol–gel synthesis protocol that allows to obtain ribbon-like vanadium oxides that preferentially creep along the porous tunnels in a commercially available carbon host of low density is demonstrated. In particular, this design offers 1) to convert the original submicrometer-sized pore network into hierarchically macroporous yet 3D-interconnected bicontinuous composite frameworks and 2) to considerably add pseudo-capacitive functionalities onto a highly conductive carbon cloth backbone. Both are demonstrated by an unprecedented area-normalized capacitance exceeding 5 F cm−2. Moreover, the as-designed symmetric supercapacitor is characterized by a maximum area-normalized cell capacitance in the order of 1 F cm−2, a geometric energy density of 0.34 mW h cm−2, and a geometric power density of 28.3 mW cm−2. These features outperform commercial double-layer supercapacitors as well as many state-of-the-art composite pseudo-capacitors and lithium-ion microbatteries.
