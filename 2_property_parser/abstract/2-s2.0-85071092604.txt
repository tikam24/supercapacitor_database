In this paper, Fe–MnO2/RGO active materials were prepared by hydrothermal method. The phase composition, microstructure and electrochemical properties of the prepared Fe–MnO2/RGO composites were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, and electrochemical analysis. The results show that, the adding of Fe ions improves capacitive performance of the MnO2. It was found that the specific capacitance of Fe–MnO2 was 119 F·g−1 when the molar ratio was 4 mol%. Here, the characterizations show that the RGO plays an important role on electrochemical performances of Fe–MnO2. We find that there is an obvious enhancement in the capacitance performances of Fe–MnO2/RGO, which is improved from 119 to 144 F·g−1.
