Graphene aerogel microlattices (GAMs) hold great prospects for many multifunctional applications due to their low density, high porosity, designed lattice structures, good elasticity, and tunable electrical conductivity. Previous 3D printing approaches to fabricate GAMs require either high content of additives or complex processes, limiting their wide applications. Here, a facile ion-induced gelation method is demonstrated to directly print GAMs from graphene oxide (GO) based ink. With trace addition of Ca2+ ions as gelators, aqueous GO sol converts to printable gel ink. Self-standing 3D structures with programmable microlattices are directly printed just in air at room temperature. The rich hierarchical pores and high electrical conductivity of GAMs bring admirable capacitive performance for supercapacitors. The gravimetric capacitance (Cs) of GAMs is 213 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and 183 F g−1 at 100 A g−1, and retains over 90% after 50 000 cycles. The facile, direct 3D printing of neat graphene oxide can promote wide applications of GAMs from energy storage to tissue engineering scaffolds.
