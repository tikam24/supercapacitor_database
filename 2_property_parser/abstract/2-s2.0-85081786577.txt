Electricity has been one aspect of technology which has changed human history and the demand for it never ceases. The quantity of conventional energy sources is decreasing and in future the amount left would not be able to suffice all the needs of the ever-increasing human population. Energy storage is one of the undeniable problems which arise while using the nonconventional resources. Battery is most viable option. However, there is need to look beyond batteries. Supercapacitor is upcoming energy storage technology. Success of supercapacitor technology lies in the carbon based electrode material. Graphite has made good impact in recent past in energy sector. It is very cheap compared to many activated carbons. Use of graphite, activated carbon and metal oxide in correct proportion needs to be investigated as it is likely to reduce the cost of supercapacitor which is major hurdle in commercialization of this device. This paper presents trials of the supercapacitors made using different activated carbons, graphite and fixed proportion of metal oxide.
