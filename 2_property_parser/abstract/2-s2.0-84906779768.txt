We prepared LiNi0.4Co0.6O2 nanofibers by electrospinning at the calcination temperature of 450 °C for 6 h. The prepared LiNi0.4Co0.6O2 nanofibers was characterized by thermal, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) studies. The morphology of LiNi0.4Co0.6O 2 nanofibers was characterized by scanning electron microscopy studies. The asymmetric supercapacitor was fabricated using LiNi 0.4Co0.6O2 nanofibers as positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as negative electrode and a porous polypropylene separator in 1 M LiPF6-ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate (LiPF6-EC:DMC) (1:1v/v) as electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry studies were then carried out in the potential range of 0 to 3.0 V at different scan rates which exhibited the highest specific capacitance of 72.9 F g-1. The electrochemical impedance measurements were carried out to find the charge transfer resistance and specific capacitance of the cell, and they were found to be 5.05 Ω and 67.4 F g-1, respectively. Finally, the charge-discharge studies were carried out at a current density of 1 mA cm -2 to find out the discharge-specific capacitance, energy density, and power density of the capacitor cell, and they were found to be 70.9 F g -1, 180.2 Wh kg-1, and 248.0 W kg-1, respectively. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
