A facile room-temperature synthesis method was employed to prepare MnMoO4·0.9H2O nanorods. Electrochemical characterization showed that the sample offered a high specific capacitance of 215 F/g at a current density of 1 mA/cm2 and a low ionic resistance of 0.65 Ω. This performance was higher when compared with hydrothermally synthesized MnMoO4 which had been thermally treated at 300 °C. This makes our room temperature synthesized electrode material an attractive low cost choice for supercapacitor application.
