NiCo-layered double hydroxides (NCLDH) synthesized by a simple one pot solâ€“gel process using propylene oxide as gelation agent. Synthesized material is investigated for its crystal structure, morphology including specific surface area and electrochemical performance as supercapacitor electrodes. The specific capacitance of as-synthesized NCLDH is 1166F/g, when the electrodes undergone charge/discharge cycling in 6 M potassium hydroxide at 1 A/g specific current. Enthrallingly, retention of capacity over 1000 and 2000 cycles found up to correspondingly 80% and 64%, at relatively high 30 A/g specific current. High capacity is ascribed to uniform porous nature of the material with considerable surface area. With an appreciable cycle life and charge storage capacity, the material prepared is an able contender for supercapacitor electrodes.
