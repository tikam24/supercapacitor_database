To address the global energy and environmental crisis, advanced energy storage systems with their superior electrochemical performances have been growing exponentially. The electrochemical properties of the selected electrode materials have a direct impact on the performance of these energy storage technologies. 2D structures are considered promising materials for energy storage systems because of their unique and outstanding electrochemical characteristics. Therefore, hybridization of 2D nanosheets with other low-dimensional materials can improve storage capacity by modulating and exploiting the synergy between the same. This comprehensive review highlights energy storage devices, their mechanisms, and key problems, with a focus on electrodes made of new generation 2D hybrids. Following that, the strategies that enable face-to-point, face-to-line, and face-to-face heterointerfaces are discussed in details. In addition, a design approach is provided for synergistically coupling 2D with other quantum materials for designing efficient and long-lasting storage systems. It is anticipated that this review article will serve as helpful motivation for developing excellent energy storage devices with improved electrochemical capability.
