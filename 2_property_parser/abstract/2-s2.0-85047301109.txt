MnO2 thin films were directly grown on stainless steel mesh via a facile hydrothermal method. The structural properties revealed the formation of delta MnO2. The capacitive performance of the as-obtained MnO2 electrode was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements. The synthesized electrode showed a high specific capacitance of 321 F g-1 at 5 A g-1. The excellent electrochemical performance identifies the MnO2 as a promising electrode material for next-generation energy storage devices.
