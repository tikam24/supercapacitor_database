An intimate hybrid of carbon black/nickel cobaltite (CB/NCO) is rationally designed and successfully synthesized via a facile two-step method. Due to the unique nanostructure and strong synergistic effects between individual components, the CB/NCO hybrid electrode delivers distinctly enhanced energy-storage properties, including a high specific capacity (604.4C g−1 at 0.5 A g−1) and excellent rate capability (∼77.3% and 62.4% of initial capacity at 10 A g−1 and 20 A g−1, respectively). The excellent energy-storage properties of this low-cost hybrid can stand comparison with the hybrids of NiCo2O4 with various costly nanocarbons. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is constructed using CB/NCO hybrid and activated carbon as the positive and negative electrode, respectively. The assembled ASC device exhibits a maximum energy density of 33.7 Wh kg−1 and a high power density of 12.2 kW kg−1. Meanwhile, the ASC device also shows a satisfactory long cycle-life and long-term stability (∼90% capacitance retention after 50,000 charge-discharge cycles at 5 A g−1). On the premise of cost control, such a strategy may enlighten new design opportunities for high-performance energy storage devices based on inexpensive carbon-based materials.
