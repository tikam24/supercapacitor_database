This chapter reviews state-of-the-art development in the field of solid polymer electrolytes for supercapacitors and discusses their specific features. The main themes discussed are based on individual series of solid polymer electrolytes such as ion exchange resins, polyethers, polymer gels and nanocomposites, followed by supercapacitor types, electrode types and supercapacitors reported under various kinds of solid electrolytes. This is followed by information on hybrid supercapacitors and current research activities and finally a conclusion. Â© 2010 Woodhead Publishing Limited. All rights reserved.
