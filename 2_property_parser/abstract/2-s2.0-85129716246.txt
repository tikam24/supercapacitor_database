The application of activated carbon is greatly limited by its low energy density. Here, the angelica herb residue–based activated carbon (AHRAC) materials modified by loading NiO and MnO2 were prepared via a hydrothermal reaction, respectively. The results of structure measurements and electrochemical tests reveal that NiO is more beneficial for improving the specific capacitance (about 678.2 F g−1) and energy density (about 30 Wh kg−1) of AHRAC owing to its unique flower-like morphology and abundant porosity. In addition, combining the density functional theory calculation (DFT), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), and diffusion coefficient calculation, the difference between AHRAC@NiO and AHRAC@MnO2 was analyzed, which may be ascribed to the larger pseudo-capacitance contribution, bigger diffusion coefficient, and higher adsorption behavior for OH−. In this work, not only a porous carbon with a high specific surface area was prepared, but also the biomass waste was reused.
