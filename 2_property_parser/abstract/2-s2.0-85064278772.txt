Herein, we are reporting the enhanced electrochemical performance of hybridised WO 3 –CdS nanocomposites prepared by microwave assisted wet chemical route without post synthesis of heating for different wt% of CdS (2 wt%, 4 wt% and 6 wt%) loading with WO 3 . Then, the end products were characterized by various techniques to evaluate their structural and morphology, thermal, optical, and electrochemical properties. From the XRD analysis, the orthorhombic and monoclinic structure of WO 3 and hexagonal phase of CdS were observed and the average crystalline size is calculated as ± 19 nm. The microscopic examination such as SEM images showed smooth and tiny particle and HRTEM images showed rod shape morphology in the as-prepared particle. The presence of W and Cd elements are confirmed by EDAX analysis. The existences of functional groups related to W and Cd are analyzed by FTIR investigation and confirmed the chemical bonding nature. Thermal (TGA/DTA) analysis showed that as-prepared structures are stable up to 450°C temperature. The electrochemical investigations have been carried out, and their enhanced specific capacitances were calculated as 44 F/g for pure WO 3 (a) nanostructures and 48, 170, and 172 F/g correspondingly for the hybridised WO 3 –CdS (b, c, d) nanocomposites.
