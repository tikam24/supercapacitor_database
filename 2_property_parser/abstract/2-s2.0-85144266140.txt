Thermally reduced graphite oxide (TRGO) samples were hydrothermally deposited (120 °C, 12 h) on nickel foam current collector without any binder. TRGO of different reduction levels were synthesized through the thermal reduction of graphite oxide at 100 and 200 °C. The binding affinity of the oxygen functional groups enabled the binder free deposition. We could achieve specific capacitance Csp of 524 F/g (at 1 A/g) for Ni/TRGO200 and 136 F/g (at 1 A/g) for Ni/TRGO100 electrodes. These values are significantly larger than those till reported for binder free reduced graphite oxide electrodes. The capacitive retention of Ni/TRGO100 is 82.5 % and for Ni/TRGO200 it is 81.5 % over 1000 charge discharge cycles. Coulombic efficiency reaches 99 % and 100 % respectively for Ni/TRGO100 and Ni/TRGO200. Detailed analysis of the electrochemical storage mechanism is also reported.
