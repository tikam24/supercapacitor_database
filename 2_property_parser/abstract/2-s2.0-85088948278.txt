It is necessary to have an energy management system based on one or more control strategies to sense, monitor, and control the behavior of the hybrid energy sources. In renewable hybrid power systems containing fuel cells and batteries, the hydrogen consumption reduction and battery state of charge (SOC) utilizing are the main objectives. These parameters are essential to get the maximum befits of cost reduction as well as battery and hydrogen storage lifetime increasing. In this paper, a novel hybrid energy management system (HEMS) was designed to achieve these objectives. A renewable hybrid power system combines: PV, PEMFC, SC, and Battery was designed to supply a predetermined load with its needed power. This (REHPS) depends on the PV power as a master source during the daylight. It uses the FC to support as a secondary source in the night or shading time. The battery is helping the FC when the load power is high. The supercapacitor (SC) is working at the load transient or load fast change. The proposed energy management system uses fuzzy logic and frequency decoupling and state machine control strategies working together as a hybrid strategy where the switching over between both strategies done automatically based on predetermined values to obtain the minimum value of hydrogen consumption and the maximum value of SOC at the same time. The proposed HEMS achieves 19.6% Hydrogen consumption saving and 5.4% increase in SOC value compared to the results of the same two strategies when working as a stand-alone. The load is designed to show a surplus power when the PV power is at its maximum value. This surplus power is used to charge the battery. To validate the system, the results were compared with the results of each strategy if working separately. The comparison confirms the achievement of the hybrid energy management system goal.
