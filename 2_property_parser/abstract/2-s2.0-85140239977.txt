At present scenario, the design of newer energy storage devices primarily focuses on superior capacity, rate performance, cost-effectiveness and stability. Among the other available Bi-Transition Metal oxides (BTMO's), NiFe2O4 is a favorable material for electrochemical supercapacitor (SC) applications due to the presence of two metal moieties. The strategy of combining carbon-based material with the metal ferrite improves the electrochemical behavior. Herein, we fabricated reduced graphene oxide (rGO) decorated with NiFe2O4 nanoparticles using a commercially available microwave device. The as-prepared NiFe2O4/rGO (NG) nanocomposite exhibits a high surface area with increased porous nanoparticles that allow fast ion- diffusion which favors the electrochemical activity. Further, we have explored the use of bare and NiFe2O4/rGO samples for SC electrode application. The NG nanocomposite electrode material exhibits better electrochemical characteristics including a high specific capacity of 1320 Cg−1 at a current density of 1 Ag−1 and long cycle stability with 94% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles when compared to bare NF in alkaline (6 M KOH) electrolyte. In addition, we have assembled NG based full cell SC device using NG and activated carbon (AC) as electrodes. The fabricated SC device shows the high specific capacity and remarkable cyclic stability. It also exhibited an energy density of 75 Whkg−1 at a power density of 2343 Wkg−1 respectively. Hence, the proposed NG electrode material promotes new opportunities for utilizing this composite material as a promising electrode material for future energy storage devices.
