Nano-MnO2 powder was synthesized by inorganic salt water solution reaction of KMnO4 and MnSO4. Results of X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscope show that the phase of nano MnO2 powder prepared is the mixture of a-MnO2 and γ-MnO2 and its particle size is 4-20 nm. After calcined at 300°C for 3 h, the powder was used as active material to fabricate electrodes. The cyclic voltammograms of electrode prepared by the nano-MnO2 powder show good capacitive performance between 0.15 V and 0.75 V for saturated calomel electrode as reference electrode in 1 mol/L (NH4)2SO4. The maximum capacitance can reach to 150.4 F/g by calculating from the constant current charge/discharge curves. Discharge/charge curves are stabilized after two or three cycles, and the results demonstrate that MnO2 nano-powder has an ideal capacitance property and applications prospect as an electrode material.
