Electrode materials for supercapacitors are at present commonly evaluated and selected by their mass specific capacitance (CM, F g-1). However, using only this parameter may be a misleading practice because the electrode capacitance also depends on kinetics, and may not increase simply by increasing material mass. It is therefore important to complement CM by the practically accessible electrode specific capacitance (CE, F cm-2) in material selection. Poly[3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene] (PEDOT) has a mass specific capacitance lower than other common conducting polymers, e.g. polyaniline. However, as demonstrated in this communication, this polymer can be potentiostatically grown to very thick films (up to 0.5 mm) that were porous at both micro- and nanometer scales. Measured by both cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectrometry, these thick PEDOT films exhibited electrode specific capacitance (CE, F cm-2) increasing linearly with the film deposition charge, approaching 5 F cm-2, which is currently the highest amongst all reported materials.
