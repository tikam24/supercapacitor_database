In this work, graphitized mesoporus carbon (GMC) was used to increase the specific capacitance and cycle stability of polyaniline (PANI). Hybrid material of polyaniline-graphitized mesoporus carbon (GMCP) was prepared by in situ chemical polymerization of aniline in presence of sulphuric acid using ammonium persulfate oxidant with various amounts of GMC. Formation of hybrid sample was confirmed from X-ray diffraction, and the composite sample was stable up to 250Â°C. Morphology, crystalline nature, and electrochemical performance of GMCP were compared with that of its individual components, GMC and PANI. GMC showed particle morphology and PANI showed nanofiber morphology. GMCP2 composite showed nanofibrous form of PANI grown on GMC (spherical form) along with PANI nanofibers. Higher crystallinity was obtained for GMCP than that of PANI. Cycling stability of GMCP2 was carried up to 12,000 cycles at 1200 W kg-1 and the retention capacitance was 66% of its original capacitance of 243 F g-1. With the same power density, GMC showed less capacitance value of 53 F g-1 with 92% retention and PANI showed capacitance of 187 F g-1 and it underwent 1500 cycles only. Higher supercapacitor performance was obtained for GMCP composite compared to that of its components, PANI and GMC.
