In this paper, a multi-resonant three-port DC microgrid bus voltage controller with hybrid energy storage of super-capacitor and battery is proposed, and corresponding multi-objective control method is investigated. The LCLC multi-resonant tank can transfer the energy of fundamental and third order frequencies to increase efficiency of the converter. The resonant current combines fundamental and third harmonics, and its peak value is effectively reduced. Moreover, the energy coupling phenomenon between the super-capacitor and the battery ports in the LCLC multi-resonant three-port bidirectional DC-DC converter caused by the leakage inductance of transformer is analyzed, and the decoupling method is proposed. Besides, a driving frequency optimization control method is investigated. By adjusting the operating frequency along with the load variations, the desirable zero voltage switching (ZVS) characteristics and high efficiency are guaranteed in full load range. At the same time, a multi-objective control method is fabricated for the DC microgrid bus voltage controller. The main control objectives contain three aspects: maintaining the stability of the DC bus voltage, energy distribution of hybrid energy storage system and adjusting driving frequency for efficiency optimization. At last, a 1.5kW prototype is built, and the experimental results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed topology, parameter design and multi-objective control method.
