Flexible and foldable supercapacitor electrodes fabricated by an in situ chemical polymerization method coating PANI on the surface and inside network of the CNFs (cellulose nanofibers)/MWCNTs (multi-walled carbon nanotubes) films are reported. Due to the porous 3D network structure of the aerogel-like CNFs/MWCNTs films made by an ethanol replacement treatment method, the CNFs/MWCNTs/PANI (polyaniline) electrodes get more PANI nanofibers inside of the porous CNFs/MWCNTs films and obtain a low charge transfer resistance (6.31 Î©) and a excellent specific capacitance (249.7 F/g at 10 mV/s). The low-cost, light-weight and flexible electrode materials may be potential applications for the high-performance flexible all-solid-state supercapacitors.
