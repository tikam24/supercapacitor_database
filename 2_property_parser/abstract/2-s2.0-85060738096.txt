An energy supply system has been designed by combining the batteries with Ultracapacitor (UC) characterized as hybrid energy storage system (HESS) for a Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) /Electric Vehicle (EV). The main aim of this paper is to design an efficient and intelligent controller for a smooth switching between the two sources of HESS. In this work, UC is used to meet the peak power requirement and average power can be supplied by the battery, acts as a major source. Corresponding to the speed of an Electric motor the math function (MFB) based controller has been designed with four individual math functions. To achieve the main objective, the designed MFB controller is combined with conventional Proportional-Derivative (PD) results in the formation of a hybrid controller which is used to generate the required switching signals to the particular converter corresponding to the vehicle dynamics. Finally, the entire circuit has been designed with the hybrid controller and simulated in MATLAB/Simulink, all measured values are presented and which shows the controller action for different modes of the electric motor.
