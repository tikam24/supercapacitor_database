In this study, the application of energy management system (EMS) for a hybrid system including fuel cell stack, supercapacitor, and battery energy storage unit in an aircraft has been analyzed. The primary purposed of using the EMS is to minimize the hydrogen consumption while controlling the supercapacitor and the battery states of charge (SOCs) under some working conditions. The minimization of the EMS in this study is based on designing a new improved metaheuristic algorithm, called Chaos Red Fox Optimization (CRFO) Algorithm to improve the system efficiency in terms of convergence and global optimization terms of view. The proposed method has been then validated by comparing with some new and popular optimization algorithms in terms of hydrogen consumption to indicate its dominance. The results showed that the proposed CRFO algorithm with 18.19 g provides the minimum hydrogen consumption toward the other comparative metaheuristic algorithms. Also, the power extracted from the battery has been kept between [− 1600, 3900] W. Furthermore, the battery SOC status is limited between 80 and 42% of constraints and the battery SOC is limited between 40 to 92%. Finally, the value of the hydrogen consumption from the suggested CRFO-based EMS are compared with two start of the art methods including traditional PI control and equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) techniques to demonstrate the recommended method’s superiority.
