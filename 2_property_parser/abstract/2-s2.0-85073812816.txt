A mixed metal oxide, α-ZnMoO4 is prepared in a simple, lucid and facile synthesis route as an active material for supercapacitor applications. The structural and morphological information is provided by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, Raman and scanning electron microscopy data. The as-prepared α-ZnMoO4 microspheres are subjected to cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies to examine its electrochemical behaviour in 2 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. Zinc molybdate microspheres have demonstrated very good electrochemical performance with 234.75Fg-1 at 0.5Ag-1 with good specific capacitance retention (82%) for sustained 1600 charge/discharge cycles.
