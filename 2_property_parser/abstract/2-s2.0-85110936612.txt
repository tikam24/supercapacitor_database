Day by day, the energy storage system (ESS) has become critical due to its massive applications in real time, like a hybrid car, WSN (Wireless Sensor Network), a Capa bus, etc. The supercapacitor is gaining popularity in this relation because of high power density, low ESR (Effective Series Resistance) and rapid charging with a long-life cycle, which makes supercapacitor a hot subject for research. This paper aggregates different researchersâ€™ works on the basis of fractographic study of electrode material of supercapacitor, and also discusses characterisation of the electrical and mechanical properties of aerographite/epoxy composites under tensile load. The combined analysis of all these fractographic studies, electrical and mechanical properties help to understand the behaviour of the supercapacitor, which also throws light to enhance the capability and applicability of the supercapacitor in the real-life system.
