A novel nanostructured hybrid material PANI@MIL-101(Cr) (PANI = polyaniline, MIL-101(Cr)-trichromium oxo-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) was obtained by the intra-pore oxidative polymerization of guest aniline molecules within MIL-101. The compound was fully characterized using PXRD, TGA, FT-IR spectroscopy, XPS and SEM techniques. An introduction of PANI has dramatically increased the material's selectivity towards carbon dioxide over nitrogen with a CO2 uptake value of 2.26 mmol g-1 at 273 K (1.2 bar). Furthermore, cyclic voltammetry measurements revealed that PANI@MIL-101(Cr) is a supercapacitor with a relatively high specific capacitance value of 135 F g-1.
