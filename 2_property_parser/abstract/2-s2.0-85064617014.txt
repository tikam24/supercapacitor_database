Supercapacitors as energy storage devices show distinct advantages like high power density and high cycle stability. While in current applications, mainly the high power density is leveraged, future non-mobile storage devices could also benefit from the robustness and materials employed, while lower charging/discharging time constants are acceptable. In this study, a simulative approach is employed to investigate the complex interplay of mass transfer, electric losses, double layer capacitance for different electrode thicknesses, electrode and electrolyte conductivities as well as charging/discharging time constants. Within the simulation cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic cycling as also electrochemical impedance spectroscopy experiment could be realized, showing the dependency of achievable maximum capacitance and voltage efficiency on various properties.
