Successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR)-based room-temperature (27 °C) chemical synthesis of bismuth oxide (Bi2O3) and its ionic conversion to bismuth sulphide (Bi2S3) has been performed and reported in the present study. A chemical conversion of the bismuth oxide to the bismuth sulphide has been confirmed using changes in the structure, phase, surface elementals , and surface area measurement studies. Both bismuth oxide and bismuth sulphide electrode materials are envisaged in electrochemical measurements wherein, the later has evidenced an enhanced electrochemical performance over the prior. The cycling stability of the Bi2S3 (91% after 2000 cycles) electrode material is also better than the Bi2O3 (87% over 2000 cycles). The as-assembled Bi2S3//Bi2S3 symmetric electrochemical supercapacitor device has adduced 75.3 Wh kg−1 and 749.8 W Kg−1energy and power densities, respectively with nearly 88.8% capacitance retention efficacy even over 2000 redox cycles measured at 10 A g−1. The commercial potential of the Bi2S3//Bi2S3 has been tested by powering the display panel “CNED” consisting nearly 42 LEDs with a full-light intensity.
