Supercapacitors have recently become the focus of attention due to the exclusive features they possess as an energy storage device. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are generally known as a novel class of porous materials which can exhibit large pore volume, very good chemical stability, and high specific surface area, provided that the components are precisely selected. In this work, a ternary MnFe2O4/CNT/ZIF (MCZ) nanocomposite is prepared using a facile hydrothermal method for the application of supercapacitors devices, and the synthesized nanocomposite is used to evaluate the electrochemical properties. The surface morphology of synthesized materials is investigated through surface analysis and the results of structural analysis have proved the accuracy of nanocomposite formation that ZIF-67 nanocubes are synthesized with crystal structures with particle size of less than 500 nm and are surrounded by the CNT and MnFe2O4 nanoparticles. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were applied to investigate the electrochemical properties of the samples. This study indicates that MCZ nanocomposite has superior electrochemical performance, confirmed by the measured specific capacitance of 389 F g−1 (330 C g−1), energy density of 24.4 W h kg−1, power density of 265 W kg−1 and good cycle stability (remaining at 107% after 500 cycles) as compared to other electrodes, whereas shown lowest resistance in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The obtained results suggest that the ternary MCZ has the potential to be applied as a novel electrode material in supercapacitor applications to render high-performance and stable energy storage devices.
