Activated carbon fibers (ACFs) are one of the most promising forms of carbonaceous nanoporous materials. They are most widely used as electrodes in different energy storing devices including batteries, capacitors, and supercapacitors. They are also used in gas diffusion layers, for electrocatalyst support and in bipolar plates of fuel cells. The most favorable aspects of ACFs are their low-cost, well-organized pore structures, easy handling, high electrical conductivity, high packing density, and improved specific capacity. In this chapter, the applications of ACFs in energy storage devices are highlighted. Most notably, the use of ACFs in supercapacitors and fuel cells is focused on. The history and working principles of supercapacitors, different types of supercapacitors with pure electrostatic attraction and/or pseudocapacitance effects, and the application of ACFs in supercapacitors are presented. In addition, the working principles and types of fuel cells as well as the application of ACFs in fuel cells are also presented.
