In view of the impact load problems in the traditional micro gas turbine (MT) power generation system, this paper analyzes its working mechanism and finds the reason lies in the slow response of the micro turbine output power adjustment. In order to make up for the shortage of the instantaneous output power of micro turbine, the method of instantaneous power fast control is proposed. Control algorithm of instantaneous compensation power is raised by power response prediction of MT. The high power dynamic response of super-capacitor energy storage can compensate low dynamic response problem of MT output power, so the instantaneous power of the system is real balance to ensure that the DC bus voltage is smooth and adaptability of MT power generation system is enhanced for impact load. Finally, the correctness and feasibility of the proposed control strategy are verified by simulation results.
