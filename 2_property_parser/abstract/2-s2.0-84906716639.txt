This paper proposes the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation for subway applications with onboard supercapacitor. The studied subway train is modeled in detail, and the HIL simulation is designed. An experimental platform using the HIL simulation method is developed and experimental results are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the HIL simulation.
