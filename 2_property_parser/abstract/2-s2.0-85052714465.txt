In this paper, a decentralized energy management strategy (EMS), which is based on a modified droop control, is proposed for a fuel cell (FC)/supercapacitor (SC)-based auxiliary power unit (APU) of a more electric aircraft. The proposed EMS is able to split the load power automatically into low- and high-frequency components and allocate them to the FC and SC units, respectively. Since the proposed EMS is fully decentralized, it features high flexibility and scalability. Furthermore, the proposed strategy is not only suitable for extending the service life of the system because the protection and recovery of the state-of-charge of the SC have been considered in doing the energy management, but also can make the system accommodate the regenerative power in a lossless way. The operational principle of the proposed strategy, system design details and performance analysis are elaborated, followed by which experiments based on a 3 kW FC/SC-APU are conducted to verify its validity.
