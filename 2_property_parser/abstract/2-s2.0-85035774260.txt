We demonstrate that by a proper design of a system comprising a perovskite solar cell (PSC) coupled to an electrochemical double-layer capacitor (EDLC), it is possible to simultaneously improve both the PSC and EDLC performance and outperform each single unit behavior. Specifically, we propose a parallel connection of PSC and EDLC of different size. The EDLC buffers PSC fluctuations by storing the converted solar energy permitting for very high power output (increased by 1 order of magnitude). At the same time, the PSC improves the capacitive response of the EDLC that can be downsized towards system miniaturization.
