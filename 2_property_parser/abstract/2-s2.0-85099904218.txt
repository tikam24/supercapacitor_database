In recent years, redox additive electrolytes have been anticipated as effectual selections over modest aqueous electrolytes. In the present study, porous carbon derived from nonporous Saccharum spontaneum confirms its efficacy as a supercapacitor electrode, in the presence of an optimized redox active electrolyte. Carbon synthesized via ZnCl2 activation at 600 Â°C shows optimum performance in terms of surface area (1590 m2 g-1) and porous properties. The same is reflected in the sample for excellent energy storage performance. High capacitances of 561 F g-1 and 275 F g-1 were obtained in an aqueous 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte, for three-electrode and two-electrode configurations, respectively. Similarly, with the incorporation of 0.01 M hydroquinone (HQ), as a redox additive to the 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte, a high specific capacity was achieved for three-electrode (1392 C g-1) and two-electrode (658 C g-1) configurations. Remarkably, a good cyclic stability of 77% retention after 5000 cycles has been evidenced in a HQ-incorporated aqueous electrolyte. A similar trend is followed for energy density, power density and other relevant electrochemical properties, as well. This journal is
