Natural nacre supplies a number of properties that can be used in designing high-performance bioinspired materials. Likewise, due to the extraordinary properties of graphene, a series of bioinspired graphene-based materials have recently been demonstrated. Compared to other approaches for constructing graphene-based materials, bioinspired concepts result in high-loading graphene, and the resultant high-performance graphene-based artificial nacres demonstrate isotropic mechanical and electrical properties. In this Perspective, we describe how to construct integrated graphene-based artificial nacre through the synergistic relationship between interface interactions and building blocks. These integrated graphene-based artificial nacres show promising applications in many fields, such as aerospace, flexible supercapacitor electrodes, artificial muscle, and tissue engineering.
