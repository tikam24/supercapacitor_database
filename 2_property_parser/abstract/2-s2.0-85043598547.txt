A novel V2AlC electrode material for supercapacitors was investigated in this study. The structure and surface morphology were examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The formation of irregularly shaped V2AlC with different particle size distribution was confirmed by XRD and FESEM. The electrochemical measurements were performed by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). V2AlC electrode exhibited 27.6 F g–1 of specific capacitance at the current density of 0.5 A g–1. The specific capacitance of V2AlC electrode remained 93.8% of the first cycle after 2000 cycles. V2AlC has great potential for application in supercapacitors.
