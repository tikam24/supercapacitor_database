The flower-like nano sized nickel cobalt oxide was successfully synthesized by facial hydrothermal method. Supercapacitor [NiCo2O4)||Activated carbon] asymmetric supercapacitor device (ASC) has been fabricated. The prepared self-assembled flower-like nanostructured NiCo2O4 nanomaterials were subjected to various analytical tools such as Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Furthermore, the bond length and electron cloud density between the atoms were analyzed by maximum entropy method (MEM). The electrochemical studies were probed using Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), chronopotentiometry charge-discharge (CD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) using electrochemical workstation (CHI6008e) instrument. The activated carbon was used as an anode electrode material for device fabrication. The maximum specific capacitance of NiCo2O4 NFs was achieved to be 1030 Fg−1 at 1 Ag−1 with good cyclic stability. The maximum specific capacitance of ASC device is 41 Fg−1 at 1 Ag−1. More interestingly, the maximum specific energy (10 W h kg−1) and specific power (2000 W kg−1) values are achieved for asymmetric supercapacitor energy storage device.
