In this paper, activated porous carbon (AC) derived from bagasse was prepared by carbonization and activation using KOH. Then, a hydrothermal route was employed to fabricate ultrathin manganese oxide (MnO 2 ) nanosheets/activated porous carbon (AC) composite (MnO 2 /AC). AC and MnO 2 /AC composite were employed as negative and positive electrode materials for a supercapacitor, respectively. An AC electrode delivers excellent electrochemical properties with a specific capacitance of 89 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 and super cycling stability of 89% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles. For a MnO 2 /AC composite, its specific capacitance can reach 492.5 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 , but its cycle performance (78.4% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles) is lower than that of AC (89%). In view of the good electrochemical performance of AC and MnO 2 /AC composite, a MnO 2 /AC//AC all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was assembled. The constructed ASC exhibits high specific capacitance of 69.375 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 and delivers a high energy density of 24.67 Wh kg −1 at a power density of 814.8 W kg −1 . Two ASCs in series can power one LED for more than 70 s. This work demonstrates that MnO 2 /AC//AC asymmetric supercapacitor shows good practical value.
