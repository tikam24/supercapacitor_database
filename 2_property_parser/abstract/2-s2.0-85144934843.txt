Lignin is one of the most abundant natural polymers and is affordable, has high carbon content and abundant active functional groups. At present, lignin-derived carbon is considered an ideal, promising electrode material for supercapacitor applications and this route is showing a vigorous development trend. In this review, we summarize the progress of lignin-derived materials for supercapacitor applications. Firstly, the concept, classification strategy and basic chemistry of lignin are introduced in brief. Then, the up-to-date developments of the synthesis strategies of carbon electrodes from lignin for supercapacitors are reviewed in detail. Finally, the work is summarized and the major challenges of the lignin-based supercapacitors are discussed. This review is presented to guide the synthesis of lignin-based electrodes for supercapacitors and facilitate their widespread application.
