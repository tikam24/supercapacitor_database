We present a simple one-step solvothermal method for in situ growth of nickel cobalt sulfide (NiCo2S4) nanoparticles on the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets and carbon nanotube (CNT) without adding any surfactant. The NiCo2S4@rGO@CNT structure was fabricated successfully with the hydrothermal method. When serving as an electrochemical supercapacitor electrode material, the NiCo2S4@rGO@CNT delivers a highly improved specific capacitance of 1242.51 F g-1 at the current density of 2.0 A g-1, as compared with that of pure NiCo2S4 (519.51 F g-1) counterpart. Its durability is mainly owing to the synergistic effects of NiCo2S4, rGO and CNT, further presenting potential applications in energy storage.
