The µW-level power density of flexible piezoelectric energy harvesters (FPEHs) restricts their potential in applications related to high-power multifunctional wearable devices. To overcome this challenge, a hierarchical design strategy is proposed by forming porous piezoceramics with an optimum microstructure into an ordered macroscopic array structure to enable the construction of high performance FPEHs. The porous piezoceramic elements allows optimization of the sensing and harvesting Figure of merit, and the array structure causes a high level of effective strain under a mechanical load. The introduction of a network of polymer channels between the piezoceramic array also provides increased device flexibility, thereby allowing the device to attach and conform to the curved contours of the human body. The unique hierarchical piezoceramic array architecture exhibits superior flexibility, a high open circuit voltage (618 V), high short circuit current (188 µA), and ultrahigh power density (19.1 mW cm−2). This energy density value surpasses previously reported high-performance FPEHs. The ultrahigh power flexible harvesting can charge a 0.1 F supercapacitor at 2.5 Hz to power high-power electronic devices. Finally, the FPEH is employed in two novel applications related to fracture healing monitoring and self-powered wireless position tracking in extreme environments.
