In this study, graphene/Co3O4 composites are prepared through a simple process under mild hydrothermal conditions. Sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) can produce many OH- and CO 32- ions after dissolution and hydrolysis in a water-isopropanol system, thereby making it applicable as both depositing agent and reducing agent in the synthesis of graphene/Co2(OH) 2CO3 composites. Remarkably, the galvanosta charge-discharge test shows that the specific capacitance value of the as-obtained composites reaches a high value of 443 F g-1 at a high current density of 5 A g-1, which is significantly improved in relation to Co3O4, and the capacitance retains 54% of capacitance at 60 A g-1. The fact that the specific capacitance remains 97.1% after 1000 continuous charge-discharge cycles at 10 A g -1 indicates that the as-prepared material has an excellent cycle life. The effect of the feeding ratios between Co3O4 and graphite oxide on the electrochemical performance has also been studied. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
