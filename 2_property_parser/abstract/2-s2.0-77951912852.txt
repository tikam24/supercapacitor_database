A novel non-aqueous hybrid supercapacitor was fabricated from two spherical materials - an activated mesocarbon microbead (AMCMB) and MnO2 nanowire-sphere, as the negative and positive electrodes, respectively. The preliminary results for this energy-storage device, which operates over a wide voltage range (0.0-3.0 V) using 1 M Et4NBF4 in acetonitrile (AN) as electrolytes, are presented. On the basis of a single electrode, the AMCMBMnO2 supercapacitor displays a high specific capacitance of 228 F g-1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s-1, corresponding to specific energy of 128 W h kg-1 based on based on the total mass of active materials, while maintaining desirable cycling stability and rate capability. The combination of the spherical AMCMB and MnO2 in a non-aqueous electrolyte is proved to be suitable for high-performance hybrid supercapacitor applications. Â© 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
