The dense manganese oxide nanorods with an extremely narrow distribution are synthesized at a low temperature using first cathodic electrodeposition subsequently heat treatment. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show that the nanorods have bar shapes, and their average diameter is less than 50 nm. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) study, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern in TEM images and the X-ray diffraction (XRD) result show that the nanorods are α-MnO 2 single crystal. The results of N 2 adsorption-desorption analysis indicate that the BET surface area of the α-MnO 2 nanorods is 93 m 2 g -1. By recording the potential-time curve during the electrodeposition process, it is revealed that water reduction reaction has a major role in the electrogeneration of base at the cathode surface under the applied electrochemical conditions. Finally, based on the H 2 bubbling on the cathode surface, the mechanism of the formation and the growth of α-MnO 2 nanorods are proposed and discussed. For the electrochemical supercapacitor application, electrochemically prepared α-MnO 2 is found to be stable for a large number of cycles with high specific capacitance, 338 F g -1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s -1. Finally, the charge-discharge mechanism is discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.
