The spinel ternary ferrites were a wonderfully adaptable class of metal oxides with distinct magnetic and electrical characteristics. In this work, the magnetic and electrochemical properties of NiZnFe2O4 nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized by the microwave combustion method. The structural and morphological studies of NiZnFe2O4 NPs were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The synthesized NPs were crystallized in the spinel structure with the Fd 3 ¯ m space group. The magnetic properties were examined by a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The magnetic data analysis confirms that the coercivity of the synthesized NPs is nearly zero at room temperature, the saturation magnetization values (Ms) 87.37. Electrochemical studies reveal that NiZnFe2O4 NPs have superior electrochemical performance. The fabricated supercapacitor device displayed a specific capacitance (73.28 F g−1), energy density (3.56 Wh kg−1) and power density (2051.28 W kg−1) respectively. The remarkable cycling stability over 10,000 cycles confirms the excellent reliability of the device for the energy storage application.
