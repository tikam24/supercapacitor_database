Through supramolecular assembly method, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is uniformly anchored on the mesoporous hollow carbon spheres (HCS), which are obtained by hard template method. The introduction of HCS can prevent the agglomeration of MoS2 and decrease the electric resistance of the compound material MoS2@HCS. The composite of MoS2@HCS-17 also owns a specific surface area of 119.0 m2 g−1. For MoS2@HCS-17, SEM and TEM results exhibit that flaky MoS2 is uniformly covered on hollow carbon spheres and possesses an expanded layered structure. Electrochemical test results show that MoS2@HCS-17 can reach 314.5F g−1 at 1A g−1. When tested at a scan speed of 50 mV s−1, there is still 87% specific capacity retention for MoS2@HCS-17 after 4000 cycles. Moreover, the assembled MnO2//MoS2@HCS asymmetric supercapacitor manifests 34.0 Wh kg−1 at 611.6 W kg−1. Bending by 180°, our assembled device still keeps stable capacitive performance. This asymmetric supercapacitor also keeps almost 93% capacity maintained after 2000 cycles.
