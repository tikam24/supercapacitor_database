In this study, we have described the synthesis of oxygen-rich hierarchical porous graphene (O-PG) using focused solar radiation on nitric acid treated graphene oxide film. This nitric acid treatment for graphene oxide helps in generating micropores on the graphene sheets and introducing oxygen-containing functional groups when solar light is focused. This unique hierarchical porous structure along with high surface area and oxygenated functional groups makes O-PG as suitable electrode in energy storage and also for capacitive deionization. The as-prepared O-PG exhibits high specific capacitance of 354 F g -1 along with energy storage of 110.6 Wh kg -1 at 1 A g -1 current density. O-PG also delivers high specific capacity of 90 mAh g -1 as high-performance cathode in aqueous Al-ion battery with an exceptionally high cyclic stability up to 10 000 cycles of charging-discharging processes at high current density of 0.5 A g -1 . In addition, the electrosorption studies of salt ions were done using capacitive deionization technique. The extraordinary salt removal capacity of 21.1 mg g -1 has been obtained for 500 mg L -1 NaCl solution at voltage of 1.4 V. This material removes not only NaCl from salty water but also other major salts such as MgCl 2 and Ca(SO 4 ) 2 . Hence, this work demonstrates a simple way of utilizing solar radiation to prepare high-performance O-PG and its applicability as an excellent electrode in high-energy supercapacitors, aqueous Al-ion battery, and capacitive deionization.
