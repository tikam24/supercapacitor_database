Co2P nanostructures with rod-like and flower-like morphologies have been synthesized by controlling the decomposition process of Co(acac)3 in oleylamine system with triphenylphosphine as phosphorus source. Investigations indicate that the final morphologies of the products are determined by their peculiar phosphating processes. Electrochemical measurements manifest that the Co2P nanostructures exhibit excellent morphology-dependent supercapacitor properties. Compared with that of 284 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 for Co2P nanorods, the capacitance for Co2P nanoflowers reaches 416 F g-1 at the same current density. Furthermore, an optimized asymmetric supercapacitor by using Co2P nanoflowers as anode and graphene as cathode is fabricated. It can deliver a high energy density of 8.8 Wh kg-1 (at a high power density of 6 kW kg-1) and good cycling stability with over 97% specific capacitance remained after 6000 cycles, which makes the Co2P nanostructures potential applications in energy storage/conversion systems. This study paves the way to explore a new class of cobalt phosphide-based materials for supercapacitor applications.
