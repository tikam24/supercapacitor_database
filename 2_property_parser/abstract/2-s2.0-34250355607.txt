Ionic liquids (IL) are very promising "solvent-free" electrolytes for high-voltage double-layer supercapacitors (EDLCs) and to this purpose they are generally selected on the basis of their bulk properties, such as electrochemical stability and ion conductivity, without taking into account those of the electrified electrode-IL interface. This interface, which has yet to be well characterized, has features that notably affect electrode capacitance, and our paper for the first time highlights the importance of the molecular chemistry and structure of the ions for the double-layer capacitive response of carbonaceous electrodes in IL. The double-layer capacitive responses of negatively charged electrodes based on activated carbons and aero/cryo/xerogel carbons in two ILs featuring the same anion and different cations of almost the same size, i.e. the N-butyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (PYR14TFSI) and 1-ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (EMITFSI) are reported. The porosity, structure and surface chemistry of the carbons are compared to their capacitive response to evince the role played by these carbon properties and by the chemistry and structure of the IL ions in the electric double-layer.
