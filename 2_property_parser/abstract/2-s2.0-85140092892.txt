Bacterial Cellulose (BC) derived from local market or symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY) was employed as the polymer matrix for hydroxyl multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT-OH)-based electrochemical double-layer capacitor (EDLC). Chitosan (CS)-sodium iodide (NaI)-glycerol (Gly) electrolyte systems were used as the polymer electrolyte. CS-NaI-Gly electrolyte possesses conductivity, potential stability and ionic transference number of (1.20 ± 0.26) × 10−3 S cm−2, 2.5 V and 0.99, respectively. For the electrodes, MWCNT-OH was observed to be well dispersed in the matrix of BC which was obtained via FESEM analysis. The inclusion of MWCNT-OH reduced the crystallinity of the BC polymeric structure. From EIS measurement, it was verified that the presence of MWCNT-OH decreased the electron transfer resistance of BC-based electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) showed that the shape of the CV plots changed to a rectangular-like shape plot as more MWCNT were added, thus verifying the capacitive behavior. Various amount of MWCNT-OH was used in the fabrication of the EDLC where it was discovered that more MWCNT-OH leads to a better EDLC performance. The EDLC was tested for 5000 complete charge-discharge cycles. The optimum performance of this low voltage EDLC was obtained with 0.1 g MWCNT where the average specific capacitance was 8.80 F g−1. The maximum power and energy density of the fabricated EDLC were 300 W kg−1 and 1.6 W h kg−1, respectively.
