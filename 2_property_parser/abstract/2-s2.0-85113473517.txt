A one-step sol-gel synthesis of porous carbon micro/nanospheres (PCMNSs) through cationic surfactant with two long hydrophobic chains was reported to realize the tunable synthesis of carbon nanospheres with interconnected structures between the shell and shell. The unique pore structure of PCMNSs endows the material with efficient electrochemical energy storage performance. The abundant macropores and mesopores of PCMNSs can promote the transport of electrolyte by reducing diffusion distances and provide sufficient active sites for effective charge storage and the charge transfer can be greatly increased by the interconnected channel structure among the carbon spherical shells. By adjusting the amount of surfactant and the consumption of ethanol, the controllable synthesis of individual carbon spheres to three-dimensional carbon frameworks were successfully realized. The results showed that the representative sample A-PCMNSs-0.6-35 had excellent supercapacitive performance, excellent electrochemical specific capacitance (242 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), great capacitance retention (170 F g−1 at 100 A g−1) and superior cycle stability (93% at 10 A g−1 after 5000 cycles).
