This paper presents the development of an enhanced power supply designed for an intelligent traffic light used as a visible light communications emitter. In the context of an increasing preoccupation for alternative energy sources, the system is being supplied with solar energy which is converted in electric energy by a photovoltaic panel. In order to improve the efficiency of the panel, the system is enhanced with a patented solar tracking system and a microcontroller which is continuously monitoring the provided energy and is deciding its optimal use. The extra energy supplied by the solar panel can be stored in a supercapacitors block and used during unfavorable weather conditions or during the night time.
