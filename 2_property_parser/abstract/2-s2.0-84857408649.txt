The electrochemical characteristics for the supercapacitors based on the titanium carbide derived carbon (CDC-TiC) electrodes in 0.4 M N,N-dimethyl-1,4-diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octanediium tetrafluoroborate (DMDABCO(BF4)2), 0.2 M DMDABCO(BF4)2 + 0.2 M triethylmethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEMABF4), and 0.4 M TEMABF4 in γ-butyrolactone (γ-BL) have been studied using cyclic voltammetry, constant current charging/discharging and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The ideal supercapacitor behaviour was observed in a wide region of cell voltages (U ≤ 3.0 V) in 0.4 M DMDABCO(BF4)2 in γ-BL. The geometry of solvation shell around DMDABCO2+ has been optimized with molecular dynamics calculations and the coordination number equal to 15, have been proposed and compared with electrochemical and gas sorption data for CDC-TiC. The gravimetric capacitance 129 F g-1, energy 40.6 W h kg-1 and power 93 kW kg-1 were established for the CDC-TiC electrodes in 0.4 M DMDABCO(BF4)2 γ-BL solution. ©The Electrochemical Society.
