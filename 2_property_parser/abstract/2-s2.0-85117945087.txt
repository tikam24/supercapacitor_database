We aim to fabricate a ZnCo layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanostructure through facile one-pot hydrothermal synthesis. ZnCo LDH with interconnected hexagonal sheets having ultrathin thickness with voids are synthesized for the effective penetration of electrolytes to achieve superior electrochemical properties. The as-synthesized ZnCo LDH nanostructure is then subjected to structural, morphological, phase, and electrochemical studies. As an electrode for a supercapacitor, the ZnCo LDH has an areal capacitance of 1964 mFcm-2 at a 5 mVs-1 scan rate, an energy density of 0.22 mWhcm-2, and an excellent cycling stability (112 %) after 2000 chargeâ€“discharge cycles.
