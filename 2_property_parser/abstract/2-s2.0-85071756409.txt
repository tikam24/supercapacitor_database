Discovery of the amazing properties of graphene has aroused great interest in other 2D materials. 2D inorganic analogues of graphene such as the transition metal dichalcogenides have been investigated widely and these materials, especially MoS2, exhibit many properties of interest. In particular, they possess properties of direct use in energy devices. In this article we review the synthesis and properties of the 2D materials of relevant transistors, sensors, photodetectors, supercapacitors and batteries as well as in oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions.
