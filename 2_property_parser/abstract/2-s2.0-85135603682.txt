Realizing high specific surface area and high heteroatom doping is the main challenge for carbon materials as electrode materials for high energy density supercapacitors. In this paper, edible fungus residue is used as the precursor via an effective carbonization-activation approach to obtain the edible fungi derived hierarchical porous carbons (EFHPCs) and adjust the porosity and heteroatom doping of carbon materials. When the EFHPC was assembled in asymmetric aqueous supercapacitor, the energy density reached to 113.12 Wh/kg at power density of 750.0 W/kg, which is significantly higher than that of commercial activated carbon. Therefore, EFHPCs can be used as ideal negative electrodes for asymmetric supercapacitors. These results indicate that the synthesis strategy adopted to design carbon with good porosity and heteroatom doping is promising for advanced supercapacitors.
