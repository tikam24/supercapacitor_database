The booming development of electronics, electric vehicles, and grid storage stations has led to a high demand for advanced energy-storage devices (ESDs) and accompanied attention to their reliability under various circumstances. Self-healing is the ability of an organism to repair damage and restore function through its own internal vitality. Inspired by this, brilliant designs have emerged in recent years using self-healing materials to significantly improve the lifespan, durability, and safety of ESDs. Extrinsic and intrinsic self-healing materials and their working principles are first introduced. Then, the application of self-healing materials in ESDs according to their self-healing chemistry, including hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, and borate ester bonds, are described in detail. Based on these, critical challenges and important future directions of self-healing ESDs are discussed.
