In this study, ruthenium was bonded to the reduced graphene oxide in an ultrasonic bath. The aerogel of the mixture was produced at −78 °C. Structural characterization of aerogels was done with XRD and FTIR, surface characterization was performed with STEM, and elemental analysis was conducted by EDX analysis. The produced aerogel composites were transformed into electrodes on conductive Nickel foam. IviumStat, a potentiostat/galvanostat device, was used for the electrochemical characterization of the symmetrical supercapacitors. According to CV voltammograms, rGO/RuO2 aerogels' highest specific capacitance was calculated as 328.6 F g−1 at a potential scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The assembled rGO/RuO2 aerogel-based supercapacitor cell offered a high energy density value of 31.1 W h kg−1 even at the power density of 8.365 kW kg−1; this is comparable to that of lead-acid and nickel-metal hybrid batteries.
