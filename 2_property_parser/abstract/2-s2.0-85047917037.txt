Cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanoparticles were anchored in a three-dimensional (3D) graphite cage for high performance supercapacitors. Significantly, the graphite cage intensified the construction of electroactive materials and facilitated the transfer of ions. As a result, the 3D-CdS/graphite cage revealed a great thermal stability and high specific capacitance (511 F/g at 5 A/g). Additionally, the 3D-CdS/graphite//reduced graphene oxide (rGO) asymmetric supercapacitor revealed a high energy density (30.4 Wh/kg at a power density of 800 W/kg) and long-term cycling stability (90.1% retention after 5000 cycles at 10 A/g) for practical applications.
