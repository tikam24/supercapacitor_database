Polyaniline nanofibres were synthesized using a economical and environment friendly SILAR method. As deposited polyaniline thin films were characterized for their structural, morphological and electrochemical properties. FT- IR study confirms the polymerization of aniline onto glass substrates. Amorphous, hydrophilic polyaniline thin films show semiconducting behaviour with optical band gap of 2.07 eV. Cyclic voltammetry have been used to explain the supercapacitive properties of deposited polyaniline thin film electrode in aqueous 1M H2SO4 electrolyte The value of specific capacitance was found to be 590 F/g in the potential window of -0.6 to 1.0 V vis-a-vis SCE in 0.1 M H2SO4 as an electrolyte with the scan rate 5 mV/sec. Scan rate study reveals the high power pulse response of polyaniline electrode showing highest capacitance of 590 F/g decreasing with increase in scan rate. EIS study supports the capacitive properties of polyaniline electrodes. Â© 2013 IEEE.
