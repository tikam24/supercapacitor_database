Herein, we spectacle the self-assembled three-dimensional (3D) intertwined zinc-cobaltite nanocubes [ZCO NCs] were synthesized by the solvothermal method. The phase formation and crystal structure of the as-prepared sample were confirmed by an X-ray diffraction study. The morphology and microstructure of the sample were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. The oxidation states and surface properties of the sample were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron microscopy (XPS) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), respectively. The prepared sample was tested as electrode material for supercapacitors. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronopotentiometry (CP) measurements revealed a specific capacitance of the electrode material of 840.72 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 and 542.60 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. Moreover, the electrode material exhibits excellent cyclic stability of up to 8000 cycles. Due to the above advantages, the produced electrode material is suitable for high-performance supercapacitors.
