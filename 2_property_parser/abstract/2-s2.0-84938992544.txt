In this work, an asymmetric supercapacitor was successfully assembled using mesoporous Ni foam/Cu/NiO composite and activated carbon (AC) as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. Its electrochemical performance was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charging/discharging techniques, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 6 M KOH electrolyte solution. The as-fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor can be cycled stably and reversibly within the potential window between 0 and 1.8 V. A maximum specific capacitance of 76.2 F/g and a high energy density of 34.3 Wh/kg are achieved, which are comparable with other recently published works. Besides, the as-assembled asymmetric supercapacitor could deliver a maximum power density of 8.68 kW/kg because of its low internal resistance (3.2 Î©), which derives from the direct growth of mesoporous active materials on the metal surface without using any polymer additives. This high electrochemical performance shows great potential of the as-assembled asymmetric supercapacitor to serve as energy storage device for various applications.
