The use of fuel cells as main source of energy is suffering an important increase, due to their continuous improvements and their good performances. Fuel cells are being used in very different industrial applications, and they are being particularly applied in automotive field. So, there is an important growing in the study of new power distribution architectures based on fuel cells. This research work presents a deep analysis related to performance problems founded in parallel topologies, and their relation with their control strategies. The objective of this work is to solve the behavioral problems aforementioned by means of the control strategy optimization. Â©2009 IEEE.
