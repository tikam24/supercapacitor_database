A ternary nanostructure, composed of graphite oxide (GO), MnO2 and poly[(2,5-di-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole)-4-diylvinylene-alt-3,6-(N-butyl- carbazolenevinylene)] (POXA-CAR), is fabricated via a simple two-step method. The as-prepared composite is characterised by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, field-emission scanning electron microscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The specific capacitance of the composite electrode reached 310F/g at a charging current of 2.5mA, which is attributed to the synergistic effects from each component. GO has a large surface area and great mechanical properties. The conducting polymer provides electron transport path and partakes of the charge storage process. This Letter suggests that the ternary composite is a promising candidate for high-performance energy storage devices. Â© 2012 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.
