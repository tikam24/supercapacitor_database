A double layer hollow structured Cu7S4/NiS material is synthesized using a self-generated sacrificial template method, as an electrode material for supercapacitors. Cu7S4/NiS composites with three different particle sizes are synthesized and tested, which exhibited high specific capacitances of 1204 F g-1, 1028 F g-1 and 857 F g-1, respectively, at a current density of 1 A g-1. The specific capacitance of the nanocomposites remained at 945.5 F g-1 (85.8%), 719.2 F g-1 (84.32%) and 558.5 F g-1 (80.13%) levels after 1000 cycles, respectively, at a current density of 4 A g-1, showing good cycle stability. Compared with the pure NiS and Cu7S4, the development of the hollow Cu7S4/NiS composites is demonstrated to be effective in enhancing the supercapacitive performance.
