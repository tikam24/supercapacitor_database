Due to enhanced demands on quality, security and reliability of the electric power energy system, a microgrid has become a subject of special interest. In this paper, output characteristics of energy storage system (ESS) with an electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) and battery energy storage system (BESS) of a renewable energy based microgrid were analyzed under grid-connected and islanded operation modes. The microgrid which consists of photovoltaic and wind power turbine generators, diesel generator, ESS with an EDLC, BESS and loads was modeled using real time digital simulator. The results present the effective control patterns of the microgrid system.
