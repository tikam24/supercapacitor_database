In the present article, the synthesis of manganese oxide (Mn3O4) nanoparticles (NPs) have been achieved by microwave assisted combustion method, which was further investigated for an electrode material in supercapacitors. The as-synthesized Mn3O4nanoparticles were characterized by different techniques like powder X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), UV-Visible spectroscopy etc. XRD pattern reveals a crystalline, tetragonal phase of Mn3O4(hausmannite) nanoparticles with a crystallite size of 28.08 nm. SEM image shows that the Mn3O4nanoparticles are present as spongy aggregates. From Tauc plot, the band gap of the material was found to be around 1.97 eV, which is suitable for energy storage (supercapacitor) application. Investigation on the electrochemical properties of Mn3O4nanoparticles were carried out by using Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic/ potentiostatic charge-discharge studies. The results signify that the obtained Mn3O4nanoparticles can be used as a potential electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
