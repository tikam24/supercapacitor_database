Supercapacitors are important energy storage devices due to its fast charging/discharging features and long cycle life. Design and fabrication of superior supercapacitor electrodes is of significance to the improvement of the overall performances of a device. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely reported for supercapacitor applications due to their high-tunability, including favorable porous properties, tunable chemical compositions, controllable crystal structures, and adjustable geometry morphologies. In this review, the recent reports focusing on MOF-based supercapacitor applications are elaborated. Particularly, the recyclable MOF-hydrolyzing strategy is introduced, during which the organic ligands can be recollected to drastically reduce the costs. Furthermore, challenges and perspectives of MOFs for supercapacitor electrode applications are also summarized.
