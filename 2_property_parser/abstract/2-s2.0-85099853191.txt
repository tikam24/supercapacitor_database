Nitrogen enriched hierarchical porous carbons with high specific surface (SSA) area and well-connected pore structure are highly desirable for supercapacitor electrode materials. Herein, nitrogen enriched hierarchical porous carbon (NHPC) was prepared by pre-carbonization of tobacco stems and activation by KHCO3. The as-prepared NHPC-800 exhibits high SSA (2691 m2 g−1) and high proportion of mesopore (76.5 %). NHPC-800 also shows high nitrogen content of 1.4 %. Benefited from improved pore structure and chemical composition, the obtained NHPC-800 delivered a high capacitance of 252.9 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and 189.1 F g−1 at 20 A g−1 in 6 M KOH. Additionally, the symmetric supercapacitor exhibits a high energy density of 7.8 W h kg−1 and good cycle stability with 92.6 % capacitance retention after 6000 charge/discharge cycles in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The good electrochemical performance makes NHPC-800 a potential electrode material for supercapacitor.
