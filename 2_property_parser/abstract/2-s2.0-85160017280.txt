In this globalized World, the demand for energy resources is increasing at an alarming rate and this has led to the enormous usage of fossil fuels Which are at the stage of depletion. As an impact of this, Wind energy, solar cell, hydrogen fuel cells are considered as alternative reneWable sources of energy all over the World. This paper demonstrates a hybrid scheme for an islanded solar photovoltaic based dc bus system With Fuel cell, Perturb and observe algorithm With some modification of additional loop of current has been used to track maximum poWer from photovoltaic system. Supercapacitor and Battery as a backup poWer source. The implemented scheme ensures that there is continuous floiv of poWer to the load irrespective of the faults and failures occurring in the poWer system. The system components have been modeled and simulated using MATLAB/Simulink toolboxes for various irradiation levels of photovoltaic system to assess their effectiveness.
