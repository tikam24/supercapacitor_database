Transition metal oxides can serve as advanced electrode materials and have attracted extensive attention in the past decade. Herein, we have been successfully synthesized the FeCo2O4 nanomaterials through a facile hydrothermal method followed by annealing treatment. The as-prepared FeCo2O4 nanomaterials possessed a porous chopsticks-like microstructure, and the BET surface areas reached 85.32 m2 g−1. When the porous chopsticks-like FeCo2O4 were used to make the working electrode, the three-electrode test system showed the ultrahigh specific capacitance of 679.94 F g−1 at current density of 1 A g−1 and a remarkable cycling stability with 93.68% capacitance retention being stable after 4000 cycles. Furthermore, the assembled porous chopsticks-like FeCo2O4// AC-ASC cell device exhibited a high energy density of 50.85 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 799.98 W kg−1 and still maintained 38.79 Wh kg−1 at a higher power density of 12,799.63 W kg−1, and long cyclic stability, with almost 78.46% capacity retention after 5600 cycles. These results firmly verify that the porous chopsticks-like FeCo2O4 nanomaterials have great potential application for supercapacitors.
