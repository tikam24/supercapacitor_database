This paper presents a new power allocation method in the electrical hybrid energy storage system composed by batteries and supercapacitors (SCs) for electric vehicles (EVs). Based on the speed of EVs, the new power sharing strategy, adapted to different kinds of load profiles, regulates the SC state of charge (SOC). By comparison, the new strategy showed the shortest accelerating time and least power losses, which can efficiently improve dynamic performance and energy utilization rate.
