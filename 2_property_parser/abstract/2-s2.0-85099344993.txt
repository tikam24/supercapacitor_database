This work presents methods of introducing sealed lead acid (SLA) batteries in combination with supercapacitors for powering a high performance electric vehicle. SLA batteries and their charging systems are readily available; however, these batteries are heavy and have poor discharge energy efficiency. Supercapacitors capable of higher discharge currents could complement the power available from the battery or replace batteries in short range electric vehicles (EV). Power levels greater than 100 kW were tested. Experimentally, supercapacitor and Pb battery configurations were analyzed to increase the power delivered to an electric motorcycle purposed for quarter-mile drag racing.
