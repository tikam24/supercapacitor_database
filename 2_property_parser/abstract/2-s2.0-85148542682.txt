Herein, we report the fabrication and characterization of a copper-halide perovskite-based (CHP) photo-responsive electrochemical capacitor (EC). A chemically stable and optically viable lead-free inorganic copper antimony iodide (Cu3SbI6) rudorffite is used as the active bi-functional symmetric electrodes. Non-aqueous HAAP gel electrolyte is sandwiched between the Cu3SbI6 electrodes to obtain the CHP photo-responsive EC. The HAAP gel electrolyte is characterized by FTIR, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). SEM is used to study the Cu3SbI6 electrodes. The CHP photo-responsive EC electrochemical energy storage performance is investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and EIS, under dark and illuminated conditions. A capacitance augmentation of 462 % is achieved for the CHP photo-responsive EC, under illuminated condition, Maximum energy density and power density of 9.98 μWh/cm2, and 3.18 mW/cm2, respectively, are attained under illumination. The CHP photo-responsive EC exhibits excellent cyclic charge–discharge stability by retaining 93 % of its initial capacitance, after 10,000 cycles.
