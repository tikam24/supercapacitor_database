This study is a bibliometric analysis of worldwide scientific literature on research activity in the field of supercapacitors. To analyze the quality, quantity and influence of published scientific papers in this field, we have performed a search in the Scopus database and have analysed the relevant records. We then proceeded with rankings of authors and countries on the basis of different indicators: number of papers, citations, Hirsh index, and citations per paper. The analysis of aggregate records shows that the number of publications has increased remarkably since 2004. This is because in the last few years, there has been a rapid growth in publications coming from China and other Asian countries (Korea, Taiwan and India). China was found to be the leading country with 459 published papers and five authors on the list of the 30 most prolific scientists per number of publications. However, the Western countries also such as the United States, Canada and Europe, along with France, Poland, Italy and Germany have showed a high level of productivity on the basis of other metric indicators. The bibliometric analysis of data shows that the United States is the leading country after which Japan, France, Canada and Poland follow. Other countries such as Korea, Taiwan, India and Italy also have excellent results and appear often in the "top ten" countries or high ranking authors. Â© 2009 by ESG.
