The rapid development of portable and wearable electronic devices has increased demand for flexible and efficient energy harvesting and storage units. Conventionally, these are built and used separately as discrete components. Herein, we propose a simple and cost-effective laser engraving technique for fabricating a flexible self-charging micro-supercapacitor power unit (SCMPU), by integrating a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and a micro-supercapacitor (MSC) array into a single device. The SCMPU can be charged directly by ambient mechanical motion. We demonstrate the ability of the SCMPU to continuously power light-emitting diodes and a commercial hygrothermograph. This investigation may promote the development of sustainable self-powered systems and provide a promising new research application for supercapacitors. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
