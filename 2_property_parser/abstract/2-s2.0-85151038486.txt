A new hyperbranched viologen containing Schiff base polymer (VSBP) is synthesized by condensing TRIPOD and VDA. The polymer is characterized using spectroscopic techniques (FT-IR & 13C NMR) and microscopic (SEM) analyses. The VSBP modified NF electrode renders an effectual electrochemical performance with maximum specific capacitance of 256 F/g at 0.5 A/g. From cyclic stability measurement, 87% capacitance retention is retained at 10 A/g and 95% achieved at 0.5 A/g after 3000 GCD cycles in a three-electrode system. Assembling of VSBP modified NF electrode as a symmetrical supercapacitor device exhibits a high energy density value of 17.02 Wh/kg with a power density of 816 W/kg and acceptable capacitance retention is achieved 90.6% at 1 A/g current density after 5000 cycles.
