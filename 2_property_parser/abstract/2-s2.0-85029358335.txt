This work presents the synthesis, assembly, and integration of two-dimensional (2D) phosphate sheets Lithium-ion energy storage devices. Three achievements have been accomplished in this work: (1) synthesis and assembly of 2D, poly-crystalline phosphate sheets greater than 50μm2 in area, and (2) 3× improved capacitance of an Iron-Phosphate-Polypyrrole battery/supercapacitor (3.6 mF/cm2) over bare Polypyrrole (PPY) films, and (3) 20× improved capacitance of an FePO4-Carbon Nanotube (CNT) battery/supercapacitor (20.8 mF/cm2) over bare CNT-based electrodes.
