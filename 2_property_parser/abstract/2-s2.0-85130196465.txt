This paper presents results of research on the impact of the type of energy storage on the performance and economy of a vehicle. For this purpose, a proprietary energy management system has been developed that uses two power sources in a hybrid vehicle. Three types of energy storages were analyzed: Ni-MH batteries, Li-Ion batteries and a supercapacitor battery. The results of the research show that the appropriate selection of these types of energy storages and the correct management of the energy stored in them bring great benefits. As a result, it was possible to improve performance, reduce level of fuel consumption, emission of harmful substances and extend the life of the primary energy storage.
