MoO2/Mo2N hybrid nanobelts doped with gold nanoparticles (AuNPMoON) were synthesized via one-step thermal-treatment of MoO3 nanobelts and HAuCl4. AuNPMoON nanobelts with a width of ca. 200 nm and an Au content of 1.08 wt% prepared in the presence of HAuCl4 exhibited a higher specific capacitance of 348 F g-1 than those prepared in the absence of HAuCl4 (21 F g-1) at a current density of 0.5 A g-1. The influence of Au content on the electrochemical performance of AuNPMoON was investigated. For practical application, two types of supercapacitor devices, PANIAuNPMoON and ACAuNPMoON, were assembled. The PANIAuNPMoON device delivered an energy density of 10.64 W h kg-1, which is higher than that of the ACAuNPMoON device (8.11 W h kg-1). Meanwhile, the specific capacitance retentions were 87.8% and 85.5% for the PANIAuNPMoON and ACAuNPMoON devices after 2000 cycles, respectively.
