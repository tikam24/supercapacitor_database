The present work unveils the electrochemical properties of a newly emerging multiferroic material, double perovskite Y2NiMnO6, as an active material for the positive electrode of electrochemical supercapacitors. We have designed a facile, low temperature hydrothermal route for the fabrication of Y2NiMnO6 nanowires, to achieve the beneficial effects of a large active surface area at the nanoscale on the electrochemical properties of the material. A comparative study reveals that the Y2NiMnO6 nanowire-based electrode is superior than its bulk counterpart, exhibiting higher specific capacitance (77.76 F g-1 at 30 mA g-1), energy density (0.89 W h kg-1 at 30 mA g-1), power density (19.27 W kg-1 at 150 mA g-1) and cyclability (>1800 cycles), in addition to a good retention of 70.17%.
