In this work, NiO@MnO 2 core/shell nanocomposites were fabricated by a two-step method. The morphology and structure of the nanocomposites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis and thermal gravity analysis. In addition, the supercapacitive performances were examined by cyclic voltammogram (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The electrochemical results indicate that the composite exhibits a specific capacitance of 266.7 F g -1 at 0.5 A g -1 and excellent cycling stability (81.7% retention after 2000 cycles at 1 A g -1 ). Therefore, this wok offers meaningful reference for supercpacitor applications in the future.
