Gel-based activated carbon electrodes were prepared from a mixture of colloidal silica and activated carbon powder in an aqueous LiNO3 3M electrolyte. These gel-based electrodes were extruded onto graphite current collector. Flexible Electrochemical double Layer Capacitors (EDLCs), also called supercapacitors, were assembled from these electrodes, a cellulose separator and encapsulated by PET films. EDLCs prototypes of 4 cm2 exhibit a capacitance of 0.32 F, a specific capacitance of 94 F.g-1, an energy density of 5.2 Wh.kg-1 and a charge density of 8.7 Ah.kg -1. Â© The Electrochemical Society.
