Preparation process for carbon aerogels is introduced. Main research progress on applications of carbon aerogels in the fields of adsorption, heat preservation, catalysis, supercapacitor and energy storage is comprehensively reviewed. Carbon aerogel is a new type of amorphous organic nanomaterial with high specific surface area (400-3 000 m2â€¢g-1), high porosity (80%-99%) and ultra-low thermal conductivity. It has important applications in adsorption and phase change thermal insulation materials. Carbon aerogel is an excellent catalyst carrier due to its higher strength, good stability and abundant reaction sites. Furthermore, carbon aerogels also show excellent electrical conductivity that organic aerogels do not.
