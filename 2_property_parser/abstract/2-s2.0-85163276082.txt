In the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) hybrid direct-current (DC) microgrids, the energy management for the high efficiency, fast power transients and thermal safety are the main difficult task for considering. In this article, the composition of the SOFC hybrid DC microgrids including the SOFC, lithium battery and supercapacitor is established, and then its stable operating requirement is discussed. Moreover, the control and optimization strategies, including the energy management techniques are designed for the SOFC, battery and supercapacitor to remedy the defects of the slow SOFC power transients. Among the energy management techniques, the control scheme based on the SOFC system optimal operating points (OOPs) is established to realize highest efficiency and static thermo-safety. Moreover, the voltage and current control strategy based on the proportional plus integral (PI) controller is set up to maintain load terminal voltage to 220 V. In the end, the experimental results are shown to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategies. In addition, the SOFC/battery/supercapacitor-based DC microgrids shows the comparative advantage in the fast load tracing.
