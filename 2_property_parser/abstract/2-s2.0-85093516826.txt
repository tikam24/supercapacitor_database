Nonvolatile deep eutectic solvent (DES) electrolytes with good electrochemical stability have recently emerged as promising electrolytes for energy storage devices. In this report, for the first time a polymerized zwitterionic molecule was introduced and a series of hybrid cross-linked zwitterion-containing copolymer DES gels are synthesized via UV initiated free-radical copolymerization of acrylic acid (AA), sulfobetaine vinylimidazole (VIPS) and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) monomers, in situ within DES, which is prepared from 1:2 M ratio of choline chloride and ethylene glycol. Systematically varying the AA:VIPS molar ratio and copolymer contents within the copolymer network enables one to widely tune the mechanical properties and ionic conductivity of the poly(AA-co-VIPS) DES gels. The tensile strength of P(AA-co-VIPS) DES gels significantly increased from 28 kPa to 176 kPa with fracture strain from 720% to 1370%, while the ionic conductivity of copolymer DES gels remains high from 2.7 to 4.1 mS cm−1 with the increase of copolymer content from 25 wt % to 45 wt%. A copolymer DES gel not only enables a supercapacitor deliver high capacitance of 71.52 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, and retains ∼97% of its capacitance after 2000 cycles, but also achieves outstanding capacitive performance over wide temperature range.
