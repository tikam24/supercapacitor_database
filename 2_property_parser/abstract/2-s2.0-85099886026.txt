An active material electrode with high areal specific capacitance is needed for a high-performance supercapacitor, but it is difficult to achieve this goal for PEDOT-based composites. Here, a novel hierarchical core/shell PEDOT@MoS2 composite was assembled by the electrochemical co-deposition of EDOT and MoS2 submicron spheres. The SEM, TEM images of the as-obtained composite explicitly reveal the core/shell heterostructure of PEDOT@MoS2 with a diameter of about 800 nm. The electrochemical characterizations show that the optimized PEDOT@MoS2 composite possesses a high specific capacitance of 2540 mF cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2 and excellent capacitance retention of 98.5% after 5000 cycles at a high current density of 100 mA cm−2. The assembled P@M-4//PEDOT asymmetric supercapacitor shows a high energy density of 937 Wh m−2 at 6500 W m−2, and outstanding cycling stability with capacitance retention of 100% after 5000 cycles. It is proposed that the enhanced performances are attributed to the robust hierarchical core/shell structures and the synergic effect between PEDOT and MoS2, which is expected to become a promising candidate for applications in high-performance supercapacitors.
