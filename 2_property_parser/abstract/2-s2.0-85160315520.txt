This investigation is motivated by interest in nanostructured FeOOH anodes for aqueous asymmetric supercapacitors operating in Na2SO4 electrolyte. The research goal is the fabrication of anodes with high active mass loading of 40 mg cm−2, high capacitance and low resistance. The influence of high-energy ball milling (HEBM), capping agents and alkalizer on the nanostructure and capacitive properties is investigated. HEBM promotes the crystallization of FeOOH, which results in capacitance reduction. Capping agents from the catechol family, such as tetrahydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone (THB) and gallocyanine (GC), facilitate the fabrication of FeOOH nanoparticles, eliminate the formation of micron size particles and allow the fabrication of anodes with enhanced capacitance. The analysis of testing results provided insight into the influence of the chemical structure of the capping agents on nanoparticle synthesis and dispersion. The feasibility of a conceptually new strategy for the synthesis of FeOOH nanoparticles is demonstrated, which is based on the use of polyethylenimine as an organic alkalizer-dispersant. The capacitances of materials prepared using different nanotechnology strategies are compared. The highest capacitance of 6.54 F cm−2 is obtained using GC as a capping agent. The obtained electrodes are promising for applications as anodes for asymmetric supercapacitors.
