The electrochemical performances of sonicated graphene quantum dots dispersoid zinc ammonium phosphate (ZIAMPH @ GQDx)sonic hybrid composites have been investigated for the first time at different variates of x = 25, 50, 75, and 100 mg. The cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge results have shown quasi-reversibility, and the 50 mg-sonicated composite (ZIAMPH @ GQDx=50 mg)sonic has shown higher specific capacitance of 683 Fg−1 @ 1 Ag−1 in 2 M H2SO4 than the same variate without sonication. The Dunn method/Randles–Sevčik calculations show higher diffusion and the BET studies reveal higher surface area of 8.896 m2 g−1 and pore diameter of 3.45 nm for the sonicated (ZIAMPH @ GQDx=50 mg)sonic than that of the unsonicated. In XRD studies the ZIAMPHsonic exists in the mixed crystalline phase (monoclinic/hexagonal), whereas the unsonicated ZIAMPH is in single-crystalline phase (monoclinic). The ZIAMPHGQD2//rGO hybrid device operates within a wider cell voltage of 0–1.8 V in 3 M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte and renders the higher specific capacitance (306 Fg−1 @ 1 Ag−1) and high energy density of 138 Wh kg−1 for the power density of 450 W kg−1 with the capacity retention of 88% for 5000 charge–discharge cycles and faster relaxation time (τ0). The SEM morphology of the sonicated (ZIAMPH @ GQDx=50 mg)sonic shows fluffy cotton locks morphology due to the dimensional, concentration effect of GQD and Microwave irradiation. The XPS and FT–Raman have been advocating the sonication effect and GQD concentration dispersoid at ZIAMPH as the promising electrode for high energy density hybrid supercapacitor applications.
