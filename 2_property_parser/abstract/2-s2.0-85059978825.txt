Cobalt metal-organic framework (Co-MOF) has been synthesized using a hydrothermal method and applied as Co-MOF modified electrode in supercapacitors. Multiple techniques like scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, X-ray diffraction and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analyzer were employed to investigate Co-MOF structure and textual characteristics. Co-MOF has high specific surface area due to the hollow structure with mesopore voids. The electrochemical behavior of the as-prepared Co-MOF was analyzed by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results exhibit good capacitive behavior of Co-MOF because the high specific surface area and numerus mesopore voids promote the transportation of electrolyte ions, which shows good capacitive stability as a supercapacitor electrode.
