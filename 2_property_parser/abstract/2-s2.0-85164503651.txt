The objective of this work was to prepare and evaluate Ni3S4/graphene nanostructures for making high-performance supercapacitor electrodes. A one-pot solvothermal method was developed to prepare the hierarchical nanostructures consisting of Ni3S4 nanoflowers on graphene nanosheets. Due to the hierarchical structure of Ni3S4 nanoflowers on graphene nanosheets, the resulting electrodes exhibited high supercapacitive performance. Herein, the Ni3S4/graphene electrode demonstrated the specific capacitance of 978.4 F g–1 at the current density of 0.5 A g–1, the rate capability and long-term cycling stability were also excellent. Moreover, the capacitance contribution of NG-60 can reach 87.9% of the total capacity at 10 mV s−1. The high pseudo-capacitive performance can be attributed to the superior electronic conductivity of graphene nanosheets and the well interconnected tiny pores/channels in the Ni3S4 nanoflower arrays. The prepared Ni3S4/graphene hierarchical nanostructures may be promising as innovative electrode materials for making high-performance supercapacitors.
