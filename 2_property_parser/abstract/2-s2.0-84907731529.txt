The trend associated with the ever increasing size of grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems necessitates PV system configurations with higher power rating power processing converters and interconnection at a higher voltage level at the point of common coupling (PCC). Moreover, the inherent intermittency of the solar irradiation greatly affects both transient- and steady-state operation of these ever larger PV systems. This paper proposes a solution dealing with challenges of the large-scale PV system. The paper introduces a multistring PV system configuration based on a high-gain DC/DC converter and energy storage system (ESS). The interleaved structure of the high-gain DC/DC converter can easily handle the challenges regarding the power rating of converters and the requirement of higher voltage at PCC. Moreover, the ESS suppresses the power fluctuation of PV arrays and balances the difference between generated PV power and peak load demand. The simulation results of proposed system are presented to validate the performance of transient and steady state.
