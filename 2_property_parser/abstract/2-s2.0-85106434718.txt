Urgent requests for environmentally friendly clean energy and the development of modern electronic products have resulted in fervent research on novel energy storage technologies, particularly for supercapacitors. But supercapacitors suffer from low energy densities, restricting their development. In order to obtain high performance supercapacitors with a high energy density and power density, the indispensable factor is designing electrode materials with excellent capacitive performance. We have successfully prepared innovative materials and unique structures to apply in high-performance supercapacitors. The nanowire is good for making close contact with the electrolyte for fast ion diffusion, and the nanoflower sheet enables shortening the electron convey route and provides a number of reaction active sites. Herein, we use copper foam (CF) as the substrate, and binder-free core−shell nanoflower-like CuO/CF@NiCoMn−OH is designed as a battery-style positive electrode. Benefiting from the advantages of a metal−organic framework (MOF)-assisted growth strategy and simple hydrothermal dynamics, the prepared optimizing electrode structure delivers a distinguished specific capacity of 26.8 F cm−2 at 8 mA cm−2 (3356 F g−1 at 1 A g−1). The assembled CuO/CF@ NiCoMn−OH//AC exhibits a high energy density of 37.28 W h kg−1 and a power density of 170 W kg−1, under a potential window of 1.5 V. This work implies that MOF-assisted construction of core−shell nanoflower-like CuO/CF@NiCoMn−OH has broad application prospects in high-performance energy storage equipment.
