Co3O4 based nanostructures have attracted enormous attention due to their exceptional electrochemical activities. However the multistep rigorous fabrication processes restrict their direct application in practical supercapacitor devices. Herein, we demonstrate growth of self supported ultra small Co3O4 NCs (nanocubes) array directly over Ni foam by facile, quick, one step solvothermal method. Impressively, the as-prepared Co3O4 NCs exhibit noticeable pseudocapacitive performance with ultra high specific capacitance of 1913 F g-1 at current density of 8 A g-1, high rate capability, as well as good cycling stability. Enhanced supercapacitance can be attributed to very small size of NCs with nanopores, leading to greater interaction of electrolyte and active material. The remarkable electrochemical performance of Co3O4 NCs electrode exhibits its potential as an alternative electrode for forthcoming supercapacitor devices.
