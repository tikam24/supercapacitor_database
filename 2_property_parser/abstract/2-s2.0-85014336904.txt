An innovative, single-pot synthesis for chemically producing graphene/polyaniline nanocomposites is presented. The method, which is based on chemical reactions at liquid-liquid interfaces, begins with benzene and aniline and ultimately yields nanocomposites as thin films of polyaniline mixed with graphene. These films self-assembled at the water-benzene interface are easily transferable to any kind of ordinary substrates, plastics included. Nanocomposites prepared with different polymer/graphene ratios show differentiated structures and morphologies, resulting in excellent pseudocapacitive behaviors (specific capacitance of 267.2 F cmâˆ’3). The construction of all-solid, transparent, and flexible supercapacitor device from this nanocomposite is also presented.
