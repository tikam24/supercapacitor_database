Herein, the integral technology process including the production, doping and tail gas recovery systems is constructed to realize the S doping modification with the excellent universality for arbitrary carbon materials. S-doped porous carbon (SPC) and S-doped carbon nanotubes (SCNTs) obtained by the developed doping methodology are employed as anode material and conductive additives of cathode and anode in lithium ion capacitor (LIC), respectively. The great alleviation of the kinetics mismatch between cathode and anode in LIC is benefited from S doping modification on anode and the construction of efficient conductive network inside electrodes. Besides, the excellent rate capability and durability can still be afforded by the fabricated LIC even at low temperature environment. This work not only develops a scalable, green and universal S doping methodology for arbitrary carbon materials, but also provides a reasonable design for the construction of high-performance LIC device.
