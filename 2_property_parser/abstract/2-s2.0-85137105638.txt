Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-derived carbon materials have abundant pore structures and ultrahigh specific surface areas, showing great potential in energy storage fields such as supercapacitors. Using environmental-friendly ZnO nanospheres (ZnO NS) as templates, the core-shell structured ZnO@Ni/Co-ZIF-8 precursor was prepared by hydrothermal method. The Ni, Co and N doped MOF-derived carbon materials Ni/CoCN with different morphologies were obtained by pyrolysing ZnO@Ni/Co-ZIF-8 at different temperatures (700, 800, 900 and 950℃). The effect of the pyrolysis temperature on their energy storage performance was investigated. The results show that with the increase of the pyrolysis temperature, Ni/Co-CN gradually changes from porous carbon to carbon nanotube bridged porous carbon structure. When the pyrolysis temperature is 900℃, Ni/Co-CN-900 shows the highest specific capacitance. In the electrolyte of 1 mol/L KOH, the cyclic voltammetry curve remains a good symmetry, indicating superior electrochemical reversibility. By calculating the capacitance contribution and diffusion contribution ratios of charge storage in this process, it is found that the dominate capacitance contribution is due to the double-layer adsorption of porous carbon and a small amount originates from the Faradaic reaction caused by N doping. At a current density of 0.5 A/g, the specific capacitance of Ni/Co-CN-900 is up to 273.5 F/g. At the current density of 10.0 A/g, the specific capacitance still remains 93.8% after 5000 galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles, exhibiting excellent electrochemical performance.
