Herein, a facile, environment-friendly and cost-effective approach was followed for the preparation of metal sulfide-based supercapacitor electrodes. The effect of transition metal interrogation on the morphology and electrochemical performance of carbon-coated nickel sulfide composite electrode was investigated. Physicochemical characterization showed that the enhancement in electrical conductivity and electrochemical reaction sites with the introduction of copper (Cu) and cobalt (Co) was due to the variation in morphology. Fast ionic transformation and improvement in the number of redox active sites might improve the supercapacitor performance. The electrochemical experiment showed that the NCoSC electrode exhibited the highest capacitance value of ~760 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 current density as compared to the NCuSC and NSC electrodes. Therefore, a hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) device was fabricated by using NCoSC as the positive electrode and thermally reduced graphene oxide (TRGO) as the negative electrode. The fabricated device demonstrated maximum energy density of ~38.8 Wh Kg−1 and power density of 9.8 kW Kg−1 . The HSC device also showed ~89.5% retention in specific capacitance after 10,000 charge–discharge cycles at 12 A g−1 current density. So, the tuning of electronic and physical properties by the introduction of Cu and Co on nickel sulfide improved the supercapacitor performance.
