Covalent organic framework (COF) is a new class of porous materials used in energy storage devices. By solvothermal method, the triphenylamine-based covalent organic framework was synthesized using Schiff base coupling reaction between tris(4-aminophenyl) amine (TAPA) and tris(4-formylphenyl) amine. The regular pore structure of TPA-COFs not only exposes more active sites of triphenylamine structure to electrolyte solution during the charge–discharge process, but also accelerates the transport of ions in the active layer. At the same time, the π-electron conjugated system and the interlayer π-π stacking effect effectively promote the conduct of electrons in the two-dimensional and three-dimensional directions of COFs materials, which improves the electrochemical performance of the materials. TPA-COFs show a higher specific capacitance of 263.1 F/g at 0.1 A/g. At the same time, TPA-COFs materials exhibit a high specific surface area of 398.59 m2/g. After 5000 cycles of charge–discharge, the capacitance retention rate of TPA-COFs is 111%, showing excellent cycle stability.
