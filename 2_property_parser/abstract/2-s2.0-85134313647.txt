Herein, a highly porous copper (I) sulfide film is formed on the copper surface by employing a sequential chemical transformation. The material is characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electrochemical analyses. The present method is simple, versatile, and economic for obtaining binder-free porous and highly conducting electrodes for an efficient supercapacitor. The supercapacitor of these electrodes with 3 M KOH electrolyte gives a high specific capacitance. The estimated specific capacitance is 1044 Fg−1 at 1.5 Ag−1 with retention close to 90% at the end of 3,000 cycles. The proposed method of making these electrodes can be easily scalable for mass production.
