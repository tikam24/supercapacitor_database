Abstract: The production of a NiCo2O4 nanopowder using hydrolytically active heteroligand complexes [M(C5H7O2)x(C4H9O)y] (where M = Ni and Co) as precursors was investigated. A simultaneous thermal analysis was used to study the synthesis of a xerogel by the hydrolysis of the complexes, their polycondensation, and drying of the synthesized gel and the transformation of the produced xerogel to an oxide powder of the desired composition. Advantages were demonstrated for the proposed method of pen plotter printing using the obtained solution of the heteroligand complexes as a functional ink in the production of NiCo2O4 thin films on the surface of substrates of various types. The results of X-ray powder diffraction analysis and scanning and transmission electron microscopy confirmed that the proposed synthesis conditions and printing parameters ensure the efficient synthesis of the oxide of the desired composition as both a nanopowder (with an average size of coherent scattering regions of about 20 nm), and thin films (with an average particle size of 12â€“15 nm).
