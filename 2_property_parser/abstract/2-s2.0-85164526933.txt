Enhancing the energy storage capacity of carbon electrodes is a key challenge to developing high-performance supercapacitors. In this study, we design an oxygen-enriched hierarchical nanoporous carbon electrode using laser fabrication and subsequent electrochemical activation, which demonstrates superior energy storage capacity. The carbon electrode is first obtained through the carbonization of phenolic resin under instantaneous high temperature induced by laser, resulting in multiple ion transport channels and a specific capacitance of 64.17 mF cm-2 at the current density of 0.2 mA cm-2. To further improve the performance, electrochemical activation is successfully conducted, leading to a 12.1-fold increase of the specific capacitance of the carbon electrodes. It is found that O-C‚ïêO-containing functional groups formed during the activation process significantly contribute to the high capacitance enhancement. In a 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte, the activated hierarchical nanoporous carbon electrode delivers a high specific capacitance of 778.3 mF cm-2 under the same test conditions. Additionally, the abundant porous structure and excellent reversibility of redox reaction of the oxygen-containing functional groups enable the assembled supercapacitor to obtain a specific capacitance of 45.3 mF cm-2 at the current density of 0.4 mA cm-2 and maintain a capacitance retention rate of 93.6% after 10,000 charge-discharge tests. This study presents a strategy to prepare carbon electrode materials with both high performance and excellent stability.
