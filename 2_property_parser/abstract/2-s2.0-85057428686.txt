In this work, a core-shell hierarchical LiFe 5 O 8 @PPy nanocomposite has been successfully fabricated through a simple etching/regrowing method. The core buffer of highly conductive PPy nanotubes is introduced to enhance the electrochemical performance of LiFe 5 O 8 . Owing to improved electron transfer capability, charge transfer resistances of the core-shell nanostructured composites are decreased and the electrochemical properties are enhanced. The representative LiFe 5 O 8 @PPy nanocomposite exhibits a high specific capacitance of 292 F g −1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s −1 , and an excellent cycling stability (82.99% after 10,000 cycles) because of the synergistic effect of LiFe 5 O 8 nanosheets and PPy nanotubes. This study confirms that the as-prepared LiFe 5 O 8 @PPy nanocomposites are promising candidates for supercapacitor electrode materials.
