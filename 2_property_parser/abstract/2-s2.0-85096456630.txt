Herein, high-performance, reliable electrochromic supercapacitors (ECSs) are proposed based on tungsten trioxide (WO3) and nickel oxide (NiO) films. To maximize device performance and stability, the stoichiometric balance between anode and cathode materials is controlled by carefully adjusting the thickness of the anodic NiO film while fixing the thickness of WO3 to ∼660 nm. Then, a small amount (≤10 mol %) of metal (e.g., copper) is doped into the NiO film, improving the electrical conductivity and electrochemical activity. At a Cu doping level of 7 mol %, the resulting ECS exhibited the highest performance, including a high areal capacitance (∼14.9 mF/cm2), excellent coulombic efficiency (∼99%), wide operating temperature range (0-80 °C), reliable operation with high charging/discharging cyclic stability (>10,000 cycles), and good self-discharging durability. Simultaneously, the change in transmittance of the device is well synchronized with the galvanostatic charging/discharging curve by which the real-time energy storage status is visually indicated. Furthermore, the practical feasibility of the device is successfully demonstrated. These results imply that the ECS fabricated in this work is a promising potential energy storage platform and an attractive component for future electronics.
