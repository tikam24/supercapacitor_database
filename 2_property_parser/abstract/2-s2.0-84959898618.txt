Energy and power capability of supercapacitors are important because of their use in providing backup power or pulse current to electronic/electric products or systems. The choice of the electrode materials, such as carbons, metal oxides or conducting polymers determines their mechanism of energy storage process. This short review focuses on the supercapacitors using porous carbon electrodes prepared from fibers of oil palm empty fruit bunches. The specific energy and specific power of these supercapacitors were analyzed to observe the change in their trend with respect to the electrode preparation parameters affecting the porosity, structure, surface chemistry and electrical conductivity of electrodes, and hence influence the energy and power capability of supercapacitors. This review finds that the trend of change in specific energy and specific power is not in favor of the expectation that both the specific energy and specific power should be in increasing trend with a significant progress.
