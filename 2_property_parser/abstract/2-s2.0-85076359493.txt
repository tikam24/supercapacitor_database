Some of the wind turbines today are recently using permanent magnetic synchronous generator (PMSG) due to its low cost, high-power efficiency and density characteristics. In most cases, a back-to-back power electronic converter is placed between the generator and the grid in a wind energy system such as modular multilevel converters (MMC) for flexible control. However, there may be some issues when this system is subjected to faults. Thus, to overcome or alleviate the effects of such issues, an integration of ultracapacitor (supercapacitor) has been considered in this work as an effective solution to improve the dynamics of output power characteristics. This paper investigates the improvements by ultracapacitor when it is installed at the DC link of back-to-back MMCs of a PMSG based wind energy system. The simulation results show that the adding of ultracapacitor to the wind energy system can improve the dynamics of the system and make the system more stable under fault conditions when compared to the case in which no ultracapacitor is utilized.
