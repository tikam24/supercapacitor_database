Nanostructured Ni(OH)2 is synthesized via an easy and cost-effective chemical deposition method with the addition of nonionic organic surfactant. The surfactant added has not taken any part in the reaction but it acts as a morphology directive. Structural and morphological characterization of prepared materials are evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The nanostructured “α” phase of Ni(OH)2 is confirmed by the XRD results. SEM images revealed the flower-like nanostructure assembled from dozens of nanosheets with the thickness 7–12 nm, forming macroporous structure. The pseudocapacitive performances are measured with cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) techniques. The maximum specific capacitance of 562 Fg−1 is exhibited from the prepared sample at the scan rate of 10 mV s−1 and 62% capacitance retention after 500 cycles. The experimental results show that the flower-like α-Ni(OH)2 is the promising candidate for supercapacitor electrode.
