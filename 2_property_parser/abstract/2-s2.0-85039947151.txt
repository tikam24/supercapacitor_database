This paper reviews the power quality challenges associated with intermittency of grid connected PV systems and reviews energy storage systems and inverter control techniques that can be utilized to mitigate the fluctuations and power quality issues effectively. This review forms part of a future study which will incorporate a hybrid supercapacitor and battery energy storage system for ramp rate control, moving average control and virtual synchronous machine control respectively to eliminate and reduce the reviewed power quality challenges in grid connected PV systems.
