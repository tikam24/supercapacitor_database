In this research work, the functional carbon was prepared by direct carbonization method without any physical or chemical activation from the dead plant leaves of Phyllanthus acidus (PAL) and tested for energy storage system of supercapacitors. This technique is very unique and appropriate to various dried biomass. The synthesized functional carbon was characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Raman spectroscopy (RAMAN), Field emission scanning microscopy (FESEM), Transmission electron microscope, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller Analysis. The functional carbon electrode materials were also assessed by Cyclic Voltammetry analysis (CV), Galvanostatic Charge and Discharge analysis (GCD), Electrochemical Impedance analysis (EIS) and Cycles stability studies in aqueous electrolyte (1M H2SO4) by using three-electrode systems. From the results, the electrode material of PAL-1000 indicates high specific capacitance of 347 F/g compared to other samples of PAL-600 and 800. The PAL-1000 exhibits a high energy density 43.38 Wh/kg and more power density of 625 W/kg. The outcomes of the result reflect that the micro porous functional carbon prepared with PAL as raw material provides eco-friendly, non-toxic and suitable as electrode material for supercapacitors.
