A composite of graphene nanosheets (GNS) decorated with manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanoparticles and interconnected by carbon nanotubes (CNTs) has been synthesized through a facile chemical method. SEM results suggest a homogeneous distribution of MnO2 nanoparticles (50-80 nm in size) on graphene nanosheets and excellent interconnectivity by CNTs. The MnO 2/GNS/CNTs electrode exhibits excellent rate capability and significantly improved cycling stability (95% capability retained after 1000 cycles), and a high capacitance of 240 F g-1 is obtained for nanoscale MnO2. In addition, the method for the synthesis of MnO 2/GNS/CNTs composites is simple and can be easily scaled up to real industrial manufacturing. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
