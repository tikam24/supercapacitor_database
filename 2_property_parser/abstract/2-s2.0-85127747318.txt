Higher energy/power of a supercapacitor device relay on different fundamental principles like ion diffusion and electron conduction within the electrode materials. To achieve both the characteristics in a single/pair of materials is a challenging task and probably can be achieved by integrating the pseudocapacitive and EDLCs in a single supercapacitor device. In this chapter, a detailed discussion on the selection of electrode materials and their integration in asymmetric as well as hybrid supercapacitor has been provided.
