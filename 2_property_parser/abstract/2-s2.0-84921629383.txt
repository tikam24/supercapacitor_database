Heterostructured ZnO/ZnS nanoforests are prepared through a simple two-step thermal evaporation method at 650°C and 1300°C in a tube furnace under the flow of argon gas, respectively. A metal catalyst (Au) to form a binary alloy has been used in the process. The as-obtained ZnO/ZnS products are characterized by using a series of techniques, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersion X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence. A possible growth mechanism is temporarily proposed. The hybrid structures are also directly functionalized as supercapacitor (SC) electrodes without using any ancillary materials such as carbon black or binder. Results show that the as-synthesized ZnO/ZnS heterostructures exhibit a greatly reduced ultraviolet emission and dramatically enhanced green emission compared to pure ZnO nanorods. The SCs data demonstrate high specific capacitance of 217 mF cm-2 at 1 mA cm-2 and excellent cyclic performance with 82% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at a current density of 2.0 mA cm-2.
