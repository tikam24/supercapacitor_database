This paper proposes a new control strategy for a two-converter hybrid power system of electric vehicles. This system is composed of a fuel cell which serves as the main power source, and Supercapacitors (SCs) which serve as auxiliary power source to deal with the transient power demand. The control objective to be addressed in such systems is to regulate the DC bus voltage and the SCs voltage to their reference values while smoothing the current of the fuel cell for the case where the load current information is unknown. To handle this unknown information, a novel approach based on the conjunction of the integral sliding mode control with the passivity-based control is developed. Compared to the existing works, the proposed approach requires neither the usage of a load admittance observer, nor the usage of a low-pass filter. The Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test results have used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
