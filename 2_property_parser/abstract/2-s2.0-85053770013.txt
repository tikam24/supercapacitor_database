An asymmetrically elastic electrochemical supercapacitor is fabricated using CoMn2O4/rGO as positive electrode and ternary N, B, and S co-doped elastic graphene aerogel as negative electrode. The combination not only endows the device superior energy density of 53.33 Wh Kg−1 at a high density of 400.00 W kg−1, but also offers a facile sensor application to feel external mechanical load with outstanding elasticity. Under the loading stress range from 0.1 to 10 N, the cell demonstrates sensitive current response towards the applied stress. It is observed that the elastic graphene aerogel offers important role by adjusting internal electric field, electric charge density and electrolyte contact in the device. Then, an elastic-electrochemical working mechanism is proposed. This declares that the elastic-electrochemical stress sensor can be a promising candidate for application in future wearable sensor electronics and system.
