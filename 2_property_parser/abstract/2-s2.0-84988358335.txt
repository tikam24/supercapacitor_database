Graphene oxide was prepared by the Hummers' method and then electrochemically reduced to produce graphene nanosheets. Physicochemical characterizations were performed using XRD, FTIR, FESEM, TEM, Raman and UV-Vis techniques to elucidate the structure and morphology of the prepared material. The electrochemical study had been conducted on graphene by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and impedance measurements, indicating its superb energy storage properties. The specific capacitance of graphene was 131 F g-1 at 0.1 A g-1. Impedance spectra showed low resistance of electrochemically produced graphene, supporting its suitability for energy storage applications, such as supercapacitor.
