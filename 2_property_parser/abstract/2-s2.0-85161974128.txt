Backgorund: Current study developed a sustainable and an efficient energy system by triply doping tin oxide (SnO2) host with the different lanthanides forming an n-type [Sm3+-Eu3+-Tm3+]: SnO2 heterostructure. Methods: Novel system was synthesized via chemical co-precipitation and thin films were fabricated. Significant findings: The synergistic electronic coupling of the rare earth dopants and SnO2 host based heterostructure was marked by band gap reduction spanning in the range of 3.48 – 3.59 eV and an average particle size of 47.7 nm with tetragonal rutile geometry. Its electro-catalytic activity for producing O2 and H2 excelled over the conventional catalysts with lower overpotential for O2 / H2 i.e. 260 and 143 mV and Tafel slope values of 89.8 and 66.9 mV dec−1, respectively. [Sm3+-Eu3+-Tm3+]: SnO2 is an auspicious electrode material for supercapacitors with the specific capacitance of 592.5 F g − 1 in 0.1 M NaCl, indicative of the characteristic pseudocapacitive behavior. This electrode is intact for an extended duration with the potential of acquiring higher current densities. Additionally, [Sm3+-Eu3+-Tm3+]: SnO2 electron transport layer in perovskite solar cell device ensued an efficiency of 14.23% and a fill factor of 66.94%. The improved photovoltaic parameters are expressive of the excellent connection between different layers enhancing the performance.
