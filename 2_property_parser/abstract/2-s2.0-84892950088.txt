A branchlike MoO3/polypyrrole conductive nanocomposite was facilely prepared by wrapping a homogeneous polypyrrole (PPy) layer around MoO3 nanobelts via the in situ oxidative polymerization of a self-assembled pyrrole monomer. X-ray powder diffraction characterization demonstrated that the PPy polymer does not hinder the crystallization of the MoO3 nanobelts substrate. The electrochemical tests show that the specific capacitance of 129 F g-1 for the MoO3/PPy hybrid is higher than both pristine MoO3 and pure PPy. Moreover, the hybrid electrode with good electrical conductivity displays good cyclic stability of 90% retention after 200 cycles of charge/discharge. These results indicate a promising potential application of the MoO3/PPy nanocomposite for use as an effective electrode material in supercapacitors. Â© 2013 American Chemical Society.
