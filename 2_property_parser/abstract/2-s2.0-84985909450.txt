The paper is studying serial constant current single transistor resonant converter with zero voltage switching (ZVS). The converter uses resonant inverter, which can start its operation directly in steady mode, hereof can work in mode close to short-circuit in the load. The converter was used for supercapacitor charging. The circuit provides charging with uniform current and voltage balance between different cells of supercapacitor.
