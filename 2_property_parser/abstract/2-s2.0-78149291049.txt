α-MnO2 nanorod was prepared by chemical precipitation with surfactant as the structure-directing agent and subsequent heat treatment at 800 °C. The morphology and structure of the prepared α-MnO2 were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). It was revealed that the α-MnO2 nanorod was successfully synthesized without impurities and the diameter of the nanorod was less than 50 nm. In cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatical discharge-charge test, the α-MnO 2 nanorod showed regular capacitive behaviors and good cycling stabilities and delivered a maximum capacitance of 166.2 F/g, which indicated that the α-MnO2 nanorod was a potential good electrode material for supercapacitor application. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.
