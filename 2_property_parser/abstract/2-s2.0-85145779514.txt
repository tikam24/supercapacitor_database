In this work, the application of composite electrode materials composed of carbon materials and transition metal oxides as electrodes for supercapacitors is reported. In situ N-doped activated carbon (NAC) is prepared by carbonization and KOH activation using polyurethane as raw material, and then Cu(CH3NOO)2 as copper source is used to prepare hierarchical porous N-doped activated carbon (Cu2O/CuO@NAC) through impregnation adsorption and hydrothermal treatment. The results show that the Cu2O/CuO@NAC composites have high specific surface area and 3D hierarchical porous structure with Cu2O/CuO loading on the surface and in the pores of the activated carbon, which is favorable for the capacitive performance. The Cu2O/CuO@NAC exhibits a remarkable specific capacitance of 1393.4 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. Therefore, the composite electrode materials of activated carbon and copper oxide represent good prospects for application in supercapacitors.
