Due to their long cyclic stability, higher power density, faster charge/discharge rates, and ease of operation, supercapacitors have gained popularity as energy storage devices. In the present work, a ternary hybrid electrode material based on nickel and manganese oxide (NiMnO3), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and polyaniline (PANI) was prepared using a facile hydrothermal method and in-situ polymerization of aniline. FTIR, XRD, SEM, TEM, EDS, BET and TGA were used for the characterization of synthesized materials. SEM reveals disc shaped morphology for NiMnO3 and shows fibrous morphology for PANI which helps in π-π interactions and enhances super capacitive performance of ternary hybrid. BET analysis reveals that the materials are mesoporous and ternary hybrid shows large surface area and pore volume needed for superior activity. The NiMnO3/CNT/PANI electrode material demonstrated good capacitive performance with 1276 F g−1 specific capacitance at 0.5 A g−1 current density and power density of 124.98 W kg−1 at 44.30 W h kg−1 energy density. Furthermore, the electrode exhibited a coulombic efficiency of 91.1 % when operating at 5 A g−1 current density. It also showed an impressive cyclic stability, maintaining 84.6 % of its capacitance after undergoing 5000 cycles. This outstanding performance can be attributed to increased structural stability and the synergistic effects due to involved components in the ternary hybrid.
