The proceedings contain 62 papers. The topics discussed include: initial testing of a laboratory scale superconducting magnetic energy storage system (SMES); systematic techno-economic analysis of medium-voltage PV-BES prosumers operating under NEM policy; performance assessment of supercapacitor energy storage integration into a renewable DC microgrid; identification of closed-spaced and poorly-damped oscillatory modes in ringdown responses of power systems; efficient 24-hour ahead PV energy production forecasting employing a transformer-based model; odd harmonic distortion contribution on a support vector machine NILM approach; assessment of energy management strategies in buildings equipped with modulating heat pumps; comparative analysis of machine learning models for short-term net load forecasting in renewable integrated microgrids; and wavelet-based automatic processing of dynamic responses for the development of dynamic load models.
