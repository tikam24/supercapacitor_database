This study proposes a unique hybrid structure with a one-dimensional activated carbon fiber (a uniform diameter of 300 nm) as a support for two-dimensional Na2Ti3O7 nanosheets (thickness of 20 nm) for a high-performance supercapacitor electrode (Na2Ti3O7/activated carbon fiber). With the important role of nanocomposites in improving electron and ion transportation, the Na2Ti3O7/activated carbon fiber displays a high specific capacity of 152 F g-1 at 1 A g-1, and a specific energy of 47.5 W h kg-1 at a specific power of 900 W kg-1 in the quasi-solid state supercapacitor with a voltage window of 0-1.6 V. Significantly, the sodium ion hybrid capacitor based on the Na2Ti3O7/activated carbon fiber nanocomposite as an anode and an active carbon fiber as a cathode exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of up to 76.8 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and a high energy density of 127.73 W h kg-1 at 95.79 W kg-1 within a wide operating voltage of 3.0 V. The excellent electrochemical performance of the Na2Ti3O7/activated carbon fiber nanocomposite benefits from the facile diffusion of electrons and ions, and a high structural stability during the electrochemical process.
