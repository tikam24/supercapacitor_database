In this paper the modelling of ultracapacitor system using continuous and discrete fractional order systems is presented. The discrete fractional order state-space model is obtained for the ultracapacitor basing on its original continuous time description. In order to make the state of the system accessibile for control purposes the Fractional-order Kalman Filter (FKF) and Extended Fractional-order Kalman Filter (EFKF) are recalled. The obtained model is used for designing and testing of a state feedback controller with EFKF. The results of simulations of the control system are given.
