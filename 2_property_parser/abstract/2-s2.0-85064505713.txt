Power fluctuation and fault-related complication are the two major issues for doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind energy conversion system (WECS). The occurrence of fault leads to the rotor over current, stator over current, and DC-link overvoltage as well. These uncertainties may damage the rotor circuit, converter circuit and force the disconnection of wind system from the grid. To get rid of these issues, a supercapacitor energy storage element along with a passive series dynamic resistor (SDR) is suggested in this paper. Supercapacitor energy storage system (SCESS) is located across the DC-link, which able to handle the power fluctuation and the SDR is placed in rotor circuit, which will reduce the overcurrent possibility. Simulation is carried for a DFIG-based WECS for three phase to ground fault and two phase to ground fault. During symmetrical fault as well as asymmetrical fault, various operational disorders appeared such as rotor overcurrent, stator overcurrent and DC-Link overvoltage are found to be within their permissible limits. The results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed strategy over the conventional vector control scheme and SCESS as well.
