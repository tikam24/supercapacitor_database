Nanoporous activated carbon materials derived from agro-wastes could be suitable low-cost electrode materials for high-rate performance electrochemical supercapacitors. Here we report high surface area nanoporous carbon materials derived from Lapsi seed agro-waste prepared by zinc chloride (ZnCl2) activation at 700 °C. Powder X-ray diffraction (pXRD) and Raman scattering confirmed the amorphous structure of the resulting carboniferous materials, which also incorporate oxygen-containing functional groups as confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) analyses revealed the granular, nanoporous structures of the materials. High-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) confirmed a graphitic carbon structure containing interconnected mesopores. Surface areas and pore volumes of the materials were found, respectively, in the ranges from 931 to 2272 m2 g−1 and 0.998 to 2.845 cm3 g−1, and are thus superior to commercially available activated carbons. High surface areas, large pore volumes and interconnected mesopore structures of these Lapsi seed-derived nanoporous carbon materials lead to their excellent electrochemical supercapacitance performance in aqueous electrolyte (1 M H2SO4) with a maximum specific capacitance of 284 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. Furthermore, the electrodes showed high-rate capability sustaining 67.7% capacity retention even at high current density of 20 A g−1 with excellent cycle stability achieving 99% capacitance retention even after 10,000 charge-discharge cycles demonstrating the potential of Lapsi seed derived nanoporous carbons as suitable electrode materials in high-performance supercapacitor devices.
