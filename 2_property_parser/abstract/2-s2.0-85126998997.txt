In this study, a simple and effective method was presented for the preparation of binder-free conducting polymer/metal oxide binary composite electrode materials. The novel electropolymerizable thiophene monomer, 3-[(2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophen-3′-yl)]-2-cyanoacrylic acid) (SDOGA), was specifically designed to fabricate homogeneous and chemically stable redox-active composite electrodes for pseudocapacitor applications. Poly(3-[(2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophen-3′-yl)]-2-cyanoacrylic acid) (PSDOGA) was electrochemically deposited on stainless steel substrates and modified with TiO2 and V2O5 particles via a simple, efficient and low-cost process without any polymeric binder. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques were used to study the pseudocapacitive properties of PSDOGA/TiO2 and PSDOGA/V2O5 binder-free binary composites in both three-electrode and two-electrode cell configurations. PSDOGA/TiO2 and PSDOGA/V2O5 composites delivered high specific capacitances of 396.4 Fg−1 and 444.5 Fg−1, respectively, at 2.5 mA cm−2 current density in single electrode measurements. Symmetrical supercapacitor devices assembled by using PSDOGA/TiO2 and PSDOGA/V2O5 binder-free binary composite electrodes exhibited satisfactory energy (78 W h kg−1 and 94.8 W h kg−1) and power (700 W kg−1 and 736 W kg−1) densities with good charge/discharge characteristics at a large operating voltage of 1.85 V. Furthermore, symmetric type supercapacitor cells achieved an excellent capacitance retention of 87% and 90% for 12 500 consecutive galvanic charge/discharge cycles at a constant current density of 2.5 mA cm−2. The experimental results revealed that the cooperation between conducting polymer film and metal oxide particles not only greatly enhanced the capacitive performances, but also improved the long-term charge/discharge stability of the redox-active electrode materials.
