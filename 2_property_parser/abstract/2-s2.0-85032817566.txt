In this study, zirconium-based metal organic framework (MOF) (UiO-66) has been synthesized and coated on carbon nanotube film (CNTF) (noted as U−C), the following is electrochemically codeposited poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-graphene oxide (PEDOT-GO) on U−C to obtain a flexible porous electrode (PEDOT-GO/U−C). The electrochemical measurements including cyclic voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic charge/discharge have been performed. Electrochemical studies show that the PEDOT-GO/U−C electrode exhibits an exceptionally areal capacitance of 102 mF cm−2 at 10 mV s−1 than that of PEDOT/U−C electrode (89 mF cm−2) with a three-electrode system, indicating the existence of GO in the composites effectively improve the capacitive performance of PEDOT/U−C. Moreover, there is a synergistic effect between UiO-66, PEDOT and GO sheets. A device of PEDOT-GO/U−C has also been assembled and tested. The optimum device shows the energy and power densities of 0.0022 mWh cm−2 and 0.2 mW cm−2 at the current density of 0.4 mA cm−2. The device exhibits the excellent flexible properties under different curvature conditions.
