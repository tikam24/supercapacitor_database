Cell voltage equalization is inevitable to ensure years of safe operation of series-connected energy storage cells, such as lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors (SCs). Although various kinds of cell voltage equalizers have been proposed, most equalizer topologies require multiple switches and/or a multiwinding transformer, resulting in complex circuitry and poor modularity. In this paper, a single-switch single-transformer equalizer using a forward-flyback resonant inverter (FFRI) with a voltage multiplier is proposed. The required switch count of the proposed equalizer is the minimum without impairing modularity due to the single-switch circuitry with no need for a multiwinding transformer. An experimental equalization test performed for eight SCs connected in series successfully demonstrated the equalization performance of the proposed equalizer. The FFRI can be extended as a "resonant input cell," and by combining one of resonant input cells and a voltage multiplier, a single-switch resonant equalization charger that is basically a charger with an equalization function is also derived. An experimental charging test using the resonant equalization charger was also performed, and its equalization-charging performance was demonstrated.
