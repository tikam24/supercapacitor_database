The function and performance of supercapacitors are determined by materials. However, their rational design is of paramount importance as well. In this paper, we report on a three-dimensional coral-like Ni2P-ACC nanostructure as binder-free electrode for greatly improved supercapacitor. This strategy is aimed first at forming a unique structure for lager redox-active sites and better spatial utilization, and second at producing greater conductivity and a hydrophilic high-polarized surface, which enhances the migration rate of ions between the electrolyte and the exposed surface. When Ni2P-ACC is employed as a positive electrode, it exhibits high areal capacity (2438 mF cm−2 or 3352 F g−1), and super-long cycle life (99% and 97.7% charge retentions after 5000 and 10,000 cycles, respectively). In addition, the ASC device with Ni2P-ACC and activated carbon electrodes also shows high areal capacity and long-term stability (88.8% retention of specific capacitance for 10,000 cycles). These results indicate that coral-like Ni2P-ACC nanostructure can be expected to become the candidate for supercapacitor electrodes in energy conversion.
