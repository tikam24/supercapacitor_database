The carbon nanotubes attached mesoporous Ag3O4-coated NiO nanosheets were prepared successfully through hydrothermal method. The structural, morphological and electrochemical properties of the prepared nanocomposite have been studied. The X-ray diffraction and Raman analysis confirms the presence of NiO, Ag3O4 and carbon nanotubes in the prepared sample. HRTEM images clearly show the coating of Ag3O4 on the NiO and attachment of carbon nanotubes. BET surface area analysis confirms the mesoporous nature of the prepared composite. The cyclic voltammetric (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and impedance analysis were made to explore the electrochemical nature of the composite. Cyclic voltammograms reveals the maximum specific capacity of 415.86 mAh g−1 at the scan rate of 3 mV s−1 and GCD analysis exhibits the specific capacity of 416.63 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1. The prepared nanocomposite retained 97% of maximum capacity even after 1500 cycles.
