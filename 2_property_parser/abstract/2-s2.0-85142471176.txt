The family of halide perovskite materials is extremely large and has gained huge attention because of their low manufacturing cost and extraordinary structural, optical, electrical, and optoelectronic properties. These materials also deliver a pattern for designing new materials for energy conversion and energy storage applications. Here, we synthesized potassium cadmium chloride KCdCl3-based halide perovskite nanocomposites with rGO and fullerene-C60 by facile solvothermal method and studied their physical and electrochemical properties. The orthorhombic phase of KCdCl3 was confirmed from XRD spectra, and the existence of constituent elements (K, Cd, Cl, and C) was confirmed from EDX analysis. SEM images evident the successful anchoring of KCdCl3 particles over rGO and C60. BET results revealed the high surface area, pore radius, and pore volume of the KCdCl3/C60 electrodes. Furthermore, the electrochemical measurements demonstrated that KCdCl3/C60-based electrodes have a higher specific capacitance of 1135 F/g at 5 mV/s and cyclic stability (97.6% retention over 3000th cycles) than other grown electrodes. Also, GCD measurement results revealed that KCdCl3/C60 electrode has a high specific capacitance of 1420 F/g, an energy density of 2052 Wh/kg, and a power density of 4.19 W/kg at 1.0 A/g than other electrodes. Finally, intensive discussion proposed that halide perovskite nanocomposite electrodes can be used efficiently as supercapacitors electrode materials for future development in this field.
