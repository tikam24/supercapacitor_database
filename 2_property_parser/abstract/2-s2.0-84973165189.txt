In power system control unicontrol with single storage units or centralized control with multiple storage units to meet different level targets is challenging. Considering the charge and discharge characteristics of storage devices, this paper proposes a hierarchical configuration structure of a battery and supercapacitor mixed storage scenario, and develops a convenient control method for accessing various DC loads and can central manage mass batteries in one place. Aiming at the optimal management of large scale battery storage, the paper proposes a three-layer battery hierarchical control structure and the control objects and control circuits are discussed. Simulation studies are used to verify the control effect of the hierarchical storage system and the results show that the strategy can effectively decrease photovoltaic output fluctuation.
