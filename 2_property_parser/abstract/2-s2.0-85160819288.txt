Energy storage has always been a major concern in the present-day situation. Advanced energy storage devices are batteries, supercapacitor and solar cells. However, advancements have been noteworthy in the field of high-performance hybrid supercapacitors. On this note, we have fabricated a hybrid supercapacitor electrode material Potassium tantalate nano cube (KT NCs) and its reduced graphene oxide composite (KT-rGO NCs) and tested its electrochemical performance. The materials showed high performances with specific capacitance of 565 F/g for KT NCs and 850 F/g for KT-rGO NCs respectively. Energy densities of both KT NCs & KT-rGO NCs are 28.24 Wh/Kg and 29.50 Wh/kg with good retention capacities. Further detailed study of both KT NCs and KT-rGO NCs are carried out with characterization techniques like XRD, FTIR, BET, Raman and HRTEM for structural analysis and electrochemical measurements to analyse various parameters pertaining to its charge storage capacity.
