In this article, the tunable capacitance properties of mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (MGCN) by tailoring its textural properties are reported. MGCN with different textural properties is synthesized by a hard template method using two different templates namely, SBA-15 and KIT-6. The formation of graphitic layers in the as-synthesized samples is confirmed by X-ray diffraction studies and successful replication of morphology and mesoporosity of the templates into the as-synthesized samples is confirmed by microscopic and nitrogen adsorption-desorption studies. The bulk and surface chemical composition of the as-synthesized samples are analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, CHNS/O analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies. The specific capacitance values of 322 and 245 F g−1 are obtained at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 for MGCN synthesized using SBA-15 and KIT-6, respectively. Although, MGCN synthesized using SBA-15 (MGCN-SBA-15) exhibits higher specific capacitance than MGCN synthesized using KIT-6 (MGCN-KIT-6), its rate performance is slightly lower than that of MGCN-KIT-6. The higher specific capacitance of MGCN-SBA-15 is attributed to its high surface area, more number of mesopores and large pore volume, whereas the presence of highly ordered mesopores in MGCN-KIT-6 results in higher rate performance. Both MGCN-SBA-15 and MGCN-KIT-6 electrodes demonstrate excellent cycling stability over 15,000 cycles. These results demonstrate that the supercapacitive performances of MGCN can be improved by tailoring its textural properties.
