Two-dimensional (2D) atomically thick materials, graphene oxide (GO) and layered molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets have been potentially investigated as novel energy storage materials due to their unique physicochemical properties. The present manuscript describes a facile binder-free approach to fabricate large-scale hybrid 2D MoS2/GO nanosheet-based electrodes using the electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method on a conducting substrate (nickel foam) for supercapacitor device applications. Structural and morphological analysis reveals uniform decoration of the electrophoretically assembled 2D MoS2/GO nanosheets over the entire substrate surface. The electrochemical supercapacitive measurements of the MoS2/GO hybrid electrode show a high specific capacitance of âˆ¼613 F g-1 at a low scan rate. Moreover, the MoS2/GO//GO electrode-based asymmetric supercapacitor device reveals ultra-high energy (23 W h kg-1) and power (17 kW kg-1) density. The superior electrochemical properties of the 2D MoS2 synergist with high surface area offered by conducting GO and mutually MoS2/GO improves the electrochemical capacitive performance with charge transport and storage. The direct hybrid electrode fabrication by the EPD method (a binder approach) eliminates the drawbacks offered by resistive binders in conventional electrodes. The present experimental findings can evoke scalable binder-free synthesis of MoS2/GO hybrid electrodes with enhanced supercapacitive performance in energy storage devices.
