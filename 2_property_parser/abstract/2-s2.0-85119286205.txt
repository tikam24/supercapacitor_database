This paper presents a human body temperature monitoring system in which the temperature read by the sensor is analyzed by the programmed logic from a microcontroller. Two LEDs are used to signal out the patientâ€™s body temperature. The whole system is powered by button cell type supercapacitors which are charged by a mini photovoltaic panel. This system is designed and addressed to people who want or need to continuously monitor their body temperature. It is a compact and easy to use system, being integrated in a bracelet that is attached to the upper arm. The successful functioning of the designed power supply opens new directions in the on-body sensor field, where the replacement of the classical batteries can be avoided by the patient.
