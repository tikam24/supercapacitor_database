A high-quality porous CoNi2S4 nanoplates array was in situ synthesized on carbon fibers (CFS) by a hydrothermal method via a CoNi-layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursor transformation process. The CoNi2S4@CFS electrode exhibits largely enhanced supercapacitor performance with a specific capacitance of 1724 F/g at 1 A/g, in comparison with that of the CoNi-LDH (1302 F/g) precursor. Furthermore, the CoNi2S4@CF electrode shows an extremely high rate capability with capacity retention of 79% under a charge density of 60 A/g, whereas the retention rate of CoNi-LDH@CFS is only ∼34%. The abundant pore structure, improved electrical conductivity, and lower internal resistances of CoNi2S4@CFS (1.0 ω) compared to those of CoNi-LDH@CFS (9.5 ω) are responsible for the enhancement of energy storage performance. By using the CoNi2S4 nanoplate array as the positive electrode, an all-solid-state asymmetric fiber-shaped supercapacitor was further obtained, which exhibits outstanding flexible, foldable, and wearable capability. In view of the component tunability for LDH materials, the hydroxide precursor transformation method with merits of mild conditions and easy operation can be extended to the synthesis of a variety of metal sulfides for broad applications in electronic devices.
