Supercapacitors, which can supply superior energy density compared to conventional dielectric capacitors and higher power density than batteries, have attracted considerable attention as a promising energy storage device. However, cycle performance and specific energy density are still key factors limiting its practical applications. This work reports a facile synthesis of high-performance asymmetric supercapacitors with hybrid nickel phosphides/nickel foam as positive electrode and biomass-based sulfur-doped hierarchical porous activated carbon as negative electrodes. It demonstrates a novel one-step colloid synthesis of nickel phosphides directly on commercial nickel foam as only nickel source. The obtained electrode exhibits satisfactory specific capacity of 1032 C g−1 (2293 F g−1) at 1 A g−1 and cyclic stability over 10,000 cycles. Most importantly, the fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor devices show excellent cyclic stability with 85.7% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles and deliver a maximum energy density of 42.2 Wh kg−1 at 741.1 W kg−1 power density. To the best of our knowledge, the assembled device in this report has absolute advantages in fields requiring simultaneous high energy density and long-term operation at high current density. These promising results demonstrate the possibility of a facile synthesis of efficient asymmetric supercapacitors with high electrochemical response and cycling stability.
