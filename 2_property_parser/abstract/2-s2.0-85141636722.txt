Dielectrics are an important category of materials that are useful for a variety of industrial applications in electrical transmission, electronic devices, energy storage, etc. This chapter focuses on the basic aspects of permittivity, relative permittivity or dielectric constant, and the role of dielectrics in electronic devices (Field Effect Transistors (FETs) and Single Electron Transistors (SETs) and energy storage devices (capacitor, supercapacitor, and battery). In the realm of silicon electronics, the dielectrics are classified into 2 types viz. high-k (materials with a dielectric constant greater than SiO2) and low-k (materials with a dielectric constant lesser than SiO2). The high-k dielectrics come in handy during the process of device miniaturization. They also enhance certain performance parameters of the MOSFETs and SETs, which are discussed in detail in this chapter. Besides, the role of dielectrics in a capacitor and the choice of solvent for supercapacitors and batteries have been discussed in reference to the dielectric constant.
