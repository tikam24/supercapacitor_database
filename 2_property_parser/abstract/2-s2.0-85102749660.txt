Biochar is a byproduct generated from the hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass, such as corn stover, in an anaerobic environment. This work aims to convert biochar into a value-added product of carbon nanofibrous felt. First, the biochar-containing precursor membrane was prepared from simultaneous electrospinning and electrospraying. After thermal stabilization in air and car-bonization in argon, the obtained precursor membrane was converted into a mechanically flexible and robust carbon nanofibrous felt. Electrochemical results revealed that the biochar-derived carbon nanofibrous felt might be a good candidate as a supercapacitor electrode with a good rate ca-pability and high kinetic performance.
