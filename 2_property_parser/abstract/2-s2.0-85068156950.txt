Two-dimensional molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a promising electrode material for supercapacitors, attributing to attractive physical properties, outstanding electrical properties, and ultrahigh exposed surface area. However, MoS2 bulk suffers from low capacity due to the overlaying of the layers and the poor electric conductivity. Covalent functionalization of MoS2 is a promising, yet challenging, approach to overcome the drawbacks and boost electrochemical performance. Here, we report a series of sandwich-like 4-aminophenyl functionalized MoS2/polyaniline (MoS2-NH2/PANI) nanosheets by in situ growth of PANI on MoS2-NH2 templates. The optimized MoS2-NH2/PANI nanosheets express a high capacitance of 326.4 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 and a superior rate retention of 63.1% when the current density increased from 0.5 A g-1 to 1000 A g-1 in a three-electrode system. Impressively, the corresponding symmetric supercapacitors deliver an electrochemical cycling stability with 96.5% retention after 10000 cycles at 5 A g-1. Our strategy of covalent linking PANI onto functional MoS2 provides a feasible approach to improve the electrochemical performance of MoS2-based materials for energy storage.
