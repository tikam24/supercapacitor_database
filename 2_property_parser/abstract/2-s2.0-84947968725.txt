We report metallic cobalt pyrite (CoS2) nanowires (NWs) prepared directly on current collecting electrodes, e.g., carbon cloth or graphite disc, for high-performance supercapacitors. These CoS2 NWs have a variety of advantages for supercapacitor applications. Because the metallic CoS2 NWs are synthesized directly on the current collector, the good electrical connection enables efficient charge transfer between the active CoS2 materials and the current collector. In addition, the open spaces between the sea urchin structure NWs lead to a large accessible surface area and afford rapid mass transport. Moreover, the robust CoS2 NW structure results in high stability of the active materials during long-term operation. Electrochemical characterization reveals that the CoS2 NWs enable large specific capacitance (828.2 F g-1 at a scan rate of 0.01 V s-1) and excellent long term cycling stability (0-2.5% capacity loss after 4250 cycles at 5 A g-1) for pseudocapacitors. This example of metallic CoS2 NWs for supercapacitor applications expands the opportunities for transition metal sulfide-based nanostructures in emerging energy storage applications.
