The proceedings contain 35 papers. The topics discussed include: sliding mode controller in fault tolerant PMSM drive; automatic restoration of power supply considering islanded operation of distribution network; a simple current control strategy for two-level four-leg inverters: the model predictive approach; predictive torque control of a multi-drive system based on a two-stage six-leg matrix converter with unity input power factor; active and reactive power control of doubly fed induction generator using direct power control technique; improving safety of cable networks by modeling deflectors of cable accessories; flatness control of batteries/supercapacitors hybrid sources for electric traction; optimal sizing study of hybrid wind/PV/diesel power generation unit using genetic algorithm; sliding mode control of a permanent magnets synchronous machine; and energy management of fuel cell/ supercapacitor hybrid power sources based on the flatness control.
