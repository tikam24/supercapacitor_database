The sea/ocean energy is a source of renewable energy sources with high energy potential in the nature. There is more than one kind of energy in the sea/ocean, and these are wind, wave, tide, flow energy. The aim of this work is to design a system that will turn multiple energy sources into electricity. Utilizing the wind and surface flow energy in offshore, a platform with a high potential hybrid power generation system model was created. In order to ensure the durability of these intermittent and unstable energy types that are inherent in renewable energy sources, a hybrid energy storage unit which are composed from battery and ultra-capacitor has been implemented to the proposed hybrid power generation system to provide the optimum solution for meeting the demand side and producing high quality electricity. In this study, all units were simulated using the hybrid power generation system and the hybrid energy storage system MATLAB/Simulink program. The hybrid power generation system and the hybrid energy storage system transfer a single-phase inverter with a single DC bus. The smart energy management algorithm in the system provides control of direct current converter and inverter circuits take into account on all power values. In this study, current, voltage and power graphical results are given by examining the dynamic behavior of possible working states of the total system. By taking the results of Case 1 from the probable working states of the system, it helps to see fast and predictable results of the simulation studies before the experimental studies.
