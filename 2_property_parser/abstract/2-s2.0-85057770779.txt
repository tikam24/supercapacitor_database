Lithium-ion capacitor battery is a late-model energy storage system. It can combine the lithium-ion battery with the capacitor to ensure that it has a high specific capacity and excellent large-current discharge performance. In this paper, a novel Li+-doped Ni0.64Mn0.64Al0.56O2 is synthesized by coprecipitation method and as a capacitor active material with commercialized LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 in different proportions forms the cathode of the lithium-ion capacitor batteries. By analyzing the results of physical property characterization, when the mass ratio is 7:3, the crystal size of cathode material is less than 2 μm with uniform porous distribution. And, through electrochemical tests, the cathode has the greatest excellent reversibility, the lowest-charge resistance, and the fastest-lithium-ion diffusion rate. Specific capacity can reach 196.34 mAh g−1 at 0.5°C and, even at 5°C current density, it also can be 67.63 mAh g-1. After 110 times charge and discharge cycles, capacity retention of this cathode material at 5°C still can be over 85%.
