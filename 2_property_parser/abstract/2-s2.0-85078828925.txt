Herein, the design and fabrication of a smart electrochromic supercapacitor using Au mesh and polyaniline (PANI) electrodes is reported. The Au mesh is obtained through the crackle templating method, whereas PANI is brought in by electrodeposition. The device exhibits a high capacitance of ≈15 mF cm−2 with good charge–discharge cycling stability. What is attractive about this device is that it can switch its color rapidly to yellow, green, or blue, depending on the operable voltage window that should serve to indicate the level of energy stored in the supercapacitor, visually.
