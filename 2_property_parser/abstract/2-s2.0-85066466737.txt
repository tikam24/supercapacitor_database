In this paper, a facile two-step method was adopted to in-situ develop a flexible electrode with NiCo-LDH nanowires@NiCo-LDH nanosheets core-shell structure on carbon fiber cloth (CFC). The electrochemical properties of the composite materials with different Ni/Co molar ratios nanosheets were systematically studied. It is found that the NiCo-LDH nanowires@Ni2Co1-LDH nanosheets (NiCo@Ni2Co1) composite material achieves a high areal capacitance of 9.67 F/cm2 at 5 mA/cm2 and a good cycling stability (75% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles). The excellent performance benefits from the distinct core-shell structure and the synergistic effect of NiCo-LDH nanosheets and NiCo-LDH nanowires. Moreover, a solid-state flexible asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) assembled with NiCo@Ni2Co1/CFC as positive electrode and activated carbon on CFC as negative electrode can work stably at a voltage of 1.6 V. This ASC displays a high areal energy density of 298.6 uWh/cm2 at a current density of 1 mA/cm2 and with a corresponding areal power density of 0.80 mW/cm2.
