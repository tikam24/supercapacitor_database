In this work, the Ni-MOFs of electrode material has been synthesized, characterized and studied for the electrochemical properties of electrode materials. The effects of the doping amount of Ni, calcination temperature and time were studied in detail. The results suggested that the electrochemical properties were obviously improved by the Ni-MOFs of electrode material and the best preparation conditions can also improve the electrochemical properties of electrode materials. These results open a way for the design of tailored MOFs as electrode materials for supercapacitors.
