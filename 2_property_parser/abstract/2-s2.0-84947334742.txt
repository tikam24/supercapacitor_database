MoS2 nanosheets are grown on the surface of carbon fibers by a facile one-step hydrothermal method, forming a core-shell nanocomposite, as manifested in scanning/transmission electron microscopy, Raman scattering, and X-ray diffraction measurements. Electrochemical studies show that the core-shell nanocomposites exhibit enhanced capacitance performance in comparison with MoS2 nanoparticles or bare carbon fibers alone, with a specific capacitance as high as 474.4 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g in 1 M Na2So4 aqueous electrolyte and excellent long-term cycle stability with only 3.1% loss of the capacitance after 3,000 charge/discharge cycles. This is accounted for by the large effective surface area of the MoS2 nanosheets as well as good electronic conductivity of the nanocomposites.
