A layered Co3O4 was obtained by thermal decomposition of Co2(OH)2CO3 precursor prepared via a hydrothermal process. The structure and morphology were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Electrochemical properties of Co3O4 electrode were preformed by cyclic voltammogram and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements in 6 mol·L-1 KOH electrolyte with the potential range from -0.1 to 0.5 V (vs Ag/AgCl). The results demonstrated that the layered Co 3O4 obtained at 200 °C had a good stability and cyclic performance. Its specific capacitance as single electrode was up to 505 F·g-1.
