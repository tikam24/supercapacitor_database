Abstractâ€”: Samples prepared via chemical, thermal, and microwave reduction of graphene oxide have been characterized by elemental analysis, BET measurements, scanning electron microscopy, and IR spectroscopy and tested as supercapacitor electrode materials. A supercapacitor having electrodes from chemically reduced graphene oxide has been shown to have the highest specific capacitance and the best long-term cycling stability.
