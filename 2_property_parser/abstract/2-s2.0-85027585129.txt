The properties of Polyindole (Pind) such as high redox activity, thermal stability, and slow degradation favor its use in various applications such as supercapacitors and sensors. However, due to strict current regulations, ideal materials for such applications are required to be “green” (environment-friendly), and also possess green fabrication routes. Further still, for the best performance, such materials should have electroactive morphologies fit for ions mobility-especially for energy storage. In this letter, we address the dual by presenting a simple green approach to fabricate Pind composite nanofibers via electrospinning. The resultant materials show properties fitting for use in supercapacitors and sensors.
