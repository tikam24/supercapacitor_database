Supercapacitors as an important component of sustainable energy system attract tremendous attention, but improvement of their performance in energy density and power capability is still considered as a challenging task. Herein, a versatile electrochemical activation strategy is introduced for a prototypical MnO2 film-coated carbon nanotubes (MnO2@CNTs) based electrode to boost its electrochemical energy storage performance. The electrochemical activation process was completed by an initial charge-discharge cycling operation, which led to the dense MnO2 film transforming into ultrathin three-dimensional (3D) nanosheets birnessite with an unexpected Na+ ions diffusion path. By adjusting electrochemical activation parameters, the nanostructure and intercalated Na+ content of birnessite was optimized. The electrochemical activated MnO2@CNTs-based supercapacitor showed a specific capacitance as high as âˆ¼404 F g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1, and about 78.7% of the initial capacitance was retained at a high current density of 100 A g-1. This should be ascribed to the optimized MnO2 3D nanosheets structure and uniformly embedded Na+ ions after electrochemical activation operations, which greatly enhanced the surface- and diffusion-controlled capacitance during the electrochemical cycling processes. It is believed that this work will provide a significant strategy for the development of high-performance supercapacitor electrodes.
