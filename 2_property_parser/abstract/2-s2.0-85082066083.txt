An asymmetric fiber-shaped supercapacitor (FSC) with roll-type configuration, displaying high power and energy density characteristics, has been fabricated for energy storage in wearable devices. The positive and negative electrodes of the asymmetric FSC consist of polyaniline (PANI) and MoO3, respectively, and are deposited on a carbon fiber (CF) substrate using a chemical bath deposition method. A polyvinyl alcohol/H2SO4 gel is used as electrolyte, which also maintains the CF electrodes in fiber form. The asymmetric PANI//MoO3 roll-type FSC exhibits a wider potential range than its symmetric PANI//PANI counterpart, resulting in higher energy and power densities. The asymmetric PANI//MoO3 roll-type FSC shows an energy density of 67.51 µWh/cm3 with a power density of 59.71 mW/cm3 at a current of 10 mA, which is more than twice the energy density of symmetric PANI//PANI roll-type FSC (30.42 µWh/cm3 and 25.12 mW/cm3).
