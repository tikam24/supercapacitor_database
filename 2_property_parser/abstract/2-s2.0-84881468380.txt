We utilize high-conductivity Te nanowire arrays grown on flexible carbon fibre to fabricate a hybrid Te/Au/MnO2 core-shell nanostructure as a supercapacitor electrode. Electrochemical measurements show that a very high specific capacitance of 930 F g-1 (based on the mass of MnO 2) is obtained for Te/Au/MnO2 core-shell nanostructures. In addition, our Te nanowire array-based supercapacitor exhibits excellent rate capability and long term cycling stability. Uniquely, high-density Te nanowire arrays offer a high specific surface area to the hybrid Te/Au/MnO2 core-shell nanostructure which profoundly increases the specific capacitance. These results indicate that Te nanowire array/Au/MnO2 core-shell nanostructures show promising applications as electrode materials for energy storage. Â© 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
