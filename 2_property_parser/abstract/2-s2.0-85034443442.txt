Wearable electronics are developing rapidly in recent years. In this work, we develop a cost-effective, facile, and scalable approach to transform insulating cotton textile to highly conductive Ni-coated cotton textile (NCT). In order to verify the feasibility of NCT as a flexible current collector for wearable supercapacitors, we electrodeposit low-crystalline Ni-Al layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles onto the NCT. The obtained NCT@NiAl-LDH shows high specific capacitance (935.2 mF cm–2), superior rate capability, and good cyclability. Besides, the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) assembled from NCT@NiAl-LDH exhibits high specific energy of 58.8 Wh kg–1 (134 μWh cm–2) when the specific power is 539 W kg–1 (1228 μW cm–2). The results demonstrate great potential of our methodology.
