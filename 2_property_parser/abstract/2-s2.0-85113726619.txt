Crumpled B, F co-doped graphene nanosheets (BFGO) have been synthesized using supercritical water as the solvent in a short reaction time of 1 h and were demonstrated for the fabrication of all-solid-state flexible supercapacitors (ASFS). As-synthesized BFGO delivered high specific capacitance with an NaVO3/H2SO4 electrolyte (832 F g-1). Moreover, the fabricated ASFS showed excellent energy and power densities of 24 W h kg-1 and 800 W kg-1 at 1 A g-1, respectively. This journal is
