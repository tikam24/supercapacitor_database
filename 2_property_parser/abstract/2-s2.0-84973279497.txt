The emergence of stretchable electronic devices has attracted intensive attention. However, most of the existing stretchable electronic devices can generally be stretched only in one specific direction and show limited specific capacitance and energy density. Here, we report a stretchable isotropic buckled carbon nanotube (CNT) film, which is used as electrodes for supercapacitors with low sheet resistance, high omnidirectional stretchability, and electro-mechanical stability under repeated stretching. After acid treatment of the CNT film followed by electrochemical deposition of polyaniline (PANI), the resulting isotropic buckled acid treated CNT@PANI electrode exhibits high specific capacitance of 1147.12 mF cm-2 at 10 mV s-1. The supercapacitor possesses high energy density from 31.56 to 50.98 Î¼Wh cm-2 and corresponding power density changing from 2.294 to 28.404 mW cm-2 at the scan rate from 10 to 200 mV s-1. Also, the supercapacitor can sustain an omnidirectional strain of 200%, which is twice the maximum strain of biaxially stretchable supercapacitors based on CNT assemblies reported in the literature. Moreover, the capacitive performance is even enhanced to 1160.43-1230.61 mF cm-2 during uniaxial, biaxial, and omnidirectional elongations.
