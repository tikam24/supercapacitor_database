In this work, we propose a novel method for the preparation of polypyrrole (PPy) layers on textile fabrics using a reactive inkjet printing technique with direct freezing of inks under varying temperature up to −16◦ C. It was found that the surface resistance of PPy layers on polypropylene (PP) fabric, used as a standard support, linearly decreased from 6335 Ω/sq. to 792 Ω/sq. with the decrease of polymerization temperature from 23◦ C to 0◦ C. The lowest surface resistance (584 Ω/sq.) of PPy layer was obtained at −12◦ C. The spectroscopic studies showed that the degree of the PPy oxidation as well as its conformation is practically independent of the polymerization temperature. Thus, observed tendences in electrical conductivity were assigned to change in PPy layer morphology, as it is significantly influenced by the reaction temperature: the lower the polymerization temperature the smoother the surface of PPy layer. The as-coated PPy layers on PP textile substrates were further assembled as the electrodes in symmetric all-solid-state supercapacitor devices to access their electrochemical performance. The electrochemical results demonstrate that the symmetric supercapacitor device made with the PPy prepared at −12◦ C, showed the highest specific capacitance of 72.3 F/g at a current density of 0.6 A/g, and delivers an energy density of 6.12 Wh/kg with a corresponding power density of 139 W/kg.
