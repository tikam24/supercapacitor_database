Supercapacitors have become a popular form of energy-storage device in the current energy and environmental landscape, and their performance is heavily reliant on the electrode materials used. Carbon-based electrodes are highly desirable due to their low cost and their abundance in various forms, as well as their ability to easily alter conductivity and surface area. Many studies have been conducted to enhance the performance of carbon-based supercapacitors by utilizing various carbon compounds, including pure carbon nanotubes and multistage carbon nanostructures as electrodes. These studies have examined the characteristics and potential applications of numerous pure carbon nanostructures and scrutinized the use of a wide variety of carbon nanomaterials, such as AC, CNTs, GR, CNCs, and others, to improve capacitance. Ultimately, this study provides a roadmap for producing high-quality supercapacitors using carbon-based electrodes.
