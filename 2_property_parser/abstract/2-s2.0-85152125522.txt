An ultralow Fe-modulated hierarchical porous carbon structure was prepared by defect engineering. Unique porous nature, accessibility, pathway for electron transfer and active site density synergistically contribute to excellent supercapacitor. Defect induced high surface area of Fe-N-doped carbon exhibit 825 F g−1 capacitance at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. An aqueous symmetric system showed capacitance of 87.9 F g−1 with a specific energy of 12.66 Wh Kg−1 and specific power of 677 W Kg−1 at 1.0 A g−1. These results ensured that the ultralow Fe doped hierarchical porous carbon structure is a preferable material for energy storage applications.
