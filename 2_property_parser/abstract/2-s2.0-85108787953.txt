The exploration of biocompatible materials has received greater significance in the research area of energy storage tools. In the present work, a composite material consisting of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) with CuO@MnO2 is synthesized via thermal reduction protocol. The resulting composite material exhibited unique morphology and excellent electrochemical properties. The electrochemical properties were premeditated by CV, GCD, and spectral impedance analysis. Electrochemical analyses of the composite materials indicated the extraordinary specific capacitance in a three-electrode configuration. The composite displayed the value of ~414 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A gâˆ’1 and the electrodes retaining 96.2% capacitance after 5000 cycles. Therefore, our study demonstrated the synergistic effect of CuO@MnO2 nanoparticles with porous CMC network structures show enhanced electrochemical properties in the presence of 3 M KOH as an electrolyte.
