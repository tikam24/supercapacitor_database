Supercapacitors are one of the most promising energy storage devices, and the performance is closely related to the structure and composition of electrode materials. However, as a promising electrode material, metal oxides are plagued by the disadvantages of low conductivity and unideal cycling stability in the application. Therefore, many kinds of research are devoted to developing new composite materials with nanostructures to solve this problem. In this study, MgMoO4 is uniformly loaded on flower-shaped CuCo2O4 grown on foam nickel (NF) by a simple hydrothermal method. This special composite structure can effectively play a synergistic role between the two materials, thus improving its overall performance. The results show that the CuCo2O4@MgMoO4-2 (CCM-2) electrode material has a high specific capacitance of 1153 F g−1 when the current density is 1 A g−1, indicating that it owns the best physical and chemical structure in various composite materials. Furthermore, the CCM-2//activated carbon(AC) asymmetric supercapacitors (ASC) device delivers high specific energy of 24.9 Wh kg−1 at the specific power of 160 W kg−1, and an excellent cycling stability (82.5 % capacitance remain after 10000 cycles). The above results show that the prepared electrode materials have great potential in supercapacitor electrode materials.
