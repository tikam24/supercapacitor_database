The supercapacitor using nano-structured Fe3O4 and activated carbon (AC) as electrode materials was developed. Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles with average particle size of 36nm were synthesized by microwave method using FeSO4Â·7H2O and ammonia as the precipitator. Three kinds of supercapacitors, Fe3O4/KOH/Fe3O4, AC/KOH/AC, Fe3O4/KOH/AC, were prepared using 6mol/L KOH as electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used to study the performance of the electrodes and the supercapacitors. The results show that the operating voltage of Fe3O4/K0H/AC hybrid supercapacitor is 1.2V. When the current density is 0.2mA/cm2 and the weight ratio of active materials (Fe3O4/AC) is 1.5, the energy density of hybrid supercapacitor is 9.25Wh/kg, which is 53.4% higher than that of AC/KOH/AC capacitor with the same electrolyte.
