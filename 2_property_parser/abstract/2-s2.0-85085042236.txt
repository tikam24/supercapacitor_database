This paper presents the simulation of hybrid supercapacitor and lithium ion battery charging for electric vehicles. The currents for both devices are controlled to be constant for preventing overcurrent to maintain the lifetime. This charging simulation uses MATLAB Simulink programs to investigate charging performances which will be useful for managing energy in the future. A DC motor is used for driving vehicles for small scale study since it is easy to control. The regenerative braking event for a relatively short time is considered for charging. The simulation results are satisfactory.
