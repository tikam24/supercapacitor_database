Solar energy is a renewable source of energy and abundantly available. Thereby harvesting solar energy with solar cells is helping the world to deal with energy crises in a sustainable manner. The photovoltaic silicon based technology is used in solar cells however its high cost is a big issue and this drawback is overcome by perovskite material, leading to more lightweight, flexible and cost-effective material. The ongoing research advances by integrating perovskite solar cell with pseudo super-capacitors to meet with the need of high storage capacity and excellent electro chemical behavior. This is a new research field and has the future scope to provide the world cleaner and efficient energy source.
