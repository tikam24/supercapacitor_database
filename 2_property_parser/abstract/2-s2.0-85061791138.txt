Rational design and synthesis of transition metal sulfide complex nanostructures are significant for achieving desired materials properties for a variety of applications. Herein, we synthesized nickel sulfide (NiS) nanostructures using laser irradiation in an aqueous solution and under the ambient condition. Crystalline nanostructures with high phase-purity were achieved without further calcination. Other transition metal sulfides, such as CuS and ZnS, were also successfully synthesized using the laser irradiation approach, suggesting the practical application of this method. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) measurements show the NiS nanostructures synthesized for 4h (NiS-4h) not only exhibited competitive overpotential (−159 mV vs. RHE at 10 A/g), lower Tafel slope (218 mV/dec) but also delivered long-term stability (14 A/g at −250 mV vs. RHE for 12h). Moreover, the NiS-4h functioned as the electrode for supercapacitor with excellent specific capacitance (3761 F/g at 10 mV/s), reversibility and rate capability (1152 F/g at 100 mV/s). These superb electrochemical performances are attributed to the remarkable value of electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and synergistic effect of Ni3+OOH for HER electrocatalytic activities, while the co-existence of Ni2+ and Ni3+ facilitates the rich redox reactions of NiS for supercapacitor.
