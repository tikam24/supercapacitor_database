With the environment pollution being serious, the fuel cell hybrid system is attracting more and more attention. Compared with single energy system, the hybrid power sources enhance the complexity of the system, thus a proper energy management strategy is necessary for keeping the system safe and reliable. Based on the analysis of the fuel cell and ultra-capacitor hybrid system, the wavelet-transform and rule based energy management strategy is proposed and verified by establishing the hybrid system model and simulation in Matlab/Simulink. The result shows that the proposed strategy can lever the characteristics of the different power sources and keep the state of charge of the ultra-capacitor in normal level.
