The proceedings contain 130 papers. The topics discussed include: hardware-in-the-loop simulation for subway applications with onboard supercapacitor; relationship between meteorological factors and accidents of traction power supply system of high-speed railway; optimizing slack time allocation in train timetable: a two-stage stochastic recourse model; a guided wave based online health monitoring technique for high-speed train bogie structures; on simulation of urban rail vehicle electro-pneumatic braking systems; multi-tracking channels' hardware simulation for GNSS integrity receiver design in transport field; single face image super resolution reconstruction based on block-PCA; the evaluation method and index system for high-speed railway train operation plan; a new control method of automatic train operation in urban rail transit based on improved generalized predictive control theory; and path choice for passengers of subway station during peak hour.
