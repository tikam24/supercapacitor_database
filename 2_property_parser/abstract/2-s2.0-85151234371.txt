Polymer dots are a new class of quantum dots that have attracted much attention from researchers. Based on, in this work, for the first time, using a one-step method, the new PDJA-Co3O4 nanocomposite with a quantum yield of 65.45%, based on the polymer dot of jeffamine was synthesized, which has ideal supercapacitor properties. The new polymer dot-based Jeffamine (PDJA) was first synthesized using a Jeffamine polymer and simultaneously composited with cobalt oxide by the solvothermal method. The photoluminescence properties and supercapacitor performance of the PDJA-Co3O4 nanocomposite and the PDJA were investigated. The PDJA-Co3O4 nanocomposite and the PDJA were prepared as electrode materials, and analysis of CV, GCD, and EIS was performed that the specific capacitance of the PDJA-Co3O4 nanocomposite electrode material and the PDJA electrode material are 978 F.g−1 and 283 F.g−1 at 50 mV/s, respectively. Also, the PDJA-Co3O4 nanocomposite and the PDJA have cyclic stability of 98.37% and 91.57% up to 10,000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry at 100 mV/s, respectively. Then, two symmetric supercapacitors were manufactured of the PDJA-Co3O4 nanocomposite and the PDJA. Finally, due to the high conductivity of the PDJA-Co3O4 nanocomposite active material, the symmetric supercapacitor of PDJA-Co3O4 nanocomposite turned on the LED lamp.
