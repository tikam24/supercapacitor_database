We prepared polyaniline doped with LiPF6 and HCl, respectively, using chemical methods. The electrode composite was attached to both sides of Al mesh, while the polymer electrolyte mixture was spread on a glass plate. Then, the polyaniline-based redox supercapacitor was fabricated using two electrodes and a polymer electrolyte membrane. The electrochemical performance of the redox supercapacitor was investigated by using the charge/discharge method, cyclic voltometry, and impedance spectroscopy. The initial specific capacitance was ≈ 115 F/g and it retained ≈ 90 F/g even after 5000 cycles. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
