A new hybrid material consisting of nickel hydroxide and nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO/Ni(OH) 2 ) for supercapacitor electrode material is prepared via an easy one-step hydrothermal method, where the reduction and nitrogen doping of graphene oxide (GO) and the in situ formation of Ni(OH) 2 are achieved simultaneously. The results show the improved electrochemical activity of N-rGO/Ni(OH) 2 upon nitrogen doping. Moreover, thanks to the positive synergetic effect between N-rGO and Ni(OH) 2 , the synthesized N-rGO/Ni(OH) 2 composite shows superior electrochemical performance, including high capacitance, excellent rate capability and good cycle life. Hence, the facile preparation approach in this work will be considered as a new way to obtain metal oxide or hydroxide/N-rGO material which can be used as advanced electrode material in high-performance supercapacitors.
