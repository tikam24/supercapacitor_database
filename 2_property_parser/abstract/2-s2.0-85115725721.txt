This paper presents a new super capacitor-based converter for power regeneration of Electrical Vehicle (EV) applications. The proposed topology employs series/parallel Lithium Ion Capacitor (LIC) controlled by bidirectional dc-dc converter during driving and regeneration modes. Series/parallel LICs and their dc-dc converter are installed between the main battery storage element and three-phase motor drive dc-ac voltage source inverter (VSI). LICs provide fast charging capability, low ESR, and high power density, which are targeted merits for EV applications. Also, the proposed inverter controls the LIC voltages during charging and discharging process to be within the permissible limits. Moreover, the proposed regeneration circuit provides dc voltage control at the input dc terminals of the motor drive VSI according to the reference speed, which in-turn reduces inverter switching loss and enhances the inverter efficiency. It also reduces the battery current during starting speed-up drive mode and regeneration mode that enhances battery lifetime and reduces battery losses. The validity of the proposed inverter has been verified theoretically using PSIM simulation software and experimentally through laboratory prototype of 48V, 1kW.
