Innovative ways of harnessing sustainable energy are needed to meet the world's ever-increasing energy demands. Supercapacitors may contribute, as they can convert waste heat to electricity through cyclic charging and discharging at different temperatures. Herein, we use an analytically-solvable model of a cylindrical pore filled with a single file of ions to identify optimal conditions for heat-to-electricity conversion with supercapacitors. We consider Stirling and Ericsson-like charging cycles and show that the former or latter yields more work when a supercapacitor operates under charge or voltage limitations, respectively. Both cycles yield the most work for pores almost as narrow as the size of the ions they contain, as is the case for energy storage with supercapacitors. In contrast to energy storage, which can be maximised by ionophobic pores, such pores do not yield the best heat-to-electricity conversion, independently of the applied potential. Instead, we find that for a given pore size, a moderately ionophilic pore harvests more work than ionophobic and strongly ionophilic pores.
