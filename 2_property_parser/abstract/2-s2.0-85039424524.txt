A facile and energy efficient microwave synthesis of NiO/MnO2 composite is presented in this study. The NiO nanoparticles (∼30 nm) and composite of NiO nanoparticles with nano-particle MnO2 were grown on the surface of graphite. The morphologies and electrochemical performance of NiO@graphite and NiO/MnO2@graphite composite were tested and compared. The SEM results showed that addition of MnO2 prevented the agglomeration of NiO nanoparticles. The electrochemical results of NiO/MnO2@graphite has demonstrated better performance than NiO@graphite, with higher specific capacitance of 102.78 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 and superior cycling stability with specific capacitance retention of 140% over more than 1500 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance of NiO/MnO2@graphite makes it suitable for electrode material of supercapacitors.
