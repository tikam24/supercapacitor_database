A coal tar pitch is used as supercapacitor precursor because it has a high carbon yield. Here we report a feasible method to make pitch-based porous carbon materials for supercapacitors by using inexpensive calcium carbonate as a hard template with its double effect of space-occupying and thermal decomposition. The textural characterization of the carbon material was investigated by N2 adsorption and transmission electron microscope. Its electrochemical capacitive performance was investigated by constructing a single electrode capacitor in a 6 mol/L KOH electrolyte. The results showed that the carbon material possessed a high capacitance of 209 F/g at current density of 0.4 A/g and showed an excellent cycle stability.
