The emergence of supercapacitors as an environment friendly energy storage device has generated a lot of interest in industry and academia. Carbon used in this device for making of electrodes can be derived from biomass. This study tries to use dried Neem leaves as a precursor to produce activated carbon. This carbon is then used to develop supercapacitors which are found to have high specific capacitance. The specific capacitance was then modelled using artificial neural network for various input parameters like temperature of activation and percentage of Neem based activated carbon.
