A low-cost and simple approach involving soaking and electrochemical deposition is employed to deposit carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and Ni-Co-S (NCS) on papers to prepare paper-based electrodes for flexible solid-state symmetric supercapacitors. The as-prepared Paper-CNTs-NCS electrode shows excellent electrochemical performance such as high areal capacitance and good rate capability. In addition, the electrode possesses good mechanical stability even after bending for 100 cycles. The symmetric supercapacitor (SC) based on the NCS-CNTs paper electrode is fabricated and exhibits a maximum energy density of 4.2 mWh Wh/m2 and power density of 1.26 W/m2
