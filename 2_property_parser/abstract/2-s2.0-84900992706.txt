In the present work, we have synthesized a mesoporous molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanostructure by a facile hydrothermal route for supercapacitor applications. FE-SEM and TEM images confirmed the mesoporous morphologies of the as-prepared samples. The electrochemical measurements showed that the as-prepared mesoporous MoS2 electrode delivered maximum capacitances of 376 and 403 F g-1 at a scan rate of 1 mV s -1 in 1 M Na2SO4 and KCl electrolyte solutions respectively, which indicated that the mesoporous MoS2 nanostructure was a suitable electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
