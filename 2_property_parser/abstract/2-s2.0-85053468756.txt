Ferrous hydroxide terephthalate, Fe(OH)(C8H5O4), is first prepared by an in situ hydrothermal growth method on nickel foam, which can be directly used as the positive electrodes for supercapacitors with superior pseudocapacitive behaviors. It displays high specific capacitance of 5.25 F cm−2 (656.3 F g−1) at 10 mA cm−2 (1.25 A g−1).
