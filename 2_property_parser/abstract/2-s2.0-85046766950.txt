Rational synthesis of advanced carbon materials is of great importance to the development of supercapacitors. In this work, we propose a facile combined electrodeposition-chemical vapor deposition for tailored construction of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) arrays on highly porous Ni matrix forming integrated 3D Ni/CNTs electrode. Interconnected CNTs with diameters of 20–30 nm are strongly anchored on the cross-linked porous Ni branches consisting of nanoparticles of 500–600 nm. Capacitive performance of the obtained porous Ni/CNTs electrode is thoroughly characterized by electrochemical means including charge/discharge tests and cyclic voltammetry. The 3D Ni/CNTs electrode shows good high-rate performance with a capacitance of 186 F g−1 at 2.5 A g−1, and excellent cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 99% after 10,000 cycles. The integrated conductive network composed of 3D Ni/CNTs offers large active area, good electronic conductivity and fast transportation paths of ions/electrons, leading to superior capacitive performance.
