Pitch/polyacrylonitrile carbon nanofiber non-woven fabrics (P/PAN CNFs) for use as supercapacitor electrode materials were prepared by electrospinning a mixed solution of pitch and PAN, followed by stabilization and carbonization. Results indicate that P/PAN CNFs have a smaller fiber diameter, higher conductivity, larger specific surface area and moderate pore size compared with PAN CNFs, which increases the capacitance and rate capability of the supercapacitors. When the mass ratio of pitch to PAN was 1/1.5, the P/PAN CNF (P/PAN-1/1.5) showed a high capacitance of 219 F g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1, a value 1.38 times that of PAN CNF. When the current density was increased to 50 A g−1, the capacitance retention of the P/PAN-1/1.5 was 69.4%, 42.8% larger than that of PAN CNF. A symmetrical supercapacitor based on P/PAN-1/1.5 had an energy density of 4.8 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 14.8 kW kg−1 and a capacitance retention rate of 94.1% after 20 000 cycles.
