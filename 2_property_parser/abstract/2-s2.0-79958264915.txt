In a traditionally embarked system the management of embarked electrical energy needs a storage device for peak load shaving, in order to compensate for the intrinsic limitations of the main energy source. Supercapacitor is a kind of electrical energy storage device. The advantages of supercapacitor are high power density, high efficiency, fast charging and discharging speed, long cycle life, wide operating temperature range and environment friendly. It has become an ideal option for highpower applications, such as hybrid power systems, regenerative energy systems and instantaneous backup power source. This paper deals with the use of supercapacitors as a storage device in electrical and hybrid vehicle. The different supercapacitors models will be given, the mathematical calculation for sizing this device and an example of their control will also be presented. Â© 2010 IEEE.
