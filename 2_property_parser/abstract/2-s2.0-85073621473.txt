Here we describe an aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor assembled using Co(OH)F nanorods on Ni foam (Co(OH)F@NF) as the positive electrode and layered Ti3C2Tx paper on Ni foam (Ti3C2Tx@NF) as the negative electrode. The Co(OH)F@NF was fabricated by a facile hydrothermal process. The nanorods were constructed as three-dimensional networks with stable structures and good durability in electrochemical reactions. As expected, the Co(OH)F@NF exhibited excellent capacitance (1265 mF cm-2 at 1 mA cm-2) and wonderful rate performance (90% from 1 to 10 mA cm-2). The Co(OH)F@NF//Ti3C2Tx@NF asymmetric supercapacitor devices showed high capacitance of 376 mF cm-2 and excellent rate capacity of 91% retention. When the two Co(OH)F@NF//Ti3C2Tx@NF devices were combined in series, a red led bulb could be lit for 12 minutes, further corroborating the possibility of the devices being used for practical applications.
