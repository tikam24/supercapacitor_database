All-solid-state Ti3C2Tx neutral symmetric fiber supercapacitors (PVA EGHG Ti3C2Tx FSCs) with high energy density and wide temperature range are constructed by using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-ethylene glycol hydrogel (EGHG)-sodium perchlorate (NaClO4) as electrolyte and separator, and Ti3C2Tx fiber as electrodes. Ti3C2Tx fiber is prepared using 130 mg mL−1 Ti3C2Tx nanosheet ink as an assembly unit in a coagulation bath of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and distilled water with 5 wt% CaCl2 by a wet spinning method. The prepared Ti3C2Tx fiber exhibits a specific capacity of 385 F cm−3 and a capacitance retention of 94 % after 10,000 cycles in 1 M NaClO4 electrolyte. The assembled PVA EGHG Ti3C2Tx FSCs deliver a specific capacitance of 41 F cm−3, a volumetric energy density of 5 mWh cm−3, and a capacitance retention of 92 % after 500 times continuous bending. Furthermore, it shows good flexibility and excellent capacitance over a wide temperature range of −40 to 40 °C and maintains its electrochemical performance under varying degrees of bending. This study provides a viable strategy for designing and assembling all-solid-state neutral symmetric fiber supercapacitors with high energy density and wide temperature range.
