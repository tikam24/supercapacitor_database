Carbon coated cobalt oxide (CC-CO3O4) was prepared by colloidal processing using cobalt oxide and sucrose. Sucrose was used as a soluble carbon precursor in the preparation of CC-CO3O4. CC-CO3O4 was characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) respectively. Electrochemical properties of CC-CO3O4 were measured in 1 M KOH electrolyte. CC-CO3O4 exhibited the maximum specific capacitance of 395 F g-1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1. The enhanced electrochemical performance of CC-CO3O4 may be due to the increased conductivity of the composite electrode by carbon coating over the cobalt oxide nanoparticles.
