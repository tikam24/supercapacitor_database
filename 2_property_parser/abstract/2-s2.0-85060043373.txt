Supercapacitors are positioned in between conventional capacitors and Batteries. This gives the great advantage to charge quickly and discharge slowly. Here in we combined efficient novel electrode of C/NiCo 2 O 4 nanowire arrays (NWAs) on new carbon material which takes advantage of the high electrical conductivity to boost the pseudocapacitive performance which is fueled from the Bi 2 Te 3 /Sb 2 Te 3 /ZnO thermoelectric generator. Bi 2 Te 3 has enhanced ZT, a high seebeck coefficient which has increased electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity. Thin film thermoelectric generator attached to the cloth material, conducts heat energy generated by human body and helps to charge super capacitor for the smart devices. Here in we expect, with a C having high surface area combining with NiCo 2 O 4 could enhance the specific capacitance, low leakage current, excellent cycling stability, and extraordinary mechanical flexibility which will be help full in charging smart devices.
