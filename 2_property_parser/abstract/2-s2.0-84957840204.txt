An innovative technique to obtain high-surface-area mesostructured carbon (2545 m2 g-1) with significant microporosity uses Teflon as the silica template removal agent. This method not only shortens synthesis time by combining silica removal and carbonization in a single step, but also assists in ultrafast removal of the template (in 10 min) with complete elimination of toxic HF usage. The obtained carbon material (JNC-1) displays excellent CO2 capture ability (ca. 26.2 wt % at 0 °C under 0.88 bar CO2 pressure), which is twice that of CMK-3 obtained by the HF etching method (13.0 wt %). JNC-1 demonstrated higher H2 adsorption capacity (2.8 wt %) compared to CMK-3 (1.2 wt %) at -196 °C under 1.0 bar H2 pressure. The bimodal pore architecture of JNC-1 led to superior supercapacitor performance, with a specific capacitance of 292 F g-1 and 182 F g-1 at a drain rate of 1 A g-1 and 50 A g-1, respectively, in 1 m H2SO4 compared to CMK-3 and activated carbon.
