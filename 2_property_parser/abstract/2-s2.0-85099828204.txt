Sandwich-like layered composite materials possess a high contact area and can expose many reactive active sites, which exhibit great potential in the application of supercapacitors. In this paper, a sandwich-like composite material was synthesized based on polyaniline (PANI), graphene oxide (GO) and ZIF-67 (denoted as GO@ZIF-67/PANI). Among them, GO is designed as a deposition substrate of ZIF-67 and transfer scaffold of electrons and PANI works as a wire to connect graphene layers and nanoparticles, which increases the conductivity of the material and makes the electron transfer easier. At the current density of 1 A g−1, the specific capacitance of the ZIF-67 composite is up to 5 times that of the ZIF-67. After alkali treatment, ZIF-67 is converted into Co(OH)2 nanosheet (denoted as GO@Co(OH)2/PANI), which remarkably promotes the transfer of electrolyte ions and electrons. At the current density of 1 A g−1, the resulting specific capacitance is 15 times more than ZIF-67. The excellent energy storage performance indicates that the prepared novel composite material has important development prospects in energy storage.
