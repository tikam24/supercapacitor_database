This paper presents a new bi-directional isolated DC/DC converter for supercapacitor (SC) interfacing. During the SC charging mode, the converter operates as a VSI-based step-down DC/DC converter and during the energy recovery mode, as a qZSI-based step-up DC/DC converter. For galvanic isolation and voltage matching a medium frequency transformer was implemented. To achieve higher SC voltage boost the qZSI with the two-stage quasi-Z-source (qZS) network was introduced. The paper discusses the PSIM simulation and experimental results of proposed converter operating with a 14.4 V 142 F supercapacitor.
