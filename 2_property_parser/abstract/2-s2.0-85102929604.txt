The simple and low-cost supercapacitor preparation strategy has received great attention at present. In our work, the MnO2 nanosheets were equably grown on carbon foam by electrodeposition to synthesize electrode. The carbon foam (CF) is a three-dimensional (3D) conductive skeleton that guarantees the rapid transfer of ions and electrons. An appropriate amount of MnO2 nanosheets provide excellent pseudocapacitance properties. The composite material reaches the highest specific capacitance of 365 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and the cycling test shows capacitance retention of 87.7% over 5000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g−1 in a three-electrode system. Meanwhile, the device revealed a maximum energy density of 22.2 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 1000 W kg−1. Two assembled supercapacitors were enough to light up a timer and the material has a certain practical value.
