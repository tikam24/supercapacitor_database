In this article, the ternary nanocomposite of ZnO/TiO2/rGO (ZTG) was synthesized via hydrothermal technique. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results substantiated the formation of ternary composites. From field emission-scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and high resolution-transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) analysis, it was noticed that rGO sheets were wrapped tightly on the edges of both ZnO and TiO2 nanoparticles, which offers high active sites during the electrochemical performances. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) technique revealed, ZTG-2 obtained a larger surface area of 148.73 m2 g−1. Based on the electrochemical performances, the active electrode ZTG-2 nanocomposite exhibited a higher specific capacitance of 1278 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. Further, the sample showed an excellent cyclic retention of 90% even after successive 5000 cycles. Additionally, Asymmetric supercapacitor showed a maximum specific capacitance of 360 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and revealed an energy density of 115.2 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 0.49 W kg−1 respectively. This article signifies the tactical emergence of ZTG-2 as a promising electrode material for supercapacitor application.
