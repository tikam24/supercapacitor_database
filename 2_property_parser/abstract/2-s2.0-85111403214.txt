Cobaltâ€“iron spinel/reduced graphene oxide composite material was obtained by one-step hydrothermal synthesis. XRD, low temperature nitrogen adsorption, Mossbauer spectroscopy, micro-Raman spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry were used for materials characterization. The influence of the annealing temperature and graphene component presence on the properties of composite materials was investigated. The contribution of pseudocapacitance component in total electric capacitance of the composite-based supercapacitors in 1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte was analyzed.
