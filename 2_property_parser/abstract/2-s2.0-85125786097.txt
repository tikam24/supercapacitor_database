An electrochemical deposition technique was used to fabricate polypyrrole (Ppy)/NiO nanocomposite electrodes for supercapacitors. The nanocomposite electrodes were characterized and investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The performance of supercapacitor electrodes of Ppy/NiO nanocomposite was enhanced compared with pristine Ppy electrode. It was found that the Ppy/NiO electrode electrodeposited at 4 A/cm−2 demonstrated the highest specific capacitance of 679 Fg−1 at 1 Ag−1 with an energy density of 94.4 Wh kg−1 and power density of 500.74 W kg−1. Capacitance retention of 83.9% of its initial capacitance after 1000 cycles at 1 Ag−1 was obtained. The high electrochemical performance of Ppy/NiO was due to the synergistic effect of NiO and Ppy, where a rich pores network-like structure made the electrolyte ions more easily accessible for Faradic reactions. This work provided a simple approach for preparing organic–inorganic composite materials as high-performance electrode materials for electrochemical supercapacitors.
