A simple one-pot hydrothermal method to synthesize MoO2/CNTs nanocomposites on nickel foam substrate for supercapacitor electrode was developed. Compared to pure MoO2 nanoparticles, the MoO2/CNTs nanocomposites show better electrochemical performance. The specific capacitance values of pristine MoO2, MoO2/CNTs (5 wt%) composite and MoO2/CNTs (10 wt%) composite were 327.4, 467.4 F g-1 and 424.7 F g-1 of at a current density of 1 A g-1, respectively. Especially, MoO2/CNTs (5 wt%) composite exhibits good rate capability and excellent cycle densities, remaining at 92.8% of the initial specific capacitance value even after 3000 cycles at 5 A g-1. The enhanced electrochemical behaviors are mainly due to the synergistic effect of combining MoO2 nanoparticles and CNTs. MoO2 nanoparticles can provide higher specific capacitance, while CNTs improve the electrical conductivity and structural stability of the composite. Such nanocomposite with high performance may be used as a promising material for electrochemical supercapacitor.
