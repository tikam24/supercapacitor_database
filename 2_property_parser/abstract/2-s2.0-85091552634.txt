By integrating the merits of lanthanide elements and quantum dots, we firstly design CeO2 quantum dots doped Ni-Co hydroxide nanosheet via a controllable synthetic strategy, which exhibits a large specific capacitance (1370.7 F/g at 1.0 A/g) and a good cyclic stability (90.6% retention after 4000 cycles). Moreover, we assemble an aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor with the obtained material, which has an extremely high energy density (108.9 Wh/kg at 378 W/kg) and outstanding cycle stability (retaining 88.1% capacitance at 2.0 A/g after 4000 cycles).
