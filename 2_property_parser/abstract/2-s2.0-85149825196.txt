After being undervalued for a long-time, the potential use of lignins have gained interest as a source of wealth from waste. Despite the complexity of lignins chemical structure, its high carbon content compared to cellulose and sugars makes lignin a very promising precursor for the development of nanocarbons for broad range applications, including supercapacitors for energy storage. High performing supercapacitors have been made using dimensionally different nanocarbon entities (zero-to three), such as carbon nanoparticles, carbon nanodots, carbon fibers, and carbon nanosheets with modular and interconnected pore structures, which are prepared from lignins of various types with and without use of templates, porogens and chemical agents. Control of physicochemical and electrochemical properties in such nanocarbons remains the key for their high energy density, flexibility, and long-term stability. To this end, nanocarbons conductivity, porosity and surface areas are controlled by various synthesis approaches while detailed adjustment of pore structure, pore width and pore distribution have been made to improve electrolyte access, ions confinement, and transportation. To compare performances of nanocarbons made from different lignin types, we must do meaningful investigations on the lignin's structure, composition, and purity to understand how their structure-property relationships are influenced by pyrolysis, carbonization and activation methods/conditions used. In this review, a clear overview of the lignins structure, classification, and properties is presented, wherein we compared the structure-property-performance relationships of nanostructured carbons from lignins for improvement of supercapacitor device performances with recent advances.
