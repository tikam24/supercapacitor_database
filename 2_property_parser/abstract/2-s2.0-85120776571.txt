Hybrid capacitors exhibit promise to bridge the gap between rechargeable high-energy density batteries and high-power density supercapacitors. This separation is due to sluggish ion/electron diffusion and inferior structural stability of battery-type materials. Here, a topochemistry-driven method for constructing expanded 2D rhenium selenide intercalated by nitrogen-doped carbon hybrid (E-ReSe2@INC) with a strong-coupled interface and weak van der Waals forces, is proposed. X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis dynamically tracks the transformation from Re-O into Re-C bonds. The bridging bonds act as electron transport channels to enable improved conductivity and accelerated reaction kinetics. The expanded interlayer-spacing of ReSe2 layer by INC facilitates ion diffusion and ensures structural stability. As expected, the E-ReSe2@INC achieves an improved rate capability (252.5 mAh g−1 at 20 A g−1) and long-term cyclability (89.6% over 3500 cycles). Moreover, theoretical simulations reveal the favorable Na+ storage kinetics can be ascribed to its low bonding energy of −0.06 eV and diffusion barrier of 0.08 eV for sodium ions. Additionally, it is demonstrated that 3D printed sodium-ion hybrid capacitors deliver high energies/power densities of 81.4 Wh kg−1/0.32 mWh cm−2 and 9992.1 W kg−1/38.76 mW cm−2, as well as applicability in a wide temperature range.
