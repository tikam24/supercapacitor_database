The ever-increasing requirements for renewable energy supply have pushed forward the development of low-cost and high performance energy storage systems. Here, we introduce the facile synthesis of a membrane-like electrode material by the uniform deposition of ultrathin NiMoO4 nanosheets on carbon nanofiber (CNF) membrane through electrospinning and solvothermal reaction. Under the templating of macroporous CNF substrate, obtained hierarchical CNF/NiMoO4 composite membrane with perpendicularly grown NiMoO4 nanosheets can offer substantial exposed electroactive sites for Faradaic redox reaction, and also provide interconnected conducting CNF networks for efficient charge transfer. Benefiting from these unique characteristics, the CNF/NiMoO4 composite membrane electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 1675 F g-1 at 1 A g−1, which outperforms most of the previously reported NiMoO4-based electrodes. Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitor device is also fabricated utilizing the CNF/NiMoO4 composite membrane as the binder-free positive electrode, which also delivers a superior cycling stability (83.6% capacity retention after 3000 cycles) and high energy density of 44.4 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 800 W kg−1. Hence, current study provides a new protocol for the low-cost fabrication of membrane-like electrodes towards practical supercapacitor applications.
