Various power system structures are simulated and analyzed in order to improve the power and energy performance of the Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicle (FCHEV) using a supercapacitor. In this paper, an optimization of the existing Type E structure, hereafter called buck-boost Type E, and its control strategy are proposed to control the power system of the FCHEV and to operate the fuel cell in the efficient range. The performances of the buck-boost Type E are compared with those of the conventional system structures by simulating acceleration, the Japan 10-15 driving cycle, and the FTP 75 driving cycle tests. The results are verified through scaled down experimental equipment. Â©2008 IEEE.
