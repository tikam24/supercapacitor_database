Conceptually novel strategies have been developed for extraction of inorganic particles from a synthesis medium to a device processing medium using undecanal as a particle receiving liquid and a phase transfer vehicle. Another major finding was the feasibility of liquid-solid extraction and formation of new organic-inorganic gels using inorganic particles as gelators. Building on the advantages offered by liquid-liquid extraction we fabricated advanced MnO2-multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT)electrodes for supercapacitors, which showed a capacitance of 6.3 F cmâˆ’2. The key to achieving enhanced capacitance was agglomerate-free processing of MnO2 and improved mixing of MnO2 and MWCNT. The extraction and gel formation mechanisms were analyzed using MnO2, Al(OH)3, ZnO, CeO2 particles and MWCNT.
