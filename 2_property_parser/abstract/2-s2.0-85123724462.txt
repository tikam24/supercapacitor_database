We report a gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) supercapacitor concept with improved pathways for ion transport, thanks to a facile creation of a coherent continuous distribution of the electrolyte throughout the electrode. Poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) was chosen as the polymer framework for organic electrolytes. A permeating distribution of the GPE into the electrodes, acting both as integrated electrolyte and binder, as well as thin separator, promotes ion diffusion and increases the active electrode–electrolyte interface, which leads to improvements both in capacitance and rate capability. An activation process induced during the first charge–discharge cycles was detected, after which, the charge transfer resistance and Warburg impedance decrease. We found that a GPE thickness of 12 μm led to optimal capacitance and rate capability. A novel hybrid nanocomposite material, formed by the tetraethylammonium salt of the 1 nm-sized phosphomolybdate cluster and activated carbon (AC/TEAPMo12), was shown to improve its capacitive performance with this gel electrolyte arrangement. Due to the homogeneous dispersion of PMo12 clusters, its energy storage process is non-diffusion-controlled. In the symmetric capacitors, the hybrid nanocomposite material can perform redox reactions in both the positive and the negative electrodes in an ambipolar mode. The volumetric capacitance of a symmetric supercapacitor made with the hybrid electrodes increased by 40% compared to a cell with parent AC electrodes. Due to the synergy between permeating GPE and the hybrid electrodes, the GPE hybrid symmetric capacitor delivers three times more energy density at higher power densities and equivalent cycle stability compared with conventional AC symmetric capacitors.
