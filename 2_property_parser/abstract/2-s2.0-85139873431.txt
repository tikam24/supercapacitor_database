Exploring novel heterostructure with multiscale nanoarchitectures and modulated electronic structure is crucial to improve the electrochemical properties of electrode materials for supercapacitors (SCs). In this study, a two-step electrodeposition approach which involves suitable efficient procedures, is leading to in-situ preparation of iron cobalt selenide (Fe0.4Co0.6Se2) @ nickel cobalt phosphate (NiCo(HPO4)2·3H2O, denoted as NiCo-P) hybrid nanostructure on carbon cloth (CC) substrate. Particularly, depositing two-dimensional (2D) NiCo-P nanosheets on the surface of Fe0.4Co0.6Se2 nanobelts results in formation of well-organized Fe0.4Co0.6Se2@NiCo-P nanocomposite with large surface area, hierarchical porous nanoarchitecture as well as numerous electroactive sites, leading to enhanced electroactivity and accelerated mass/electron transfer. Benefiting from its unique nanoarchitecture and synergistic effect of two components, the obtained free-standing Fe0.4Co0.6Se2@NiCo-P electrode demonstrates gravimetric capacity (Cm)/volumetric capacity (Cd) of 202.3 mAh/g/319.6 mAh cm−3 at 1 A g−1 and good cyclic stability (83.9% capacity retention over 5000 cycles), which are superior to those of pure Fe0.4Co0.6Se2 and NiCo-P electrodes. Impressively, it was established that an aqueous hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) based on Fe0.4Co0.6Se2@NiCo-P and rape pollen derived hierarchical porous carbon (RPHPC) achieves gravimetric energy density (Em)/volumetric energy density (Ed) of 64.4 Wh kg−1/10.7 mWh cm−3 and a long cycle life with 90.3% capacity retention over 10,000 cycles. This report offers a perspective to design selenide/phosphate heterostructure on conducting substrate for electrochemical energy storage applications.
