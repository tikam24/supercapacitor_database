With the rapid development of renewable energy technology, marine current energy is treated as the most desirable form of ocean energies. Due to the nature of marine current energy, simple structure, high reliability, and good control performance are the primary consideration for the energy management strategy. This paper proposes an energy management control strategy based on rules to compensate for the fluctuating power caused by tidal motion. The hybrid energy storage system composed of vanadium redox flow battery (VRB) is applied to reallocate power. Supercapacitor banks (SCBs) are applied as the auxiliary power source to absorb or release the required power according to energy management strategy based on control rules in the marine current power system. SCB makes the grid-connected power track the grid command power and also improves the operational efficiency of the vanadium redox flow battery (VRB). VRB compensates for the low-frequency fluctuating power caused by tidal motion and plays an important role in compensating for the difference in power between the grid-connected power and the grid command power to ensure the reliability of the marine current power system. A simulation model of a 3 MW marine current power system is built to verify the effectiveness of the energy management strategy based on the real marine current velocity data.
