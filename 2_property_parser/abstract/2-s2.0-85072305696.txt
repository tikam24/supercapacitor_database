In this work, homogeneous NiMoO4 nanorods@hydrous NiMoO4 nanosheets core/shell nanostructure were assembled on nickel foam by a two-step hydrothermal method and incorporate with an anneal process. Benefiting from their core/shell nanostructure and homogeneous nanocomposites, the arrays present high areal capacitance up to 6.34 F/cm2 at 4 mA/cm2 and display a remarkable specific capacitance retention of 89% after 5000 cycles. When the current density increases to 70 mA/cm2, the capacitance is 3.13 F/cm2 displayed good rate capability. The excellent electrochemical properties allow them to be used as a promising electrode material for pseudocapacitors, which has a wide application prospect in the field of electrochemical capacitor.
