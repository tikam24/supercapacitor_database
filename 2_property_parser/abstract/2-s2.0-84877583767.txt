Graphene/ZnO nanocomposites were successfully synthesized by microwave-assisted method. The structure, morphology, optical and composition of the obtained samples were characterized using XRD, FT-IR, laser Raman, UV-Vis spectroscopy and XPS analysis. XRD analysis confirmed the presence of graphene/ZnO nanocomposite. FE-SEM image reveals that the homogenous distribution of ZnO nanoparticles on the graphene nanosheets. The electrochemical properties of the graphene/ZnO electrodes were analyzed by cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy. The results confirmed that the incorporation of ZnO nanoparticles enhanced the capacitive performance of graphene electrode. Graphene/ZnO nanocomposite electrode showed higher capacitance value of 109 F g-1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1 in 1 M KCl solution as compared to the graphene electrodes. These results demonstrated the importance and great potential of graphene based composites in the development of high-performance energy-storage systems. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
