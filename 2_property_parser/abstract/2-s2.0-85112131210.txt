The tubular-like NiS/Mo2S3 microspheres as electrode material are designed and synthesized by solvothermal method, and match with activated carbon to build a new asymmetric supercapacitor, improving specific energy and cycle life of asymmetric supercapacitors. The NiS/Mo2S3 composite material of tubular-like microspheres possesses excellent specific capacity (199 mAh g−1 at a current density of 1 A g–1) and long cycle life (76% of initial capacity after 3000 cycles). In addition, a new asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) based on NiS/Mo2S3 (positive electrode) and AC (negative electrode) is fabricated, which have high energy storage and excellent cycle stability. The NiS/Mo2S3-2//AC ASC possesses high specific energy (31.2 Wh Kg−1) and specific power (850 W Kg−1), its specific capacity still maintains 81.3% after 10,000 cycles. Therefore, the tubular-like NiS/Mo2S3 microspheres may enrich the material system related to nickel-molybdenum bimetal for SCs.
