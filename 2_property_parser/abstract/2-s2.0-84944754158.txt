Pure flower-like NiCoMn layered double hydroxide (LDH) and 3D-architectured NiCoMn LDH/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composite are fabricated by a solution method. The NiCoMn hydroxide nanoflakes are tightly deposited on the surface of rGO. Electrochemical measurements prove that rGO can greatly improve its capacitive performances, compared with the pure counterpart. A high-specific capacitance of 912 F g-1, high-rate capability and long cycle life are achieved for the composite. A NiCoMn LDH/rGO//activated carbon hybrid capacitor is also fabricated. It possesses a high-specific capacitance of 206 F g-1 and an energy density of 92.8 W h kg-1 in 1.8 V.
