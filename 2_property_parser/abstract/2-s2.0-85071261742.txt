Nitrogen sulfur co-doped bimetal nanocomposites (NS-BNs) are prepared through vulcanization and annealing using bimetallic Ni/Co-MOF as a precursor. The nitrogen sulfur co-doped bimetal nanocomposites have abundant electroactive sites and redox reaction centres, which exhibit remarkable electrochemical performance as electrode materials for supercapacitor. The specific capacitance could reach 1529 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and excellent cycle stability (retention rate of 89.29% after 10000 cycles). After the current density is expanded ten times, the specific capacitance can still reach 1069 F g−1, indicating superior rate performance. Furthermore, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor displayed a high energy density of 41.04 Wh kg−1 at power density of 750 W kg−1. As a result, non-metal doped nanocomposites material has promised applications for electrochemical supercapacitors.
