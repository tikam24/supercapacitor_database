A benzimidazole-containing diamine monomer was prepared via a simple one-step synthesis process. A two-step procedure involving polycondensation in the presence of aromatic dianhydrides (4,4′-oxydiphthalic anhydride, ODPA) followed by thermal imidization was then performed to prepare a benzimidazole-based polyimide (BI-PI). BI-PI membranes were fabricated using an electrospinning technique and were hot pressed for 30 min at 200 °C under a pressure of 50 kgf /cm2. Finally, the hot-pressed membranes were assembled into supercapacitors, utilizing high-porosity-activated water chestnut shell biochar as the active material. The TGA results showed that the BI-PI polymer produced in the two-step synthesis process had a high thermal stability (Td5% = 527 °C). Moreover, the hot-press process reduced the pore size in the BI-PI membrane and improved the pore-size uniformity. The hot-press procedure additionally improved the mechanical properties of the BI-PI membrane, resulting in a high tensile modulus of 783 MPa and a tensile strength of 34.8 MPa. The cyclic voltammetry test results showed that the membrane had a specific capacitance of 121 F/g and a capacitance retention of 77%. By contrast, a commercial cellulose separator showed a specific capacitance value of 107 F/g and a capacitance retention of 49% under the same scanning conditions. Finally, the membrane showed both a small equivalent series resistance (Rs) and a small interfacial resistance (Rct). Overall, the results showed that the BI-PI membrane has significant potential as a separator for high-performance supercapacitor applications.
