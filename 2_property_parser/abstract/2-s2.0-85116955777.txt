In the current era, the development of human society increasingly depends on huge amounts of energy, which contradicts the limited reserves of non-renewable resources. The development of green, clean, efficient and sustainable new energy and energy utilization technologies is extremely urgent. As an important member of transition metal phosphides, cobalt phosphides have been widely used in electrochemical energy storage and conversion fields such as electrolysis of water, supercapacitors and secondary batteries due to its excellent performance of absorption/desorption of H and its special crystal structure. However, cobalt phosphides have also many shortcomings. In the process of electrolysis of water, the active components are easily decomposed and the structural stability is poor. When used in the supercapacitor, cobalt phosphides electrode materials suffer from the insufficient exposure of the active site and the lower conductivity. As anode materials for lithium/sodium ion batteries, the huge volume change results in poor cycle stability. In this review, the crystal structure, preparation methods and improved methods of cobalt phosphides were summarized, and the effective mechanism and development status of cobalt phosphides used in electrolysis of water, supercapacitor and lithium/sodium ion battery were summarized. In addition, the existing problems and future development directions for cobalt phosphide materials were also discussed.
