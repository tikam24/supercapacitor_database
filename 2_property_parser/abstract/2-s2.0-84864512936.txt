In order to describe the supercapacitor's external characteristic more correctly during working process, the classical equivalent circuit model of supercapacitor was developed into a time-varying equivalent circuit model, and the parameters of the time-varying equivalent circuit model were identified through the least square algorithm with finite memory. The classical and the time-varying equivalent circuit models were simulated and compared with the same experimental data under the platform of Matlab/Simulink. The results show that the time-varying equivalent circuit model is of higher accuracy and able to reflect the dynamic characteristic of supercapacitor more precisely.
