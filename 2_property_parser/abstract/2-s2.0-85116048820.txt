Two-dimensional (2-D) structure and high conductivity of the metal disulphides (MDs) are interesting for the applications in the energy storage sector. Nevertheless, their high instability restricts their widespread applications. In this work, we report MoS2/VS2 nano-urchins homogeneously grown onto reduced graphene oxide (rGO) matrix (denoted as G-MVS) via a facile hydrothermal approach and its electrochemical performance in an aqueous electrolyte system. G-MVS has a high specific capacitance of 460 F g−1 (287.5 F cm−2) at 0.5 A g−1 and 310 F g−1 (193.75 F cm−2) at 10 A g−1. In a symmetric configuration G-MVS//G-MVS, a high energy density of 49 Wh kg−1 (67.86 mWh cm−2) at a power density of 700.25 W kg−1 was achieved.
