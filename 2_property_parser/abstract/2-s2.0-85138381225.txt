This work describes the formation of two-dimensional Molybdenum di-sulfide (MoS2) nanoflakes developed by temperature varying hydrothermal method from 140 °C to 200 °C and further applied as effective electrode material for high performance supercapacitor. The structural analysis confirms the formation of hexagonal crystal structure of MoS2 by XRD. The surface morphological study revealed uniform growth of MoS2 nanoflakes and flower-like structure. The chemical bonding and the location of Mo-S band was confirmed at 600 cm−1 through FTIR–spectrum. The electrochemical performances of the MoS2 electrode were analyzed by Cyclic Voltammetry, Galvanostatic Charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance techniques. The electrode material prepared at 160 °C temperature exhibits excellent super capacitive performances when compared to other temperatures. This electrode recorded a maximum specific capacitance of 691 Fg−1 at current density 1 Ag−1 and good cyclic stability of 89 % over 5000 cycles. It exhibits very less charge transfer resistance 1 Ω which is lesser than other electrodes.
