The Ni-based/graphene materials were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method, using the graphene oxide as the support precursor. The textural and structural properties of the as-prepared Ni-based/graphene samples were fully characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, thermalgravimetric analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, respectively. Electrochemical properties were examined by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic charge-discharge tests. The results showed that the 15%-Î²-Ni(OH)2/graphene had the high specific capacity of 2077 F g-1 at 5 mV s-1 in the range of 0.0-0.7 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) and had a good cycle life with 965 F g-1 after 500 cycles at 50 mV s-1.
