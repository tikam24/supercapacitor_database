This paper analyzed the installed power, working condition and power flow in mobile hoist equipment, especially the Wheeled Crane. Based on the 25 Ton Wheeled Crane, this paper proposed a hybrid power system scheme based on Supercapacitor and key points of energy or oil saving in system design, designed main circuitry of the system, and the engineelectrical system control strategy. The system experiments and energy consumption comparison were performed. The result showed that the designed hybrid power Wheeled Crane may save more than 30% power. Â©2010 IEEE.
