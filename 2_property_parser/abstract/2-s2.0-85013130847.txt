CoAl-layered double hydroxide/fluorinated graphene (CoAl-LDH/FGN) composites were fabricated via a two-step hydrothermal method. The synthesized CoAl-LDH/FGN composites have been characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and electrochemical measurements. The results indicated that the fluorinated carbon with various configuration forms were grafted onto the framework of graphene, and the C-F bond configuration and fluorine content could be tuned by the fluorination time. Most of semi-ionic C-F bonds were formed at an appropriate fluorination time and, then, converted into fluorine rich surface groups (such as CF2, CF3, etc.) which were electrochemically inactive as the fluorination time prolonged. Moreover, the CoAl-LDH/FGN composites prepared at the optimal fluorination time exhibited the highest specific capacitance (1222 F/g at 1 A/g), the best rate capability, and the most stable capacitance retention, which offered great promise as electrode materials for supercapacitors.
