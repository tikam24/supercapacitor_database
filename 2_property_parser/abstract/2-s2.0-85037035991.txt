Vanadium nitride (VN) was deposited by DC-sputtering on a vertically aligned carbon nanotube (CNTs) template for the purpose of nano-structuration. This led to the fabrication of hierarchically composite electrodes consisting of porous and nanostructured VN grown on vertically aligned CNTs in a nano-tree-like configuration for micro-supercapacitor application. The electrodes show excellent performance with an areal capacitance as high as 37.5 mF cm−2 at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 in a 0.5 M K2SO4 mild electrolyte solution. Furthermore, the capacitance decay was only 15% after 20,000 consecutive cycles. Moreover, the capacitance was found to increase with VN deposit thickness. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses of the electrodes before and after cycling suggest that the oxide layers that form at the VN surface is the responsible for the redox energy storage in this material. Such electrodes can compete with other transition metal nitride based electrodes for micro-supercapacitors.
