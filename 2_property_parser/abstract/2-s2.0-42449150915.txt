The α-MnO 2 spherical assemblies were prepared via a facile hydrothermal approach in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The assembled nanostructures were composed of the MnO 2 nanorods with 150-200 nm in width and several micrometers in length. The products were characterized by SEM, TEM and XRD. The electrochemical characterization was carried out by cyclic voltammetry, which indicated that the α-MnO 2 spherical assemblies were of an excellent electrode material for supercapacitor.
