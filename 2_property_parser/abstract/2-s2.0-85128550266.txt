A supercapacitor (SC), also called an ultracapacitor, is a high-capacity capacitor with a capacitance value much higher than other capacitors, but with lower voltage limits, that bridges the gap between electrolytic capacitors and rechargeable batteries. The most promising future of SC is the combination of a double-layer charging interface with existing energy storage technologies. Still, the SC applications that have been achieved are an exciting realization of part of an age-old technology that is only getting better with time.
