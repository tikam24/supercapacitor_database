The overall performance of electric vehicle (EV) and hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) largely depends on batteries which are considered as main energy storage system (ESS). The issues related with the battery such as large size, high cost, shorter cycle life and lower power density can be solved by implementing hybrid energy storage system which is a combination of two or more ESS. This paper presents a hybrid energy storage system for EV using battery and ultra-capacitor (UC) which can provide both, high energy density while driving and high power density during acceleration. The speed control of motor drive is used to improve the efficiency of EV drive train. The power flow is managed by using a tunable proportional-integral (PI) controller based close loop electric drive in such a way that peak power is supplied by UC and steady state power is supplied by the battery. Detailed study in Simulink environment is carried out at different operating conditions to test the effectiveness of proposed system.
