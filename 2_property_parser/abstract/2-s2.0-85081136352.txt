Bacterial cellulose (BC), an eco-friendly bio-product obtained from fermentation of various microorganism, consisting of the interconnected networks structure attracted widespread interest due to its unique physical properties, including the large specific surface area, remarkable mechanical strength, high water-holding ability, good chemical stability, and environmental benign material. These advantages enable BC to be applied to fabricate the highly versatile three-dimensional (3D) carbon nanomaterials, and tunable flexible scaffold to support other multifunctional materials. In this review, the production process of various carbon nanofibrous composites based on BC, such as carbon nanofiber (CNF), doped CNF, CNF/metal oxide and CNF/conducting polymer, is presented. Their emerging applications in supercapacitors are illustrated, in particularly, the design of hybrid bendable electrodes based on BC substrate for flexible supercapacitor is highlighted. The challenges and opportunities in this fascinating area of designing functional nanomaterials and flexible electrode from BC for various energy storage are addressed. Moreover, the perspectives are given for the future development, including several significant kinds of study for applications in the rechargeable battery.
