A novel carbon–CoO–NiO–NiCo2O4 integrated electrode has been designed by reducing the hetero-structured NiCo2O4 nanosheet array with C2H2 on the nickel foam at a low temperature of 350 °C. The topotactical transformation from NiCo2O4 to the integrated electrode has been first conceived and investigated. Such unique nanoarchitectures exhibit excellent electrochemical performance with ultrahigh capacitance and desirable cycle life at high rates. © the Partner Organisations 2014.
