The supercapacitor is focused as a highly sustainable and capacity energy storage device to meet the demand of energy in day-to-day life. Here, a band-gap tuned highly stable h-BN/rGO wrapped CdS/PPy is presented as a supercapacitor electrode material to obtain excellent specific capacitance, high power density and long cycling stability. It was synthesized via hydrothermal method combined with chemical oxidative polymerisation mechanism. The liquid exfoliated h-BN and graphene layers are restacked randomly by properly sandwiching alternate layers to form band gap tuned h-BN/rGO hetero-structure contributing as a conducting framework due to formation of Van der Waals stacked superlattice. The h-BN/rGO-CdS core-shell structure prevents the swelling and shrinking of CdS which improved the electrochemical performance and stability of the supercapacitor electrode. The highly conducting PPy nanowires acts as a backbone for the fast conduction of ions and the porous structure exhibiting superior specific capacitance of 1435F/g at a current density of 1A/g. The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) fabricated using h-BN/rGO/CdS@PPy//AC showed a specific capacitance of 102F/g at 1A/g and maximum energy density of 32 Wh/kg at a power density of 750 W/kg. Furthermore, the device showed a capacitance retention of 88.50 % after 5000 cycles assures it as a promising material for supercapacitor application.
