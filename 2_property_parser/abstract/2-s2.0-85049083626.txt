Thermally reduced graphite oxide and titanium dioxide (TRGO-TiO2) composite is synthesized by using a simple chemical method for supercapacitor applications. The TRGO-TiO2 composites have higher capacitance than that of each precursor, such as GO, TRGO, and TiO2. Electrochemical performance of the composites with different weight ratio of TRGO to TiO2 is also investigated, and optimal ratio for the best performance is 7 to 3, resulting in the specific capacitance of 380 F gâˆ’1. The best performance of the TRGO-TiO2 composite is attributed to synergic effect of the high electrical conductivity supported by TRGO and electroactive property of TiO2.
