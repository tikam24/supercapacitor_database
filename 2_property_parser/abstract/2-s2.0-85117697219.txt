In this work, we prepared MnO2 electrodes by ultrasonic-assisted electrodeposition to study the influence of current density on the surface morphology and electrochemical performances of the MnO2, as well as the electrochemical performances of MnO2 electrodes of supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries. The prepared MnO2 electrodes showed nanorod morphology, and the grain size changeed and presented a different distribution at different current densities. The electrochemical performances of as-prepared electrodes under a current density of 7 mA cm−2 shows a high mass specific capacitance of 415.4 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1 in supercapacitors and 818.1 mA h·g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 200 cycles in lithium-ion batteries.
