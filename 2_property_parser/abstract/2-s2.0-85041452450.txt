This paper presents a novel power flow control strategy for an energy management system (EMS) with hybrid energy storage. The EMS operates a remote microgrid and directs the power flow to either batteries or supercapacitors to increase the life of the batteries. This paper demonstrates that the use of supercapacitors increases the lifetime of the batteries and ultimately improves the economics of the system. The proposed EMS controller also compensates for the 120Hz ripple on the DC bus. Modeling, simulations and experimental verification are presented together with the procedure to perform the assessment of the battery lifetime, according to the tuning parameters of the controller.
