The growing interest in the use of energy storage systems to improve the performance of tramways has prompted the development of control techniques and optimal storage devices, displacement, and sizing to obtain the maximum profit and reduce the total installation cost. Recently, the rapid diffusion of renewable energy generation from photovoltaic panels has also created a large interest in coupling renewable energy and storage units. This study analyzed the integration of a photovoltaic power plant, supercapacitor energy storage system, and railway power system. Random optimization was used to verify the feasibility of this integration in a real tramway electric system operating in the city of Naples, and the benefits and total cost of this integration were evaluated.
