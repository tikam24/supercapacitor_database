Ordered WO3 nanowire arrays on carbon cloth (WNCC) conductive substrates are successfully prepared by a facile hydrothermal method. The as-prepared samples were characterized by XRD, SEM and TEM and directly functionalized as supercapacitor (SC) and lithium-ion battery (LIB) electrodes without using any ancillary materials such as carbon black or binder. The unique structural features endow them with excellent electrochemical performance. The SCs demonstrate high specific capacitance of 521 F g-1 at 1 A g -1 and 5.21 F cm-2 at 10 A cm-2 and excellent cyclic performance with nearly 100% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at a current density of 3 A g-1. All-solid-state SCs based on the integrated electrodes are also presented, exhibiting high flexibility without obvious performance declination at different bending states. A high capacity of 662 mA h g-1 after 140 cycles at a 0.28 C rate and excellent rate capabilities are also obtained for LIBs due to the unique structures of the integrated electrodes.
