2-D BiVO4 nanosheets with monoclinic phase were synthesized at room temperature, and incorporated with Ag to form BiVO4:Ag hybrid materials. The experiments demonstrated that doping Ag has largely increased the electrochemical performances of supercapacitor. Furthermore, the specific capacitance can reach up to 109 F g–1 at 1 A g–1 (the undoped one is of 27 F g–1); energy density has enhanced to 15.2 Wh kg–1 compared with the pristine one without Ag (3.8 Wh kg–1). Therefore, doping Ag into bismuth-based compound provides us an alternative approach for the synthesis of 2-D nanostructured hybrid as an efficient electrode material for supercapacitors
