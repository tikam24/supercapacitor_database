The integrated system of photovoltaic energy conversion and energy storage, comprising of Dye Sensitized Solar Cell (DSSC) with supercapacitor is theoretically designed using the Zubieta – Bonert model for DLCs. The temporal evolution of the charging of the photo – supercapacitor (PSC) is derived from the differential equation corresponding to the designed integrated circuit, and is studied using numerical methods. The influence of the solar cell parameters such as the diffusion coefficient (D) of the electrons, the working area of the photoanode (A) and the short circuit current density (Jsc) on the charging time of the photo – supercapacitor is analysed. Further, the Energy Conversion and Storage Efficiency (ECSE) of the PSC is studied for various conditions.
