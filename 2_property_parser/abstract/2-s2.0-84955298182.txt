In the present work, synthesis of CoMn2O4 electrode material through a newly adopted hydrothermal method was achieved and reported. The synthesized material was subjected to various physico-chemical properties to analyze the suitability of the material for the super capacitor applications. The structure of the title compound was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction studies. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirms the various functional groups associated with the material. Optical and surface analysis was studied by using UV–Visible spectroscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy. The electrochemical properties of modified electrode CoMn2O4 were investigated using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge, cycle stability and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in electrochemical workstation. Based on the electrochemical properties, the electrode material reveals the ideal capacitance behaviour with high capacitance of 700 F/g at the sweep rate of 5 mV/s in 3 M KCL aqueous electrolyte solution. The remarkable electrochemical performance undoubtedly makes CoMn2O4 as the promising material for supercapacitor applications.
