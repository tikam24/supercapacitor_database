Polyaniline/activated carbon (PANI/AC) composites have been synthesized by in situ polymerization of aniline on the surface of activated carbon. The morphology of the composites was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The performance of undoped and Li-doped PANI/AC composites as the electrode in supercapacitors was investigated by cyclic voltammery, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectrometry in 6 mol/L KOH solution using Hg/HgO as reference electrode. It was found that doping the PANI/AC composite with Li led to a significant enhancement in capacitance from 372 to 466 F/g, an increase of 25.3%. Furthermore, doping with Li led to an increased ability to retain high capacitance after a large number of cycles.
