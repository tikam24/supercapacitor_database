A massive amount of power is required to meet the worldwide need for gratifying human aspirations. As a result, the possible effect on the energy storage equipment is crucial to ensure a steady supply of energy. However, a supercapacitor is a potential device that provides a sustainable source of energy. In the current work, we presented a fabrication of Ag2Te at different concentrations of 0.006, 0.012, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 M via a hydrothermal approach for energy storage devices. A variety of analytical techniques were employed to assess its structure, morphology, and textural property regarding the fabricated electrode. Among different electrode materials, the Ag0.025Te electrode exhibited the large Cs of 711.86 F g-1, Ed of 35.12 W h Kg-1, and Pd of 298.4 W Kg-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 The stability test of Ag0.025Te shows 92.96% retention of capacitance over 5000 GCD cycles with little destruction in the structure as determined by XRD. EIS responses indicated that the improved performance in 1.0 M KOH is because of low hydration sphere radius, strong ionic conductivity of K+, and less electrode resistance. The encouraging results suggest that the Ag0.025Te nanorod might provide an ideal cathode material for supercapacitor applications.
