In order to improve the efficiency of charging the super capacitor, Proposed based on the capacity Characteristics of supercapacitors charging constant current constant voltage control method. In this paper a three-dimension finite element model of a spiral wound supercapacitor was developed, At first, the transient state and the stable state temperature fields were simulated with the finite element method. In this way, we discussed the temperature distribution of the supercapacitor. Then the internal temperature of supercapacitor were measured with the thermal resistance during charging and discharging process under normal temperature. The results indicate this model can accurately simulate the supercapacitor thermal behavior under the small or moderate constant Voltage-Constant Current charging and discharging conditions. Thus, It is high charging efficiency and reliable with temperature changing slowly using a certain range of safe current charge for supercapacitors, Some cooling strategies are necessary Beyond the current range of security.
