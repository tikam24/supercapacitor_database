A graphene nanosheet/polyaniline nanotube (GPNT) composite is prepared for the first time by in-situ chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline using vitamin C as a structure directing agent. The vitamin C molecules lead to the synthesis of polyaniline (PANI) nanotubes through the development of rod-like assembly by H-bonding in an aqueous medium. The initially synthesized graphene oxide/polyaniline nanotubes composite is reduced to graphene using hydrazine monohydrate followed by re-oxidation and protonation of the PANI to produce the GPNT nanocomposite. This novel composite showed a high specific capacitance of 534.37 F/g and an excellent energy density of 74.27 Wh/kg at a constant current of 0.5 mA. Besides, the GPNT composite exhibited excellent cycle life with 91.4% specific capacitance retained after 500 charge-discharge cycles. The excellent performance is due to the synergistic combination of graphene which provides good electrical conductivity and mechanical stability, and PANI nanofiber which deals with good redox activity.
