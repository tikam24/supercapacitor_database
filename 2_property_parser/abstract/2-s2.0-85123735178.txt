As important electrode materials, 2D layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have attracted much attention owing to their high reaction activity, tunable composition and unique structure. However, the poor cycling stability restricts their large scale industrial applications. To solve this problem, we fabricate several NiCo-LDH nanosheets through regulating the ratio of Ni and Co ions. The as-obtained samples are utilized as cathode for supecapacitor. Thereinto, the NiCo3-LDH product possess a specific capacitance of 699 C g−1 at 1 A g−1. The as-assembled device delivers an energy density of 90.75 W h kg−1 at 2700 W kg−1 and keep 91.84% of its initial capacitance after 10000 cycles. Moreover, as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts, the obtained product presents an overpotential of 270 mV at 20 mA cm−2 and excellent cycle stability.
