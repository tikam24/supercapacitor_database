Transition metal sulfides have attracted considerable attention due to their excellent electrochemical performance for supercapacitors. Herein, we prepared a Co3S4/CoMo2S4 (Co−Mo−S) composite on reduced graphene oxide/Ni foam (RGO/NF) with unique flower-like morphology through a carefully time-controlled sulfurization process. It was found that the vulcanization time has a great influence on the morphology and electrochemical properties of the composites. After 3 hours of vulcanization, the as-prepared Co3S4/CoMo2S4@RGO/NF electrode exhibited a superior specific capacitance of 2530.4 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, as well as excellent cycling stability with 78.8 % retention of the initial capacitance even after 6,000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g−1. An asymmetric device was assembled employing the Co3S4/CoMo2S4@RGO/NF composite as a positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as a negative electrode. The device delivered a maximum energy density of 59.0 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 640 W kg−1 and a high cycling performance (90.7 % capacitance retention after 6,000 cycles). These results demonstrate the promising potential of Co−Mo−S@RGO/NF as binder-free, high-performance electrode in renewable energy storage systems.
