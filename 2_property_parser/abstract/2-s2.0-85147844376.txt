The bus voltage of the ship DC microgrid is sensitive to the change of loads, which has an influence on the power supply quality. This paper introduces a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) that is composed of a battery set and a supercapacitor set, and further studied the control method of HESS. First of all, the topological structures of the ship DC microgrid and HESS are described. Second, combined with the frequency division droop control and voltage PI control, a sliding mode control (SMC) method is proposed to control the charge and discharge of HESS based on an improved reaching law. Finally, the simulation model of the ship DC microgrid is established for the verification of the control method. Simulation results show that: (1) HESS can overcome the shortage of the dynamic response ability of the diesel rectifier generator to the steep change of load power. The supercapacitor set and the battery set successfully respond to the high-frequency and low-frequency components of the differential power in the system, respectively. (2) Compared with the traditional PI control method, SMC can reduce the current chattering of HESS and the voltage fluctuation amplitude of the DC bus. The proposed SMC method can provide a reference for the stable and reliable operation of the ship DC microgrid.
