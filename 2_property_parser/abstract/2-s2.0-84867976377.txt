Manganese oxide (MnO2)/Carbon nanotubes(CNTs) composites were prepared by a home-made microwave heating equipment. The crystal structure, microstructure, electrochemical properties were characterized by XRD and SEM, the discharge capacity and cycling performance were compared. The results show a birnessite-type MnO2 coating can be prepared. In this paper, a microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis method was used to synthesize the MnO2/CNTs composites. MnO2 content increases with the increasing of microwave power, which result in the specific capacitances of as-prepared materials increase. Â© (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
