A new nanocomposite based on CuCo2S4 nanosheets and polyaniline conducting polymer is synthesized and introduced as an electrode material for energy storage supercapacitors. First, CuCo2S4 nanosheets are prepared on carbon cloth through hydrothermal route and a wide potential window of 1.2 V is obtained for this material in Na2SO4 electrolyte. Then, a nanocomposite with an optimized amount of polyaniline is synthesized through chemical polymerization of aniline monomer on the surface of CuCo2S4 nanosheets and its electrochemical behavior is studied. Regarding the synergistic effect between polyaniline and CuCo2S4, the resultant CuCo2S4/polyaniline electrode exhibits a wider potential range and an improved specific capacitance of 920 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, significantly higher compared to that of bare CuCo2S4 nanosheets (780 F g−1). Symmetric supercapacitor assembled by newly prepared CuCo2S4/polyaniline as both anode and cathode, demonstrated extended operating potential window (1.8 V) and delivered high energy density of 32.5 Wh kg−1 and power density of 900 W kg−1. These results confirm that the as-prepared nanocomposite exhibits improved electrochemical performance and is a promising candidate to be used in energy storage devices.
