The increasing trend of portable electronic products requires the development of portable and flexible energy-storage devices, such as flexible supercapacitors. In this study, we deposited polypyrrole (PPy) and nickel sulfide (NiS) on bacterial cellulose (BC) nanofibrous membranes to be used as flexible supercapacitor electrodes. The obtained PPy/NiS/BC composite membranes are highly conductive, with the electrical conductivity up to 5.1 S cm−1. Electrochemical measurements showed that the supercapacitors based on the PPy/NiS/BC electrodes have a high specific capacitance of 713 F g−1 with a power density of 39.5 W kg−1 and an energy density of 239.0 Wh kg−1 at a current density of 0.8 mA cm−2. With increasing current density from 0.2 to 1.6 mA cm−2, the corresponding capacitance changes from 884 to 569 F g−1. The presence of NiS is found to considerably improve the capacitance performance.
