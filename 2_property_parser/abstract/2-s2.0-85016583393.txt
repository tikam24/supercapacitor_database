Silver nanowires (AgNW) with a small diameter were synthesized by a facile and novel polyol reduction method. Ag nanowires ink was then spun on the surface of F-doped SnO2 (FTO) to form the AgNW/FTO conducting film. Welding treatment of the AgNW/FTO conducting film not only increased the optical transmittance from 71.9 % to 79.3 % at 550 nm and decreased the sheet resistance from 11.4 ohm sq-1 to 9.8 ohm sq-1, but also improved the adhesivity of AgNW network on FTO substrate. Furthermore, MnO2 nanosheets were directly deposited on welded-AgNW/FTO (wAF) substrate to prepare a transparent MnO2/weled-AgNW/FTO (MwAF) composite electrode. The MwAF electrode displayed excellent electrochemical performance, including high specific capacitance (375 F g-1 at 5 mV s-1) and superior cycle stability (173.3 % of the initial capacitance after 20000 GCD cycles).
