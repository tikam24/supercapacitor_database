Low-cost porous carbon nanofibers with MnO2 are developed via simple and inexpensive processes by using lignin as an affordable carbon precursor and generator of porous structures through one-step electrospinning and carbonization without requiring any other activating agent and process. The lignin-based carbon nanofiber/MnO2 composites carbonized at high temperature have a high mesoporosity induced by pore opening effect, and thus exhibit a high capacitance retention of 87 % and optimum cycling stability with 93 % retention due to the excellent chemical reversibility. Further, the large surface area with many micropores derived from the low carbonization temperature affords high capacitive performance with a maximum specific capacitance of 212 Fg−1 at low current density and a high energy density of 26.5 Whkg−1 at a power density of 400 Wkg−1. These eco-friendly, low-cost, and pore-controlled MnO2/CNF composites have been designed with optimized carbonization temperature and lignin addition to enhance their capacitive properties.
