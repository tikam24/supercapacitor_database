Supercapacitors or ultracapacitors are promising energy storage devices due to their capability to deliver high peak current and to capture a huge amount of energy in a short time with very low internal power loss. In particular, supercapacitors currently seems to be interesting device for many applications because they can supply high power for a significant amount of time and can be recharged more quickly than electrochemical batteries. In different applications, a combination of the two devices batteries and supercapacitors could be used to develop a high-efficiency storage system with a high dynamic performance. In this paper we are going to concentrate on various parameters of super capacitor i.e. equivalent circuit and also application of the super capacitor for ride-through power demand. This paper introduced a combined working of Supercapacitor and battery using MATLAB Simulink and basic hardware.
