Next-generation flexible electronics must achieve multifunctionality, environmental friendliness and antibacterial activity. Accordingly, organisms in nature are interconnected. Inspired by the honeycomb multilayer porous structure, a wood-nanotechnology-derived flexible membrane circuit is created to meet the abovementioned requirements. The flexible wood (FW) matrix is made of natural balsa wood that underwent a simple top-down chemical treatment. The multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) acts as a “bridge” between the FW matrix with a porous array structure and the active material (silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). Due to the three-dimensional porous microstructure and highly conductive surface inherited by the wood-nanotechnology-derived flexible membrane (FW/MWCNT/Ag/PEDOT:PSS), it shows a high area capacitance (266.7 mF cm−2 at 20 mV s−1) and a good long-term cycling stability 84.3% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 5 mA cm−2 when used as a supercapacitor electrode. In addition, it shows an excellent specific electromagnetic shielding efficiency (up to 970 dB cm2 g−1), proving its application potential in the field of electromagnetic shielding. Because of the biocidal property of Ag NPs, the FW/MWCNT/Ag/PEDOT:PSS shows a remarkable antibacterial effect on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. This strategy provides a new opportunity for researchers to design biomass-based integrated electronic materials.
