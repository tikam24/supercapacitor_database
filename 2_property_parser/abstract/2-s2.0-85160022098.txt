Abstract: Direct electrical energy storage by supercapacitors is the leading energy storage technology. The performance of supercapacitors depends mainly upon the electrode material constituents. Carbon is the preferred energy storage material for its some main properties such as a large surface area, electrical conductivity, porosity, thermal stability, etc. Sustainable, green, renewable, low-cost and environmentally friendly carbon energy storage materials can be obtained from biomass. A larger surface area and tunable micro-porosity, which are the most important advantages, could be achieved by chemical activation of K2CO3 and HNO3. In this work, the effect of K2CO3 and HNO3 on the porosity and the electrochemical energy storage capacity of carbon derived from biomass made from the industrial tea waste were evaluated. A carbon material with a high performance of energy storage exhibiting 460 F g–1, with a surface area of 1261 m2 g–1, could be developed by activation of K2CO3 in the 1 : 1 optimum ratio (w/w). The HNO3 treatment also increased the capacitance but to a very low degree.
