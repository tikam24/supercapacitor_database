A triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is an excellent tool for clean energy harvesting. Herein, we describe the development of a woven carbon fiber (WCF)-based multifunctional TENG-cum-structural supercapacitor and its connection via a rectifier so that the energy generated by the TENG is stored in the supercapacitor. The effectiveness of the WCF electrode was enhanced by growing P-doped Cu–Mn selenide nanowires on the surface. The polyester-based outer surface of the supercapacitor served as the positive electrode for the TENG and the polydimethylsiloxane-coated nanowire-WCF was the negative electrode. The integrated TENG generated 7.4 W m–2 of power, while the supercapacitor displayed energy and power densities of 97.21 Wh kg–1 and 54.25 W kg–1, respectively. The device retained excellent mechanical properties (strength: 583.11 MPa; modulus: 37.52 GPa; impact resistance: 69.91 J) after exposure to various outdoor environmental conditions. This type of device could mitigate the future energy demands of self-charging automobiles, electronics, and various outdoor applications.
