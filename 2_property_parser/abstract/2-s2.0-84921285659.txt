Mesoporous carbons were prepared from carbon spheres derived from hydrothermal carbonization of sucrose, followed by KOH activation. The porous structure was tuned by adjusting the ratio of KOH to sucrose-derived carbon spheres. Activated carbons exhibited bi-modal pore size distribution consisting of both micropores and mesopores within 1-5 nm in size, and high surface areas up to 2823 m2 g-1 can be achieved. The activated porous carbons derived from an optimal KOH/carbon weight ratio of 2.5 demonstrated the highest specific capacitance of 316 F g-1 with excellent high-rate performance and good cycling stability. A high power density of 151.8 kW kg-1 with a reasonable energy density of 10.7 W h kg-1 in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte could be achieved. Similarly, a high energy density of 32.8 W h kg-1 at a decent power density of 52.5 kW kg-1 in organic electrolyte can be realized, attributed to the high surface area and micro/mesoporous structure. The current study provides a simple, low cost and effective method for the preparation of electrode materials for supercapacitors from biomass.
