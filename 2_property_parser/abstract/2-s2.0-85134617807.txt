NiCo2S4 and CuCo2S4 have been proven to be effective electrode materials in energy storage applications. In this study we investigate the influence of polypyrrole on the electrochemical behavior of these two potential materials. At first, high surface area micro-sized hollow spheres of NiCo2S4 and CuCo2S4 were successfully synthesized through facile solvothermal method and then pyrrole was polymerized through oxidative polymerization on the surface of as-prepared spheres. Resuls demonstrate improved electrochemical performance of both NiCo2S4 and CuCo2S4 after composing with polypyrrole. At current density of 1 A g–1, the specific capacitance of NiCo2S4/Polypyrrole and CuCo2S4/Polypyrrole was calculated to be 1412 F g–1 and 1005 F g–1, respectively. A symmetric supercapacitor assembled by NiCo2S4/Polypyrrole as both cathode and anode was able to light up a 3.2 V white LED for 14.2 min and an assembled supercapacitor from CuCo2S4/Polypyrrole as both cathode and anode lit up the same LED for 10.1 min.
