To explore the high performance of supercapacitors, oxygen deficient Fe2O3/N, P co-doped carbon (N-Fe2O3/NPC) composites were successfully fabricated by the one-step calcination of a precursor of FeOOH/polyaniline composites via a simple strategy of introducing oxygen vacancy (denoted as oxygen defects). The influences of carbonization temperature and carbonization time on the electrochemical properties of the N-Fe2O3/NPC composites were investigated. The results show that N-Fe2O3/NPC-450-2h exhibits high capacitance (605 mF cm−2 at a current density of 5 mA cm−2) and cycle life (100% after 2000 cycles). The assembled N-Fe2O3/NPC-450-2h-based symmetrical supercapacitor possesses a capacity retention rate of 100% after 5500 cycles at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. In addition, the symmetrical supercapacitor shows a maximum energy density of 0.0148 mWh cm−2 (0.255 mWh cm−3) when the power density is 0.8 mW cm−2 (13.8 mW cm−3). N-Fe2O3/NPC-450-2h has broad application prospects as an electrode material for long-life symmetrical supercapacitors.
