Herein, a hierarchically porous carbon was derived from the natural withered rose flower (denoted as RDPC) through a facile two-step method of carbonization and chemical activation with a mixture of KOH/KNO3. The as-derived RDPC contains an enlarged specific surface area of 1980 m2 g−1, better electrical conductivity and hierarchical porous architectures. Under three-electrode system with 6 M KOH electrolyte, the RDPC displays a wonderful electrochemical activity as supercapacitor electrode including of ultrahigh SC (350 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), superb rate ability (165 F g−1 even at 150 A g−1) and remarkable durability (only 4.4 % fading rate of capacitance after 140,000 cycles at 100 A g−1). The RDPC based symmetric supercapacitor with 6 M KOH electrolyte supplies the highest energy density of 15.6 Wh kg−1 at 499 W kg−1 with only 3.5 % decay rate of capacitance over 15,000 cycles at 20 A g−1, which is revealing the excellent real application of RDPC in the supercapacitor. This extraordinary electrochemical performance of RDPC can be attributed to its uniform interconnected layered-like morphology, hierarchical porous networks, large specific surface area and fast electrochemical kinetics. Therefore, it is indicating that a facile and inexpensive designing of porous carbon from naturally available withered rose flowers and is a more sustainable electrode material for advanced energy storage related applications.
