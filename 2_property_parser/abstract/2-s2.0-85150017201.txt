Biomass can be converted to biofuels and bioproducts via thermochemical processes. Biochar is one of the major products of thermochemical conversion of biomass. There are mainly two processes involved in the conversion of biomass to biochar: pyrolysis and hydrothermal Carbonization. The effect of process parameters on biochar yield and properties are discussed, including temperature, residence time, heating rate, feedstock composition and particle size. The efficient use of biochar is critical to improving the economic viability and environmental sustainability of biomass conversion technologies. Applications of biochar for both agricultural and environmental benefits (e.g., as soil amendment, pollutant removal and carbon capture) as well as biochar for energy storage materials and catalytic applications are reviewed in this chapter. This review aims to present the more significant recent advances in several biochar utilizations such as contaminants sorption, catalysts, and supercapacitors. Discussions on biochar production technologies, chemistry, properties, characteristics, and advanced functionalization techniques are provided. It also points out barriers to achieving improvements in the future.
