Transition-metal nitrides are selected as potential materials for energy storage due to their excellent theoretical electrochemical properties. However, its structure easily collapses in electrochemical reactions, which hinders their application. Reasonable regulation and unique design of its structure is a feasible strategy. Here, we have constructed a unique layered porous heterostructure through a continuous multi-step method. The prepared Cu3N@NiCo–N/Cu electrode material exhibits excellent electrochemical performance (8.49 F cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2) and outstanding cycle stability (90.1% after 8000 cycles). In particular, the asymmetric supercapacitor device assembled with Cu3N@NiCo–N/Cu cathode and rGO anode provides an excellent energy density of 124.9 μWh cm−2 at a power density of 1.6 mW cm−2. This research expands new methods for constructing high-performance energy storage devices.
