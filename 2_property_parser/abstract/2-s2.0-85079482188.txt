This paper puts forward an energy management strategy for the tram composed by two sets of high-power hydrogen fuel cell, supercapacitor and power battery, which can satisfy operating conditions. The strategy is based on the state machine, and the running status of the tram is divided into four states: traction, idling, braking and failure. Aiming at the unevenness voltage of two sets of supercapacitor during their discharged process, a voltage equalization algorithm based on adaptive discharge coefficient is proposed, which makes the supercapacitor discharge evenly during the same acceleration process, and it also avoids the excessive use of the supercapacitor effectively. At the same time, in order to improve the overall efficiency of the two sets of fuel cell, in the idle state using the optimal algorithm. At the end of this paper, by comparing the actual operation status of tram under different strategies, the feasibility and superiority of the energy management strategy proposed in this paper are further reflected.
