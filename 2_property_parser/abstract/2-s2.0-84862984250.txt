Metallic cobalt-graphene composites were synthesized through coprecipitation synthetic method followed by hydrothermal treatment at 180°C. The composite material as prepared was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), SEM, TEM, Energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) analysis and Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. The results indicate that metallic cobalt particles possess a good dispersion on the surface of graphene. The electrochemical performance of metallic cobalt-graphene composites was characterized by Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests. The specific capacitance of the composite material approaches 1340 F g -1 at current density of 1.5 A g -1 with a capacitance retention rate of 82% at current density of 3.5 A g -1. The results suggest that the combination of metallic cobalt and graphene leads to synergistic performance, which inherits the overall system with enhanced electrochemical performance. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
