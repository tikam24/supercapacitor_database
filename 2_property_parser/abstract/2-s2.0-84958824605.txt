Exploiting nanoporous binder-free electrode materials is important for the fast development of supercapacitor devices. A simple and effective strategy is demonstrated to fabricate a nanoporous all metallic binder free composite mixing tin (Sn) and lead (Pb) powders together and also, compositing them under pressure and temperature. The anodized metallic composite block have been functionalized and also found a nanoporous structure. A SEM result shows that the nanoflake like arrangement has been synthesized. The XRD results confirm the nanoporous structure of the Sn/Pb foam after etching with 5 M NaOH. The prepared supercapacitor is able to offer large specific capacitance (8.5 F cm-3) and good cycling stability (94% capacitance retention after 100 charge-discharge cycles), with regard to the synergic integration of Sn and Pb metals and the unique nanoporous structure.
