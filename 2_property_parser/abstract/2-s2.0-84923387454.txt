We present an investigation on a power pack combining a CH3NH3PbI3-based solar cell with a polypyrrole-based supercapacitor and evaluate its performance as an energy pack. The package achieved an energy storage efficiency of 10%, which is much higher than that of other systems combining a PV cell with a supercapacitor. We find a high output voltage of 1.45 V for the device under AM 1.5G illumination when the CH3NH3PbI3-based solar cell is connected in series with a polypyrrole-based supercapacitor. This system affords continuous output of electric power by using CH3NH3PbI3-based solar cell as an energy source mitigating transients caused by light intensity fluctuations or the diurnal cycle.
