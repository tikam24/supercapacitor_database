Porous carbons with the large specific surface area, high electrical conductivity as well as abundant heteroatom doping are regarded as a promising candidate for supercapacitor applications. In this report, a facile potassium ferrate (K2FeO4) activation strategy is adopted to transform the N-rich Schiff-based polymer into N-doped graphitized porous carbons (NGPCs) by the synchronous activation and graphitization. The optimized NGPC-700-1 sample delivers a delightful capacitance of 322.7 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and an excellent rate capability (79.1% capacitance retained at 50 A g−1) in 6 M KOH due to the unique laminated and porous structure with the large surface area (2123.7 m2 g−1), high porous volume (1.30 cm3 g−1) and abundant N/O dopant (6.20/8.20 at%). Moreover, the assembled symmetric supercapacitor achieves a high energy density of 21.5 W h kg−1 at the power supply of 445.5 W kg−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Therefore, NGPCs derived from one-step activation/graphitization of N-rich polymer represent a promising route for preparing porous carbon materials with the high charge storage capacity and rate capability in the energy storage.
