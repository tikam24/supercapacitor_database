Delafossites are popularly known materials for thermoelectric and electrochemical device applications due to their layered structural features. In this paper, delafossite CuCrO2 nanoparticles (NPs) have been synthesized using a simple chemical procedure and are investigated as a supercapacitor material. To determine the phases of delafossite CuCrO2 NPs, the morphological and phase formation experiments were conducted using diffraction patterns and microscopic analysis. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) studies were performed to evaluate the supercapacitative behavior of delafossite CuCrO2 NPs. As prepared delafossite CuCrO2 NPs based electrode showed an outstanding electrochemical property as compared to annealed delafossite CuCrO2 NPs at 300–500 °C. A good specific capacitance of ∼464.7 Fg-1 at 0.01 Vs-1 was found for the fabricated supercapacitor using non-annealed delafossite CuCrO2 NPs based electrode, which was further validated by GCD results. The electrochemical supercapacitor fabricated with both non-annealed and annealed delafossite CuCrO2 NPs displayed considerably the outstanding cycling stability by maintaining up to ∼88% after 5000 cycles. This work sets the pace for a new and efficient method of preparing delafossite CuCrO2 for high-performance electrochemical supercapacitors.
