Honeycomb-like nitrogen-doped carbon/polyaniline (HNC/PANI)composite is prepared by a facile two steps method. The honeycomb-like nitrogen-doped carbon skeleton, with uniform pore sizes and three-dimensionally ordered structure, is obtained via the sacrificial template method and polyaniline is served as the N and C source during this progress. The specific surface area is 1056 m2 g−1, which is much higher than that of the disordered nitrogen-doped carbon (named NDC)and pure PANI. The subsequent polyaniline nanofibers with different concentrations are in-situ polymerization on carbon skeleton. The as-prepared HNC/PANI shows excellent performance of supercapacitors is demonstrated by the electrochemical evaluation, which specific capacitance is as high as 686 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 along with the good rate performance and superior cyclic stability (87.8% after 5000 cycles at 10 A g−1, which is superior to the NDC/PANI and pure PANI electrode). Perhaps this work offers a novel approach to improve the specific capacitance and cycle stability of supercapacitors via the ordered honeycomb-like carbon framework.
