Traditional solutions for the recycling of waste tires result in several environmental complications and lethal health risks. Equally, the requirements for low-cost, eco-friendly, and energy-efficient energy storage devices are gradually increasing with the global population burst. As an effective solution herein, we report a novel process for mass scale synthesis of zinc-dopes fibrous reduced graphene oxide spheres (ZGS) using waste tires as a resource through an environment-friendly double step pyrolysis approach. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis reveals a peak quantum capacitance of 59.63 μF cm−2 at −0.38 V for ZGS, which is about 5.5 times more in comparison to the pristine graphene. Moreover, the electrochemical performance of the ZGS-based supercapacitor device shows an outstanding power density of 3325 W kg−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1 and an excellent energy density of 36.94 Wh Kg−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1 with a high specific capacitance of 316.00 F g−1 at the scan rate of 5 m Vs−1. Furthermore, our analysis depicts a link between industrial symbiosis (IS), circular economy (CE), and sustainable development (SD).
