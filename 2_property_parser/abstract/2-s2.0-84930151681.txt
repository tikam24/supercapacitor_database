A novel solution combustion synthesis method was used to prepare 3-D nanoporous Mn3O4/C composite electrode, with manganese oxide covered uniformly on the surface of carbon paper. Manganous nitrate (Mn(NO3)2)and glycine (NH2CH2COOH) were used as reactants. The morphology, microstructure and phase composition of the as-prepared samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis. The electrochemical studies of the hybrid structure were conducted in Princeton workstation and Arbin systerm. Different morphologies of manganese oxide were obtained by tuning the ratio of the reactants. And the results show that the composite possesses a continuous, uniform morphology when the ration of manganous nitrate and NH2CH2COOH is 1:1. The hybrid structure shows excellent electrochemical performance, with a specific capacitance of 201 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g, as well as good long-term cycle stability, with a retention of 94% of the initial capacitance after 1000 cycles.
