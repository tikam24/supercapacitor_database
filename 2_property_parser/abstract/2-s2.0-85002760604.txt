This paper presents a supercapacitor prediction aging model according to the voltage and to the temperature for telecommunication applications. To investigate this phenomenon, an experimental test bench is designed to accelerate the supercapacitors' calendar aging. Experimental tests are carried out at constant temperatures when the supercapacitors are polarized at the maximum voltage. To quantify the supercapacitor's aging, the equivalent series resistance (ESR) and the equivalent capacitance (C) are measured using the DC and AC characterization, respectively. To determine the supercapacitor lifetime, Arrhenius law is considered which describes the effect of temperature on the velocity of a chemical reaction.
