In this work, the hybrids of Ni-Co nanoheterostructure wrapped by carbon with high specific surface areas and narrow mesopores distribution were obtained by one-step heat treatment of nickelocene (NiCp2) filled ZIF-67. This is a fine example of the integration of metal heterostructure and porous carbon in one particle at the nanometer level. Electrochemical data demonstrate that this nanoporous hybrid material integrates the advantageous properties of the transition metal and carbon, exhibiting a distinguished specific capacitance (236 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1) and a higher cycling stability of 94.3% after 1000 cycles, highlighting the advantages of such unique configuration accompanied by the synergistic effect of Ni-Co heterostructure.
