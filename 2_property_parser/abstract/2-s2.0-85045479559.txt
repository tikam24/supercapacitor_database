For the first time, a facile one-pot hydrothermal synthesis method of Na0.9MnO2 nanowires (NWs) was successfully reported. Starting from Mn2O3 particles, we are able to grow Na0.9MnO2 in one step via simple hydrothermal method. The products are highly crystalline NWs with high density. The NWs’ length and density can be controlled by varying NaOH concentration during the growth. High performance electrochemical capacitors are fabricated by using Na0.9MnO2 NWs as electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry measurements reveal excellent mass-specific capacitance of 183 Fg−1 at 5 mVs−1. Na0.9MnO2 NWs also exhibit a reliable charge-discharge, cycle stability, and low internal resistance. Our study demonstrates Na0.9MnO2 is synthesized in NW morphology in a facile, simple, and efficient way. The excellent electrochemical characteristics of Na0.9MnO2 NWs suggest they could be employed as novel, next-generation electrodes for electrochemical energy storage devices.
