The robust Bi7.53Co0.47O11.92 nanoflowers on the nickel foam are first designed by a simple solvent thermal reaction followed by calcining. For its unique structural stability and good electrical conductivity, the Bi7.53Co0.47O11.92 nanoflowers exhibit high specific capacitance of 1046 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and outstanding rate capability (81.7% capacitance retention at 10 A g−1) along with good cycling stability (80.5% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles). The asymmetric supercapacitor assembled with Bi7.53Co0.47O11.92 and activated carbon delivers a high energy density of 41.1 Wh kg−1. This research provides a guiding strategy for the synthesis of high-performance supercapacitor electrode material based on the bismuth.
