Owing to their tunable conductivity, good processability, environmental friendliness, and unique dopingâ€“dedoping characteristics, conducting polymer (CP)-based flexible supercapacitors have been widely investigated. Inclusion of CPs into flexible substrates has been demonstrated to be an efficient way for fabricating CP-based flexible supercapacitors. This paper provides a focused review on recent progresses in the research and development of CP-based flexible supercapacitors. The synthesis and electrochemical performances of CP-based hydrogels, including the pristine CP hydrogels, hybrid hydrogels, and all in one supercapacitors, are highlighted. The latest progress in the development of flexible supercapacitors based on binary and ternary hybrid films consisting of CP/carbon nanotubes, CP/graphene, or CP/graphene/carbon nanotubes is discussed. Furthermore, a brief summary of the use of CP-based textiles and fibers for flexible supercapacitors is also presented, along with the current challenges and future perspectives for CP-based supercapacitors.
