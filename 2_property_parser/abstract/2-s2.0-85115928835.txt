This review covers the developments towards graphene based composite electrodes for supercapacitor application. In particular, graphene is being considered as the potential electrode material for high power supercapacitor application because of its extraordinary physical and chemical properties such as large specific surface area, good electrical conductivity and large corrosion resistance in aqueous electrolytes. However, it does not meet the requirement of high energy density for the supercapacitor. Therefore, graphene has been mixed with other materials to improve the energy density of the device. The supercapacitor performance of graphene based composites as electrodes has been significantly enhanced. In this context, synthesis and electrochemical performance of graphene based composite electrodes with metal oxides, ferrites, conducting polymers and other materials are discussed in this review.
