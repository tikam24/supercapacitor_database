A new 2D Mn-MOF (Mn-PRCA, PRCA = pyrazine 2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride) is constructed and used as a host for the loading of Ni2+ through post-synthetic modification method (PSM). Then the bimetal MOF(Ni@Mn-PRCA) is served as template for the synthesis of Ni0.4Mn1.6P by the phosphorization route. The obtained Ni0.4Mn1.6P is used as electrode material and exhibit a large specific capacitance of 1060 F/g at 1 A g and a capacitance retention of 75 % after 2000 cycles). In addition, an asymmetric device Ni0.4Mn1.6P // AC (activated carbon) is also assembled and shows an energy density of 21.1 W h kg âˆ’1 at the power density of 799.6 kW kg -1 under a stable working voltage of 1.6 V. This is the first time that PSM technique is applied in electrochemical application and bimetal phosphide derived from a new MOF is used as electrode materials for supercapacitor.
