Grid integration of photovoltaic (PV) system with a hybrid energy storage can help not only in increasing more penetration of PV system into the network but also in improving the power system dynamics and control in addition to helping the demand side management. In this work, a PV system with a hybrid energy storage including a battery array and a super capacitor bank is going to work as an active generator with innovative load management and power flow control strategies for managing the active power demand locally considering the grid constraints. This work proposes an architecture for a PV based active generator, which can provide active power in controlled manner while maintaining the frequency stability within the power grid. With the proposed architecture and innovative control strategies, the load demand to the grid can be effectively reduced as the PV generated power can be maximally utilized locally and the power fluctuations can be compensated using the embedded energy storage. The power flow is managed using the hierarchical approach with the state-flow and droop characteristics as a finite state machine.
