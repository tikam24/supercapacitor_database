This paper deals with a system in which DC motor is started by using parallel combination of supercapacitor and battery, for enhancing the battery-life. Supercapacitor delivers energy during ride through periods, which typically are during starting or during overloads. While delivering the energy, their current demands heavily increase. For the cases of heavy drainage of energy, for a longer time, the reduction in terminal voltage of supercapacitor reduces the power fed by the supercapacitor. Then another capacitor is added in parallel with previous capacitor, supercapacitor bank of element can lead to higher effective current while enhance the power fed to the load during this overload period. MATLAB simulation has been done to analysis such systems. Energy calculations have also been done. The proposed system is realized experimentally on small D.C. motor. Thus a less-known co-working of supercapacitor and battery in parallel has been reported here. No doubt, the nominal voltage of battery, charged supercapacitor and motor armature how to be judiciously chosen, when application details are to be worked out. From the angle of design, these aspects needs more deliberations, but have not been dealt with here, since, the aim was only to practice the parallel connection of supercapacitor and battery with view to enhance the battery life.
