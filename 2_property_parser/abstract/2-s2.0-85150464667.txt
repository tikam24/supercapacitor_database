This paper mainly addresses the design, sizing and control of an actively configured battery-supercapacitor (SC) based hybrid energy storage system (HESS). Various important aspects while performing the HESS sizing analysis are discussed in detail. The hybridization reduces the battery stress during transient instants, thus enhancing the system response in addition to improvement of battery life. The performance of HESS depends on the control scheme and power allocation between battery and SC. A low-pass filtration based frequency decomposition strategy is used to achieve the power sharing. The control approach is validated through simulation and implemented using dSPACE DS1103 digital controller in the developed test-rig under sudden load variation. The performance of the HESS controller is found satisfactory under steady-state as well as transient operation.
