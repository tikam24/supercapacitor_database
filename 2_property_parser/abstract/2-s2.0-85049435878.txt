For maximum and efficient charge storage and delivery, porous nanorods with active sites can offer a unique set of advantages. Herein, hierarchically porous (0.2–200 nm) cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) nanorods are hydrothermally prepared by tuning oleic acid concentration (100–500 μL) with subsequent annealing (400 °C). These hierarchical pores (with edges and cavities) raise the specific surface area of CoFe2O4 nanorods to 154 m2 g−1. In addition, 80% of CoFe2O4 sites become accessible boosting the capacitance to a high value (460.5 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1), while retaining excellent cyclic stability (95.8% for 5000 cycles). Maximum pseudocapacitive contribution from these electrochemically active sites is ensured by rapid diffusion of electrolytic OH− ions (5.8 × 10−8 cm2 s−1). Moreover, on assembling these nanorods as a positive electrode in asymmetric configuration (graphene nanoribbons as negative electrode), the cell exhibits an outstanding energy density (33.5 Wh kg−1 at 727.8 W kg−1), almost double of its symmetric (16.5 Wh kg−1 at 288 W kg−1) counterpart.
