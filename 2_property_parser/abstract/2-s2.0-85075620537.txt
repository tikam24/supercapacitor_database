Electrochemical energy storage devices are today’s need for present and future utility, where high energy and power density are combined in the same material. Supercapacitors offer high energy density at high charge–discharge rates. Transition metal sulfides have been tried as a new type of electrode materials for supercapacitor, and good performance has been proved. Cadmium-doped CuS nanostructures have been prepared via a sample hydrothermal process at 130 °C. Nanocomposites of cadmium-doped CuS have been the focus of intensive study due to their potential applications in diverse fields. The nanostructures were characterized by XRD, FTIR, SEM/EDS, and TEM. The XRD pattern reveals that the Cd nanoparticle-incorporated CuS shows crystallite nature, and crystallinity increases with the addition of cadmium on CuS. Electrochemical analysis was performed using a 2M KOH electrolyte in the technique called CV and EIS study. Cd–CuS exhibits hexagonal architecture and the specific capacitance is calculated as 458 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 scan rate. The high utility of pseudocapacitive Cd–CuS is achieved only in its highest doping concentration of cadmium on CuS. Hence, this type of electrode material may get wide utility range in future energy storage devices.
