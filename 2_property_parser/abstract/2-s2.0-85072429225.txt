Supercapacitor has the merits of low resistance and long lifecycle ability. When combined with battery, they can alleviate the burthen of battery, increase the battery's working efficiency and prolong its lifecycle. This paper introduces a control architecture based on balancing of SOC and algorithm based on fuzzy logic, Aiming at the two different cycles that have sufficient and insufficient energy that can be recovered from braking unlikely, this paper puts forward the methods of on-line adjusting fuzzy control parameters. Consequently, simulation was performed,and the results validate the effective adapting capacity of the control logic under different driving cycles. Copyright Â© 2007 SAE International.
