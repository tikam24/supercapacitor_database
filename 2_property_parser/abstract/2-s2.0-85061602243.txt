Manganese oxide (MnO 2 )/polyaniline composite thin films were deposited using the electrochemical route for the fabrication of supercapacitor devices. The MnO 2 polyaniline composite was prepared with different percentages of MnO 2 and polyaniline and its structural, morphological, electrochemical, wettability and supercapacitor properties have been studied. The effects of the different percentages of MnO 2 and polyaniline on the supercapacitor have been investigated. The thin film containing 80% polyaniline and 20% MnO 2 shows relatively better supercapacitance, i.e., 409 F/g as compared to other composite thin films. The same film shows the retention of 92% of its original specific capacitance value after 1000 cycles. Similarly, after 2000 cycles, this value is still 84%.
