Abstract: Carbon materials have been used in the field of supercapacitors. However, the lower electrochemical performance limits its wide application. Polyaniline (PANI) possesses excellent controllable electrochemistry. Therefore, a composite material composed of polyaniline and carbon materials will significantly improve the electrochemical performance of carbon materials alone. In this article, the carbon/PANI composite mesh electrode materials were prepared by electrochemical polymerization. The carbon mesh with highly wrinkled nanoscale microstructure is an excellent substrate material of polyaniline. The agglomerate morphology of polyaniline on the carbon mesh can be efficiently controlled by the number of CV cycles. The polyaniline agglomerated coating of the carbon/PANI-45 composite mesh exhibits a multi-scale pore microstructure: abundant macropores, mesopores and micropores. This unique electrochemically deposited porous structure can significantly improve electrochemical performance of the carbon/PANI-45 mesh electrode material due to efficient ion transport channels and electron transport path. The area-specific capacitance of the carbon/PANI-45 based interdigital supercapacitors is up to 246.7 mF/cm2 at the current density of 20 μA/cm2. The area-specific capacitance retention rate is about 93.1% when the current density increases to 200 μA/cm2.
