This review gives an overview of the synthesis, surface, and electrochemical investigations over Mn-based compounds in the development of new supercapacitors. There is a lot of interest in Mn products these days because of their excellent theoretical capacitance quantities, chemical stability, thermal, lower cost, and ready availability. In this regard, the synthesis, characterization, and performance of different compounds of Mn compounds are discussed in detail. These remarkable results demonstrate the exciting commercial potential for high-performance, environmentally friendly, and low-cost electrical energy storage devices based on Mn different compounds. These reports have determined the amazing potential of the Mn base materials as the pseudocapacitors electrodes. Further investigations can develop the current performance of the Mn base materials as the pseudocapacitors. The nanofoams/aerogels of MnO2â€“carbon can be used directly for ECs due to their outstanding cycling stability.
