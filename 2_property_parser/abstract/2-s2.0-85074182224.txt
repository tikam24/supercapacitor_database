Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of electrochemical devices have become powerful tools for the in situ investigation of electrochemical processes. The techniques often take advantage of NMR's nondestructive/noninvasive properties, its sensitivity to frequency shifts, internal interactions, and transport processes, as well as its ability to measure liquid phases and disordered materials. Here, we provide a perspective on recent work on in situ MRI of electrochemical devices, batteries and relevant model systems, and discuss their applications and promises in assessing device performance, and electrochemical processes in cells.
