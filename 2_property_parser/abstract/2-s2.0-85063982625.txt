Inspired by the capability of hyperaccumulators to enrich heavy metal ions, metal-loaded biomass is prepared, and the metal nanospheres are dispersed in hierarchical porous carbon skeletons uniformly after activation. The raw material comes from nature and is renewable and environmentally friendly. The simple process leads to effective loading of metal ions, and the cobalt ion solution is reusable, which meets the requirements of green chemistry. The product achieves high specific capacitance because cobalt nanospheres exhibit obvious pseudocapacitance, and the hierarchical porous carbon skeletons lead to low impedance, which is beneficial for the rate performance. This experiment provides a new strategy for the preparation of biochar and metal-composite-based supercapacitor electrode materials.
