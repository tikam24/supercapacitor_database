The development of a negative electrode for supercapacitors is a critical challenge for the next-generation of energy-storage devices. Herein, two new electrodes formed by the coordination polymers [Ni(itmb)4(HPMo12O40)]·2H2O (1) and [Zn(itmb)3(H2O)(HPMo12O40)]·4H2O (2) (itmb = 1-(imidazo-1-ly)-4-(1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene), synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method, are described. Compounds 1 and 2 show high capacitances of 477.9 and 890.2 F g−1, respectively. An asymmetric supercapacitor device assembled using 2 which has novel water-assisted proton channels as negative electrode and active carbon as positive electrode shows ultrahigh energy density and power density of 23.4 W h kg−1 and 3864.4 W kg−1, respectively. Moreover, the ability to feed a red light emitting diode (LED) also demonstrates the feasibility for practical use. The results allow a better elucidation of the storage mechanism in polyoxometalate-based coordination polymers and provide a promising direction for exploring novel negative materials for new-generation high-performance supercapacitors.
