The purpose of this study is to investigate the magnetic and electrochemical properties of the new GO/Pani-CeO2/CoFe2O4 nanocomposite. This nanocomposite was synthesized through two routes and the results of the investigations show interesting cases. The interaction between CeO2-Pani and the presence of Ce-O was confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy and the XRD data showed the successful formation of the magnetite nanoparticles with the presence of CeO2 anchored onto polyaniline within the GO matrix. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed well the presence of Ce+3 (in addition to Ce+4) and its percentage. The products were identified by other methods such as VSM, FE-SEM, and EDX. Electrochemical studies such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to evaluate the effect of changes in the accumulation type of the synthesized nanocomposite were recorded in 0.5 M H3PO4 vs. Ag/AgCl. The stability test also shows that the desired compound has relatively good stability as a supercapacitor.
