As an efficient energy storage device, supercapacitor has attracted increasing attention from researchers. However, there are two major problems that hinder the commercialization of electrode materials. First, the morphology and structure of electrode materials are not reasonable and the specific surface area is small, which leads to insufficient active sites; second, it is difficult to reach the theoretical specific capacitance due to the poor conductivity of active materials. Dealloying is a technical means that takes into account the design of material morphology and its phase structure. Porous metal materials prepared by dealloying have the characteristics of controllable morphology, simple preparation method and rapid reaction, so they have been widely used in electrode materials of supercapacitor. In this review, firstly, the dealloying preparation methods and materials suitable for electrode materials are introduced, and then, how to prepare materials from two aspects of morphology and phase composition design by dealloying technology is introduced in detail. Finally, the existing problems of the present stage dealloying technology in the electrode materials of supercapacitor and the future development direction are pointed out.
