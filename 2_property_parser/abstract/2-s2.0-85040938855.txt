Herein, amphiphilic block copolymer-modified film electrodes were fabricated using poly(acrylic acid)-b-poly(acrylonitrile)-b-poly(acrylic acid) as a surface modifier, polyethersulfone as a matrix polymer, and activated carbon as an active substance by the phase separation method to enhance the wettability of the electrodes. The effect of the surface modifier on electrochemical performance was investigated. The results indicate that the hydrophilic polymer chains of poly(acrylic acid) are coated on the surface, and the wettability of the fabricated electrode film is largely improved. The prepared film shows good electrochemical performance and is further used as an electrode to assemble a symmetric supercapacitor. The high electrochemical performance of the device demonstrates that the rational coating of the amphiphilic block copolymer onto the surface of a film electrode can obviously improve the wettability and further enhance the electrolyte-affinity of the film electrode. More importantly, both the film electrode and the symmetric supercapacitor are flexible.
