Different morphologies of 3D N, P, S-doped C-(Mn2O3)3MnSiO3 (petal-like C-MnSi-0.5 and cube-like C-MnSi-2.0) are derived from natural reed leaves and used in electrochemical supercapacitors. The as-obtained C-MnSi materials have an architecture with huge BET surface area and large number of pore structures and exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance. C-MnSi-0.5 gives 376 F g−1 and C-MnSi-2.0 gives 391 F g−1 at the current density of 0.5 A g−1. Both C-MnSi materials maintain high retention (above 99%) after 10 000 cycles. The SC devices with C-MnSi and activated carbon (C-MnSi-0.5‖AC and C-MnSi-2.0‖AC) achieve high capacities (378 and 458 mF cm−2 at a current density of 2 mA cm−2, respectively) and good cycle stabilities (70.2% and 73.8% capacity after 6000 cycles, respectively). The results presented in this study indicate that the N, P, S-doped C-MnSi architectures from natural reed leaves are promising and efficient materials for manufacturing high performance supercapacitors.
