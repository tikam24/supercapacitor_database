The hydrothermal method was mostly used for the preparation of metallic double hydroxides. However, itis very time-consuming and energy-consuming. In this study, we for the first time reported a facile, rapidand cost-effective microwave strategy to fabricate nickel/cobalt double hydroxides (Ni/Co-DH). Four sol-vents, including water, ethanol, isopropanol and tertbutanol, were used for the synthesis of Ni/Co-DHto examine effect of the reaction medium. The study demonstrated that the Ni/Co-DH prepared in theaqueous solution exists as the mixture of α-Ni(OH)2and β-Co(OH)2. However, the Ni/Co-DH prepared inthe organic solvent studied has a hydrotalcite-like structure. Moreover, the Ni/Co-DH prepared in ethanoloffers ultrathin flowercluster structure with a three-dimensional morphology. Owing to the greatlyimproved Faradaic redox reaction and mass transfer, the Ni/Co-DH electrode exhibits excellent pseudo-capacitance performance, including high specific capacitance and rate capability, good charge/dischargestability and long-term cycling life. Its maximum specific capacitance was up to 1887.5 F g-1at the currentdensity of 1 A g-1, which is more than 2.4-fold that of the Ni/Co-DH prepared in the aqueous solution.The specific capacitance can remain 1187.5 F g-1when the current density increases to 10 A g-1. Thecapacitance can keep at least 99.7% at the current density of 8 A g-1after 3000 cycles. This work alsoprovides a promising approach for the synthesis of various metallic double hydroxide materials withlargely enhanced supercapacitor behavior, which can be potentially applied in energy storage/conversiondevices. © 2013 The Authors.
