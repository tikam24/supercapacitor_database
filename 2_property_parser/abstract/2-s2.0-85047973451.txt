The nano-Au@PANI was prepared via a two-step method of oxidative polymerization by controlling the diffusion of oxidizing agents. The morphology of nano-Au@PANI was characterized by TEM, and the performances of supercapacitor were measured by electrochemical work-station (CHI660E). Furthermore, the relationship of reaction time and the performances of supercapacitor were also studied. The results showed that the nano-Au@PANI composites possessed yolk-shell structure, and with extension of reaction time the specific capacitance first increased and then decreased. When the reaction time was 12 h, the shell thickness of PANI was about 21 nm, the specific capacitance was up to 79 FÂ·g-1.
