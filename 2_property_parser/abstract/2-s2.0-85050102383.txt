The electrification of the automobile powertrain and the automation of driving functions are the major trends of the automotive industry in the 21st century. In combination, these two systems will enable novel possibilities for energy efficient driving. The autonomous driving system provides a trustworthy prediction of the future load profile, which is used for the calculation of energy optimal control trajectories. This paper presents a fundamental research on and the potentials of a predictive operating strategy for a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) supported by the autonomous driving system. A HESS is composed of a battery representing the energy storage device and a double layer capacitor (DLC) representing the power storage device. It is shown that a dynamically optimized operating strategy improves the energy efficiency and reduces the weight, the volume and the cost of the HESS.
