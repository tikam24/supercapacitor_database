Rectangular shaped α-Ce2S3 microrods have been grown with the aid of a facile, efficient, low cost and low temperature chemical bath deposition (CBD) approach in thin film form. Characterizations of α-Ce2S3 have been performed through structural, morphological and surface wettability studies. Intermixed rectangular microrods with lower contact angle provide a reduction in intrinsic resistance and effective ion diffusion path during electrochemical activities ensuring maximum utilization of the active electrode species. This leads to achieve a remarkable specific capacitance of 726 F/g at 2 mV/s scan rate with the excellent electrochemical stability of 93% at 2000 CV cycles. Efficient electrochemical findings exhibit excellent scope of α-Ce2S3 towards next-generation energy storage devices.
