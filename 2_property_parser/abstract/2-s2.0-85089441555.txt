Low cost and efficient one-step facile hydrothermal synthesis was used to synthesis CoS@WS2 composite on the surface of nickel foam and evaluated as an electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, galvanostatic charge–discharge tests, and cyclic voltammetry were used to evaluate the electrochemical characteristics of the CoS@WS2 electrode. A high-specific capacitance of 2442.32 F g−1 at a current density of 4.28 A g−1 was noted for CoS@WS2. The fabricated CoS@WS2 electrode material displayed acceptable rate capability (97.1% capacitance retention at a current density of 4.28 A g−1) and good cycling stability over 3000 charge–discharge cycles. The advanced electrochemical characteristics of CoS@WS2 were contributed to the synergistic effect and high surface area. The greater electrochemical performance of nanoparticles-like CoS@WS2 composite attracts their capacity to meet the requirements of applied electrochemical energy-loading applications. Over all, these results demonstrate that the synthesis of layered CoS@WS2 could be a promising for applied electrochemical energy-loading applications.
