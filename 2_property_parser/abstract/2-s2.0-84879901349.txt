A polypyrrole-reduced graphite oxide core-shell composite was facilely fabricated through electrostatic interactions and π-π accumulation. This novel composite shows remarkable performance as an electrode material for supercapacitors, with a high specific capacitance of 557 F g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1, and retains a high value after 1000 charge-discharge processes. The maximum energy density of the fabricated supercapacitor based on the mass of active electrodes is calculated to be 49.5 W h kg-1 and 33.3 W h kg-1 at a power density of 0.22 kW kg-1 and 6.06 kW kg-1, the improved capacitance might be mainly ascribed to higher conductivity and more crumpled surface of the composite. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
