Dynamic performance of a power system has been shown to have improved because of incorporation of supercapacitor storage system interfaced through a STATCOM. The STATCOM has the capability to improve the voltage profile of the system through the control of reactive power. The supercapacitor adds a powerful dimension to the performance of the power system by injection or absorption of real power. A multi-machine system model with the incorporation of active and reactive storage systems has been modeled, controllers designed, and simulation studies carried out. PI controllers have been included in the voltage and power control loops of the STATCOM. Rotor speed error is considered as the input of both controllers. Disturbances in the form of simple torque pulse as well as severe three-phase faults were simulated. The results show that the supercapacitor based STATCOM storage system can control both the slowly growing transients as well as rotor angle instability conditions.
