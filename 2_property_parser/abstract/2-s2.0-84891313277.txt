Fuel cells and supercapacitors are electrochemical devices providing efficient and pollution-free production and transformation of electricity. Notwithstanding their environmental appeal, a host of materials-science problems-chiefly related to the limited durability of crucial functional components-are hindering their widespread application. The present knowledge of the relevant materials-science notion is mostly at the macroscopic and empirical trial-and-error level and the answers to many questions require much deeper scientific understanding of the origin of degradation processes. In this regard, the development and the implementation of appropriate methods for in-situ characterization of cell components at the functionally relevant length scales is highly required. Soft X-ray spectroscopies, such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray emission (fluorescence) spectroscopy, resonant inelastic X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy have been extensively employed for ex-situ characterization of materials used in electrochemical systems. Furthermore, adding spatial resolution capabilities by implementing proper optical solutions has opened unique opportunities for monitoring material changes and mass transport events occurring at submicron length scales. The input from these methods is providing correlative information about the status of the electrode surface and of the electrode/electrolyte interface and also of the processes occurring under operation conditions.
