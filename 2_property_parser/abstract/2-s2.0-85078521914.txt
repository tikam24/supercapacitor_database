A multidimensional micro CuCo2O4/nano NiMoO4 architecture is prepared on Ni foam by the hydrothermal method. The structure consists of urchinlike CuCo2O4 microspheres covered by ultrathin NiMoO4 nanosheets. The synergistic effect depends on the diversity of space and composition. The one-dimensional CuCo2O4 nanoneedles enhance the charge transport and carry the two-dimensional NiMoO4 nanosheets. The nanosheets can expose abundant active sites and act as an armor to alleviate the volume change and maintain the structural integrity during long-term cycling. The three-dimensional skeleton integrates the intrinsic properties and external spatial effect of each component. The corresponding supercapacitor exhibits a high specific capacity of 276 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1, good rate capability, and excellent cycling stability of 98.3% over 8000 cycles. The concept of integrating the multidimensionality and multicomponent provides a universal approach to develop high-performance materials.
