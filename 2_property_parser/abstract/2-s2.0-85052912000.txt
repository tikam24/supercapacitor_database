Nano-sized Ni(OH)2 is being widely as an for various applications like battery, supercapacitor, fuel cell, sensor, catalyze etc. due to its natural abundance, environmentally friendly and excellent electrochemical property. And these properties of nickel hydroxide majorly depend on synthesis method. β-Ni(OH)2 and Modified-β-Ni(OH)2 (ethylenediamine as templating agent) was successfully synthesized by conventional chemical precipitation method. β-Ni(OH)2 and Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanocomposite formed by vigorous sonication up to the formation of the uniform dispersion. Developed materials were characterized by using X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Structural characterization suggested the formation of the hexagonal structure of β-Ni(OH)2 and particle size was found 7.5 nm and 3 nm for conventional and modified β-Ni(OH)2 respectively. Flame retardancy and thermal stability study were exhibited with UL-94 and TG/DTA and it was found that as particle size decreases uniform dispersion and better flame retardancy and thermal stability.
