Heteroatom doping can change the electrochemical properties of carbon materials, but the simple, cheap and environmentally friendly preparation of these materials still remains a challenge. Herein, we have reported a new general strategy to fabricate heteroatom-doped carbon fiber materials based on the bioconcentration of different toxic organic dyes via fungal hyphae. The doped carbon fibers had a high content of heteroatoms and a three-dimensional network structure, exhibiting great potential as electrode materials for supercapacitors. Among these products, the N-S doped carbon fiber prepared by bioconcentration of methylene blue had the highest specific capacitance of 235 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and good rate capability (72.8% retention from 1 A g-1 to 20 A g-1). This strategy can turn toxic waste into valuable materials, converting trash to treasure in the most literal sense; this bioconcentration method is green, general, low-cost and suitable for the preparation of fungal hyphae heteroatom-doped carbon fiber materials from different heteroatom precursors.
