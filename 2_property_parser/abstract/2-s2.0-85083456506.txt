With tetramethylethylene (2,3-Dimethyl-2-butene, TME) as the polymer source, lithium powder (Li) was immersed to obtain highly stable lithium powder (TME-Li) coated with poly 2,3-Dimethyl-2-butene. It was pre-embedded into an electrode sheet with an intermediate carbon microsphere (MCMB)/multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT)/super carbon black (SP) composite material as a negative electrode and assembled into a lithium-ion capacitor (LIC). Scanning electron microscopy and intelligent Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were used to analyze lithium powder and electrode sheets scientifically. In addition, constant current charge–discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were also used to analyze the electrochemical properties of the LIC. The results show that embedded TME-Li can improve the electrochemical performance of capacitors efficiently. When the current density is 50 mA g−1, the specific capacitance can reach 69.09 F g−1. Within the current density range of 50–700 mA g−1, the maximum power density is 1.02 kw kg−1, and the energy density is as high as 91.14 Wh kg−1. After 4000 constant current charge and discharge cycles, the capacitance retention rate is still above 83%, showing good electrochemical performance.
