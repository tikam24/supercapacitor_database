Nickel selenide nanoparticles uniformly supported on graphene nanosheets to form NiSe2/rGO composites were prepared via one-step mixing solvothermal method. The NiSe2/rGO composite possesses a high specific capacity of 137.7 mA h g−1 (1A g−1) and displays an excellent rate property. Moreover, there are NiSe2/rGO-20 as electrode materials assembling asymmetric supercapacitors, which manifests high energy density (33.13 Wh kg−1) at a power density (850 W kg−1) and the capacity can maintain of 80 % after 10,000 cycles. Therefore, NiSe2/rGO composite can be a potential candidate for high-efficiency asymmetric supercapacitors.
