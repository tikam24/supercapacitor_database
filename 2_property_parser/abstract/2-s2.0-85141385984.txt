For most electrodes fabricated with carbon, transition metal compounds, or conductive polymers, the capacitance may deteriorate with cyclic charging and discharging. Thus, an electrochemically stable supercapacitor has long been pursued by researchers. In this work, the hierarchical structure of balsa wood is preserved in the converted carbon which is used as a supporting framework to fabricate electrodes for supercapacitors. Well-grown carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on interior and exterior surfaces of balsa carbon channels provide two advantages including 1) offering more specific surface area to boost capacitance via electric double layer capacitance and 2) offering more active Fe and Ni sites to participate in the redox reaction to enhance capacitance of the balsa carbon/CNTs electrode. The balsa carbon/CNTs demonstrate an excellent area capacitance of 1940 mF cm−2. As active sites on Ni and Fe catalysts and inner walls of CNTs are gradually released, the capacitance increases 66% after 4000 charge–discharge cycles. This work brings forward a strategy for the rational design of high-performance biomass carbon coupled with advanced nanostructures for energy storage.
