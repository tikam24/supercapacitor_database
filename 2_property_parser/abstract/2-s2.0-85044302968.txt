Zinc oxide based composite materials show advantages such as low cost, environmental protection, good electrochemical reversibility, high specific capacitance, high power density, high energy density, good cycling stability and simple preparation, which makes them promising materials for advanced supercapacitors. Based on the most advanced research, we present recent findings in the investigation, discussion and challenges related to various kinds of zinc oxide based composite materials, such as zinc oxide/carbon, zinc oxide/graphene, zinc oxide/manganese dioxide, zinc oxide/nickel oxide and other composites.
