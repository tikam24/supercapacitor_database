The terms 'supercapacitor' and 'ultracapacitor' were coined by Nippon Electric Company (NEC), Japan, and Pinnacle Research Institute, USA, respectively. In technical terminology, it is named as electrochemical double-layer capacitor in contrast to 'electrolytic capacitor'. Historically, supercapacitors are divided into genuine double-layer capacitors that use the high surface area of carbon materials, and faradaic systems that additionally use redox reactions at metal oxides or conductive polymers. The article outlines the birth of supercapacitor technology: (1) the discovery of double-layer capacitance, from the Leyden jar to electrochemical capacitors; (2) the history of its commercialization; and (3) the history of the development of carbonaceous materials, metal oxides and polymers for supercapacitors, and hybrid capacitors.
