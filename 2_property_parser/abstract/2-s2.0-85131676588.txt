This paper proposes a black widow optimization (BWO) algorithm-based derivative-type control for optimized virtual inertia (VI) emulation using fast responding ultracapacitor (UC) as energy storage system for frequency regulation in a two-area deregulated power system composed of thermal and hydro units with high penetration of solar photovoltaic. The parameters of the system have been controlled by using newly formulated BWO and their performance have been compared for virtual inertial emulation efficacy with other algorithms under different contract obligations. The impact of the coordinated action of BWO-based proportional-integral (PI) controller with VI emulation has been validated on the area frequency, tie-line power, and generated power of different units. The eigenvalue approach has been applied to verify the performance and effect of VI emulation control using fast acting UC on system stability. The proposed VI emulation control studies have been evaluated under nonlinear environment of deregulated power system. The comparative studies show that BWO optimized PI-based VI emulation using fast responding UC provides superior dynamic responsiveness in all competitive electricity market scenarios tested under different operating conditions.
