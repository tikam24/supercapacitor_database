Nitrogen enriched carbon nanofibers have been obtained by one-step carbonization/activation of PAN-based nanofibers with various concentrations of melamine at 800 °C under a N2 atmosphere. As synthesised carbon nanofibers were directly used as electrodes for symmetric supercapacitors. The obtained PAN-MEL fibers with 5% melamine stabilised at 280 °C and carbonized at 800 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere showed excellent electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of up to 166 F g-1 at a current density of 1A g-1 using 6 M KOH electrolyte and a capacity retention of 109.7% after 3000 cycles. It shows a 48% increase as compared to pristine carbon nanofibers. Two electrode systems of the CNFM5 sample showed high energy densities of 23.72 to 12.50 W h kg-1 at power densities from 400 to 30000 W kg-1. When used as an anode for Li-ion battery application the CNFM5 sample showed a high specific capacity up to 435.47 mA h g-1 at 20 mA g-1, good rate capacity and excellent cycling performance (365 mA h g-1 specific capacity even after 200 cycles at 100 mA g-1). The specific capacity obtained for these nitrogen enriched carbon nanofibers is higher than that for pristine carbon nano-fibers.
