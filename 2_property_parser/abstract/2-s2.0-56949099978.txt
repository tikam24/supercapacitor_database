Crystalline structure of ruthenium oxide (RuO2) was electrochemically deposited onto tin doped indium oxide (ITO) electrode and used as electrodes to form a supercapacitor in a 0.5M H2SO4 electrolyte. The structural and surface morphological observations revealed the formation of nanograins of RuO2 of tetragonal crystal structure. For electrochemical supercapacitor application, electrochemically prepared crystalline RuO2 was found to be stable for large number of cycles with the specific capacitance 498 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV/s. The specific capacitance is found to be dependent on the scan rate and the capacitance values varied inversely with scan rate. Â© 2006 by ESG.
