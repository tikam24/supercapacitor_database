Due to their low cost, high conductivity, and synergistic impact, the ternary CuCo2S4 sulfides were thoroughly examined in this article as electrode materials for electrochemical properties. The hydrothermal reaction process for energy storage application was aided by the nanostructured copper cobalt sulfides (CuCo2S4) secured on multiwalled carbon nanotubes/polypyrrole composite via ultrasonication. By utilizing a 6 M KOH electrolyte, the produced composite electrode displays increased specific capacitances and cyclic stability. The structural, morphological, and surface properties of the composite materials were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory, and the Barrett, Joyner, For better supercapacitor use, the morphological characteristics of nanoscale CuCo2S4 on NMWCNT/PPy surface were confirmed. The synthesized CuCo2S4@NMWCNT and CuCo2S4@NMWCNT/PPy composite electrodes shown outstanding cyclic stability up to 5000 cycles and specific capacitances of 259 F/g, respectively, at 1 A/g. The synthesized ternary composite electrode's electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characteristics reveal the lowest Rs (0.53 and 0.63) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) as 65.6 Î©, as well as reasonably outstanding retention of 90.5 % after 5000 cycles. Through the use of a three-electrode configuration, the increased surface and morphological features of the CuCo2S4 on NMWCNT/PPy composite boosted the electrochemical properties of the ternary composite electrode.
