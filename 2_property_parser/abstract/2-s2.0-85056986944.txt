Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has emerged as one of the most promising photocatalysts due to its metal-free nature, abundance of raw material, and thermal physical-chemical stability. The breakthrough research studies in recent years have mostly been concentrated on the engineering of the intrinsic and morphological properties of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts in the framework of powder suspensions for artificial photosynthesis and environmental remediation. However, practical applications of g-C3N4-based electrodes and devices are still in the early stages of development due to challenging fabrication methods of g-C3N4 thin films. This review addresses the classification of diverse techniques to deposit g-C3N4-based thin films and explores a broad spectrum of applications pertinent to g-C3N4-based electrodes. Although this paper is principally focused on photoelectrochemical water splitting, other emerging applications of g-C3N4 in solar cells, electrocatalysts and supercapacitors are also reviewed. Lastly, further suggestions are posited for other potential applications, challenges and future orientations.
