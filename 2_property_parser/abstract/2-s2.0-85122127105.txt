The energy management strategy of full power fuel cell vehicle with battery and supercapacitor as secondary energy source directly affects the vehicle economy and the life of each energy. The energy management strategy based on wavelet transform fails to take into account the change of state of charge (SOC) of battery and supercapacitor.In order to give full play to the dynamic characteristics of various energy sources and ensure that the battery and supercapacitor work within the appropriate SOC range, on the basis of wavelet transform, the fuzzy logic control method is used to dynamically distribute the power output between fuel cell and battery, and the supercapacitor is given priority to braking energy recovery. The AVL cruise joint Simulink simulation platform is established to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy based on WLTC working condition. The results show that the strategy is feasible and can ensure that the battery and supercapacitor are in a more efficient SOC range.Compared with the strategy based on wavelet transform, the hydrogen consumption of the whole vehicle is reduced by 3.8%.
