A facile, single-step hydrothermal route is followed to prepare ZnS nanowires with large aspect ratios. The obtained ZnS nanowires deposited on nickel foam (ZnS/Ni-foam) exhibit a specific capacitance of 781 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g. An asymmetric supercapacitor fabricated from ZnS/Ni-foam as a positive electrode and jute derived activated carbon coated on Ni-foam (JAC/Ni-foam) as a negative electrode attains a high specific capacitance of 573 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g, with an accompanying high energy density of 51 Wh/kg at a power density of 200 W/kg in an extensive operating potential window of 1.2 V. In addition, the ZnS//JAC asymmetric supercapacitor reveals long-term cyclic stability, after 10,000 GCD cycles the device sustain around âˆ¼87 % of the initial specific capacitance. These results shed enlighten a new opportunity for promising electrode materials in supercapacitors.
