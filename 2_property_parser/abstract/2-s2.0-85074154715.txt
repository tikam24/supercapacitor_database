The main objective of this paper is focused on the real time implementation in a MATLAB/SIMULINK environment of a closed-loop hybrid control strategy structure consisting of a combination of Fuzzy Logic control approach and a standard PID control strategy. This strategy is applied to control the speed of a 2 HP 1750 rpm permanent magnet DC motor used in a wide range of HVAC applications. The novelty of the paper is the new modeling approach by using SIMULINK SIMSCAPE library blocks, more practical due to its simplicity, easier and faster to implement and, in particular, very easy to practice for MATLAB users compared to a traditional modelling approach. The DC motor can be powered by a unidirectional DC voltage converter connected to a 10 kW-Microgrid PV array or directly from a Li-Ion battery or a Supercapacitor, both connected via two bidirectional DC boost-buck converters to the same Microgrid. The Microgrid energy storage system is suitable for renewable energy applications that are connected to a local grid, thus releasing the overloaded national grid, saving a considerable amount of energy and drastically reducing the energy costs.
