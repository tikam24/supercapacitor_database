A novel binder-free electrode material, Co3S4@rGO/Ni foam, was synthesized with a facile one-step method under mild experimental conditions. 1-Thioglycerol was utilized as the catalyst for the low-temperature hydrolysis of sodium thiosulfate. S2−, the hydrolysis product, reacted with cobalt cation to produce Co3S4, which was coated on rGO nanosheets. Co3S4-encapsulated rGO spontaneously assembled on Ni foam exhibiting a highly porous flower-like morphology. Co3S4@rGO/Ni foam was characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to investigate the energy storage performance of Co3S4@rGO/Ni foam, which demonstrated high areal capacitance (12.17 F cm−2 at 10 mA cm−2) and ultra-long cycling life (98.9% capacitance retention after 5000 GCD cycles). The asymmetric supercapacitor device assembled with Co3S4@rGO/Ni foam and activated carbon (AC) as positive and negative electrodes may provide a high energy density of 6.18 W h m−2 at power density of 37.3 W m−2.
