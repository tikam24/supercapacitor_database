In this research work, we report a novel method for developing ternary NiCo2O4 compounds using deep eutectic solvents (DESs) and a strategy for improving their pseudocapacitive performance. NiCo2O4 composites with N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) were fabricated on Ni foam using a hydrothermal method. The electrochemical performance of the NiCo2O4 was altered with the change in the reaction temperature. The composite of NiCo2O4 and NCNTs demonstrated a maximum value of specific capacity of 303 mAh g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The specific capacity for the composite compound was 1.3-fold greater than that of the pristine NiCo2O4 sample. For practical applications, we constructed a flexible solid-state hybrid supercapacitor comprised of NiCo2O4/NCNTs//activated carbon (AC) cells with an excellent energy density of 12.31 Wh kg−1, outstanding power density of 8.96 kW kg−1, and tremendous electrode stability. The three-dimensional mesoporous nanoflowers and nanotubes-like nanostructures of NiCo2O4 are well-suited for use in hybrid devices as well as convenient for flexible electronic devices.
