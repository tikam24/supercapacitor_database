Magnetic functional graphene oxide (MFGO) has been synthesized in this work using FeCl4 âˆ’ magnetic anion paired with 1-methyl imidazolium cation. Hybrid poly ortho aminophenol (POAP)/MFGO films have then been prepared via POAP electropolymerization in the presence of MFGO nanosheets, serving as active electrodes for electrochemical supercapacitors. The FeCl4 - functional group in MFGO plays a major part in atomic scale charge/energy transfer and consequently intramolecular electrochemical phenomena in MFGO systems, as shown by the theoretical results. POAP/MFGO composite films have been characterized by surface and electrochemical analyses. The performance of the system has been investigated by various electrochemical methods such as galvanostatic charge discharge experiments, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Novel nanocomposite compounds have been developed in this work for electrochemical redox capacitors. The advantages of these compounds include simple synthesis method, high active surface area and stability in aqueous electrolytes.
