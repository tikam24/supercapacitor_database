Energy management acknowledges a power management plan for a battery and supercapacitor-based hybrid energy storage system. The suggested control method prolongs the battery life by protecting it from high discharge currents experienced during electric vehicle (EV) acceleration. The supercapacitor provides the peak current. Since the battery is protected from excessive discharge rates during transient loads, the DC link voltage profile is maintained. Energy Management of hybrid storage system presents a battery-based Bidirectional converters for Electric vehicle charging. A solar-powered cell battery along with a bidirectional DC-DC converter. A Battery is accommodated supply capacity to the external energy source. The dual-purpose DC-DC converter can be used to both charge and discharge the battery. Supercapacitors can store excess energy by advancing both bearings at the same time. The model's results were analyzed and examined using MATLAB/Simulink software.
