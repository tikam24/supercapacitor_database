The porous carbon microtubes/flakes composites are prepared via a facile hydrothermal treatment with bamboo chopsticks as a carbon precursor and KOH as an activating agent. The as-prepared samples possess the large specific surface area up to 2337 m2 g−1. They exhibit the high specific capacitance of 212 F g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1, and the capacitance retention remains 96% after 1000 cycles in 6 M KOH. The results indicate that the natural resource of bamboo chopsticks could be an essential raw material for the energy storage devices.
