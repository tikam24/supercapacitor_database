The process of disposing discarded tyre is considered as a significant environmental and economic concern. As a result, many recycling technologies have been investigated to account for their re–use. Pyrolysis is considered to be most hopeful of all these methods. Pyrolysis is the process of a waste tyre being thermally degraded at a high temperature. The value–added products of the pyrolysis process include tyre pyrolysis oil (TPO), pyrochar, and pyrogas etc. TPO corresponds to an alternative fuel for engines as well as a starting material for producing of benzene, toluene, xylene, and limonene. In process of producing carbon nanotubes (CNTs), TPO is used as a precursor. Transformation of porous carbon structure from pyrochar is utilized for absorption and energy storage in batteries and supercapacitors. Pyrogas acts as a source of hydrogen and also may be utilized as an industrial fuel. Pyrolysis may be used to turn the waste tyre into useful materials in this fashion. In this review, we collectively addressed the recent developments of the waste tyre disposal and their by–products.
