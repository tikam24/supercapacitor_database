In this paper, a fast reaching law based integral terminal sliding mode controller has been designed for photovoltaic based DC microgrid system. The proposed microgrid system comprised of photovoltaic system as main energy source and fuel cell, battery and supercapacitor as auxiliary energy sources. To avoid the stress on individual energy sources, an energy management system has been devised to allocate the load among these energy sources. Using the Lyapunov stability criteria, the stability of proposed framework has been validated. The performance of the proposed controller has been verified by simulating the dc microgrid under varying environmental conditions and load demands in MATLAB/Simulink platform. The comparison of the proposed control laws against PID and lyapunov controllers has been provided in order to assess its accuracy and robustness. The hardware-in-loop experiments have been performed to verify the real-time efficacy of the proposed microgrid system.
