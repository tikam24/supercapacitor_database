Supercapacitors or EDLCs (i.e. electric double-layer capacitors) or ultra-capacitors are becoming increasingly popular as alternatives for the conventional and traditional battery sources. This brief overview focuses on the different types of supercapacitors, the relevant quantitative modeling areas and the future of supercapacitor research and development. Super capacitors may emerge as the solution for many application-specific power systems. A capacitor was known as a condenser in the past. It is essentially an assembly of two parallel conductors with an insulator sandwiched between them. It holds electric charge when a potential is applied across its terminals. The supercapacitors as discussed in this paper are useful in applications where lithium ion and electrochemical batteries are not suited. Some of the interesting properties of super capacitors are short charging time, high cycling stability and long shelf life.
