In order to study the influence of the size of electrolyte ions on the electrochemical performance of supercapacitor electrolyte, two kinds of electrolytes, N, N-dimethylpyrrolidinium tetrafluoroborate P11-BF4), N-ethyl-Nmethylpyrrolidinium tetrafluoroborate (P12-BF4), are synthesized. The electrolyte salts were arranged into propy. lene carbonate (PC) with the concentration of 1 mol/L. The influence of the size of electrolyte ion on the electro. chemical performance of activated carbon based supercapacitors were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, constant current charge-discharge and AC impedance spectroscopy. The results show that both the electrolyte ion size and cation symmetry affect the discharge specific capacitance of the supercapacitors. The smaller the electrolyte ion size is, the better the voltage withstanding characteristic of the electrolyte is, and the higher the working voltage of the supercapacitor is. The size of the electrolyte ion and the symmetry of the cation affect the electrochemical performance of the supercapacitors.
