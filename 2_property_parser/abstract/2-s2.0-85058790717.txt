To control a smart grid in stationary application or in an embedded application such as electric vehicles, it is needful to comprehend behavior and modelling of the energy storage devices. In this article a simple electrical model for describing charging process of a supercapacitor for usage in electric vehicles applications is depict. Three scenarios with three equivalent scheme are proposed. The studied models are realized in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. The models and the simulation results of the supercapacitor are compared and analyzed.
