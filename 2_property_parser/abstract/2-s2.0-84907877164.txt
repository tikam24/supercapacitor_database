In order to improve the utilization of energy and the variable torque transmission efficiency of loaders, a full series hybrid scheme is proposed based on the analysis of the working condition of a 5 t loader. A fuzzy logic control strategy regarding to this scheme is developed. By this control strategy the system required torque can be online estimated; then, taking the required torque and the SOC value of the super capacitor as the inputs, the output torques of the engine, the generator and the motor can be achieved. Results show that the SOC value of the super capacitor is stable, the engine output torque basically falls the high efficiency zone, which can save about 16.6% fuel than the conventional loaders, so this strategy can improve the fuel economy.
