Carbon anchored titanium carbonitride for supercapacitor electrode material was prepared by a direct semi-solid-sate carbonitridation method. The prepared sample is highly conductive and mesoporous (250 m 2 g −1 ), enabling fast electron transfer and ion transport. As a result, a high capacitance of 360 F g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 , and an impressive capacitance retention ratio 100Ag -1 /1 A g −1 of 53%, as well as long cyclic capability (>10,000 cycles) can be obtained in 1 M H 2 SO 4 . The thick electrode also presents a high area capacitance up to 1.77 F cm −2 . A flexible H 2 SO 4 /PVA symmetric supercapacitor was fabricated to demonstrate its practicality. Remarkably, the supercapacitor presents high-rate performance (up to 25 kW kg −1 ) and long cyclic performance (>10,000 cycles), illustrating its potential application in flexible integrated energy storage devices. This work provides a novel insight into designing and preparing carbonitride based materials for high performance supercapacitor.
