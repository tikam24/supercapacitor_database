We prepare granule Li4Ti5O12/carbon nanotube composite (LTO/CNT) using intermediate Li2TiO3 and then used as an anode of hybrid supercapacitors. The hybrid supercapacitors fabricated with LTO/CNT anode with 3 wt% CNT and activated carbon (AC) cathode deliver superior electrochemical performances. It is mainly ascribed to the reduced charge-transfer resistance and improved ionic and electronic conductivity, resulting from smooth and rapid lithium ion kinetics and electron diffusion by suppression of particle growth and aggregation. Moreover, elastic properties of CNT can alleviate the volume change of LTO during charge-discharge process, resulting in excellent cycle performance. The performance improvement such as discharge capacitance, rate capability, and cyclability as well as energy and power density demonstrate that 3 wt% CNT addition in LTO anode appeal for high performance hybrid supercapacitors.
