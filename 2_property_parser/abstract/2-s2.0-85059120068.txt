Ultrcapacitor (UC) or Supercapacitor(SC) is gaining popularity owing to large values of capacitance, high power density, high energy density and fast charging. UC has found applications in many industries as a reliable energy storage device. This paper is aimed at presenting the charging characteristics of UC when charged using PWM technique.Other methods of charging UC, like constant voltage and constant charging method, pose certain limitations and increase the charging time. A comparison is drawn when UC is charged using constant current charging method and PWM technique. The proposed method facilitates relatively faster charging of UC in a controlled manner.
