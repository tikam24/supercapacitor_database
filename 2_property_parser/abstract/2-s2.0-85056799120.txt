Void-bearing electrodes composed of commercial microporous activated carbon were prepared for electric double-layer capacitors by using ammonium hydrogen carbonate to form void spaces between the carbon particles. The N2 adsorption isotherm showed that the introduction of void spaces increases the BET surface area and decreases the external surface area of the film electrodes. Additionally, although their volumetric capacitance was reduced as a result of lower electrode density, the void-bearing electrodes demonstrated superior rate capability owing to their lower diffusion resistance of ions. However, their lifetime performance was slightly worse than that of standard activated carbon electrodes. Moreover, gas evolution was mildly suppressed, but micropore blockage was promoted. The results indicate that solid deposition occurred around the micropores, which thus led to pore blockage, and that gaseous products were mainly generated on the external surface of the electrodes.
