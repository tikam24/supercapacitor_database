Solid-state flexible micro supercapacitors based on porous and conducting polymer nanofibers via the direct-write, near-field electrospinning process have been constructed. Testing results have shown a capacitance of 0.3mF/cm2, 30X larger as compared with those of flat electrodes. Key innovations of this work include: (1) densely-packed, porous 3D nanostructures with conductive nanofibers via the near-field electrospinning process; (2) flexible solid-state micro electrodes with high energy density using the pseudocapacitive effect; and (3) simple yet versatile manufacturing process compatible with various substrates and surfaces. As such, this technology is readily available to make practical MEMS energy storage devices.
