Clean energy innovations are currently gaining huge attention because of fossil fuel exhaustion and increased global warming. Among the various technologies for converting electricity to other forms of energy, electrochemical energy storage technology is widely used, which includes the battery, supercapacitor and their hybrids, and fuel cells. Due to the long cycle life, high power density, more reliability and performance, and less maintenance needed, supercapacitors are favorable among different energy storage devices. Supercapacitor technology is evolving by exploring new materials and concepts. Transition metal oxides are versatile materials with many advantages such as natural abundance, low cost, and negligible toxicity toward living organisms. Tungsten oxide has gained large interest in the field of electrochemical applications due to its wide negative potential window so that it can be used as a negative electrode for device fabrication. So, here we focus on the recent development of WO3 nanostructures as electrode material for supercapacitor applications. To enhance the conductivity of tungsten trioxide, many researchers have also developed the composites of WO3 with different carbon materials and other transition metal oxides. So this article presents the development of pristine WO3 as well as their composites to provide insights into the rapidly growing field of energy storage that may inspire additional research.
