A polymer nanocomposite shows a distinctive physicochemical property that cannot be acquired by performing on individual components alone. The polymer nanocomposite has an important research interest due to its optimistic capability for functional applications in many fields. Specifically, polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) have attracted important research attention for solving energy and environmental problems. In the present work, poly-vinyl pyrrolidone (PVP)/polyethylene oxide (PEO)/α-Fe2O3 is one of the excellent electrode materials for supercapacitors by reason of its low cost. The device was assembled by using PVP/PEO and PVP/PEO/x wt.% of α-Fe2O3 polymer nanocomposite as the cathode and activated carbon as the anode. The optimized PVP/PEO/Fe2O3 composites are bendable electrode materials that show a high specific capacitance of 76.22 mF cm−2 at a current density of 1 A cm−2, express a high-power density of 318.18 W Kg−1 at an energy density of 3.77 Wh kg−1, and have an everlasting performance. This work shows an immense approach of ASC devices to fabricating flexible polymer nanocomposites for high-performance supercapacitor applications. This simple fabrication method helps us to understand and develop a flexible hybrid supercapacitor application. Flexible solid-state asymmetrical supercapacitors bring about a working potential of 1.8 V and attain an outstanding specific capacitance and energy density.
