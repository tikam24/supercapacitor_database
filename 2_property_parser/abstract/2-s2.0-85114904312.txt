Hybrid materials were preparedviathe controlled fumigation-based polymerization of pyrrole on the surface of activated carbon derived from carbon dots, combining the stability of carbon materials, the wettability of carbon dots, and the high pseudocapacitance of polypyrrole; all of these synergistically boosted the electrochemical performance, resulting in a high specific capacitance (481 F gâˆ’1) and good stability for supercapacitor applications.
