Modern factories are increasingly using automated guided vehicles (AGV) or mobile robots for transport. To increase their run-time, most of them now have energy recovery systems that feed the kinetic energy of the braking process back into the storage system. In most cases, the storage system is a Li-ion battery, which is thus subjected to increased stress. To cope with this issue, Super-Capacitors can be used in combination with batteries. In this paper, the standard battery solutions will be compared with the combined Super-Capacitor and battery solutions. A recommendation for the use of the different topologies based on general system characteristics is provided.
