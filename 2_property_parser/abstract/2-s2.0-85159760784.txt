In recent years, researchers continue optimizing and innovating in the selection of supercapacitor electrode materials and fabrication processes. In this paper, the fabrication process and electrochemical performance of an all-solid-state planar on-chip micro-supercapacitors (POMSs) with nitrogen and oxygen co-doped graphene quantum dots as electrode material will be demonstrated. Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) electrode films were prepared by a modified liquid-air interface self-assembly method, and patterned by photolithography. The resulting POMSs achieved an area capacitance of 25.53 μFcm−2, and its areal energy density and areal power density are 3.55nWh cm−2 and 8.79 μW cm−2 correspondingly. It is worth noting that the POMSs have excellent rate capability and can maintain outstanding performance at ultrahigh scan rate of 10000 V s−1. The POMSs have a short time constant which is 3.16 μs, and the capacitance characteristics can be maintained over 99.1% in 10000 cycles of charge and discharge at a scan rate of 5000 V s−1 in the cyclic stability test.
