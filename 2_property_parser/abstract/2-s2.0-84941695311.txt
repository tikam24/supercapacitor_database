This paper analyses the possibility to use different sources of energy in the hybrid power systems. Storage technologies with supercapacitors, flywheels are those that technically better adapt to smooth the power fluctuations of wind turbines. This is mainly because these technologies have quick responses time, higher electrical efficiencies and greater lifetimes. Technologies of solar modules, wind power plants, flywheels, supercapacitors and fuel cells are investigated in the work.
