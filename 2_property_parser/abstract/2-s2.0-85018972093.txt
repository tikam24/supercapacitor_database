Although Nickel-Cadmium (NiCd) and Nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries have been widely used, their drawbacks including toxic Cd and expensive La alloy at the negative electrodes, low energy density (40-60 Wh/kg for NiCd and 140-300 Wh/L for NiMH), low power density (150 W/kg for NiCd and 1000 W/kg for NiMH), and low working potential (1.2 V) limit their applications. In this work, Cd and La alloy were replaced with N-doped reduced graphene oxide aerogel (N-rGOae) providing a hybrid energy storage (HES) having the battery and supercapacitor effects. The HES of Ni(OH)2-coated N-rGOae//N-rGOae provides 1.5 V, a specific energy of 146 Wh/kg, a maximum specific power of 7705 W/kg, and high capacity retention over 84.6% after 5000 cycles. The mass change at the positive electrode during charging/discharging is 8.5 μg cm-2 owing to the insertion/desertion of solvated OH- into the α-Ni(OH)2-coated N-rGOae. At the negative electrode, the mass change of the solvated K+, physically adsorbed/desorbed to the N-rGOae, is 7.5 μg cm-2. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) shows highly reversible redox reaction of α-Ni(OH)2. The as-fabricated device without using toxic Cd and expensive La alloy has a potential as a candidate of NiCd and NiMH.
