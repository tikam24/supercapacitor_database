On-chip micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) have attracted great attention recently. However, the performance of MSCs is usually unsatisfactory because of the unreasonable pore structure. The construction of a three-dimensional (3D) interconnected porous carbon-based MSC by controllable activation is proposed. The porous monolithic carbon microelectrode activated by ZnO nanowires provides electron/ion bicontinuous conduction path. The fabricated MSC with this microelectrode rendered a high areal specific capacitance of 10.01 mF cm -2 , 6 times higher than that of pure pyrolyzed carbon-based MSC, 1.6-5 times higher than that of the MSC with porous carbon activated by ZnO nanoparticles because of its cross-linking macropore-mesopore-micropore structure and considerable areal atomic ratio. The optimization mechanism of the hierarchical channel pore for the electrochemical performance of MSCs is investigated in detail. Four kinds of electrolytes, including H 2 SO 4 , redox additive KI/H 2 SO 4 , LiCl, and LiTFSi, are employed for constructing MSCs. The voltage window of water in a salt electrolyte assembled LiTFSi-MSC is expanded to 2.5 V. The energy density of LiTFSi-MSC is 6 times higher than that of H 2 SO 4 -MSC, which can drive light-emitting diodes without serial or parallel connection. This high-performance 3D interconnected porous carbon-based MSC shows a great potential in applications for large-scale integration of micro-/nanodevices.
