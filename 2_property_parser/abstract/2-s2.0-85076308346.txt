In the original published article (J. Electroanal. Chem. 851 (2019) 113482) inadvertently we put a different plot in Fig. 5f (Variation of specific capacitances as a function of mass specific current for the PANI and the three different NFP composites electrodes), which is not matching with the values written in the manuscript. With this corrigendum we provide the correct image (Fig. 5f: Variation of specific capacitances as a function of mass specific current for the PANI and the three different NFP composites electrodes). This change does not alter any of the results or conclusions shown in the paper. In addition, There are two corresponding authors for the manuscript, Sanna Kotrappanavar Nataraj* and Debasis Ghosh*. Although the email id for both the corresponding authors are there, the star mark for corresponding author behind Sanna Kotrappanavar Nataraj is missing in the published article. [Figure presented]
