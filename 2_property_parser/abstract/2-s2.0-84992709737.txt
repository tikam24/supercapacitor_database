Supercapacitor has been successfully fabricated using TiO2-Carbon with Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) activation on ceramics template. Synthesis of TiO2 sol was conducted by using Sol-gel method. Ceramic membrane as a growth template of TiO2-C which is activated with NaOH was prepared as a supercapacitor electrode materials. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is used as a separator and phosphoric acid (H3PO4) as an electrolyte. NaOH activation on the supercapacitor electrode had increased the capacitance value both at the combustion temperature of 250°C and 300°C. Based on EDX (Energy Dispersive X-Ray) reported that the greatest amount of carbon found in the activated electrode at a combustion temperature of 300°C is 60.67%, which provides the highest capacitance value that is 14 540 nF with H3PO4 electrolyte concentration of 0.5 M and the charging time for 30 minutes with a conductivity value of 45.4x10-5 S cm-1.
