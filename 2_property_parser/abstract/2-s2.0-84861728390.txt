The paper presents electrical and mechanical properties of structural supercapacitors and discusses limitations associated with the approach taken for the electrical properties evaluation. The structural supercapacitors characterized in this work had the electrodes made of carbon fiber weave, separator made of several cellulose based products, and the solid electrolyte made as PEGDGE based polymer blend. The reported electrical properties include capacitance and leakage resistance; the former was measured using cyclic voltammetry. Mechanical properties have been evaluated thorough tensile and three point bending tests performed on structural supercapacitor coupons. The results indicate that the separator material plays an important role on the electrical as well as mechanical properties of the structural capacitor, and that Celgard 3501 used as separator leads to most benefits for both mechanical and electrical properties. Specific capacitance and leakage resistance as high as 1.4kF/m 3 and 380kΩ, respectively, were achieved. Two types of solid polymer electrolytes were used in fabrication, with one leading to higher and more consistent leakage resistance values at the expense of a slight decrease in specific capacitance when compared to the other SPE formulation. The ultimate tensile strength and modulus of elasticity of the developed power storage composite were evaluated at 466MPa and 18.9MPa, respectively. These values are 58% and 69% of the tensile strength and modulus of elasticity values measured for a single layer composite material made with the same type of carbon fiber and with a West System 105 epoxy instead of solid polymer electrolyte. © 2012 SPIE.
