A simple oxidative polymerization approach has been used to synthesize MoO3/PANI hybrid composite for energy conversion and storage application. In this carbon-free energy conversion process, as-developed electrocatalyst (MoO3/PANI hybrid composite) has significantly improved the molecular hydrogen generation via electro-reduction of protons. The hydrogen evolution kinetics parameters, overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 is ∼110 mV and Tafel slope 132 mV/dec have been obtained for the as-developed catalyst which suggests the reaction is controlled by Volmer-limited reaction step. Further the as-developed material has been tested for energy storage application and exhibited specific capacitance of 680 F. g−1.
