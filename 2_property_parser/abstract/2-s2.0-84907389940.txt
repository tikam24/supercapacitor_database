This paper presents a supercapacitor module connected in parallel with fuel cell system to supply a highperformance Z-Source Inverter (ZSI) feeding a three phase induction motor for hybrid electric vehicle applications. The supercapacitor is connected between the input diode and the bidirectional switch of the high-performance ZSI topology. The indirect field-oriented control (IFOC) method is used to control the induction motor speed during motoring and regenerative braking operations to produce the modulation index and a dual loop controller is used to control the Znetwork capacitor voltage to produce the shoot-through duty ratio. MATLAB simulation results, for a 15 kW induction motor fed by a high performance ZSI, verified the validity of the proposed control strategy during motoring and regenerative braking operations.
