Aiming to find suitable electrolytes for electric double layer capacitor (EDLC), the relationship between the formation velocity of electric double layer and the specific capacitance in different electrolyte (H 2SO 4, KOH, KCl, NH 4Cl, and LiOH) solutions was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and AC impedance with varying frequency and potential, which was also analyzed based on Stern model and Gouy-Chapman diffusion layer model. It shows that the capacitance is positively correlated with the formation velocity of the electric double layers, which is affected by the type of ions applied, the concentration of the electrolyte solution, and the potential and frequencies as well. The electrolyte solutions of 6 mol/L KOH and 4 mol/L H 2SO 4 provide the largest capacitance, reaching 214 and 186 F/cm 2, respectively. Both 6 mol/L KOH and 4 mol/L H 2SO 4 solutions are suitable electrolytes for EDLC applications using Pt as electrodes. Â© 2012 Wuhan University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
