Graphene has recently attracted a wide range of research interests due to its rigorous two-dimensional structure and extraordinary electrical, thermal and mechanical properties. As a conductive agent, an activated carbon supercapacitor can obtain better performance. This paper summarizes the latest research progress, mainly from two aspects: (1) the preparation of an activated carbon base for a supercapacitor based on waste sugar solution and the relationship between pore structure and activation parameters, and (2) the application of the two-dimensional materials graphene and its composite materials in electric double-layer capacitors, graphene–polymer composite tantalum capacitors, graphene–transition metal oxide composite tantalum capacitors, and asymmetric super capacitors. The studies found that graphene and its composite materials have obvious advantages in improving the cycle efficiency, conversion rate, and energy density of supercapacitors, the overall energy efficiency of mechanical systems, and the chemical properties of nanoelectronics. Therefore, it is urgent to summarize these works in order to promote the next development. Graphene is expected to be effectively and environmentally quantified in the near future, and its application in supercapacitors will be further expanded and matured.
