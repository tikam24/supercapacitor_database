Hierarchical porous nickel based metal-organic framework (Ni-MOF) constructed with nanosheets is fabricated by a facile hydrothermal process with the existence of trimesic acid and nickel ions. Various structures of Ni-MOFs can be obtained through adjusting the molar ratio of trimesic acid and nickel ion, the obtained hierarchical porous Ni-MOF exhibits optimal porous structure, which also possesses largest specific surface area. The hierarchical porous structure constructed with nanosheets can supply more active sites for electrochemical reactions to realize the excellent electrochemical properties, thus the hierarchical porous Ni-MOF reveals an outstanding specific capacitance of 1057 F/g at current density of 1 A/g, and delivers high specific capacitance of 649 F/g at current density of 30 A/g, indicating that it exhibits good rate capability of 63.4% even up to 30 A/g. The hierarchical porous Ni-MOF keeps 70% of its original value up to 2 500 charge-discharge cycles at the current density of 10 A/g. Furthermore, asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) were assembled based on hierarchical porous Ni-MOF and activated carbon (AC), the ASCs reveal specific capacitance of 87 F/g at current density of 0.5 A/g, and exhibit high energy density of 21.05 Wh/kg and power density of 6.03 kW/kg. Additionally, the tandem ASCs can light up a red LED. The hierarchical porous Ni-MOF exhibits promising applications in high performance supercapacitors.
