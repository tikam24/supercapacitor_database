In this work, series of manganese selenide (MnSe) and graphene oxide (GO) nanocomposites are prepared via a well-known hydrothermal route to investigate the impact of varying content of GO (5, 10, 15, and 20%) on the electrochemical properties of MnSe-GO composites. Phase and structural investigations of the as-prepared samples were carried out by using XRD. SEM analysis showed the successful formation of flakes-like morphology of MnSe wrapped on GO sheets, providing a conductive pathway for transmission of electrolyte ions. When tested thoroughly for supercapacitor electrodes in a three-electrode configuration, all electrodes revealed a pair of redox peaks originating from Mn2+/Mn3+ due to faradaic redox reactions owing to their pseudocapacitive behavior. Amongst all samples, the optimum electrochemical performance was achieved with the aid of 5% GO composite with MnSe, which exhibited a capacitance of 180 F g−1 with the lowest charge transfer resistance. For practical aspects, we designed and fabricated an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC), which delivered a capacitance of 56.25 F g−1, an energy density of 31.25 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 6779.20 W kg−1. Remarkably, our fabricated ASC made of MnSe-GO//AC displayed an outstanding cycling performance with its initial capacitance retention of 86.3% when tested for 5000 successive charge-discharge cycles. Thus, based on the comparative results of MnSe based GO composites for energy storage, the performance of the MnSe nanomaterial can be further enhanced by using different carbon-based nanomaterials, a promosing approach to fabricate materials for future energy conversion and storage devices.
