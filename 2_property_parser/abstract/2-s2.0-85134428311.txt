Developing flexible device with high energy density and long cycle stability remains still a challenge for energy storage. At the same time, single-component metal oxides suffer from poor working stability and slow ionic electron mobility. In order to address these issues and meet fast increasing demand for alternative energy, high efficient energy storage devices are required. Herein, ultrafine NiO/MnO2/PPy nanoarrays are designed and prepared through a simple chemical reaction. The as-prepared samples are utilized as electrode materials and exhibit an excellent electrochemical performance. In addition, Due to their unique structural characteristics, it shows high specific capacitance (1100 C g−1 at 1 A g−1) and capacitance retention of 82.79 % after 10,000 cycles. Furthermore, quasi-solid-state asymmetric device is assembled and delivers an energy density of 49.8 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 856 W kg−1. This work provides the design method of ultrafine nanoarrays with an excellent electrochemical property for next energy storage fields.
