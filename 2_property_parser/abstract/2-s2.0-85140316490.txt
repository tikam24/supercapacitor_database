Bioinspired nanohybrids offer promising electrode materials for energy storage applications. In this study, we have synthesized nanohybrid materials on carbon paper (CP) using the galvanostatic electrodeposition method to achieve the best combination of metal salts with a small organic moiety. The fabricated nanohybrids exhibit better energy storage properties. Among various nanohybrids, BSeYW/NCDH [BSe = benzo[2,1,3]selenadiazole, Y = l-Tyrosine, and W = l-Tryptophan; NCDH = nickel-cobalt dual hydroxides (2:2)] exhibits a high specific capacitance of 1734 F g-1at 2 A g-1and cyclic stability with 86.18% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles at 25 A g-1. Furthermore, the solid-state symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) device has been assembled by exploiting two binder-free BSeYW/NCDH(2:2) hybrid electrodes for practical applications. The SSC device has been electrochemically analyzed by cyclic voltammetry at different scan rates and potential windows. The galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) has been performed to investigate the capacitive behavior and cyclic stability. The fabricated SSCs deliver a maximum energy density of 18.27 W h/kg at a power density of 571.97 W/kg. In addition, the SSC device retains 85.25% at 7 A g-1even after 5000 GCD cycles. Additionally, two assembled devices connected in series can operate a small fan and illuminate an LED. So, the electrochemical properties of BSeYW/NCDH nanomaterials could be used for the development of high-performance energy storage materials and devices.
