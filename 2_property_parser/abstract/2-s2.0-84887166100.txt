Manganese oxide is one of the most attractive inorganic materials because of its structural flexibility and wide applications in catalysis, ion exchange, electrochemical supercapacitors, molecular adsorption, biosensors, and so on. In recently, manganese oxides nanomaterials, including MnO, MnO2 and Mn3O4, have attracted great interest as anode materials in lithium-ion batteries and water treatment due to their high theoretical capacity, environmental benignity, low cost, and special properties. Hence, manganese oxides nanostructures with excellent properties and various morphologies have been successfully synthesized. Herein, we provide a recent development of the synthesis of manganese oxides nanomaterials and their application. Â© (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
