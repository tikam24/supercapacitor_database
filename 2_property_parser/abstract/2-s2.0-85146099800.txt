Metal-organic frameworks with high specific surface area and controlled morphology have great potential for lithium-ion battery applications. Here, the ZIF-67 precursor was prepared by the room temperature stirring method. Then Co3O4/NC composite electrodes with hollow polyhedral structure were successfully prepared by a two-step calcination method, and their electrochemical properties were discussed. The specific capacitance of Co3O4/NC at a current density of 1 A g−1 is 1144F g−1 (much higher than the specific capacitance of pure Co3O4), and the retention rate is 45.4 % under a 20 A g−1 of current density. In addition, the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device consisting of Co3O4/NC composite electrodes and activated carbon produced the highest energy density of 40 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 1037 W kg−1. At a current density of 5 A g−1, the capacitor retains 87.6 % of its initial capacitance after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles.
