Smart devices based on paper-based composite materials are attracting increasing attention for applications in wearable and flexible energy storage and strain sensors, due to their outstanding flexibility and light weight properties. Although the paper materials are modified by various methods to overcome the shortcomings of poor conductivity and obtain various smart properties, the functionalized paper-based materials generally have poor swelling, mechanical strength and cycle stability in the electrochemical process, which seriously affects the application of paper-based devices in energy storage. Herein, for the first time a new class of symmetrical integrated smart paper-based supercapacitors with binder-free was fabricated by incorporating vitrimer (V) into original paper with pencil-drawing (OPD) loading polyaniline nanofibers (PN). The resultant OPD@PN-V supercapacitor show high gravimetric and areal specific energy density of 56 Wh kg−1 and 785 μWh cm−2 and simultaneously maintains high gravimetric and areal specific power density of 78 kW kg−1 and 286 mW cm−2, substantially surpassing the performance of conventional supercapacitors device with separator. More importantly, the introduction of vitrimer greatly enhances the cycle stability of the supercapacitor, and the supercapacitor also displays good reshaping, shape-memory and self-healing properties, which greatly broadens the application scenarios of supercapacitors. Besides, the OPD@PN-V device also shows a great potential in detecting the movement of human.
