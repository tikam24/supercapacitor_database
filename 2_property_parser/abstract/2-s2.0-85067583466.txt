Flexible supercapacitors with high power densities and durability have shown enormous potential for use in portable electronics. In this study, we developed a high-performance supercapacitor by building a three-dimensional (3D) reduced graphene oxide (rGO) structure on a CNT-Fe3O4-PANI film. The porous rGO structure with a large surface area endows rGO-CNT-Fe3O4-PANI electrodes with excellent electrochemical properties, such as a specific capacitance of 414.5 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. Moreover, a symmetric supercapacitor device with rGO-CNT-Fe3O4-PANI electrodes demonstrated a remarkable cell performance, with an energy density of 60.8 Wh kg−1, a power density of 45.2 kW kg−1 and an excellent cycle life, indicating that the rGO-CNT-Fe3O4-PANI composite is a promising and novel energy storage electrode that can be used for fast and efficient energy storage.
