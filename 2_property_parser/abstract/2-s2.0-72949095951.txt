This paper presents a supercapacitor-based dynamic support system for hybrid microgrids that guarantees the safe transition between operation modes (parallel / stand alone) and the correct dynamic power balance in stand-alone mode. The paper describes the design and development of the hardware and software components of a microgrid support system that has been implemented as a 7.8kW single phase prototype connected to a 125V-100Wh supercapacitor bank. The prototipe has been experimentally tested confirming the good performances observed in the preliminary simulation studies.
