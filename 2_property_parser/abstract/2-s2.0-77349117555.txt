Stable aqueous dispersions of polymer-modified graphene sheets were prepared via in situ reduction of exfoliated graphite oxides in the presence of cationic poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI). The resultant water-soluble PEI-modified graphene sheets were then used for sequential self-assembly with acid-oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes, forming hybrid carbon films. These hybrid films were demonstrated to possess an interconnected network of carbon structures with well-defined nanopores to be promising for supercapacitor electrodes, exhibiting a nearly rectangular cyclic voltammogram even at an exceedingly high scan rate of 1 V/s with an average specific capacitance of 120 F/g.
