Adopting filter paper as precursor, combined with a facile carbonization and activation process at a relative low temperature of 650°C, a regular and hierarchical porous carbon electrode materials are obtained to assemble high performance supercapacitor. The PFPC40 supercapacitor exhibits a high specific capacitance of 219.6 F∙g−1 and 173.0 F∙g−1 at 1 A∙g−1 and 50 A∙g−1, respectively, indicating an excellent rate capability of 78.8%. In addition, the capacitance retention of PFPC40 supercapacitor reaches 99.0% after ten thousand charge-discharge cycles at 5 A∙g−1, demonstrating excellent cycling stability. Furthermore, the PFPC40750 sample possesses a high specific surface area (SSA) of 1920 m2∙g−1, and the good electrochemical performance is similar to that of PFPC40. Therefore, this work provides a new strategy for the preparation of hierarchical porous carbon electrode material and this material is promising to applied in energy storage device.
