Recently, a new type of 2D transition metal carbides or nitrides (MXene) has attracted wide attention due to its large specific surface area, good hydrophilicity, metallic conductivity and other physical and chemical properties. 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene was obtained by etching Al layer of Ti3AlC2 with LiF and HCl and then mechanically delaminated. And the monolayer Ti3C2Tx nanosheets with lateral dimension of 625 and 2562 nm can be prepared by changing the intensity and way of mechanically delamination, as well as the centrifugation rate and time. Then their morphology, structure, composition, and electrochemical performance of Ti3C2Tx were studied. The results showed that the specific capacitance of Ti3C2Tx with smaller lateral size (<1 Î¼m) can reach 561.9 F/g, higher than that of reported graphene, carbon tube and MnO2 in the repotted literatures. And the Ti3C2Tx electrode still remained 96% of the initial specific capacitance after 104 testing cycles.
