Poor electronic conductivity is one of the main obstacles that limit the supercapacitive performance of α-Fe2O3. Herein, we report an ultrathin graphene layer activation strategy for significantly boosting the electrochemical performance of electrode materials. The α-Fe2O3@C still retains the α-Fe2O3 original dendritic architectural structure, which can provide a more effective contact between electrode and electrolyte ions. Meanwhile, the graphene layer simultaneously improves Li+ diffusion and electronic conductivity, thus leading to a greatly enhanced electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance of 443.2 F g−1, which is almost double the capacitance of α-Fe2O3 without the graphene layer. More importantly, the resultant graphene layer greatly increases the stability of dendritic α-Fe2O3 in electrochemical cycle testing. The asymmetric supercapacitor based on a CNT-COOH anode and graphene layer-activated dendritic α-Fe2O3 cathode can achieve a high energy density of 77 W h Kg−1 at a power density of 1380 W kg−1. Our work provides a simple, novel and effective strategy to significantly enhance the electrochemical performance of α-Fe2O3.
