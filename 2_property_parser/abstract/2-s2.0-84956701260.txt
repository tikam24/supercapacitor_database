In the present work, spherical α-MnO2 with a high specific capacitance was synthesized by a twostep hydrothermal route. MnCO3 precursors were first prepared by a common hydrothermalmethod, and then converted to α-MnO2 via a hydrothermal reaction between the precursors and KMnO4 solutions. The effects of hydrothermal temperature on the morphology, crystal structure and specific area of the MnO2 were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and BET measurements. The electrochemical capacitive properties of the manganese dioxides with different morphologies and structures were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and galvonostatic charge-discharge tests. The results showed that the temperature in the second hydrothermal step had prominent impact on the capacitive properties of α-MnO2. The MnO2 synthesized at 150 °C exhibited a highest specific capacitance of 328.4 F · g-1 at a charge-discharge current density of 100 mA·g-1.
