Hollow micro-/nanostructures and oxygen vacancies are highly desirable for supercapacitors due to high active surface area and outstanding electrochemical properties. In order to benefiting from the both effect, binder-free oxygen-vacancies NiCo 2 O 4 based films with hollow microspheres were pioneering directly deposited via one kind thermal spray technology, named solution precursor thermal spray (SPTS) process. To our best knowledge, the rapid one-step SPTS route was firstly employed to synthesize and deposit NiCo 2 O 4 films for supercapacitor applications. The CV data clearly demonstrated that the specific capacitances of more oxygen-deficient NiCo 2 O 4 electrodes with hollow microspheres (i.e. F12) are significant higher than that of NiCo 2 O 4 films composed by solid particles (i.e. P12) with less oxygen vacancies, exhibiting a rapid increment of about 20 times. The oxygen-vacancies NiCo 2 O 4 film composed of hollow spheres possesses large specific capacitance of 902 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g with a good capacitance retention of 89.2% after 2500 cycles under 20 mV/s scan rate and a quite small resistance. Furthermore, this work pointed out that the Solution Precursor Thermal Spray (SPTS) route with high-interest for depositing other binder-free metal oxides based films as electrodes for other energy storage applications, benefiting from suitable surface morphologies and in-situ introduced oxygen vacancies as well.
