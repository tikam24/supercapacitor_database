Increasing demand for electronic devices has sparked quantum of research work on energy storage systems. In the present work, we report the facile synthesis of platelet-like Zirconium tungstate (ZrW2O8 NPs) binary metal oxide via co-precipitation method. The ZrW2O8 NPs was confirmed by several physicochemical techniques. Furthermore, FESEM images proved the platelet-like morphology of ZrW2O8 NPs. The as-prepared ZrW2O8 NPs was used as electrode material in the fabrication of supercapacitors. ZrW2O8 NPs @ Ni foil shows the specific capacitance (Csp) maximum of 508 F g−1 at 5 mV/s and showed 91.3% of cyclic stability after 4000 GCD cycles. As a result, ZrW2O8 NPs was utilized as an anode electrode material to construct an asymmetric device, ZrW2O8 NPs || Activated carbon (AC). The as-fabricated device showed the energy density of 9.65 Wh kg−1 related to the power density of 299.48 W kg−1. The effective supercapacitive behavior might be due to the unique morphological features, occurrence of multiple redox sites, and enhanced electrical conductivity of ZrW2O8 NPs. Thus, all these findings account for the applicability of ZrW2O8 NPs as electrode material in high-performance supercapacitors.
