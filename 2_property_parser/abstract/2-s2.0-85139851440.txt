In this paper, we synthesized zinc oxide (ZnO) thin film by using a cost effective chemical bath deposition technique (CBD) at 90°C. The as-deposited ZnO films exhibited polycrystalline in nature. The FESEM image shows growth of nanorods about 0.2μm length. The Raman spectrum was recorded using frequency of 532nm with excited line Nd-YAG laser. The optical band gap of ZnO thin film obtained 3.37eV. The value of RMS roughness is determined by atomic force microscopy (AFM), found to be 34nm. The supercapactive studies were determined in 2MKOH aqueous electrolyte by means of cyclic voltammetry and charge-discharge technique. ZnO exhibited maximum specific capacitance of ZnO 204F/g at the scan rate of 5mV/s.
