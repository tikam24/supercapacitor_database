This paper portrays the benefits of introducing an ultracapacitor into a battery pack of an urban electric vehicle drive train. Simulations are done taking two basic scenarios into consideration: fresh cells and half-used battery cells. The simulations show that the lower the temperature higher the hybrid system efficiency. Data from real world are considered to conduct this study. Simulations are done considering modified Bangladeshi drive cycle for low weight vehicles. Several issues like volumetric, gravimetric and cost issues of hybridization are present in this paper. By this system the power loss of the system can be reduced by up to 5% to 10%. Finally, hybridization not only increases the efficiency of the energy storage system also increases the power train efficiency and battery lifespan. This paper would help researchers for further development of this topic.
