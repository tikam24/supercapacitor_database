The electrochemical performance of porous Nickel oxide nanocrystals synthesised by the hydrothermal method is discussed here. In this porous Nickel oxide, crystal structure and morphology were investigated by XRD, FT-Raman, FE-SEM and HR-TEM. The electrochemical performance of porous Nickel oxide electrode examined by various aqueous electrolytes such as 1 M Na2SO4, 0.5 M KOH and 1 M Na2SO4 + 0.5 M KOH solution. The electrode material delivers high specific capacitance found as 200 F/g at 1 A/g using a single aqueous electrolyte 1 M Na2SO4. The porous Nickel oxide nanocrystals electrode performed the long-term good cyclic stability around 2000 cycles with 91% capacity retention. Here, 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte achieves high capacity among various electrolytes can be considered as promising electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
