Electronic conductivity of pure NiCo2S4 is limited, and fortunately, g-C3N4 has been explored in recent years for electrochemical applications with considerable potential. NiCo2S4/g-C3N4 nanocomposites, improving greatly the cycle life of supercapacitors, are synthesized via simple one-step hydrothermal method for supercapacitor electrode materials in this paper. The composite of g-C3N4 and NiCo2S4 materials can provide a good bridge for ion transport in the electrochemical reaction process, and can also provide more active sites for the electrochemical reaction due to g-C3N4 two-dimensional lamellar structure having a large specific surface area. It is demonstrated that NiCo2S4/g-C3N4 electrodes can achieve specific capacitance of 1229.9 F/g under a current density of 5 A/g and cycling life of 2000 cycles by retaining 66.24% of the energy storage capability in the paper. In general, the potential of g-C3N4 in electrochemical applications can be expanded by changing the molar composition of g-C3N4.
