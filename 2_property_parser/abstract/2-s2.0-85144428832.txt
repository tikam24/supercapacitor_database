This study aimed to assemble a high-performance electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC) using a hardwood kraft lignin (HKL)-based separator and HKL-based electrodes, which were fabricated from a nonwoven mat of electrospun HKL fibers. The separator was prepared by the thermostabilization of the mat derived from a mixed dope of HKL, hexamethylenetetramine, and polyethylene glycol (1.66/0.50/0.09, w/w) for electrospinning. Although a mat-type HKL-based electrode containing conductive carbon black (CB) has been reported to be suitable for a commercial cellulosic separator, this electrode was found to be unsuitable for the HKL-based separator because of its rough surface and poor contact with the separator interface. Hence, a powder-type electrode with a smooth surface was fabricated by grinding the mat, followed by casting with a carboxymethyl cellulose aqueous solution, and its EDLC possessed high energy (49 Wh kg-1) and power densities (151 kW kg-1). Moreover, to provide a simple process for electrode fabrication, another mat-type electrode was fabricated by adding CB to the mixed dope, followed by electrospinning, carbonization, and steam activation. The resultant EDLC exhibited excellent electrochemical performance with energy (58 Wh kg-1) and power densities (55 kW kg-1).
