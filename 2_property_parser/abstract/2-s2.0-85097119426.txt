In this work, a facile one-step electrodeposition method is developed to prepare 3D Ni3S2 interconnected nanosheet arrays on Ni foam as electrodes for suprecapacitors, resulting in excellent pseudocapacitance performance. The composition, microstructure and morphology of the prepared Ni3S2 materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The electrochemical capacitance properties were tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) measurements in a three-electrode system. Taking advantage of the highly conductive 3D architectures, the Ni3S2/NF-10 electrode exhibits a superior specific capacitance of 2850 F/g at current density of 1 A/g. Remarkably, a specific capacitance of 1972 F/g could be still achieved at a high current density of 10 A/g, indicating its excellent rate capability. With the increase of the electrodeposition time, the 3D architectures of Ni3S2 begin to disappear, resulting in a reduced specific capacitance. The appropriate electrodeposition conditions is the key of preparation of high performance electrode materials. Test results show that the prepared Ni3S2 material is expected to be used in the field of electrochemical energy storage.
