In this article, we reported the preparation of manganese molybdate (MnMoO4) nanorods by a facile sonochemical method and investigated its electrochemical properties for supercapacitor applications. The microstructure, surface morphology and composition were characterized by using field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), high resolution- transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photo electron microscopy (XPS). The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of sonochemically synthesized α-MnMoO4 nanorods revealed the presence of redox pairs suggesting the pseudocapacitive nature of MnMoO4. A maximum specific capacitance of the α-MnMoO4 nanorods was about 168.32 F g-1 as observed from the galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) analysis at a constant current density of 0.5 mA cm-2. Long term cyclic stability study revealed that about 96% of initial capacitance was retained after 2000 cycles. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
