To satisfy the high-rate power demand fluctuations in the complicated driving cycle, electric vehicle (EV) energy storage systems should have both high power density and high energy density. In order to obtain better energy and power performances, a combination of battery and supercapacitor are utilized in this work to form a semi-active hybrid energy storage system (HESS). A parameter matching method of battery-supercapacitor HESS for electric vehicles (EVs) is proposed. This method can meet the performance indicators of EVs in terms of power and energy for parameter matching. The result shows that optimized parameter matching is obtained by reducing the weight and cost.
