Vine-like polyaniline (PANI) nanostructures were prepared using electrochemical polymerization onactivated carbon nanofibers (ACNF) in order to use as a supercapacitor. Electrospun polyacrylonitrile(PAN)-based nanofibers were firstly carbonized and physically activated to increase the specific surfacearea. The PANI formed a vine-like shape and well-contacted with the surface of ACNF. The remark-ably improved electrochemical performances of PANI-deposited ACNF electrode were investigated usingcyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge test, and electrochemical impedance analy-sis. The current area of the PANI-ACNF electrode is higher than that of ACNF electrode in CV curves and thespecific capacitance of the PANI-ACNF was 832 F g-1which is much higher than 353 F g-1of ACNF at a cur-rent density of 1 A g-1in galvanostatic charge/discharge analysis. During galvanostatic charge/dischargetest of 1000 cycles at 1 A g-1, the PANI-ACNF sample keeps its specific capacitance up to the value of765 F g-1(92% retention). Also, the PANI nanostructure on the ACNF substrate achieved a rapid dop-ing/dedoping process between the surface of electrode and electrolyte ions in comparison with ACNFelectrode.
