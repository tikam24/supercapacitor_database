MnCO3 nanospheres are employed as the template to prepare MoS2 hierarchical hollow nanospheres. The synthesis procedure involves the hydrothermal growth of MoS2 ultrathin nanosheets on the surface of MnCO3 nanospheres and subsequent selectively dissolving the template by acid washing. Galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements show that the MoS2 electrode has a specific capacitance of 142 F g-1 at a current density of 0.59A g-1 and it retains 92.9% of capacitance even after 1000 cycles. These results indicate a promising potential application of hierarchical hollow MoS2 nanospheres for using as a suitable electrode material in Supercapacitors.
