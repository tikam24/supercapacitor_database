This paper presents the modeling and control of an Electric Vehicle (EV) driven by a 5-phase Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (PMSM). The machine in an open-end winding configuration is supplied by two isolated 5-leg Voltage Source Inverters (VSIs). The inverters are fed by a Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) consisting of a battery and Supercapacitors (SCs). To increase the battery lifetime, the SCs are used to provide the high-power requirement during driving operations. In addition, an Energy Management Strategy (EMS) is proposed to take advantages of this EV architecture. Numerical results are derived to verify workability of the EV system.
