The simple, cost effective chemical bath deposition (CBD) method is used for La2O3 thin film formation. The supercapacitive properties of La2O3 thin film electrode are studied by using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The maximum specific capacitance of 147 F g-1 is obtained with excellent electrochemical stability of 96% over 2000 CV cycles.
