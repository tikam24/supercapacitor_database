Binder-free, high-performance electrode materials play a critical role for supercapacitors. In this paper, through the electrochemical anodization process, ordered CuO/Cu2O nanosheet arrays (NSAs) were successfully in situ fabricated on copper foil, which could be directly adopted as the current collector. Then, NiOOH was introduced for the further modification of CuO/Cu2O arrays via a facile hydrothermal deposition treatment using nickel nitrate as precursor. The as-fabricated NiOOH@CuO/Cu2O composite nanosheet arrays exhibit an excellent areal capacitance of 1206 mF cm−2 at a current density of 1 mA cm−2 in 2 M KOH aqueous solution with an outstanding long-term cycling stability, with 84.6% of initial capacitance after 3000 charge/discharge cycles. The facile, cost-effective, and controllable fabrication route and the robust supercapacitive activity suggest that the NiOOH@CuO/Cu2O composite nanosheet arrays could be a promising candidate electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.
