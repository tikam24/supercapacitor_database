A facile wet chemical method was developed to synthesize a PANI/charcoal/Ni nanocomposite (PANI/AC/Ni), which was found to show significant electrochemical performance as a supercapacitor. The as-prepared sample was characterized by various spectral and analytical techniques. The newly fabricated PANI/AC/Ni nanocomposite electrode exhibited excellent specific capacitance with a maximum value of 1661 F g -1 at a discharge current density of 1 A g -1 . Furthermore, the composite electrode showed a specific capacitance retention of 93% after 2000 charge-discharge cycles. Thus the PANI/AC/Ni nanocomposite was proved to be a promising electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.
