As the global economy develops and environmental awareness grows, technology in the energy sector is receiving widespread attention. Energy storage technology and electrification of rail transit are the most promising research directions in the energy field. The rail sector requires energy storage technologies to cope with the energy management demands of electrification; new types of energy storage, particularly power storage, are also finding application in the rail sector. This paper summarizes the demand for energy storage in rail transit and analyses the required forms of energy storage. According to the current stage of energy storage development, this paper presents the system structures and the corresponding power electronic topologies for different forms of energy storage.
