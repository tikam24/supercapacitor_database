In this paper, NiSe2 materials were synthesized on carbon fiber felts (CFF) using a convenient one-step microwave approach. Self-supporting NiSe2/CFF is a bifunctional active material with outstanding supercapacitive behavior and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic activity. For supercapacitors, the NiSe2/CFF electrode material has a specific capacitance (Cs) of 1125.4 F−1 (1 A g−1) and capacitance retention of about 97.4% (50,000 cycles). Furthermore, the flexible asymmetric supercapacitor (FASC) assembled used NiSe2/CFF electrode as cathode exhibited an excellent cycle life (89% retention after 20,000 cycles). In terms of OER electrocatalysis, NiSe2/CFF material shows lower Tafel slope (54.4 mV de−1), an overpotential (144.7 mV), and remarkable cycling activity. The NiSe2/CFF materials synthesized in this study show attractive potential for practical applications. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
