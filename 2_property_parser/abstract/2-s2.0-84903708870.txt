A three-dimensional porous carbon nanotube film with a supported NiO nanonet was prepared by simple electrophoretic deposition and hydrothermal synthesis, which could deliver a high specific capacitance of 1511 F g−1 at a high discharge current of 50 A g−1 due to the significantly improved transport of the electrolyte and electrons. © The Partner Organisations 2014.
