The hybrid nanocomposite based on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/ multiwalled carbon nanotubes/graphene was prepared by reducing the graphene oxide with hydrazine in the presence of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and the anchored poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) hollow spheres (b-PEDOT). The transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of b-PEDOT/MWCNTs/rGO nanocomposite reveal that the b-PEDOT and MWCNTs were sandwiched between layers of graphene sheets. The b-PEDOT nanoparticles act as spacers to create gaps between neighboring graphene sheets, resulting in a higher surface area compared to pure graphene. Furthermore, it shows a significant pseudocapacitance energy storage mechanism during the charge/discharge process. And the MWCNTs improve electric conductivity of the nanocomposite and contribute to a low equivalent series resistance (ESR). Utilizing this composite material, a specific capacitance of 225 F g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1 has been achieved. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.
