Ultracapacitors have large energy density, high power density, high capacitance ranging from few farads to thousands of farads, low Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR) and low rated voltages. Standard measurement devices like LCR meters, etc., are not suitable for measurement of Capacitance and ESR of Ultracapacitor, as their measurement ranges are not adequate for measurement of parameters of Ultracapacitors. This paper proposes a Digital meter for measuring parameters of Ultracapacitor using Charge-discharge method.
