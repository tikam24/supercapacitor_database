The micro-sized materials have low processing difficulty, which ought to be more suited for practical applications. Here, a novel micron-sized NiCo 2 O 4 pompon is first obtained by the synergistic effect observed in the co-template method. The obtained product has a larger specific surface area of 109.62 m 2 /g and higher pore volume of 0.30 cm 3 /g than that of blank sample. Aided by the unique morphological superiority, it exhibits high specific capacitance of 2201.7 F/g at 2 A/g, good rate performance of 1296.8 F/g even at 20 A/g, and desirable cyclic stability of 14.2% degradation over 3000 continuous cycles at 10 A/g. The performance is better compared to most NiCo 2 O 4 electrodes in similar reports. The co-templates controlled synthesis shows advantages of simpleness, practicality and high efficiency, and should bring high application value in electrode synthesis.
