Bismuth phosphate nanostructures act as an active electrode material for next-generation energy storage device applications. Here, we report the effect of hexagonal phase, monoclinic phase, reaction time, and temperature on electrochemical properties of BiPO4 nanostructures prepared with microwave technique. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the synthesized materials confirmed the formation of pure phase formation BiPO4 nanostructures. The Debye Scherrer formula calculated the size of the crystals. All the synthesized bismuth phosphate materials are in the nanometers range, which was also exposed to Field Effect Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) assessment. Optical properties are explained by Raman spectra and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Electrochemical properties are studied via cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic chargeâ€“discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. The power law is used to confirm the behavior of the electrode, i.e., of battery type or supercapacitor type. This power law is applicable to CV curves of the samples. Further, the specific capacity was calculated from the GCD curve. The study reveals that bismuth phosphate can be used as an efficient electrode material for energy storage device applications.
