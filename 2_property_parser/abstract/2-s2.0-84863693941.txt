A new type of core-shell structured material consisting of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and manganese dioxide (MnO 2) nanoflake is synthesized using an in-situ co-precipitation method. By scanning electron microscopy and transition electron microscope, it is confirmed that the core-shell nanostructure is formed by the uniform incorporation of birnessite-type MnO 2 nanoflake growth round the surface of the activated-MWCNTs. That core-shell structured material electrode presents excellent electrochemical capacitance properties with the specific capacitance reaching 380 F g -1 at the current density of 5 A g -1 in 0.5 M Na 2SO 4 electrolyte. In addition, the electrode also exhibits good performance (the power density: 11.28 kW kg -1 at 5 A g -1) and long-term cycling stability (retaining 82.7% of its initial capacitance after 3500 cycles at 5 A g -1). It mainly attributes to MWCNTs not only providing considerable specific surface area for high mass loading of MnO 2 nanoflakes to ensure effective utilization of MnO 2 nanoflake, but also offering an electron pathway to improve electrical conductivity of the electrode materials. It is clearly indicated that such core-shell structured materials including MWCNTs and MnO 2 nanoflake may find important applications for supercapacitors. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.
