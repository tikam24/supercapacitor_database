Graphene is an attractive material for its physicochemical properties, but for many applications only chemically synthesized forms such as graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) can be produced in sufficient amounts. If considered as electrode material, the intrinsic defects of GO or rGO may have negative influence on the conductivity and electrochemical properties. Such defects are commonly oxidized sites that offer the possibility to be functionalized with other materials in order to improve performance. In this work, we demonstrate how such ultimately efficient functionalization can be achieved: namely, through controlled binding of very small amount of materials such as RuO2 to rGO by atomic layer deposition (ALD), in this way substituting the native defect sites with RuO2 defects. For the example of a supercapacitor, we show that defect functionalization results in significantly enhanced specific capacitance of the electrode and that its energy density can be stabilized even at high consumption rates.
