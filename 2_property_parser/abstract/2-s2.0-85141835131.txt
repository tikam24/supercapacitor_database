This chapter focuses on the electronic textiles using supercapacitors made up of nanofibers. Predominantly conductive polymers such as poly-3,4-ethylenedioxythiphene:polystyrene sulfonate or polyaniline are either spun directly or combined with other polymers such as polyacrylonitrile to produce nanofibers. These supercapacitor fibers are lightweight, flexible, and very stable against mechanical stress and have a very high capacity in relation to their weight. Due to these properties, they are currently under discussion for use as capacitors in smart textiles. On the other hand, there are some problems that must be solved such as the possibility of mass production, durability in relation to their longevity, and pending practical tests in which the nanofibers are tested under real conditions with embedded electrical devices.
