This paper demonstrates a brief review of the research progress of the advanced carbon-based materials for the supercapacitor electrodes. Diverse types of carbon-based electrodes exploited and reported to the literature are summarized and classified into pure carbon electrodes, carbon/metal oxides composite electrodes, carbon/metal oxides/conducting polymers composite electrodes as well as carbon electrodes based on other materials. Pure carbon electrodes are firstly introduced, confirming their merits and shortcomings. To cover the shortage of pure carbon electrodes and further enhances their electrochemical performance, a composite electrode, combined with metal oxides and conducting polymers, is respectively presented. It is worth noticing in this article that combining various materials to form composites has been one main direction to own a positive synergistic effect on the carbon-based electrodes.
