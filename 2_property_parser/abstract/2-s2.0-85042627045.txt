Mesoporous graphene is synthesized based on the chemical vapor deposition methodology by using heavy MgO flakes as substrates in a fluidized-bed reactor. Subsequently, sulfur and nitrogen coincorporation into graphene frameworks is realized by the reaction between carbon atoms and thiourea molecules. The as-obtained sulfur and nitrogen codoped mesoporous graphene (SNMG) exhibits remarkable capacitive energy-storage behavior, as a result of well-developed pore channels, in terms of that in a symmetric supercapacitor and lithium-ion hybrid capacitor (LIHC). The ultrahigh durability of the SNMG/SNMG symmetric supercapacitor is demonstrated by long-term cycling, for which no capacitance decay is found after 20 000 cycles. A LIHC constructed from commercial Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) as the anode and SNMG as the cathode is capable of delivering much enhanced lithium-storage ability and better rate capability than that of activated carbon (AC)/LTO LIHC. Moreover, SNMG/LTO LIHC exhibits maximum energy and power densities of 86.2 Wh kg−1 and 7443 W kg−1 and maintains 87 % capacitance retention after 2000 cycles.
