Autonomous solar-powered small light and signal units can help solve many navigation and transportation problems for sufficient solar energy potential regions. Even in case of centralized grid presence the additional consumers' integration can be an issue due to construction works and power availability. Electrochemical accumulator is a traditional solution for such devices, but its application usually faces lifetime and stable operation at low temperatures problems. Electrochemical double-layer supercapacitor (EDLC) possess high cyclic resource and stable operation down to minus 40-45Â°C. Low specific energy capacity, high specific energy costs and high self-discharge rates are main drawbacks for this technology. The paper is devoted to airport signal unit operation numerical simulation in case of lead-acid accumulator and EDLC application. Using developed software based on energy balance calculation and satellite solar energy data, optimal configurations of signal units were derived for Rostov and Saratov climate conditions. Technical and economical estimations for both configurations were made from the 100% operation availability and minimum service during 20 years-typical lifetime for monocrystalline photovoltaic module. Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) charge controller features typical for such application are also considered. Target parameters for EDLC commercially attractive application were evaluated.
