Following fundamental concepts and definitions, the characteristic benefits and limitations of electrochemical cells in energy conversion are considered. Thermodynamics, kinetics and ohmic drop are seen to be important in realising a high charge capacity and energy efficiency. Types of electrochemical device, including the battery, flow battery, fuel cell, supercapacitor and their combinations are compared.
