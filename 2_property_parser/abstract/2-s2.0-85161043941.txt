Research on electrochemical energy storage devices aims to produce supercapacitors via a facile and nonpolluting method. Because of unnecessary elemental doping and disordered morphologies of nano-oxides, impurities in raw materials during the conventional fabrication process would reduce the pseudocapacitance. Herein, we propose a submerged photosynthesis crystalline method for synthesizing oxygen vacancy (Vo)-enriched Mo-W oxide hydrates and Mo-doped tungsten oxide hydrate nanocomposites at 55 °C and normal pressure. In addition, this study describes the impact of Vos on pseudocapacitance using ab initio calculations based on density functional theory. Doping the WO3·0.33H2O lattice with Mo and Vos brings the conduction band closer to the Fermi energy level. The comparison of the ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared (UV-vis-NIR) irradiation spectrum and absorption coefficient calculation suggests that Mo and Vodoping is responsible for the NIR absorption. This study concludes that enriched Vos result in the highest specific capacitance and pseudocapacitive behavior of MoxW1-xO3·0.33H2O.
