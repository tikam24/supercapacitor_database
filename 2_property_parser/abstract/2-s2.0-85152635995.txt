For the self-developed micro-electric vehicle (MEV), the supercapacitor/battery hybrid energy storage system (HESS) parameters were matched by analyzing the vehicle dynamic and economic constraints. The power distribution of HESS was realized by the fuzzy control strategy, and the entire vehicle model was also built to simulate the dynamic performance. The LCC model of MEV was established based on the comprehensive research of the life cycle cost (LCC). Quantitative comparisons and simulation results show that the micro electric vehicle with supercapacitor/battery HESS has great advantages in dynamic and economy. In the future, with the maturity and popularization of related technologies, the supercapacitor/battery HESS will have a huge preponderance.
