With the rapid development of world economy and an increasing use of portable electronic devices, energy storage systems are becoming more reliable on nano/micro supercapacitors. This work reports a fast and facile microwave-initiated synthesis approach of 2D-molybdenum ditelluride nanosheets supported on graphene substrate (MoTe2/graphene), which can be used as an efficient energy storage material. The physical characterizations, such as scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction analyses substantiate the successful synthesis of MoTe2/graphene nanocomposite. The electrochemical characterizations reveal their excellent supercapacitive behavior with specific capacitance of 434 ± 37.5 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and a good cycling stability of 125% retention after 5000 cycles at 10 A g−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. In addition, the symmetric MoTe2/graphene//MoTe2/graphene configuration displays excellent cyclic stability up to 10,000 cycles with a maximum energy density of 43.2 Wh kg−1 at high power density of 3000 W kg−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, which demonstrates the hybrid-capacitor behavior. Therefore, the microwave synthesized MoTe2/graphene reveals a great potential as advanced electrode materials for energy storage devices with high electrochemical performance through one-step facile synthesis approach.
