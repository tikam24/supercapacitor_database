A green approach for the electrochemical exfoliation of graphite to graphene is reported. After the exfoliation of graphite, the 9-anthracene carboxylate ion (ACA), which was used as an electrolyte, was adsorbed on the surface of graphene through noncovalent interaction. X-ray diffraction analysis confirms the exfoliation of graphite to graphene. Atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy analyses show the formation of single layer graphene. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy confirm the noncovalent attachment of ACA on the surface of graphene. The 9-anthracene carboxylic acid modified graphene (ACEG) shows good electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance of 577 F g-1 in 1 M H2SO4. The ACEG electrode shows 83.4% retention in specific capacitance after 1000 charge-discharge cycles. A high coulombic efficiency of 102% is also observed indicating its suitability as energy storage electrode materials. Â© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012.
