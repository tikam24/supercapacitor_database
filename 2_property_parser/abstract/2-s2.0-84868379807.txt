In this work, porous carbon with a high specific surface area as electrode materials for supercapacitors are obtained by a carbonization process at various temperatures from 700°C to 1000°C without activation process using poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) as a carbon precursor. The electrochemical performance is characterized by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling performance using two-electrode system in 6.0 M KOH as an aqueous electrolyte. The results indicate that carbonization temperature significantly affected the specific surface area and pore volume of the PVDF-derived carbons and their capacitive behavior. In particular, the electrochemical performance of the prepared PVDF-derived carbon is determined by both the electric double-layer capacitance and the pseudo-capacitance resulting from the residual surface functional groups on PVDF-derived carbons. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.
