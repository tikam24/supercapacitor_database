Planar on-chip micro-supercapacitors with winding interdigitated microelectrodes were fabricated by liquid-air interfacial assembly and lithography. The micro-supercapacitors with the microelectrodes (finger width of 210 μm and gap of 70 μm) can quickly complete charging and discharging in a very short time (84 ms), owing to the shortening of the ion path. They deliver an area capacitance of 90.39 μF cm−2 and a stack capacitance of 29.16 F cm−3. In addition, the energy density and the power density at 1 V s−1 are 4.05 mWh cm−3 and 145.79 mW cm−3, respectively. The micro-devices have excellent cycling stability with 98.5% capacitance retention after 2000 cyclic voltammetry cycles and can operate well at an ultrahigh scan rate of 5000 V s−1.
