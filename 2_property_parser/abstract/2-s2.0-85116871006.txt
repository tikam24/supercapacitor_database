Energy storage by supercapacitors forms one of the key solutions in the implementation of sustainable energy systems. Supercapacitors play an essential role in storing the excess amount of energy produced by renewable energy sources and deliver the same on the time of disposal. The evolution of supercapacitor technology can boost the transportation sector especially the hybrid electric vehicles. The development of such systems requires high energy storing supercapacitor electrodes, suitable electrolytes to allow suitable ion transport or conduction, correct sealants, appropriate fabrication technique, etc. These components have direct impact on the performance and the vital parameters like electrochemical capacitance, power and energy density. Conducting polymers-based electrodes mainly exhibit pseudocapacitive behavior as a result of high redox type specific capacitance while as electrolyte provide feasible ion transport sites thereby offering low resistance to electrochemically active materials. This chapter features the importance of electrolytes in supercapacitors especially conducting polymer electrolytes in development of flexible supercapacitors.
