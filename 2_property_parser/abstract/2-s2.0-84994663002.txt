Active Power injected into the grid can be smoothened by implementation of efficient and economic energy storage. This paper deals with the vector controlled Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) associated with an energy storage device i.e. battery/Supercapacitor to generate a constant active power through the grid for all wind speeds. The controllers regulate DFIG wind turbine to generate the desired amount of active power, where the deviations between the available wind energy input and desired active power output are compensated by the Energy Storage System (ESS). The storage device is implemented on the dc link via dc-dc converter. A control strategy is developed for dc-dc converter to store extra amount of power and discharge it when required. Simulation studies are carried out in SIMULINK (MATLAB) on a DFIG equipped with battery or Supercapacitor to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.
