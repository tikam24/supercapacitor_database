Mesoporous carbon/graphene composite was firstly synthesized by hard-template method. Then, different quinone molecules were introduced to improve the capacitive performance of the composite. The results show that mesoporous carbon/graphene composite with 30% (w/w) loading of butylhydroquinone shows the best capacitive performance. This sample exhibits specific capacitance of 355 and 226 F·g−1 at the current density of 0.5 and 30 A·g−1, respectively, highlighting its good rate performance.
