A series of novel ternary composites reduced-graphene oxide/zine oxide/poly(p-phenylenediamine) (RGO/ZnO/PpPD) have been synthesized by employing the hydrothermal-polymerization method for the first time. RGO sheets substrate and thin PpPD coating are designed to effectively prevent the volume expansion of ZnO during the charging/discharging processes. We have found the proportions of components play an important role in determining the synergy of the composites. As a result, when the mass ratio of products (RGO: ZnO: PpPD) is equal to 1:8:8, the obtained composite achieves excellent electrochemical properties with a significantly increased specific capacitance of 320 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 compared with 58 F/g for pure ZnO samples. In addition, GMP-1,8,8//GMP1,8,8 supercapacitor has been assembled and presents a maximum energy density of 18.14 Wh kg−1 and a maximum power density of 10 kW kg−1.
