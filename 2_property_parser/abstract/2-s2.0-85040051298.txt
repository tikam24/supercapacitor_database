The development of low-cost and efficient coating technology for ZnFe2O4 in the application of supercapacitor, electronic devices, chemical sensors, is desirable but remains a challenge. In this study, a facile fabrication of ZnFe2O4 coatings via electrophoretic deposition (EPD) methods has been realized by employing hydrothermal synthesized ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles as starting materials. Benefiting from systematic investigation for the deposition kinetic of ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles in the dispersion system of ethanol-acetylacetone with the addition of nitric acid, smooth ZnFe2O4 coating with good film characteristics was successfully and rapidly fabricated. With a preliminary study of ZnFe2O4 coatings as supercapacitor electrode, the specific capacitance decayed from 198 to 17.1 F gâˆ’1 when the deposition time increased from 0.5 to 10 min because of the poor electric conductivity. Therefore, an electrophoretic codeposition of ZnFe2O4 and conductive carbon material is necessary in the given application with desire of good electron transfer ability.
