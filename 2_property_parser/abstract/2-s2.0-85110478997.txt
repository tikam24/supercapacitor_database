High edge energy storage with large life-span stable materials have become the most significant and major requirement in near future. Bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3) nanoparticles (NPs) was effectively synthesized by utilizing bismuth diethyldithiocarbamate (Bi[DTC]3) complex as single-source antecedent. The synthesized Bi2S3 NPs were affirmed by structural, morphological and thermal analysis with various analytical studies. The electrochemical performance of Bi2S3 NPs reveals that, exhibit redox behavior from cyclic voltammetry analysis, the charge–discharge analysis was examined by the galvanostatic chronopotentiometry. Bi2S3 NPs exhibit excellent supercapacitor behavior with value of the specific capacitance 470 Fg−1 at current density 0.5 Ag−1 and the retentivity of 79% after 1000 cycles. The Bi2S3 NPs were further utilized as photocatalytic discoloration of Congo Red (CR) dye in aqueous medium under UV light irradiation. Which shows, excellent catalytic behaviour, up to 98% of CR dye degrade within 150 min and it is exhibit good catalytic stability and reusability.
