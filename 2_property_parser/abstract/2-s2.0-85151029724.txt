The facile and low-cost technology for the fabrication of high-performance electrode material for supercapacitors is very important for green energy storage. Herein, the commercial carbon cloth (CC) with poor capacitance is subjected to thermal treatment at 430°C, followed by a potentiostatic oxidation at a constant potential of 2 V. Through the thermal activation process, the capacitance is increased to 1310 mF cm−2, and further enhanced to 2421 mF cm−2 after the additional potentiostatic activation. Nitrogen adsorption experiment and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis show that the prominent increase in specific surface area upon thermal-activation and the formation of oxygen-containing groups after electrochemical-activation are responsible for the greatly improved capacitive properties. The aqueous hybrid zinc ion supercapacitor (HZSC) constructed using the thermal-electro dually activated CCs cathode and Zn plate anode shows a high energy density of 1.21 mWh cm−2 at a power density of 4.75 mW cm−2. The HZSC displays superior long period stability with 94.65% capacitance retention after 8000 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles. This work proposes a facile route to transform commercial carbon cloths into high performance self-standing cathode for the aqueous HZSCs, which will have noticeable effect on energy storage technology due to its stability, low-cost, environmental friendliness and safety.
