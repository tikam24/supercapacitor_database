Electric vehicles (EVs) of the modern era are almost on the verge of tipping scale against internal combustion engines (ICE). ICE vehicles are favorable since petrol has a much higher energy density and requires less space for storage. However, the ICE emits carbon dioxide which pollutes the environment and causes global warming. Hence, alternate engine technology is the need of the current era to mitigate the existing problems and keep the environment clean. With the advancements of batteries and supercapacitors have seen some production of EVs having same or even higher total mileage per full tank, some even reach 580 km per charge. The energy generated from solar cell is one of the best sources of energy to integrate with the batteries and supercapacitors for electric vehicles. In this review, different types of solar cells and their integration with supercapacitors and batteries have been discussed for electric vehicles.
