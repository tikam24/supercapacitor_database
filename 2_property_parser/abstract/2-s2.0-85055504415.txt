This paper reveals the impact of an ultra-capacitor (UC) and thyristor control phase shifter (TCPS) on frequency stability of large hybrid interconnected power system. The impact of UC and TCPS has been studied for general purpose hybrid generated multi areas power system. Further to this, an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is is proposed for automatic load frequency control (ALFC). Thermal and reheat thermal plants are connected in Area-1 and area-2, whereas area-3 has hydro plant and area-4, 5, 6 consists of nuclear power plant, diesel power and gas turbine plant, respectively. A micro grid based on Solar Photovoltaic (PV) system and fleet of electric vehicle (EV) system is developed and integrated with load side of area-1 for load management in interconnected grid. Effect of Small load change and large load change are discussed in separate cases. The controllers are tuned by adding sliding surface to enhance the performance. A comparison between ANFIS and PI-based control approaches with and without UC and TCPS exhibits the superiority of ANFIS controller by integrating UC and TCPS. The results of the proposed control technique are compared with already published results.
