MXenes have shown distinctive advantages as active materials for supercapacitors due to their 2D open structure and high electronic conductivity. However, the horizontal stack and random orientation of MXene flakes on a current collector lead to the limited accessible surface area and transport pathways. Blocking the ion transport is largely deteriorated for the electrochemical performance of an MXene electrode. Herein, a vacuum filtration process, affording with the entwined mental mesh as filter membranes, is employed for constructing an “anti-T-shape” MXene film electrode. The resultant vertical ionic tunnels improve the kinetics of electrolyte ion transport. Consequently, a lower interfacial charge transfer impedance and an increased pseudo-capacity are achieved in the sulfuric acid electrolyte. This work may inspire further investigations on anisotropic properties of MXenes beyond electrochemical energy storage.
