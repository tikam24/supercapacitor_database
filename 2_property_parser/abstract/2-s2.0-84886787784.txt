Using chemical vapor deposition in this study to grow vertically aligned carbon nanotubes on Ni/Ti/Au/Si as electrodes for supercapacitor is simpler and reproducible than other methods. Nanoparticles on Ni/Ti/Au/Si substrate proceeded by e-beam evaporation were less than 1 nm, vertically aligned MWCNT are distributed uniformly on the substrate, and the number of nanotubes per square centimeter is 6.3×lO10. Morphologies and structures of the composite electrode were examined by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectrum. This straightforward process can fabricate high specific surface areas of other nanoparticles on the MWCNTs. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
