The spinel structural NiCo2O4 material used in super capacitor has fine electrode chemical performance, but the operating availability and discharge capacity of its active substance are not good. In this paper, a new kind of NiCo2O4 material which fabricated in situ on nickel foam was prepared by hydrothermal method, and the material was further modified by doping at cobalt position. Through the synthesis and modification processes mentioned above, the NiCo1.98X0.02O4 material (X = Fe, Cu, Mg, V, Ag, Mn, Mo, Ti) were prepared for further tests. According to the test results, the area ratio capacitance of active substance can be increased by the optimization of the type and amount of doped metal. Subsequently, the optimized NiCo1.99Mg0.01O4 and NiCo1.95Cu0.05O4 materials were characterized by XRD, SEM, EDS, XPS, and FT-IR. Through above characterizations, it can be found that materials doped with different metals have both similarities and differences. However, the doping at the cobalt site has not changed the crystal structure of the NiCo2O4 material, and the electrochemical properties of the doped materials are stable.
