The output voltage stability of any DC-DC con-verters is still challenging in voltage conditioning applications between the DC energy source and the power transmission line of any electric vehicle. Input voltage and load variations are the two main disturbances in such applications since the terminal voltage of the battery, fuel cell stack, or supercapacitor is adversely influenced by load changes. In this study, we propose a robust structured H8 feed-forward controller synthesizing approach for non-minimum phase multi-level converters to suppress the effects of disturbance inputs. The input voltage and load current feed-forward controllers are constructed as a static function for easy implementation. The voltage mode three degrees of the freedom control scheme is tested under step load, set-point, and input voltage changes. The performances and robustness of the proposed methodology are verified via simulation and DSP-based real-time application. In these tests, the 200-W-rated power prototype has fast closed-loop dynamics against severe changes in input voltage and load current disturbances.
