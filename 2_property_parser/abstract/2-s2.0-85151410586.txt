The accelerated growth of renewable energy conversion and storage devices with significantly greater efficiency, stable operation, cost effectiveness, and user-friendly environment manifests a challengeable approach to mitigate the global energy crisis. This review focuses on studies carried out regarding various energy storage mechanisms, so as to design and develop sundry materials for accomplishing most suitable (high energy density and long term excellent stability) supercapacitor electrodes. The present review specifically strikes the works on electrode materials such as carbides, phosphides, sulphides, polymers, oxides, and nitrides with graphene. It is visualized from the study that graphene with metal sulphides yield high specific capacitance, energy density, power density and cyclic stability compared to graphene with carbides, nitrides, phosphides, oxides, and polymers thereby ensuring their commercial potentials.
