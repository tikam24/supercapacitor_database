This paper presents the design and development of the first body integrated super-capacitor and Li-ion battery based hybrid energy storage system for electric vehicles. Body integration of SCs not only improves the acceleration, regeneration responses of the vehicle and longevity of the Li-ion battery, but also allows for better utilization of available space giving additional room for the Li-ion battery, the primary power source. Features of the developed body integrated super-capacitors system, design of the bi-directional interleaved converter employed, hybrid energy storage system with experimental results are presented.
