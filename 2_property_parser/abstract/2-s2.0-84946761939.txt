Use of carbon nanomaterials (nanoporous carbon in different forms, carbon nanotubes, graphene derivatives, and different composites) in capacitor electrodes enables significantly higher energy storage capability than for conventional electrolytic capacitors. An attempt of synthesis of the main results found from research and development work in the last time by using carbon nanomaterials in supercapacitors is performed in this chapter. Specific capacitance values (related to specific energy) as key performance material indicator, reaching 150-200 F/g for nonaqueous electrolytes and up to 450-500 F/g in aqueous electrolytes, have been reported. Corresponding specific energy values up to 35-40 Wh/kg in organic electrolyte, 50-60 Wh/kg in ionic electrolyte, and 10-15 Wh/kg in aqueous electrolyte have been also reported. These capacitance and specific energy values take into account only the carbon nanomaterial from a supercapacitor cell. For practical cells where other materials are included, the above values have to be divided by a factor at least of 4. In many cases, charge storage is provided by pseudocapacitance (fast faradaic reactions, associated with functional groups from the carbon surface) in addition to the electric double layer. The shape of cyclic voltammograms and of galvanostatic charge-discharge curves at low scan rate or current density can indicate if there is pseudocapacitance contribution. Sometimes, the pseudocapacitance contribution to the specific capacitance is attributed to the electric double layer. Discharge voltage record with the time of a supercapacitor cell on a load resistance can also reveal the contribution of electric double layer and pseudocapacitance to the total exhibited capacitance. Better understanding of charge storage mechanisms in the experimental supercapacitor cells can lead to better utilization of carbon nanomaterials for further advance in performance.
