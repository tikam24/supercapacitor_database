Energy storage has become the most crucial topic of research in the 21st century owing to the growing demand for energy for various modern-day requirements. Supercapacitors (SCs) are energy storage devices that can deliver power for a wide range of electronic gadgets, electric/hybrid vehicles and sophisticated machines used in space and the military. Electrode materials play a vital role in determining the electrochemical performance and stability of these energy devices. It is therefore essential to design efficient and long-lasting materials that are solid, lightweight and flexible to suit various applications. The excellent chemical and physical properties of MoS2 have made it one of the most widely considered two-dimensional nanomaterials in the past few years. Through this review, we mainly highlight the synthesis, properties, and electrochemical performance of MoS2 and its composites-based functional materials. The potential uses of MoS2 in various fields imply that this material still offers many possibilities for exploration and development.
