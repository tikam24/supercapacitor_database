Altair Nanotechnologies, a provider of energy storage systems, has developed a lithium-titanate battery system to mitigate some difficulties associated with ancillary services. The power storage system provides frequency regulation on a 1-sec dispatch basis, as needed. With AES, Altairnano developed a 2-Mw, 500-kw-hr system with the capability of producing 1000 amp at 1000 v that was designed and built to fit inside two 53-ft trailers. The Altairnano battery system was pilot-tested at AES' Indianapolis Power & Light location. The lithium-titanate battery system exhibits three times the power capabilities of existing batteries and can be described as the combination of a battery and a supercapacitor. Thus, power can be extracted from as well as inserted into the battery.
