Poly[1-[4-(3-carboxy-4-hydroxyphenylazo)benzenesulfonamido]-1,2-ethanediyl, sodium salt] (PAZO) exhibits a number of unique physical properties. An electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method has been utilized for the deposition of PAZO films, which exhibited photoinduced birefringence. The advantages of EPD, deposition mechanism and kinetics of deposition are discussed. PAZO exhibits unique adsorption properties, which are related to its chemical structure. The salicylate ligands of PAZO monomers with strong chelating properties provide numerous adsorption sites for PAZO adsorption on inorganic materials. It was found that PAZO can function as a charging, dispersing and film forming agent for EPD of a wide array of materials, such as TiO2 (anatase and rutile), micron size platelets and submicrometre particles of Al2O3, zirconia, MnO2, MgAl2O4, aluminium hydroxide, SiC, Pd metal, carbon nanotubes and polypyrrole nanofibers. The feasibility of incorporation of other polymers and organic dyes into the PAZO films has been demonstrated. PAZO showed superior performance compared to other dispersing agents for the EPD method, overcoming their limitations. Another major finding of this study was the possibility of EPD of composites, using PAZO as a co-dispersant for different materials. Testing results showed that composites can be used for optical, energy storage, corrosion protection and other applications.
