A supercapacitor is well recognized as one of emerging energy sources for powering electronic devices in our daily life. Although various kind of supercapacitors have been designed and demonstrated, their market aspect could become advanced if the utilisation of other physicochemical properties (e.g. optical) is incorporated in the electrode. Herein, we present an electrochromic supercapacitor (smart supercapacitor) based on a nanoflake NiMoO4 thin film which is fabricated using a facile and well-controlled successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) technique. The polycrystalline nanoflake NiMoO4 electrode exhibits a large electrochemically active surface area of ~ 96.3 cm2. Its nanoporous architecture provides an easy pathway for the intercalation and de-intercalation of ions. The nanoflake NiMoO4 electrode is dark-brown in the charged state and becomes transparent in the discharged state with a high optical modulation of 57%. The electrode shows a high specific capacity of 1853 Fg–1 at a current rate of 1 Ag–1 with a good coloration efficiency of 31.44 cm2/C. Dynamic visual information is obtained when the electrode is charged at different potentials, reflecting the level of energy storage in the device. The device retains 65% capacity after 2500 charge-discharge cycles compared with its initial capacity. The excellent performance of the nanoflake NiMoO4 based smart supercapacitor is associated with the synergetic effect of nanoporous morphology with a large electrochemically active surface area and desired chemical composition for redox reaction.
