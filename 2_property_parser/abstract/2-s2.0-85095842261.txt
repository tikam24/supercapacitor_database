A strategy for the preparation of layer-by-layer hybrid material of nano tungsten oxide and reduced graphitic oxide by jet nebulizer spray pyrolysis method and characterization of the material for supercapacitor applications is reported. Ammonium tungstate thin films were deposited on glass substrate using jet nebulized spray pyrolysis technique. Graphitic oxide is deposited as a second layer over the ammonium tungstate thin film by spray deposition. Over the graphitic oxide layer, thin film of ammonium tungstate was coated by jet nebulized spray deposition method. The layered materials are annealed in nitrogen atmosphere at the optimized condition 450°C for 2 hours. The morphological, optical and electrochemical properties of the prepared materials were characterized using XRD, SEM, PL, CV and EIS techniques. The XRD results show that the tungsten oxide crystallizes in tetragonal structure with polycrystalline of grain size 40-60nm. Optical study shows 2.5eV as band gap energy of the materials. CV and EIS data represent hybrid nature of the materials with specific capacitance 283F/g at 5mVs-1 and ESR value 8.80Ω. Result shows layer-by-layer hybrid material of tungsten oxide and reduced graphitic oxide prepared using jet nebulized spray pyrolysis technique suitable for supercapacitor electrodes.
