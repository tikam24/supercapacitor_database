To improve the electrochemical performance and overcome the disadvantages of layered double hydroxides (LDHs), designing the three-dimensional structure may be an effective way. Based on this strategy, we successfully synthesized multi-sized nanosheets cobalt-iron layered double hydroxides (Co-Fe LDHs) on Ni foam by a facile hydrothermal reaction. The poor conductivity of LDHs can be improved by directly grown on Ni foam which can be used as conductive skeleton. The sample has a unique three-dimensional structure with multi-sized nanosheets observed from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. The elements and structure are confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The electrodes show a great specific capacitance of 3340 mF cm−2 (1670 C cm−2) at 1 mA cm−2 and good cycling stability which keeps the capacitance retention at 85.1% after 4000 cycles. The improved performances may be due to the unique structure with multi-sized nanosheets and the Ni foam used as conductive skeleton to reduce agglomeration and strengthen conductivity. The results indicate the Co-Fe LDHs grown on Ni Foam have a promising future as supercapacitor electrodes.
