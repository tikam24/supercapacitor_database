The paper do some research on the positive piezoelectric effect of piezoelectric ceramic stack. Piezoelectric energy generator is laid on the highway surface, and using the stress which is generated by piezoelectric device to generate electric energy when the vehicle is passing. The generated electric energy is stored in the lithium battery package for street lighting at night after the circuit adjustment. The experimental demonstration and theoretical analysis show that the electric energy generated in piezoelectric stack can be stored in 12V-12Ah lithium battery package within 12h by the circuit of 3F ultracapacitor and LM2575HVT-12V regulator when the output voltage of LM2575HVT-12V is 12V. 12V-12Ah lithium battery package supply energy to the 12V, 12W high power LED lighting for 12h, and meeting the street lighting standards.
