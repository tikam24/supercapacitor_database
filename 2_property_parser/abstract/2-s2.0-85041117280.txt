Highly compressible graphene aerogel are proposed as the promising electrode materials for compression-tolerant electrochemical capacitors. Herein, the polypyrrole (PPy) was introduced into the compressible graphene aerogel to further improve its specific capacitance and compression-tolerant ability. As-prepared graphene/PPy aerogel withstands 95% repeated compression cycling without any structure collapse. The gravimetric capacitance of the superelastic pseudocapacitors based on graphene/PPy aerogel electrodes reaches 335 F g−1 and can retain 97% even under 95% compressive strain. And a volumetric capacitance of 108 F cm−3 is achieved due to the significantly increased density of the electrodes under 95% strain. This value of the volumetric capacitance can be preserved by 85% after 3500 charge/discharge cycles with various compression conditions. This work will pave the way for advanced applications in the area of compressible energy-storage devices.
