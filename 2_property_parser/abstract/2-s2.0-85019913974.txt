Polyaniline (PANI) was coated on carbon nanotubes within a nanoporous sheet (buckypaper) by in situ electrochemical polymerization. The chemical structure and morphology of the polyaniline and the resulting composites were studied. This work shows a strong effect of aniline concentration and buckypaper soaking time on the synthesis of polyaniline. Outstanding composite areal and gravimetric capacitances of 54 F/cm2 and 400 F g-1, respectively, could be achieved at high weight loading of PANI.
