Metallic cobalt nanoparticles are embedded into ZIF-67 (Co(MeIM)2, MeIM = 2-methylimidazole) by a facile method. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results show that the metallic cobalt crystals in the composite do not come into existence obviously until the carbonation temperature reaches 700 °C. According to the results of transmission electron microscope (TEM), the obtained Co/ZIF-67 maintains the structure of ZIF-67. In addition, the cobalt-nanoporous carbon composites process the carbon-shell/cobalt-core architecture, which inherits from the porous structure of Co/ZIF-67. What is more, the grain sizes of the cobalt/carbon composites obtained at 700 °C, 800 °C, 900 °C and 1000 °C are 2.1 nm, 3.1 nm, 9.9 nm and 14.8 nm, respectively. As a result, the specific capacitance of the composites material is up to 511.5 Fg-1 at a current density of 100 mAg-1 in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. More significantly, the comparative investigations at different carbonization temperatures suggest the capacitance is mainly based on the redox mechanism.
