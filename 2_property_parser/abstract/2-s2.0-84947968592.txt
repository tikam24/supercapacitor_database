Flexible supercapacitors with large power and energy densities, long life cycles and good operational safety are necessary devices for various applications. In this work, we demonstrate the integration of a composite based on graphene nanosheets/multiwalled carbon nanotubes in an in-plane supercapacitor configuration by using a straightforward preparation involving the filtration of nanomaterials to produce an electrode film. Reduced graphene oxide (RGO) received 15 wt % carbon nanotubes to act as a conducting additive, which led to a flexible and transferable thin film (RGO/MW) with an average conductivity of 20.0 S cm-1. Three ionic liquids were tested as electrolytes for the supercapacitor, among which 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (EMITFSI) was observed to exhibit the best performance. The specific capacitance of the supercapacitor based on RGO/MW-EMITFSI reached 153.7 F g-1 at a current density of 0.2 A g-1 and exhibited a capacitance retention of 88% after 2000 cycles. The maximum energy and power densities were calculated to be 41.3 Wh kg-1 and 3.5 kW kg-1, respectively, for the RGO/MW-EMITFSI supercapacitor.
