Many wearable or portable medical devices have limited battery energy. In this paper, a piezoelectric transducer (PZT) was adopted to take advantage of bodyweight to generate power to wearable and implantable medical devices. To confirm the power generated by the PZT, electromyography (EMG) was used to measure the subject's muscle activity. The proposed system consists of three parts: power, measurement, and monitoring units. The power unit was tested using on 0.25 F, 0.33 F, 0.5 F, and 1 F supercapacitors to explore the best supercapacitor that can supply the measurement unit by power. Based on using PZT, we found that the power unit was able to supply the measurement unit with adequate voltage (i.e., 5 V) for normal operation without system failure. The present system has better performance than state-of-the-art in terms of power and voltage as compared to that in previous studies.
