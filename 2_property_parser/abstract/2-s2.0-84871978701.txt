Activated mesocarbon microbeads/polyaniline composite (AMCMB/PANI) was synthesized by in-situ polymerization of aniline on activated mesocarbon microbeads (AMCMB) with high specific surface area of 2945 cm2/g, using ammonium persulfate as oxidant. Microstructure and morphology of AMCMB/PANI were investigated by scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The electrochemical properties of AMCMB/PANI were studied in 6mol/L KOH solution by galvanostatic charge/discharge, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The specific capacitance of AMCMB/PANI electrode was 387.72 F/g under the specific current of 0.02 A/g by constant current charge/discharge technique, and increased by 57.46%, comparing with the specific capacitance of AMCMB electrode, showing that a small amount of polyaniline could significantly improve the specific capacitance of electrode material. When the specific current increased 1000 times, the specific capacitance of AMCMB/PANI electrode was 157.68 F/g, indicating good rate capability.
