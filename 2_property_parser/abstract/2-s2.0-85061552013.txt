A hybrid storage system with Li-ion battery and ultracapacitor that can increase the hosting capacity of the load point and provide demand charge reduction for customer has been presented in this paper. The proposed system is a potential behind-the-meter solution for median- to large-size commercial buildings that can enable higher photovoltaics (PV) penetration in future distribution systems. In this work, a proposed optimization algorithm can reduce the peak demand, minimize the voltage variation at the load point, and consider the degradation cost of Li-ion batteries. The proposed approach is verified on a modified IEEE 13-node test feeder with scaled real PV generation and load data.
