A facile and template free greener route is used to fabricate natural polysaccharide based biocompatible mesh-like Fe2O3/C nanocomposites for supercapacitor application. Thermal, structural and morphological properties of iron oxide-carbon composites prepared at different annealing temperature have been analyzed and the electrochemical properties of composites are evaluated. The nanocomposite prepared at 500 °C with mesh-like structure reveals maximum specific capacitance of 315 F g-1 in 2 M KOH solution at a scan rate of 2 mV s-1 and good capacity retention (88.9%) after 1500 continues charge-discharge cycles with energy density of 37 W h kg-1, indicating that the Fe2O 3/C composite can be a promising electroactive material for a supercapacitor. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
