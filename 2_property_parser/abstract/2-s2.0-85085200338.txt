The structural properties and capacitive behavior of manganese dioxide films prepared by potentiostatic cathodic deposition were examined in presence and absence of pre-electrophoretically deposited reduced graphene oxide (rGO) film. The FTIR analysis reflects the formation of a MnO2/rGO composite film structure. SEM and TEM characterization show that the MnO2 film deposited on rGO film has finer and less compact nanostructure and grown as sparsely aggregated particles follow the open structure of underlying rGO platelets. The specific capacitance and rate capability of MnO2/rGO film are higher than that of pristine MnO2 film; it exhibits specific capacitance of 292 Fg-1 at 1 mA cm-2 and better cyclic stability at 3 mA cm-2. The presence of 3D underlying defective rGO film creates an open structure with larger area, facilitates the electron transfer and access of the electrolyte ions through the surface of MnO2 film and hence offering the potential of the unique capacitive behavior.
