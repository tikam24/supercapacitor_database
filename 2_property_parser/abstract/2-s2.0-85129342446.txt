The main aim of this paper is to propose a scheme for the internal and external energy management of the EV/HEV and to try to analyse the performance of the EV/HEV in terms of speed tracking and output power. This paper is focused to achieve the maximum efficiency with the minimum cost so their proposed different types of the DC-DC converter with their different controlled technique. Due to the analysis purpose, we are using PID and FLC controlled technique for designing the motor driver. Here, a parallel connection of super capacitor (followed by BBBC) and battery bank (followed by UBBC) is proposed for reducing the stress on the battery bank and getting the optimised energy at every point. Now, Simulink software named MATLAB and Simulink is used for verifying our results.
