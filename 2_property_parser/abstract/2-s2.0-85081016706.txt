A flexible solid-state supercapacitor based on vapor phase polymerized (VPP) PEDOT into cellulose paper matrix (PEDOT/CP) was successfully fabricated. The PEDOT/CP composite material worked as both current collector and electrode in constructed test cells. It had a low sheet resistance of 14 ω/square and survived the Scotch tape test for adhesion. It also showed excellent stability with no significant conductivity drop after 1000 cycles of bending. The PEDOT from electrode obtained the mass specific capacitance of 179 F/g at scan rate of 10 mV/s, which was among the highest specific capacitances ever reported. This high capacitance was attributed to the combination of the VPP technique and the porous fibrous structure of the cellulose matrix. The EDOT vapor penetrated and polymerized through the CP matrix made of nanometer to micrometer level CP fibers. The highest electrode volumetric capacitance achieved was 13.7 F/cm3. The whole device achieved an energy density of 0.76 mWh/cm3 and a power density of 0.01 W/cm3. Bending the supercapacitor to 90° or rotating to 45° caused no major change in capacitance. Owing to the all nonmetallic materials used to construct the supercapacitor, it can be easily disposed. The incineration of the supercapacitor does not release significant hazardous exhaust.
