Flower-shaped Co3O4 nanorods directly grown on nickel foam(Co3O4/NF) were prepared by one step hydrothermal method at low temperature. Co3O4 nanorods are directly connected with the nickel foam, and no binder is needed as an additive, so the Co3O4/NF electrode has good electrical conductivity. This flower-shaped structure makes larger surface area of Co3O4 nanorods that exposes to the electrolyte, thus promoting the redox reaction. The Co3O4/NF electrode shows a high specific capacitance of 2005.34 F/g at the current density of 0.5 A/g and a high capacitance retention of 98.0% after 5000 cycles. The high superior capacitive performance with high specific capacitance and the excellent cyclic performance indicate that the one step hydrothermal method has great potential application in supercapacitors.
