Ag-doped MnO 2 pseudocapacitor electrodes with dendrite and foam-like structures were successfully produced for the first time using an electrodeposition method employing structure-directing agents, i.e., sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) acting through micelle formation at solid-liquid interfaces. Doping silver with MnO 2 enhanced their electronic conductance. Controlling pseudocapacitor electrode morphologies with surfactants accelerated ion transport. The specific capacitance values of the Ag-doped MnO 2 films produced with SDS and CTAB, measured in 0.5 M Na 2SO 4 at a scan rate of 5 mV s -1 were 551 and 557 Fg -1, respectively. These values are about 2.7-fold higher than that of the pure MnO 2 film and about 1.4-fold higher than that of the Ag-doped MnO 2 film made without using surfactants. Â© Springer-Verlag 2012.
