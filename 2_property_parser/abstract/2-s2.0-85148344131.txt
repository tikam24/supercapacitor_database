Utilization of waste biomass into an economical high-performance energy storage device has become the focus of research in the fields of science and technology. The high cost of production and the low storage capacity of supercapacitors are one of the obstacles in the development of supercapacitors. In this study, raw materials for supercapacitor cell electrodes from hazelnut seed shell (HSS) biomass as a renewable carbon source with optimization of CO2 activation. Pre-carbonization, chemical activation of 0.3 M KOH, carbonization at a temperature of 600 °C, and physical activation with temperature of 700 °C, 800 °C, and 900 °C is a process used to convert HSS biomass into activated carbon material. Microstructure analysis shows that the HSS-800 carbon electrode is semicrystalline with the lowest Lc value of 9.339 nm. The HSS-800 carbon electrode also has good conductivity and wettability characteristics caused by the electrode containing the C–H, O–H, C[dbnd]O, and C[dbnd]C functional groups. Measurement of CV and GCD which showed that the largest Csp value was produced by the HSS-800 sample with Csp values of 166.42F g−1 and 137.6F g−1, respectively. Based on these results, activation of CO2 at a temperature of 800℃ produces carbon materials with the best performance which has the potential to be used as basic material for supercapacitor cell electrodes.
