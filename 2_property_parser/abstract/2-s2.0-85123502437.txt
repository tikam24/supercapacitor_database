Aqueous supercapacitors have the superiorities of high safety, environmental friendliness, inexpensive, etc. High energy density supercapacitors are not conducive to manufacturing due to the limitation of water thermodynamic decomposition potential, resulting in a narrow working voltage window. To address such challenges, a great endeavor has started to investigate high voltage aqueous supercapacitors as well as making some progress. This review summarizes key strategies regarding the realization of wide working voltage of aqueous supercapacitors and analyzes the involved mechanism, including the optimization of electrodes, electrolytes, diaphragms, and supercapacitor structures. From the perspective of extending the theoretical voltage window, electrode functionalization, heteroatom doping, neutral electrolyte, water-in-salt electrolyte, introducing redox mediators into electrolyte, and designing asymmetric structure are effective strategies for achieving this goal. Further, the actual voltage window can be maximized by optimizing the electrode mass ratio, adjusting potential of zero voltage, and electrode functionalization. The challenge and future of expanding working voltage of aqueous supercapacitors are further discussed. Importantly, this review provides inspiration for the development of supercapacitors with high energy density.
