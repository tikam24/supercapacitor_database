The Mn1-xNixCo2O4 (0.00 ≤ x ≤ 0.20) nanoparticles were synthesized by a simple PAN-solution route. XRD, TEM, SAED, FESEM, XANES, XPS, and BET techniques were used to investigate the structural and morphology of Ni-doped MnCo2O4 nanoparticles. The effect of Ni ions substitution in MnCo2O4 nanoparticles on the electrochemical properties was examined on three-electrode systems. The results show that the substitution of Mn with Ni ions can improve the electrochemical properties of MnCo2O4 nanoparticles. The Mn1-xNixCo2O4 electrode with x = 0.15 exhibits the highest specific capacitance of 378 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1. After 1000 charge-discharges times, this electrode has good capacity retention of 85%. The good capacitance characteristics and cyclic stability indicate that these Mn1-0.85Ni0.15Co2O4 nanoparticles could be applied as active materials for energy storage devices.
