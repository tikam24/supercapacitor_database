Relatively high cost is one of the biggest challenges for supercapacitors. Cheap carbon material expanded graphite (EG) was chosen to synthesize Ni(OH)2/EG composite by a facile microwave-assisted heating method. The Ni(OH)2/EG composites demonstrates a specific capacitance of 1569 F g−1 at current density of 1 A g−1 and 1077 F g−1 at current density of 10 A g−1, based on the total mass of Ni(OH)2/EG composite, conductive agent, and adhesive agent. The Ni(OH)2/EG composite exhibits not only high specific capacitance and rate capability, but also excellent cycling stability with 73% retention of initial specific capacitance after 1000 cycles at current density of 10 A g−1. An asymmetric supercapacitor AC//Ni(OH)2/EG was assembled and it demonstrates a comparable capacitance of 86.4 F g−1 at current density of 0.5 A g−1, an energy density of 37.7 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 490.9 W kg−1, and 26.1 Wh kg−1 at a high power density of 10.1 kW kg−1. After 1000 cycles at the current density of 5 A g−1, the specific capacitance can retain 80.1%. Therefore, the Ni(OH)2/EG composite will pave a promising way for supercapacitor-powered buses.
