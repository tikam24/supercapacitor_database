Energy sustainability is a foremost challenging goal that will lead to a promising mission in modern life in the long run. Such exceptional energy and power delivered supercapacitors is more suitable for many advanced device applications. In this study, we constructed an asymmetric combination using R7 and Ni-Co-Zn-S electrodes for supercapacitor applications. The asymmetric R7//Ni-Co-Zn-S exhibited a very high specific capacitance of 598 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with the operating voltage of 1.6 V in 3.5 M KOH medium. The calculated energy density of 53.1 Wh Kg−1 with the power density of 800 W kg−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1, indicates outstanding capacitive performance. And around 49% of energy density (24.5 Wh kg−1) was retained even at 10 A g−1 with high power density of 12,002 W kg−1. The results suggest that the R7//Ni-Co-Zn-S asymmetric system can be adapted to advanced energy storage devices in alkaline media for modern electronics industries.
