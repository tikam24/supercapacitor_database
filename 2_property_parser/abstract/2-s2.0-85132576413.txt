One-dimensional TiO2 nanobelts (TiO2 NBs) loaded with MnO2 nanoflakes (MnO2 NFs) were fabricated by coating of pre-synthesized H2Ti3O7 NBs with carbon layer followed by annealing in Ar atmosphere and hydrothermal treatment with KMnO4 solution. Then, disclosed by SEM and TEM inspections, interconnected MnO2 NFs were uniformly deposited on the surface of TiO2 NBs, forming the final products of TiO2@MnO2 nanobelts (TiO2@MnO2 NBs) with unique core–shell nanostructures. The supercapacitive properties of the TiO2@MnO2 NBs were studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. Compared with bare MnO2 NFs, the TiO2@MnO2 NBs exhibit enhanced rate performance and excellent cycle stability because of the synergistic effect of the two metal oxides. For instance, TiO2@MnO2 NB electrode released a specific capacitance of 113.3 F g−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 solution at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. After performing 10,000 charge–discharge cycles, such composite electrode retained 99.6% of the initial specific capacitance. We also constructed a TiO2@MnO2 NB//TiO2@MnO2 NB symmetrical supercapacitor device, which offered an energy density of 4.04 Wh kg−1 with long-term cycle stability. The satisfactory electrochemical behaviors would make TiO2@MnO2 NBs a reliable candidate material for the building of high-stability energy storage devices.
