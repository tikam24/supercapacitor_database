The electric double-layer capacitor (SuperCapacitor) is an energy storage/supply device that makes use of the electric double-layer phenomenon in which positive and negative charges are accumulated at the interface of a solid and liquid. NEC TOKIN has already produced the FC Series of SuperCapacitors with a 235°C reflow compatibility for use in surface mounting. Recently, NEC TOKIN has succeeded in the development of a high heat resistance product (FCS type SuperCapacitor) that has compatibility with lead-free solder reflow conditions (260°C reflow temperature). Details of this development are introduced in this paper.
