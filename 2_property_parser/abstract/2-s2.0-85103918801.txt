Three-dimensional (3D) core-shell structure of MnSn(OH)6 nanobox with MoS2 nanosheet is grown by series of simple steps for supercapacitor application. This core-shell is composited of MnSn(OH)6 nanobox as core and MoS2 nanosheet as shell. As-synthesized electrode material was characterized by Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). As-fabricated MnSn(OH)6@MoS2 electrode exhibited redox behavior with excellent specific capacitance of 1176 F g-1 at a current density of 4 A cm-2. These findings make MnSn(OH)6@MoS2 a better alternative source for energy storage devices.
