In this work, a high-performance asymmetric supercapacitor device based on NiCo 2 S 4 /NiS hollow nanospheres as the positive electrode and the porous activated carbon as the negative electrode was successfully fabricated via a facile two-step hydrothermal synthesis approach. This NiCo 2 S 4 /NiS//activated carbon asymmetric supercapacitor achieved a high energy density of 43.7 Wh kg −1 at a power density of 160 W kg −1 , an encouraging specific capacitance of 123 F g −1 at a current density of 1 mA cm −2 , as well as a long-term performance with capacitance degradation of 5.2% after 3000 consecutive cycles at 1 mA cm −2 . Moreover, the NiCo 2 S 4 /NiS electrode also demonstrated an excellent specific capacitance (1947.5 F g −1 at 3 mA cm −2 ) and an outstanding cycling stability (retaining 90.3% after 1000 cycles). The remarkable electrochemical performances may be attributed to the effect of NiS doping on NiCo 2 S 4 which could enlarge the surface area and increase the surface roughness.
