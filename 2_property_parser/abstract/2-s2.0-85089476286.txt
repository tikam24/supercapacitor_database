Electrochemically synthesized iron oxide thin films are deposited on stainless steel (1.5 × 5 cm) by using 0.1 M aqueous ferric chloride as a precursor solution. X-ray diffraction spectra of the prepared samples show orthorhombic crystal structure with polycrystalline in nature of iron oxide (Fe2O3) and field emission scanning electron microscopy micrographs show compact granular and mesoporous surface morphology. Prepared electrodes show mixed capacitive behavior, the highest specific capacitance of Fe2O3 (annealed at 300 °C for 1 h) is 408.45 F g–1 at 2 mV s–1 scan rate in 1 M Na2SO4. Charge–discharge behavior exhibits specific energy 8.41 W h kg–1, specific power 7.465 kW kg–1 and columbic efficiency 91% of the Fe2O3 electrode. Impedance spectroscopy carried from 1 mHz to 1 MHz frequency range reveals the capacitive behavior of the electrode and gives internal resistance of 2.35 ohm.
