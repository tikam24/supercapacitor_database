Herein, a novel three-dimensional hierarchical NiCo2O4/Ni2P structure is successfully fabricated through a facile hydrothermal and subsequent electrodeposition process. One-dimensional Ni2P nanoneedles decorate on two-dimensional NiCo2O4 nanosheets can effectively enhance the electrical conductivity and surface area of NiCo2O4 to promote fast Faradaic reaction. The optimized NiCo2O4/Ni2P-30 electrode exhibits a high specific capacity of 2900 F g−1 at 0.008 A cm−2. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is fabricated by using the NiCo2O4/Ni2P-30 as positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode, the device achieves an excellent electrochemical property with the energy density of 40.7 W h kg−1 at 800 W kg−1. Besides, the as-assembled device also exhibits an excellent cycling performance of ∼92.0% of initial capacitance after 5000 cycles indicating its outstanding conductivity and structural stability. All of the results demonstrate that the hierarchical NiCo2O4/ Ni2P composites are electrodes in energy storage application.
