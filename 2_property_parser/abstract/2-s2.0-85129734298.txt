Polymeric nanocomposite foams have attracted increasing research attention for technical reasons. Poly(methyl methacrylate) is a remarkable and viable thermoplastic polymer. This review highlights some indispensable aspects of poly(methyl methacrylate) nanocomposite foams with nanocarbon nanofillers (carbon nanotube, graphene, etc.) and inorganic nanoparticles (nanoclay, polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane, silica, etc.). The design and physical properties of poly(methyl methacrylate) nanocomposite foams have been deliberated. It has been observed that processing strategies, nanofiller dispersion, and interfacial interactions in poly(methyl methacrylate)â€“nanofiller have been found essential to produce high-performance nanocellular foams. The emergent application areas of the poly(methyl methacrylate) nanocomposite foams are electromagnetic interference shielding, sensors, and supercapacitors.
