N-doped carbons were fabricated from zeolite-templated carbon via modification with melamine and mild KOH activation. The N-doping treatment and KOH activation slightly lowered the surface areas of pristine zeolite-templated carbon; nonetheless, N-doped carbons with a lower surface area exhibited much higher capacitance and cycling stability as fabricated into symmetric supercapacitor. Significantly, N-doped carbon obtained at 700Â°C showed a capacitance of 45.7 F/g at 0.1 A/g and 42.0 F/g at 10 A/g for the fabricated supercapacitor with 6 M KOH electrolyte, with 92% retention of initial capacitance as current density increased up to 100-fold. This performance was attributed to the dual contribution of electric double-layer capacitance and pseudo-capacitance. The assembled supercapacitor also exhibited excellent cycling stability, with 91% capacitance retention at 10 A/g after 10000 cycles.
