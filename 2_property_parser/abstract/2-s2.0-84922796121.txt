Flexible strip supercapacitors are developed and their electrochemical properties are characterized. Activated carbon is used as the electrode material and it is found to have a good porous structure which provides a large surface area for energy storage. Furthermore, this activated carbon performs well. The manufacturing processes for the supercapacitors are described in detail and the preparation process has good reproducibility. The strip supercapacitors are combined in series and parallel to measure their electrical properties. The performances of these two samples in series or in parallel both follow the theoretical models. The electrochemical potential window of a series circuit of these two strip supercapacitors is 4.8 V. The energy and power of the series or parallel circuits are equal to the sums of the two strip supercapacitorsâ€™.
