Herein, three novel composites (CB/CoNiFe(SDS)–LDH, CNTs/CoNiFe(SDS)–LDH and CNFs/CoNiFe(SDS)–LDH) with high specific capacity and high retention were prepared by combining SDS intercalated CoNiFe-LDH with various carbon materials. The addition of SDS improved the layer spacing and induced the LDH nanosheets to form porous flower-like structures. This structure had more electrochemically active sites and facilitated charge/electrolyte ion transfer, resulting in a higher specific capacity of the material. The addition of carbon materials enhanced the overall electrical conductivity of the material, resulting in further performance improvements. Among the composites, CNFs/CoNiFe(SDS)–LDH exhibited exceptionally excellent electrochemical properties (203.3 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 71.3 % 1–30 A g−1). Then, asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) based on the composites and activated carbon (AC) were assembled. Compared to CB/CoNiFe(SDS)-LDH//AC and CNTs/CoNiFe(SDS)-LDH//AC ASCs, CNFs/CoNiFe(SDS)-LDH//AC ASC had larger specific capacitance (148.1 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and higher capacitance retention (56.2 %, 1–15 A g−1). After 10,000 cycles at 10 A g−1, the capacitance retention of the CNFs/CoNiFe(SDS)–LDH//AC, CB/CoNiFe(SDS)–LDH//AC and CNTs/CoNiFe(SDS)–LDH//AC ASCs were 85.0 %, 75.3 % and 85.2 %, showing good application prospects.
