Xylene-functionalized N-donor ligand p-BIMB (p = para position, BIMB = bis- (imidazole-1-ylmethyl)benzene) and rigid carboxylate linker trans-H2CHDA (CHDA = 1,4-cyclohexane(dicarboxylic)acid) were treated with Co(NO3)2 under solvothermal conditions to afford a new two-dimensional (2D) coordination polymer [Co(trans-H2CHDA)2(p-BIMB)2·2H2O]n (1). Complex 1 possesses a sql network. With the porosity formed by the 2D framework, the Co(II) complex 1 demonstrates an excellent specific capacitance of 563 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, and also good retention of capacitance (≈64% after 4000 cycles at 5 A g−1). Which make complex 1 a good candidate for electrode material in a supercapacitor application. Meanwhile, this Co(II) compound exhibits good adsorption ability for the permanganate anion.
