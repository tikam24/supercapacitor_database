Hierarchical porous carbons (HPCs) were obtained by carbonization of resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) gels prepared in the presence of a cationic polyelectrolyte as a soft template. The porosity of the gels is maintained during air drying due to the stabilizing effect of a cationic polyelectrolyte on the sol-gel nanostructure. The proposed method greatly simplifies the production of porous carbon by making it unnecessary to use complex drying procedures, cumbersome solvent exchanges, and long curing times. Additionally, pore size of the HPCs can be tailored (from mesoporous to macroporous range) by controlling the amount of polyelectrolyte in the initial stage of RF polymerization. The HPCs have a high specific surface area (up to 675m2/g), large specific capacitance (up to 140F/g) and areal capacitance (up to 0.1F/cm2), in acidic media. Significantly retention of the specific and areal capacitances of 72% are observed at high scan rates of 200mV/s, making it suitable as an active material for fast supercapacitor applications.
