In the recent years the demand of high energy density, high power density energy storage device with long cycle stability increased because of their vast applications from portable electronics devices to power tolls and hybrid electric vehicles. Also, the developments in renewable energy sources also created immediate demand for high energy density energy storage devices. Supercapacitors are found to be suitable to fulfill the current demand of energy storage devices. Transition metal nanomaterials are considered to store high charge because of their large surface area and variable oxidation states. In the present review, we discussed the recent advances in the area of supercapacitors using transition metal oxides, nitride, sulfides, diselenides, phosphides, and ferrites. The effect of surface morphology, synthesis process, and various doping/composites on specific capacitance of supercapacitors were discussed in detail.
