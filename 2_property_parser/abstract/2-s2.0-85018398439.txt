In this paper we present a general approach for the preparation of graphene-ZnO composite electrode material via hydrothermal method for supercapacitor applications. The sample was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Electrochemical properties of the electro-active material were analyzed by cyclic voltametry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). From XRD analysis ZnO nano-particles are homogeneous distribution on the graphene sheets. Sandwich-like composite structure morphology as confirmed by SEM analysis. In electrochemical performance, the composite electrode material leads to a high capacitance value found to be 719.2 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV/s. Based on the above results this electrode material exhibits the potential candidate material for supercapacitor applications.
