The research of energy storage systems in the DC link of a machine tool is focused on the choice of the appropriate type of the energy storage system (passive or active) and its control strategy considering better energy efficiency. For the control strategy of the DC/DC converter two ways were taken into account: the proportional-integral and predictive control strategies. The energy consumption model of the drive group was developed in Matlab/SimPowerSystems for quantitative comparisons of the proposed energy storage systems. The model was validated by measurements of energy consumption in the drive unit of a machining centre. Â© 2011 EPE Association - European Power Electr.
