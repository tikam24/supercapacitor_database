A Sb (6mol%)-doped SnO2 xerogel impregnated with RuO2 nanocrystallites is prepared via an incipient-wetness method and is optimized for its electrochemical capacitance in aqueous 1M KOH electrolyte by adjusting the calcination temperature and the RuO2 loading. The electrode capacitance does not increase monotonically with increasing RuO2 loading. A maximum electrode capacitance of 15Fg-1, which represents a three-fold increase compared with the blank xerogel and a specific RuO2 capacitance of 710Fg-1 RuO2, is obtained with a RuO2 loading of 1.4wt.% and by calcination at 200°C. Higher loadings presumably result in a homogeneous nucleation upon drying, which causes severe reduction in the total surface area of the RuO2 crystallites. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.
