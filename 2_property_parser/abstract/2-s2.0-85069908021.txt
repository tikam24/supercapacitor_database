Constructing the porous graphitic carbon materials based on the renewable biomass-derived raw materials has raised widely attention in recent years. Herein, this work proposes a cost-effective and eco-friendly approach for fabricating the highly graphitic porous carbon (HGPC) materials using leaves of viburnum sargenti for the first time. The as-prepared carbon sample exhibits a moderate specific surface area of 762.3 m2/g, a high oxygen content of 16.75 at.%, which could contribute additional pseudocapacitance during electrochemical reaction process. And the doping of nitrogen atom (0.53 at.%) could availably improve the conductivity. Consequently, the HGPC electrode delivers an excellent specific capacitance of 612.8 F/g at 0.5 A/g and a remarkable cycling stability with 96.02% capacitance retention over 10,000 cycles. Additionally, the assembled HGPC//HGPC symmetric supercapacitor presents an ultrahigh energy density of 25.6 Wh/kg at the power density of 450 W/kg. This facile technique holds great promise to offer an effective and universal methodology for fabricating renewable biomass-derived carbon materials for high-performance supercapacitors.
