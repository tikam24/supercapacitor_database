Reduced graphene oxide, polyaniline and nickel oxide ternary nanocomposites were synthesized in series by changing the weight ratio of polyaniline adopting in-situ single step chemical method. Their structural characterization was carried out, employing, powder-XRD, IR spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) techniques. Thus synthesized composites were tested for their electrode property by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with two electrode system using 6 M KOH as electrolyte at different weight ratio of polyaniline. Of all composites synthesized the one with polyaniline weight of 100 mg rendered the maximum capacitance of about 153.37 F g-1 with corresponding energy and power densities of 13.63 W h kg-1 and 392.54 W Kg-1,respectively. It exhibited 100% retention of its initial capacitance up to 10000 charge - discharge cycles. The obtained performance is superior to the binary combination of constituent materials, namely, reduced graphene oxide, polyaniline and nickel oxide.
