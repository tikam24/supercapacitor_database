Energy storage devices with the smart function of changing color can be obtained by incorporating electrochromic materials into battery or supercapacitor electrodes. In this review, we explain the working principles of supercapacitors, batteries, and electrochromic devices. In addition, we discuss the material candidates for electrochromic energy storages in detail. The challenges of the integrated electrochromic energy system for simultaneous realization of electrochromism and energy storage are specially highlighted.
