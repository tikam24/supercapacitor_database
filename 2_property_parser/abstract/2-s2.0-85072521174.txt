In this work, a facile and effective route is introduced to optimize the performance of biomass-based porous carbon materials by partially degrading the component (e.g., lignin, hemicellulose, and cellulose) of the raw materials with the following purposes: (i) collapse the organism to increase the porosity of the material and (ii) inhibit the generation of nonporous carbon sheets caused by lignin. The pretreated raw material (chestnut shell) shows a satisfactory outcome utilizing as carbon precursor, the specific surface area of the as-prepared hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) as high as 2621 m2 g-1, nearly a 45% promotion can be achieved compared with the control sample (CPC, 1802 m2 g-1). Thanks to the optimization of the structure, excellent electrochemical performances also have been achieved in the energy device, the HPC-based supercapacitor enjoys an appealing capacitance of 393.1 F g-1 more than the control sample (199.2 F g-1) and superb capacitance retention as high as 96% after 10 000 cycles in the 6.0 M KOH system. Moreover, a delightful energy density of 23.8 W h kg-1 can be delivered at 220 W kg-1 in the Na2SO4 system with a 1.8 V voltage window, exhibiting promising potential application in the energy device.
