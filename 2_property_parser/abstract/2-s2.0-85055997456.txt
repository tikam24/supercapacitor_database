A polymer electrolyte was developed by blending lithium (LiPAA) with non-ionic polyacrylamide (PAM). The LiPAA-PAM showed synergic effect and achieved an ionic conductivity of 13.8 ± 2.4 mS cm−1, higher than previously developed neutral pH polymer electrolytes. Chemical and structural characterizations of the LiPAA-PAM films revealed a stable homogeneous amorphous structure. The performance of double layer capacitors using LiPAA-PAM electrolyte system was demonstrated using YP-50F activated carbon electrodes. These solid cells demonstrated wide voltage window (1.5 V), good cycle life (>10,000 cycles), and excellent rate capability (up to 500 mV s−1 in cyclic voltammetry).
