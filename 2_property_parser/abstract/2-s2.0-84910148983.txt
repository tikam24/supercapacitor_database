The design of cost-effective electrocatalysts and supercapacitor electrode materials with delicate hierarchical morphologies and enhanced functionalities has great potential in energy conversion and storage processes. Here, a fast and efficient microwave-assisted oil-in-water microemulsion template hydrothermal method is applied for the synthesis of multiple components and functional mesoporous hollow NixCo3-x(PO4)2 shells. Due to the high surface area and correspondingly increased electroactive sites derived from the mesoporous and hollow characteristics, the obtained NixCo3-x(PO4)2 shells exhibit excellent performance as a non-enzymatic glucose sensor, non-precious metal electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and electrode material for energy storage.
