Mo3N2/MoO3 hybrid composites with a porous nanobelt structure are prepared by a generally applicable strategy. Benefiting from the unique porous nanobelt architecture and the synergistic contributions of the components, Mo3N2 /MoO3 hybrid exhibits excellent performance as a supercapacitors. Herein, Mo3N2 /MoO3 hybrid is explored as a potential capacitive material for the first time. This composite shows a significantly larger specific capacitance (282 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1 ) than a single component with outstanding cyclic stability (with 93% retention of the original specific capacitance even after 1000 CV cycles). An asymmetric supercapacitor device is also fabricated with a maximum energy density of 17.4 Wh kg−1 at 697 W kg−1.
