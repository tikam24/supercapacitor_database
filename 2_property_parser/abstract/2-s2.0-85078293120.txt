The surface modification of mesoporous carbon with polyaniline was carried out by the method of oxidative polymerization of aniline. It was found that the initial conditions for the synthesis and the percentage of carbon template in the reaction mixture have little effect on the course of temperature dependencies. However, these parameters affect the yield of the target product and the electrically conductive characteristics of the resulting materials. Composites with a polyaniline/mesoporous carbon mass ratio of 1:1 have better electrical conductivity. The electrical capacity of these samples in the aqueous electrolyte is 299.6 F/g, which is 3.5 times higher than in the organic electrolyte. Information on the polyaniline in the modifying layer on the surface of the mesoporous carbon was obtained by the method of Raman spectroscopy.
