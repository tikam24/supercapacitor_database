The poor electrical conductivity of the metal organic frameworks (MOFs) limits their application in the supercapacitors. Here we developed a versatile strategy to effectively incorporate the conductive polymer polypyrrole (PPy) into ZIF-67 by in-situ polymerization and crystallization. Attributed to the stereoscopic surrounding of ZIF-67 with the conductive PPy, which is helpful for fast transfer of the electron/ion, the ZIF-67/PPy heteroaerogel exhibits a high specific capacity (1241F g−1 at 1A g−1) and high stability with 91% retention rate after 10,000 cycles measurement at 10 A g−1. The appealing electrochemical performance of the ZIF-67/PPy heteroaerogel recommends its promising application in supercapacitors.
