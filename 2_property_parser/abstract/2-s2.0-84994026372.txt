Porous nanostructure composites materials had attracted widely attention due to their potential application in energy storage (Lithium ion batteries (LIBs) and supercapacitor) and electrocatalyst of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Co3O4@CoO@Co@C nanocomposites had been successfully synthesized using glucose as carbon source and cobalt nitrate as metalprecurs or of Co3O4@CoO@Co@C, which has excellent electrochemical performance for LIBs, supercapacitor and OER. Three kinds of morphology samples marked by Co3O4@CoO@Co@C-2/1, Co3O4@CoO@Co@C-1/1 and Co3O4@CoO@Co@C-1/2 are synthesized due to different atomic ratio of cobalt/carbon in precursors. Electrochemical and catalytic performance of Co3O4@CoO@Co@C-2/1 nanocomposites is more excellent than Co3O4@CoO@Co@C-1/1 and Co3O4@CoO@Co@C-1/2. Co3O4@CoO@Co@C-2/1 shows that discharge capacity can maintain 450 mA h g−1 and coulombic efficiency is nearly 100% during 500 cycles for LIBs. It indicates the excellent cycling stability of Co3O4@CoO@Co@C-2/1 as electrode for supercapacitor that about 78.3% of initial specific capacitance can be retained after 10000 cycles at current density of 2 A g−1. Co3O4@CoO@Co@C-2/1 as catalyst of OER shows excellent electrochemical durability over 15 hours continuous experiment.
