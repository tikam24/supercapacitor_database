In the past decades, over depletion of non-renewable energy sources, ecological concern and abruptly increasing energy demands prompted us to look towards clean energy conversion and storage systems. Electrospinning technology amends its versatility in producing nanofibers from a fewto hundred nanometers. The unique properties of 1-D nanofibers (NFs) with high surface to volume ratio and high porosity with low density prevailed them for potential energy application. NFs based materials have received significant attention in electrochemical supercapacitors in the pursuit of modern energy conversion and storage technologies. The present chapter intends to introduce an encompassing overview of electrospun nanofibersâ€™ progress in supercapacitor application. The entire chapter comprises four major parts. First part briefs about the introduction of supercapacitors for energy conversion devices. The second part encapsulates the types of supercapacitors, emphasizing their basic mechanisms for energy storage. Present supercapacitors-based technologies have redeemed electrospun NFs as cathodes, anodes, and electrolytes. Principle components of these devices like electrodes and electrolytes have extensively harvested the electrospun NFs in the form of nanowires and nanofibrous mats with different functionalities. The third part summarizes theNFs based on ongoing research on electrode materials for supercapacitors comprising carbon-based materials and nanocomposites, simple metal-oxides, perovskites, spinel-type oxides, etc. The fourth part deals with the electrospun membrane-based electrolytes for supercapacitors. Finally, the chapter concludes with a summary and future outlook of electrospun nanofibrous for advanced energy storage.
