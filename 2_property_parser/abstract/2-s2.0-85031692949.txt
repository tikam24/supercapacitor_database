Designing electrode materials with high specific capacitance is crucial for further improving the energy storage performance of supercapacitors. Nickel sulfide (NiS) nanosheets anchored on the surface of N-doped hollow carbon spheres (NiS/NHCS) were rationally designed and synthesized via a multistep transformation approach. Uniform nickel silicate nanosheets were first deposited on the surface of NHCSs, followed by chemical conversion into NiS nanosheets. The NiS/NHCS composite shows excellent electrochemical properties as an electrode material for supercapacitors. The NiS/NHCS electrode can deliver a high specific capacitance of 1150 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and show outstanding cycling performance with a retention rate of 76% over 4000 cycles, which are much higher than those of pure NiS hollow spheres (NiS-HS) (400 F g-1 and 63%, respectively). Moreover, a hybrid supercapacitor assembled with NiS/NHCS as the cathode and an activated carbon electrode as the anode delivers a high energy density of 38.3 W h kg-1 at a power density of 160 W kg-1 and has an excellent cycle performance with the retention rate of 96% after 5000 cycles. The exceptional electrochemical performance of the NiS/NHCS composite indicates its potential application in high-performance supercapacitors.
