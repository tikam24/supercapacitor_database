Flexible power packs combining a flexible photovoltaic part with a wearable all-solid-state supercapacitor as the self-sustaining energy system to power wearable device have attracted great interest due to the increasing demands for green energy and the tendency for multi-functionalization in electronics industry. To meet this energy requirement, we report an asymmetric all-solid-state supercapacitor, then integrate with commercial flexible solar cells to develop a self-sustaining power pack. In view of comfort for wearable electronics, cotton-textile radiation-proof clothes commonly used for pregnant woman cloth (PWC) are selected as the flexible substrate to construct wearable energy storage devices, which have the properties of flexible, green, renewable, breathable and excellent conductivity. Experimental tests demonstrate that the wearable asymmetric supercapacitors with high power density and relatively large energy density, fast charge/discharge capability, light-weight, excellent reliability and flexibility can enable the solar energy captured from the environment to afford a continuous and stable output of electric power and diminish the solar energy fluctuations. The supercapacitor is assembled with the Coâ€“Ni layered double hydroxides (Co-Ni LDH) nanosheets as the positive electrode and the FeOOH as the negative electrode. Furthermore, the fabricated self-sustaining power pack as the energy source can continuously power the press sensor for monitoring the human physiological signals regardless of the sunlight fluctuation, demonstrating its potential usage in future wearable and portable electronic devices.
