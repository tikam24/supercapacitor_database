Polyaniline (PANI)-based electrode devices were prepared on carbonized cotton fabric (CCF) by electrodeposition. Dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid (DBSA) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) are selected as the dopants. The electrochemical capacitance of the fabric electrode could be significantly improved due to the formation of unique PANI nanofibers (less than 500 nm in diameter) on the surface. In addition, the electrode with good electrochemical properties has been fabricated to be a solid-state flexible supercapacitor (SC), with an areal-specific capacitance of 759.02 mF/cm2 at the current density of 2 mA/cm2. At a power density of 27.13 mW/cm3, its energy density is 0.49 mWh/cm3. Meanwhile, the supercapacitor could maintain high capacitance under different bending angles, and its capacitance retention is 78.21% after 1500 cycles at 100 mV/s.
