The on-board energy system permits the storage/delivery energy in electrical vehicles. It can use different energy devices working together, like batteries and supercapacitors. The energetic performances of batteries make them efficient, but for supplying pulsating loads, supercapacitors must be added. In this paper, the design of the system is presented and the dynamic model is described using the Port-Hamiltonian formalism. The Passivity-Based Control strategy is proposed according to achieve the best energy management of the system. Simulation results of the system processes are presented in order to prove that the model and the control strategy applied can ensure the global system stability. Copyright Â© 2007IFAC.
