With the accelerated consumption of fossil fuels and the increasing energy crisis, supercapacitors, as new energy storage components, have attracted great attention from researchers. In this paper, biomass-based porous carbon was prepared by hydrothermal method, and the microstructure and elemental composition of the material were analyzed. The electrochemical properties of the electrode as a supercapacitor electrode material were studied. The results show that the specific capacity of the biomass-based tamarindus indica-derived porous carbon material increased from 166 F•g-1 to 232 F•g-1, indicating that doping can effectively improve the capacitance performance of biomass-derived porous carbon materials.
