Storage of energy is considered as the most germane technologies to address the future sustainability. In this study, aniline was chemically oxidized with a controlled concentration of pyrelenediimide tetracarboxylic acid (PDITCA) by ammonium persulfate to polyaniline salt (PANI-H2SO4-PDITCA), with nanorods morphologies, having a sensibly decent conductivity of 0.8 S cm−1, wherein H2SO4 was generated from ammonium persulfate during polymerization. PANI-H2SO4-PDITCA salt showed bathochromic fluorescence shift (595 nm) compared to PDITCA (546 nm). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area of the PANI-H2SO4-PDITCA-25 and PANI-H2SO4-PDITCA-50 were 18.3 and 21.4 m2 g−1, respectively. Furthermore, its energy storage efficiency was evaluated by supercapacitor cell configuration. The composite PANI-H2SO4-PDITCA-50 showed capacitance 460 F g−1 at 0.3 A g−1 and large cycle life 85,000 cycles with less retention of 77% to its original capacitance (200 F g−1) even at a better discharge rate of 3.3 A g−1. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
