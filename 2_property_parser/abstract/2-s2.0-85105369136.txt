In this paper, Kalman filter algorithm is used to calculate the target curve of wind power fluctuation. Utilizing the fast response characteristics of super-capacitors and the stable and efficient hydrogen generation characteristics of fuel cell electrolyzer, a hybrid energy storage control strategy for suppressing short-term wind power fluctuations was established. The traditional hybrid energy storage strategy to stabilize the wind power fluctuation control is to directly suppress the wind power by utilizing the characteristics of the energy storage device. In this paper, and double-reactors self-circulation coordinated control system is to divide supercapacitors into charge reactor and discharge reactor. While the wind power fluctuation is stabilized, the size of the SOC of the supercapacitor unit is judged. At the same time, the charge and discharge state is changed in turn by self-circulation. By coordinating the control of fuel cell and electrolyzer, the charged and discharge depth of double-reactors self-circulation coordinated control system is expanded. The hybrid energy storage coordinated control system not only greatly reduces the active power fluctuation produced by the wind gen is expandederators, improves the power quality, but also reduces the charge-discharge conversion times of the energy storage device and prolongs its life-span.
