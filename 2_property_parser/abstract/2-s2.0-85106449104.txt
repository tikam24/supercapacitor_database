Supercapacitors are electrochemical energy storage systems that depend on high-surface-area electrodes and can play a dominant role in areas that require high power delivery or uptake. And of various electrodes, biomass-derived carbonaceous electrodes have recently shown impressive promise in high-performance supercapacitors because of their widespread availability, renewable nature and low-cost electricity storage. Based on this, this review will discuss the current status of biomass-derived carbon materials in supercapacitors and highlight current research with a specific emphasis on the influences of structure and elemental doping on the electrochemical performance of corresponding carbon electrodes. This review will also discuss the gap between laboratory achievements and practical utilization in terms of these biomass-derived carbon materials and outline practical strategies for future improvement.
