The development and demonstration of a hybrid battery/supercapacitor energy storage system (ESS) onboard the Earth-orbiting CubeSat JPL/CSUNSat1 is described. The ESS is capable of supporting high power pulse currents (>10C-rate) at low temperature (<-40 Â°C). The primary operational phase of the technology demonstration mission includes the performance characterization of the ESS at various discharge rates (1-15 A) at moderate to low temperatures. The internal resistances obtained from JPL/CSUNSat1 telemetry under battery-only, supercapacitor-only, and hybrid operating modes of the ESS were consistent with ground test data. Despite the loss of telemetry downlinks due to the failure of a memory storage card in the later stages of the mission, ten charge/discharge cycles were performed successfully to validate an impedance-based performance model developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. This flight demonstrates the first use of supercapacitors within a hybrid energy storage subsystem in a space environment.
