This paper examines electric vehicle (EV) subsystems operation and will focus on power management (PM). PM is always concerned with the EVs battery performance, efficiency and lifetime. The battery plays a vital role in the EV's performance, to provide the vehicle driving system with the energy needed for operation. Lithium-ion batteries have emerged as the battery of choice for EV manufacturers due to their high energy density and lightweight as compared to other energy storage. For the safe and dependable functioning of EV batteries, condition assessment of the batteries is significant. This is attained by a battery management system (BMS). In addition to the BMS, the optimal flow of energy between the battery, converters and additional vehicle components should also be regulated. This is called a power management control (PMC), where the vehicle's optimum performance depends heavily on the nature of PMC. Therefore, the design of PMC is critical to reduce energy consumption, increase system efficiency and maximise battery life. This paper presents an overview of EVs battery modelling, technologies and properties. It shows the BMS performance indicator and the benefits of integrating battery and supercapacitor to optimise the energy consumption of EVs.
