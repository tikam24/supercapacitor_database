This paper deals with the real-time implementation of a robust control for electric vehicles, supplied by a battery/capacitor super capacitor hybrid energy storage system (HESS) and piloted via a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM). The main goals are to monitor the motor using the back-stepping control and to provide an efficient power management. This has been implemented by means of the DC bus regulation using an Hâˆž regulator, while a classical regulator is used to ensure a super capacitor (SC) voltage allowing a maximal availability during repetitive peak power, in order to ensure an optimal power flow to the load as well as to keep the SC operation in a safe voltage range. This original algorithm has been validated through experimental results provided by a tailor made test bench including both the HESS and the vehicle emulation controlled via two dSPACE 1104 cards. Furthermore, the back-stepping controller shows good dynamic performances, where the system reaches to track perfectly the speed profile, under tolerable torque and flux ripples.
