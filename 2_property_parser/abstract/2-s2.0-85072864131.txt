Porous activated carbon (AC) is prepared by the steam activation of biochar prepared from pyrolyzed pine nut shell as a precursor. The effects of various activation temperatures, activation times and steam flow rates on the structure and properties of the obtained ACs are compared and analyzed. The cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cycle stability properties of the ACs are measured in a three-electrode electrochemical system with 6 mol L-1 KOH solution as the electrolyte. The results show that an activation temperature of 850Â°C, an activation time of 60 min and a steam flow rate of 18 ml h-1 are the optimal conditions. The AC obtained under these conditions displays a specific surface area of 956 m2 g-1, a mesopore ratio of 37.1% and a specific capacitance of 128 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1. Moreover, the AC has a well-developed interconnected hierarchical pore structure including micropores, mesopores and macropores and a good capacitance retention rate of 98% at a current density of 5 A g-1 after 10000 cycles of testing. These high-performance ACs from biomass waste show potential industrial applications in energy storage.
