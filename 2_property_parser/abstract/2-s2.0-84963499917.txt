The present work is focused on the fabrication and characterization of a novel supercapacitor-based biosensor for the detection and quantification of low density lipoprotein. More specifically, graphene oxide was functionalized with hyperbranched polyethylenimine and subsequently incorporated into chitosan in order to obtain a nanocomposite film which was cast over a Pt disk electrode. Finally, the electrode surface was bio-functionalized with anti-apolipoprotein B-100 using the N-hydroxysuccimide/N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide chemical coupling approach. The material properties of the electrode were evaluated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. The supercapacitor-based biosensor exhibited good specificity and sensitivity to low density lipoprotein in the concentration range from 10 to 120 mg/dL and also excellent response times (∼1 s). Enhanced response time and specificity of the biosensor suggest that these materials may be utilized for guiding future of point-of-care devices.
