The study looks at a hybrid control approach for an islanded solar low voltage photovoltaic-based dc microgrid, with the goal of overcoming the limitations of both centralized and distributed control schemes. A Photo Volatile system with battery storage is used on bus 1, battery storage with supercapacitor is used on bus 2, and variable loads like automobile applications are used on bus 3. The suggested hybrid control approach is capable of effortlessly transitioning between high and low bandwidth communication to construct a distributed control system in the event of a central failure. The central supervisory control system is in responsible of adjusting grid settings as well as sending and receiving data to and from local node controllers, that govern bus voltage and energy management. The study demonstrates how system transients are absorbed using battery and supercapacitor devices during load changes. The simulation depicts the continuous flow of information and decision-making processes via each level of control while taking subsystem restrictions into consideration.
