The polyaniline (PANI) is an eco-friendly conductive polymer which has been considered for diverse applications. The partially oxidized phase of the PANI is useful for the charge storage application. Here, a unique nanograin/nanofiber structured PANI was grown on inexpensive stainless steel (SS) current collector by the simple oxidative polymerization process and its charge storage properties were systematically investigated. For that, the inexpensive successive ionic layer adsorption reaction method was used to grow a uniform nanostructured PANI on the SS conductor. This evolution of the nanostructure was studied with the Field emission scanning electron microscope. Furthermore, the as-prepared PANI was confirmed by the X-ray diffraction and the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. In the half cell electrochemical testing, the prepared PANI exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 710 F g−1 with a specific discharge capacity of 119 mAh−1 at 0.2 mA cm−2 in 1 M H2SO4 for the supercapacitor application. Also, by using the power-law relation it was observed that, in a charging and a discharging current, initially a contribution of the diffusive faradaic reactions is more as compared with the surface capacitive non-faradaic reactions.
