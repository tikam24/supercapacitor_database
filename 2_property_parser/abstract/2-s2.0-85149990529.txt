ZIF-8 is an excellent precursor or template for preparing nitrogen-doped porous carbon materials for supercapacitor electrodes. However, the porous carbon materials obtained by direct high-temperature carbonization of ZIF-8 have limited specific surface area and only microporous structure. These inhibit the electrolyte penetration and ion diffusion, which seriously affecting their electrochemical performance. In this work, nano-polyhedron nitrogen-doped porous carbon materials are prepared as electrode materials by a simple one-step heat treatment of ZIF-8 and polyvinylpyrrolidone complexes, and the effects of carbonization temperature and the content of polyvinylpyrrolidone are investigated for their capacitive performance. The introduction of polyvinylpyrrolidone in the ZIF-8 frame not only provides carbon and nitrogen sources, but also can effectively increase the specific surface area and optimizes pore size distribution after carbonization. Electrochemical tests show that the reversible specific capacitance is 296 F g−1 at the current density is 0.5 A g−1, and the capacity retention rate is 76% at 5 A g−1. Therefore, this work provides a new idea for exploring carbon material with excellent electrochemical properties for application in the field of supercapacitors.
