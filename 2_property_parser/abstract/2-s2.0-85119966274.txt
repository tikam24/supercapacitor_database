Porous carbon has been one of the most promising electrode materials for supercapacitors, and the carbon precursor has a significant impact on the properties of final products. Herein, we report an efficient method to prepare hierarchically porous carbon (HPC) using a hard-soft carbon precursor by mixing biomass and pitch, following with carbonization and KOH activation. Combining the advantages of each single precursor, the resultant RH1SP1-HPC presents a high surface area of 2996 m2 g-1 with the fabrication of a 3D interconnected porous structure and good conductivity. Benefiting from these features, RH1SP1-HPC exhibits a superior electrochemical performance compared with the samples derived from a single precursor with a high specific capacitance of 340 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 in a two-electrode system and outstanding rate capability of 87.6% capacitance retention at 20 A g-1. The enhanced capacitive performance demonstrates that the hard-soft carbon precursor is desirable to synthesize porous carbons for energy storage.
