The hydrothermal method was used to study the reaction of citric acid with KMnO4 at relatively low temperatures at the presence of graphene. The influence of molar ratio of KMnO4 to citric acid, morphologies and electrochemical performance of compounds were investigated. The structure and the morphology of samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction(XRD), scanning electron microscopy(SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The electrochemical performance of the samples was also tested. The results showed that the MnOOH/graphene composite with the nanorod structure reacted from the KMnO4 to citric ratio of 8:3 had the best super-capacitance. The specific capacitance could reach 267.7 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g with excellent cycle stability.
