Glycine-assisted polyaniline-NiCo2O4 composite porous powder was synthesized by a simple chemical method. The FT-IR and UV-visible spectroscopy analysis confirmed the presence of the corresponding functional groups. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the porous morphology of NiCo2O4 and a brush-like morphology of PANi-NiCo2O4 composite which helps in enhancing the electrochemical performance of the composite. The X-ray diffraction pattern indicates the spinel crystal phase of NiCo2O4 in the synthesized sample. Cyclic voltammetry and impedance analysis were done to understand the electrochemical performance of the material. The specific capacitance calculated by galvanostatic charge-discharge method was found to be 687.5 F/g for PANi-NiCo2O4, whereas for NiCo2O4 and pure PANi, it was 458.5 F/g and 373.75 F/g respectively. Cyclic stability analysis showed 88% retention of specific capacitance over 1000 cycles for the as-synthesized PANi-NiCo2O4 sample.
