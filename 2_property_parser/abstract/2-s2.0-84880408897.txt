Supercapacitors are nowadays considered to be one of the most important electrochemical storage devices. These devices display high power and extraordinary cycle life, and they are currently used in an increasing number of applications. However, in order to further increase the applications of supercapacitors, an increase in their energy capacity appears to be necessary. Moreover, the development of safe and environmentally friendly supercapacitors is also required. In this article, we illustrate the contributions ionic liquids (ILs) might play in the development of high energy and safe supercapacitors. First, the use of ILs as electrolytes in supercapacitors is considered, and the advantages as well as challenges related to the use of this kind of electrolyte are analyzed. Next, the interaction between ILs and electrode materials is taken into account, with particular attention paid to inactive components of supercapacitor electrodes. The introduction of natural cellulose as a binder is used as an example of the contribution ILs might provide to the development of environmentally friendly supercapacitors.
