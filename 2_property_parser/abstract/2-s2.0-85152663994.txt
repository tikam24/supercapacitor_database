Supercapacitors have drawn a lot of interest because of their incredibly high capacitance and practically limitless cycle life. Supercapacitor storages that can operate independently are extremely close. Lightweight supercapacitors with greater energy storage capacity are expected to be developed through more improvements. With its distinct and novel features, pencil graphite (PG)–turned graphene oxide (GO), a new carbon compound, could be used as an electrode in a supercapacitor due to its distinctive and innovative properties. As part of the preliminary investigation, low-cost graphene electrodes that can be made with basic laboratory apparatus were used. They were made of graphite of grade 4B pencil lead. The time-consuming process of cleaning solid electrodes can be avoided because PGGO are affordable, useful, and can be utilized as disposable electrodes. It is a frequently used electrode that is non-toxic, environmentally safe, and easily renewable. It was supported by electrochemical characterization in a 2 M KOH electrolyte. The electrode’s specific capacitance was 286.03 Fg−1 at 0.5 Ag−1. The capacitor had a 149.98 Wkg−1 power density and a 14.30 Whkg−1 energy density. Ninety-five percent of the capacitance was still present after 2000 cycles, demonstrating exceptional longevity and dependability. Applications of such materials are listed in order to meet the specific criteria for the design of sophisticated supercapacitor devices.
