In this work, a composite electrode was fabricated by chemical deposition of polydopamine (PDA) and graphene oxide (GO) on the copper foam (CF) surface, followed by annealing treatment. Owing to the cohesive effect of the PDA middle film, GO was coated on CF surface successfully, and then reduced simultaneously while annealing. The resulted rGO/PDA/CF composite electrode was directly used as a supercapacitor electrode and exhibited excellent electrochemical performance, with a high specific capacitance of 1250 F g-1 at 2 A g-1 and favorable cycle stability.
