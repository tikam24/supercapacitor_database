In this study, flexible and low-cost graphite sheets modified by atmospheric pressure plasma jet are applied to reduced-graphene-oxide/polyaniline supercapacitors. Surface treatment by atmospheric pressure plasma jet can make the hydrophobic surface of graphite into a hydrophilic surface and improve the adhesion of the screen-printed reduced-graphene-oxide/polyaniline on the graphite sheets. After the fabrication of reduced-graphene-oxide/polyaniline supercapacitors with polyvinyl alcohol/H2SO4 gel electrolyte, pseudo-capacitance and electrical double capacitance can be clearly identified by the measurement of cyclic voltammetry. The fabricated supercapacitor exhibits specific capacitance value of 227.32 F/g and areal capacitance value of 28.37 mF/cm2 with a potential scan rate of 2 mV/s. Meanwhile, the capacitance retention rate can reach 86.9% after 1000-cycle cyclic voltammetry test. A light-emitting diode can be lit by the fabricated reduced-grapheneoxide/ polyaniline supercapacitors, which confirms that the supercapacitors function well and can potentially be used in a circuit.
