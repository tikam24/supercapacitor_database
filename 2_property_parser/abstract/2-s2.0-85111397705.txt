Developing high-performance, robust and economic supercapacitors is a promising path to the future electric vehicle technology. Herein, a hierarchically porous CeO2micro rice was attached onto a Ni foam (NF) surfaceviaa facile hydrothermal approach. The fabricated binder-free electrode exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 728.3 F g−1in a 3 M KOH electrolyte. Further, this value was improved to 2319.5 F g−1by the 3 M KOH + 0.2 M K4[Fe(CN)6] redox additive electrolyte. The improved electrochemical performance was achieved by reversible redox reactions that occurred in the electrolyte due to the inclusion of 0.2 M K4[Fe(CN)6]. The as-prepared binder-free electrode has retained 85.3% of its initial capacitance in 3 M KOH, even after 5000 cycles, and in the redox additive electrolyte, the retention increased to 92.7%. The highest energy and power density of 39.6 W h kg−1and 550 W kg−1, respectively, were achieved in the redox additive electrolyte.
