Magnesium cobaltite (MgCo2O4) nanofibers have been prepared by a sol–gel electrospinning method. The effect of calcination temperature (500, 600, and 700 °C) on the physical properties of the product have been investigated by various techniques, such as TG/DTA, XRD, BET, FTIR, FESEM, EDS, and DRS. The XRD patterns indicated the co-existence of two phases of MgCo2O4 and MgO, and calcination at higher temperatures favored the MgCo2O4 spinel phase of the nanofibers. Optical studies have revealed that the band gap narrowed from 3.88 to 3.80 eV with increasing calcination temperature. The specific surface areas of the samples evaluated by the BET method concomitantly decreased from 34.65 to 6.48 m2 g−1 as the calcination temperature was increased from 500 to 700 °C. FESEM images revealed that calcination at higher temperatures interrupted the fiber structure and decreased the aspect ratio, ultimately leading to a rod-like morphology at 700 °C. The electrochemical performances of the MgCo2O4 electrodes have been assessed by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). According to the CV results, the maximum specific capacitance observed for the electrode material calcined at 500 °C was 324 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, making it promising for application in pseudocapacitors. Moreover, the GCD results demonstrated that the sample calcined at 500 °C delivered a specific capacitance of 210 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and that the capacitance retention was 87.80% after 3000 charge–discharge cycles at a current density of 3 A g−1, suggesting high cycling stability.
