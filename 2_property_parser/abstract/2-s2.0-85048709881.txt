A layered structural MOF [Ni(Hppza)2]n (1) was synthesized and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, elemental analyses and IR spectroscopy. For complex 1, the crystal structure is extended into 3D structure through N–H···O hydrogen bond. And for the first time, this complex used as an electrode material for a supercapacitor. It exhibited large specific capacitance of 184 F g−1 can be achieved at rates of 5 mV s−1. The value demonstrated the best performance of all the MOF materials in supercapacitor at present. Such an excellent electrochemical property may be attributed to the intrinsic characteristics of Ni-MOF material including its crystal structure and morphology.
