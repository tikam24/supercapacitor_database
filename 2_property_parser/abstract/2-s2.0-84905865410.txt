A Polyaniline-Supercapacitor with quinone electrolytes remains stable over 50 000 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles. The quinones provide superior stability by preventing the conversion of porous polyaniline to a highly reactive state. Our work shows that highly stable polymer-supercapacitors can be engineered by combining electrochemically active polymers and redox-active electrolytes with concerted electrochemical properties.
