A techno-economical optimization framework is used to design and optimize an off-grid solar-biogas hybrid renewable energy system that uses five percent glycerin for feedstock. A self-modelled algorithm and an iterative numerical modelling approach are used to optimize the system. Based on the optimization results, a 254 kW solar plant operating at a 15 percent capacity factor was needed. It was determined that the biogas system would require 310 m3storage capacity at 10 atm pressure, two turbines rated at 20 kW and 25 kW, and a 100 kWhr supercapacitor. A pumped hydro storage (PHS) system with a capacity of 1880 m3 and two turbines rated at 40 kW and 50 kW was required to store the surplus energy generated. As a result, the system will be able to meet the energy demand of a dairy plant with an annual surplus of 8.3 MWhr. Furthermore, the plant does not have any significant environmental impact.
