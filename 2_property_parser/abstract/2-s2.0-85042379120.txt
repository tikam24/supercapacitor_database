Size and shape controlled nickel oxide/nickel vanadate (NiO/Ni3V2O8) nanocomposites were achieved by solvothermal method. Ammonium metavanadate and nickel chloride precursor solution in appropriate proportion was dissolved in solvent with sodium hydroxide as reducing and stabilizing agent. Three different products were obtained by varying solvothermal processing time as 10 h, 14 h and 18 h at 160 °C. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), Raman and photo luminescence (PL) studies substantiate NiO/Ni3V2O8 formation. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) studies provides detailed information about NiO/Ni3V2O8 nanorods configuration. Electrochemical studies were carried out to understand pseudocapacitive properties of obtained products. Estimated specific capacitance for product PVK1 has superior value as 653 Fg−1 at current density 1 Ag−1 due to nanorods regular arrangement with uniform size distribution.
