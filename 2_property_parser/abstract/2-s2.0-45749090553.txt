A new water soluble elastomer was evaluated as a binder with LiFePO 4 -VGCF cathode material in Li-ion batteries and different carbon origin anodes. The electrochemical characteristics of this cathode and anodes were compared to that with PvdF-based cathode binder. The elastomer-based cathode and anodes show high flexibility with good adhesion. The electrochemical performance was also evaluated and compared to PvdF-based cathodes at 25° and 60°C. A lower irreversible capacity loss was obtained with the elastomer-based cathode and graphite-based anode , The Li-ion gel electrolyte developed by Hydro-Québec shows high stable cycle life but lower power density at rates less than 5C compared to liquid electrolytes copyright The Electrochemical Society.
