In the present work is studied the effect of two types binders (polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)) on the pore structure of chosen nanocarbons as electrode materials for symmetric supercapacitors. The PVDF influences both the micro and macro pores, while PTFE attacks preferentially the macropores. The commercial product TDA-Research with PTFE binder, which possess the highest micropore volume and micropore surface, shows the highest and stable discharge capacity in comparison to both other studied carbons. The addition of 6.2% Î²-Ni(OH)2 to the positive electrode in the supercapacitor increases the discharge capacity significantly (around 35-40% at 30-60 mAg-1). The obtained result is promising and it deserves further examination.
