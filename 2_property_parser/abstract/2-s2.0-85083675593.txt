In this study, binary (CB/MnO2) and ternary nanocomposites (CB/MnO2/PPy) include carbon black (CB) and manganese (IV) oxide (MnO2) and polypyrrole (PPy) were chemically synthesized and were characterized by many techniques such as : FTIR-ATR, Raman spectroscopy, SEM-EDX, TGA-DTA analysis, XRD, TEM and BET surface analysis. Electroactive materials were used as a symmetric supercapacitor device system and taken 3 methods (cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)). CB/MnO2/PPy nanocomposite at [CB]o/[MnO2]o/[Py]o = 1:1:3 showed a highest specific capacitance of C sp = 273.2%F/g at a scan rate of 1 mV/s in 1 M H2SO4 solution. This nanocomposite combination supplies higher energy and power densities of supercapacitor device (E = 0.5513 Wh/kg and P = 91.556 W/kg at 6 mV/s). Equivalent circuit model of R s(C 1(R 1(C 2(R 2 W)))) was used to analyze circuit parameters. Furthermore, the symmetric device for CB/MnO2/PPy nanocomposite at [CB]o/[MnO2]o/[Py]o = 1:1:5 shows an excellent long cycle life with 92.20% of initial capacitance retention after 1000 cycles. CB/MnO2/PPy nanocomposite electrode can be a candidate for supercapacitor applications.
