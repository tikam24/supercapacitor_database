In this work, a feasible one-pot approach to synthesize manganese oxide/graphene composites, the so-called plasma-enhanced electrochemical exfoliation process (PE3P), has been developed. Herein, a composite of graphene decorated with manganese oxide nanoparticles was prepared via PE3P from a KMnO4 solution and graphite electrode under a voltage of 70 V in an ambient environment. By controlling the initial KMnO4 concentration, we obtained distinct MnO2/graphene samples. The prepared samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The electrochemical measurements of the MnO2/graphene composites revealed that the specific capacitance of the samples is approximately 320 F g-1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s-1, which is comparably very high for manganese oxide/carbon-based supercapacitor electrode materials. Considering the simple, low-cost, one-step and environmentally friendly preparation, our approach has the potential to be used for the fabrication of MnO2/graphene composites as the electrode materials of supercapacitors.
