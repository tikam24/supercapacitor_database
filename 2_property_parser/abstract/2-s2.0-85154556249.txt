With the increasing proportion of green energy in the human energy supply, the development of environmentally friendly and efficient energy storage devices is becoming more and more urgent. Among them, supercapacitors have received extensive attention due to their high-current chargeâ€“discharge characteristics. Biomass-derived carbon materials have become a research hotspot for supercapacitor electrode materials due to their structural diversity, renewability, wide availability, environmental friendliness, and low cost. This review will briefly introduce the precursors and preparation methods of biomass-derived carbon materials. More importantly, we will focus on reviewing the applications of biomass-derived carbon materials of different dimensions as electrode materials for supercapacitors. We hope that paper can provide some creative inspiration for the further research of biomass-derived carbon materials and their composites in the field of energy storage devices.
