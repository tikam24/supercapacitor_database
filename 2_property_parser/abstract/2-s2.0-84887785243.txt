In this article, we report the application of a non-vacuum based direct printing technique of electrohydrodynamic atomization (EHDA) for the deposition of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) thin films of 90 nm thickness onto flexible polyethersulfone (PES) substrates. The optimization of EHDA process to achieve a stable cone jet for the uniform deposition of SWCNT thin films is discussed in detail. The physico-chemical characterization of SWCNT thin films has been carried out using X-ray diffraction, UV-vis spectroscopy and Fourier-transform infra red spectroscopy techniques. The field emission scanning electron microscope studies revealed the surface morphology of SWCNT thin films. Further, the electrical study of the SWCNT thin films exhibited a linear ohmic behavior at room temperature as well as at elevated temperatures. Â© 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.
