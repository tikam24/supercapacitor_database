Supercapacitors, also known as electrochemical capacitors, have attracted more and more attention in recent decades due to their advantages of higher power density and long cycle life. For the real application of supercapacitors, there is no doubt that cyclic stability is the most important aspect. As the core component, electrode materials determine the cyclic stability of supercapacitors, although the other components like electrolyte and separator are also important. In this review, we sum up the cyclic stability of supercapacitors according to type of electrode material and its energy storage mechanism, discuss the strategies to boost the stability of those electrode materials, and indicate several key significant considerations in measurement of cyclic stability. The purpose is to obtain safe, long-lasting, and high-performance supercapacitor devices.
