We report the proof-of-concept of the TransCap, a monolithically integrated device that exhibits the storage properties of a supercapacitor and the low-voltage operation of an electrolyte-gated transistor. The proof-of-concept is based on coupling a polymer channel with a high surface area carbon gate, employing an ionic liquid as the electrolyte. The possibility to recover the stored energy from the TransCap permits us to use it to power different microelectronic components.
