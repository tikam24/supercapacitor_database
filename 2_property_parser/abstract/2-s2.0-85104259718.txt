This work focuses on the development of a novel type of chemically activated carbon networks composited with the graphene oxide. Here, the carbon networks were derived from green biomass wastes such as orange peels, banana peels and potato starch. All the obtained carbon materials were being activated using different activating agents based on the higher specific capacitance such as phosphoric acid activated orange peel derived carbon, sulphuric acid activated banana peel derived carbon and hydrochloric acid activated potato starch. Further they were individually composited with graphene oxide for enhanced performance. Different chemical activation is employed for the sake of obtaining higher specific capacitance, energy and power density. Phosphoric acid activation on orange peel derived carbon network was selected due to the improvement in the micropores and further increased the surface area with the controlling capability of structures of activated carbon. To improve the conductivity of the samples, graphene oxide was added. The electrochemical performance of orange peel, banana peel and potato starch derived nano porous activated carbon materials composited with graphene oxide for supercapacitor applications is evaluated using aqueous H2SO4 electrolytes at a scan rate of 10 mV s-1. The samples that are prepared are structurally characterized using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction and electrochemically characterized using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge and discharge measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. From the electrochemical measurements, suitability of material as electrode for supercapacitors can be understood. The superior electrochemical performance is attributed in orange peel derived nano porous carbon/ graphene oxide due to porous structure.
