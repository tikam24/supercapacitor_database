The electrochemical performances of the composite material based on activated carbon and LiMn 2O 4 were characterized by rate charge-discharge, cyclic voltammograms and electrochemical impedance spectra. It is demonstrated that the composite material has advantages of both the high power density of the supercapacitor and the high energy density of the lithium ion battery. Moreover, the electrochemical measurements also show that the composite material has good cycle life performance. At 10C rate, the discharge capacity of the composite material (80% LiMn 2O 4+20% activated carbon, mass fraction) is 76.4 mAÂ·h/g, which is greatly improved compared with that of LiMn 2O 4. The capacity loss in constant current-constant voltage mode is no more than 0.01% after 100 cycles.
