Supercapacitor battery stacks (SBS) are widely used in energy storage systems and electric vehicles. The stricter requirements for their reliability, safety and reduction of unexpected failures necessitate an analysis of their maintainability, availability and expected failures. An analysis of the maintainability and availability of supercapacitor battery stacks is particularly important when these devices are used in systems with uninterruptible processes and in electric vehicles. For the evaluation of the availability and expected failures of SBS it is necessary to apply three types of analysis- A n analysis of failure rates of supercapacitors or SBSs, a probability analysis (also called Markov Analysis) and Theory for Preventive Maintenance to define the time to perform the maintenance, repair activities and probability for failure-free operation of the SBSs after performed activities. In combining these three types of analysis it is possible to determine the probability states, expected failures, effectiveness of possible protection circuits, maintenance activity and redundancy of SBS.
