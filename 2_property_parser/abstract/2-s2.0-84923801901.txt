Graphene-based supercapacitors and related flexible devices have attracted great attention because of the increasing demands in the energy storage. As promising three-dimensional (3D) nanostructures in the supercapacitor electrodes, graphene-based aerogels have been paid dramatic attention recently, and numerous methods have been developed for enhancing their performance in energy storage. In this study, an exclusive strategy is presented toward directly in situ growing reduced graphene oxide (RGO) aerogels inside the 3D porous carbon fabrics for engineering the interfaces of the resulting binary 3D architectures. Such unique architectures have shown various advantages in the improvements of the nanostructures and chemical compositions, allowing them to possess much enhanced electrochemical properties (391, 229, and 195 F g-1 at current densities of 0.1, 1, and 5 A g-1, respectively) with excellent cycling stability in comparison with the neat RGO aerogels. The results of the performance in the flexible all-solid-state supercapacitors along with discussion on the related mechanisms in the electrochemical properties indicate the remaining issues and associated opportunities in the development of advanced energy storage devices. This strategy is relatively facile, versatile, and tunable, which highlights a unique platform for engineering various 3D porous structures in many fields.
