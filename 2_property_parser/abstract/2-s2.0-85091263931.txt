Background: In this paper, the supercapacitor based on the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) electrodes has been fabricated. Objective: The polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were used as a gel elec-trolyte. Methods: The electrodes and electrolytes thin films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The specific capacitance (Cs) of the CNTs-based supercapacitor has been measured using the cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic methods. For the scan rate, 20 mV s-1 the Cs of the CNTs-based supercapacitor was 173 F g-1. Results: Using the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy the Nyquist curve has been plotted. The reactance capacitance and the equivalent series resistance of the CNTs-based supercapacitor with PVDF/PVA gel electrolytes were 90 Ω and 25 Ω respectively. Conclusion: Also, few patents for the CNTs-based supercapacitor have been reviewed and cited. The CNTs-based supercapacitor proposed a new structure solid-state and flexible supercapacitor with high performance.
