The proceedings contain 70 papers. The topics discussed include: effects of morphological and structural properties of zinc oxide nanostructures on the performance of an ultraviolet detector; chemical exfoliation and microwave absorption of reduced graphene oxide synthesized from old coconut shells; antimicrobial activity analysis of Piper betle Linn leaves extract from Nganjuk, Sidoarjo and Batu against escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; synthesize of rGO from coal (sub-bituminous) as a counter-electrode on dye-sensitized solar cells; characterization and classification of purity of limestone in Madura Island for industrial application; effect of aqueous electrolyte to the supercapacitor electrode performance made from sugar palm fronds waste; and study of electronic and magnetic properties of single layered graphene with vacancy and (-OH) adsorption by density functional theory calculation.
