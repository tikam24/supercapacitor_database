Porous carbon with high specific surface area (SSA), a reasonable pore size distribution, and modified surface chemistry is highly desirable for application in energy storage devices. Herein, we report the synthesis of nitrogen-containing mesoporous carbon with high SSA (1390 m2 g-1), a suitable pore size distribution (1.5-8.1 nm), and a nitrogen content of 4.7 wt % through a facile one-step self-assembly process. Owing to its unique physical characteristics and nitrogen doping, this material demonstrates great promise for application in both supercapacitors and encapsulating sulfur as a superior cathode material for lithium-sulfur batteries. When deployed as a supercapacitor electrode, it exhibited a high specific capacitance of 238.4 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and an excellent rate capability (180 F g-1, 10 A g-1). Furthermore, when an NMC/S electrode was evaluated as the cathode material for lithium-sulfur batteries, it showed a high initial discharge capacity of 1143.6 mA h g-1 at 837.5 mA g-1 and an extraordinary cycling stability with 70.3 % capacity retention after 100 cycles. Nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon: Nitrogen-containing mesoporous carbon (NMC) with a highly developed mesopore structure has been prepared through a facile one-step self-assembly process. Electrochemical studies have demonstrated it to be a promising electrode material for high-performance electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and Li-S batteries.
