The synthesis of 2D electrode material is always a focus for supercapacitors. The MoO3 nanoplates are fabricated via heat-treating the mixture of C3N4 as a sacrificial soft template and ammonium molybdate at a high temperature. The TEM results show that it exhibits obvious nanoplate morphology. The temperature and mass ratio of ammonium molybdate to C3N4 are adjusted and these influences on electrochemical performance are investigated. MoO3 nanoplates can reach a high specific capacitance of 994.2 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in an acid electrolyte under optimized conditions. Moreover, the assembled YP50//MoO3 device can achieve a high energy density of 35.5 W h kg−1.
