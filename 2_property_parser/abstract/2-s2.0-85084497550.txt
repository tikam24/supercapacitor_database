Hybrid Electric vehicles are widely considered as the emerging solutions for green technology in the field of transportation due to their user and eco-friendly interface. The conventional energy storage system is prone to multiple types of faults, discharging problems and many more. To overcome these constraints, this paper develops a hybrid battery ultra-capacitor system with optimized control for hybrid electric vehicles. This aims at constructing an energy model of an electric vehicle powered by a hybrid energy system with the help of simulation tools. A hybrid controller is proposed to control the power flow and charging of battery ultra-capacitor system. The hybrid controller adapts fuzzy logic control for intelligent operation and particle swarm optimization for updating the weights of fuzzy. The results depicted an efficient operation of the proposed hybrid energy storage with the adapted controller. Further the results are compared with the standard European driving cycle.
