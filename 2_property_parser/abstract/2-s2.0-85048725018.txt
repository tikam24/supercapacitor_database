Expanded graphite (EG) - polypyrrole (PPy) hybrid nanocomposites are used for the fabrication of paper-based highly flexible supercapacitor devices. Brush-painted EG electrodes are utilized as electrodes for the electrodeposition of PPy, resulting in the formation of nanocomposite electrodes with the desired material loading. Fabricated paper-based electrodes are free from heavy current collectors, binders, and conductive additives. Within nanocomposite electrodes, expanded graphite layer on paper facilitates the charge transfer and conformal PPy layer atop improves capacitance through pseudocapacitance. Fabricated nanocomposite electrodes are highly flexible, thanks to excellent mechanical integrity among paper, EG and PPy components. A specific capacitance of 177.8 F gâˆ’1, in conjunction with a capacity retention of more than 94.9% is obtained following 5000 cycles. With the simple fabrication and promising electrochemical performance obtained herein, fabricated paper-based nanocomposite supercapacitors are envisaged for utilization as power sources in paper electronics.
