The hybridization of carbon nano-materials enhances the efficiency of each function of the resulting structure or composites. Also, the addition of non-carbon elements to nanomaterials modifies the electrochemical properties. Electrodes combining porous carbon nanofibers (CNFs) and metal oxides benefit from the combination of the double-layer capacitance of the CNFs and the pseudocapacitive character associated with the surface redox-type reactions. Consequently, they demonstrate superior supercapacitor performance in terms of high capacitance, high energy/power efficiency and high rate capability. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the latest advances made in the development and application of various metal oxide/CNF composites (CNFCs) to supercapacitor electrodes.
