The increased demand of energy due to the recent technological advances in diverse fields such as portable electronics and electric vehicles is often hindered by the poor capability of energy-storage systems. Although supercapacitors (SCs) exhibit higher power density than state-of-the art batteries, their insufficient energy density remains a major challenge. An emerging concept of hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) with the combination of one capacitive and one battery electrode in a single cell holds a great promise to deliver high energy density without sacrificing power density and cycling stability. This Minireview elaborates the recent advances of use of nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4) as a potential positive electrode (battery-like) for HSCs. A brief introduction on the structural benefits and charge storage mechanisms of NiCo2O4 was provided. It further shed a light on composites of NiCo2O4 with different materials like carbon, polymers, metal oxides, and others, which altogether helps in increasing the electrochemical performance of HSCs. Finally, the key scientific challenges and perspectives on building high-performance HSCs for future-generation applications were reviewed.
