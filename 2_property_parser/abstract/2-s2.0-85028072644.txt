Nanopowders of the NiMn2O4 spinel of a grain size of about 30 nm are obtained by the method of coprecipitation. The specific capacity in an aqueous electrolyte (1 лю LiNO3) is determined by the method of cyclic voltammetry. Using computer simulation, the peculiarities of the mechanism of intercalation of Li+ into a NiMn2O4 spinel are studied by the method of crystal chemical analysis.
