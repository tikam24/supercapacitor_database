As Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) technology matures, it will benefit by borrowing new components and techniques from related industries to improve performance and reduce costs. A particularly important area to draw from is the electric vehicle industry. ROVs are typically powered and controlled from a cable called a "tether" and the maximum power which can be provided to the vehicle is a function of the tether size and the required length. What if the ROV had a "turbo" mode, much like a hybrid gas/electric vehicle using a small amount of energy storage and an electric motor to provide short bursts of additional power? A prototype "hybrid" energy storage system is used to demonstrate how peak power available to the ROV can be increased or the size of the tether can be reduced. The prototype is based on a component commonly used in electric vehicles called a supercapacitor. Data from test dives shows the vehicle typically reaches peak power for only 5 seconds. Anytime the power demand of the vehicle is below the maximum available from a traditional power supply, energy could be stored in the supercapacitors for later use, allowing greater power output when required. The data is also used to estimate tether savings/performance gains using this technique. Thanks to great strides in electric vehicle technology, ROV capability and efficiency will improve significantly. In much the same way adding even a small electric motor and batteries or supercapacitors to a typical gasoline powered car results in a "hybrid" vehicle with either the same performance at greater fuel economy or increased performance at the same milage, ROV operators will benefit from a combination of reduced costs/carbon emissions or increased power.
