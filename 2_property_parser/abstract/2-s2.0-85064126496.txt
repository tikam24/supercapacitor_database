A hollow–structured NiCo Hydroxide/carbon nanotube composite is prepared using a facile epitaxial growth route based on the construction of a new 3D hard template and a subsequent etching treatment. With a controlled etching procedure, the hard template Cu2O nanoparticles gradually dissolve, which results in the formation of a hollow structured NiCo hydroxide/carbon nanotube composite. Owing to a synergetic contribution from the hollow structured NiCo Hydroxide and the intersected carbon nanotube network, the NiCo hydroxide/carbon nanotube composite electrode exhibits a significant enhancement in structural stability and displays a higher specific capacitance (1896 and 1479 F g−1 at 1 and 40 A g−1, respectively) in comparison with that of the NiCo hydroxide. An asymmetric supercapacitor consisting of hollow structured NiCo Hydroxide/carbon nanotube composite shows a high specific capacitance of 139.3 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, a maximum energy density of 37.9 Wh kg−1, and a power density of 7005 W kg−1. The device also maintains 91.6% of its initial specific capacitance and a coulombic efficiency close to 100% after 12,500 cycles at 6 A g−1. This superior performance suggests that the prepared hollow structured Hydroxide/carbon nanotube composite has potential for applications as an electrode material in high–performance supercapacitors.
