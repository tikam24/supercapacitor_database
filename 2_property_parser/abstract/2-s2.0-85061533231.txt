Controllable nanoarchitecture arrays of the transition metal selenide, supported on conductive substrates, are promising materials for high-performance electrochemical energy storage and conversion applications. Herein, Ni 3 Se 2 nanowire arrays with a rich-grain-boundary are rationally grown on a nickel foam (NF) substrate by the solvothermal method. Under optimized conditions, the Ni 3 Se 2 nanowire arrays prominently display high areal capacitance of 635 μA h cm −2 at a current density of 3 mA cm −2 and excellent rate capability. As an asymmetric supercapacitor, the Ni 3 Se 2 electrode (cathode) shows a high energy density of 42.6 W h kg −1 at a power density of 284.8 W kg −1 . When used as a two-dimensional (2D) electrode for water splitting reaction, the Ni 3 Se 2 electrode exhibits high catalytic activity to achieve 100 mA cm −2 at an overpotential of 320 mV in the oxygen evolution reaction and a low overpotential of 95 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm −2 in the hydrogen evolution reaction in a 1.0 M KOH solution. The Ni 3 Se 2 nanowire array electrode is shown to be a high-performance alkaline water electrolyzer with current density of 10 mA cm −2 at a cell voltage of 1.62 V. The results demonstrate Ni 3 Se 2 as a promising 2D highly active electrode for electrochemical energy storage and conversion applications.
