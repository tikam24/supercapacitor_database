Crosslinked-polyaniline (CPA) nano-pillar arrays adsorbed on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets were synthesized by in situ solution polymerization through two steps of reduction. The electrochemical analyses demonstrated that the befittingly reduced CPA/RGO composite exhibited high performance as electrode materials for supercapacitors. The CPA/RGO composite showed very high specific capacitance of 1532 F g−1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 or 694 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1 in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte, as well as great energy density of 61.4 W h kg−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1. The electrode material also had decent power density of 4 kW kg−1 at a current density of 10 A g−1, and good cycling stability of 92.5 % capacitance retained after 500 cycles of cyclic voltammetry at 500 mV s−1. The neat microstructures and super electrochemical properties suggest the potential use of the composites in supercapacitors.
