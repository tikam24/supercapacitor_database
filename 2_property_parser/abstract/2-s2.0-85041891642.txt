Polyaniline-modified carbon nanotube composite nanofibers are deposited on carbon paper substrate using two steps template-free chemical oxidative deposition process. Regular nanofibers mat was observed through microscopy, and suggested better dispersion and interfacial adhesion ability of modified CNT with PANI matrix, which provided distinct architectural pores. Surface roughness was estimated using AFM surface topography image and decrease in roughness was observed in MPCNT nanofibers mat than PCNT nanofibers mat. Also, decrease in surface roughness due to reduction in agglomeration increased current burst and conducting pathway, which is confirmed in localized current profile plot. In addition, XPS results confirmed the improvement of intrinsic oxidation state, doping degree and conductivity in MPCNT than PC0. Fabricated MPCNT electrode miniaturized resistance and demonstrated highest specific capacitance ~ 1302 F g−1 at current density 0.5 mA cm−2 with good cyclic stability (82% retention even after 6000 cycles). Also, MPCNT electrode exhibited high energy density (250 Wh kg−1) and power density (148 W kg−1). Moreover, develop electrode materials are used to fabricate an asymmetric supercapacitor device for demonstrating the applicability.
