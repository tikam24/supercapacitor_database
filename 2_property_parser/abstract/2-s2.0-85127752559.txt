In this paper, we prepared CCT nanocomposite comprising of Co3O4, carbon black and TiO2 via microwave-assisted sol–gel technique. The composite is designed as electrode material for supercapacitor application. We have synthesised two samples namely CT and CCT where CT is optimised composite of carbon black and TiO2 nanoparticle, and CCT is composite of Co3O4, carbon black and TiO2, respectively. The prepared electrode material has been characterised by X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charging-discharging (GCD) and electrochemical impedances spectroscopy (EIS). The structural and microstructural characterisation of the material confirms the formation of the crystal structure and nanocomposite. The CCT material shows better specific capacitances of 250 F g−1 at a rate of ten millivolts per second which is advanced than that of CT composite. The CCT sample exhibits energy density (Ed) of 46 W h kg−1 at corresponding power density (Pd) of value around two thousand watt per kilogram. The analysed result reveals that the prepared CCT nanocomposite can be considered as potential electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
