An electrochemical synthesis method of reducing graphene oxide (GO) under constant potential is reported. Electrochemical technique offers control over reaction parameters such as the applied voltage, electrical current and reduction time; whereas the desired size and thickness of the film can be pre-determined by controlling the amount of precursor GO deposited on the electrode with defined shape and surface area. This synthesis technique produces high quality electrochemically reduced GO (ERGO) film with controllable size and thickness. Electrochemical symmetrical supercapacitors based on ERGO films achieved a specific capacitance of 128 F/g with an energy density of 17.8 Wh/kg operating within a potential window of 1.0 V in 1.0 M NaNO3. The supercapacitor was shown to be stable, retaining ca. 86% of the original specific capacitance after 3500 charge-discharge cycles. The results indicate that this simple synthesis technique for providing graphene-like materials has great potential in various applications such as energy storage. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
