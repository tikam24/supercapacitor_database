In this paper, the Rainflow Cycles Counting Method is applied to estimate the supercapacitors lifetime. Several studies can be found in the literature but in most of them, estimation methods of supercapacitors lifetime are based only on the Ac-Impedance Spectroscopy Method or on the Cyclic voltammetry. The using of these methods is very fastidious and need a very high number of experimental cycling tests. Sometimes, it can be interesting to have a simplest but accurate method to estimate the life cycles of the supercapacitor. So, abacus can be realized by manufacturer to guide users or to be used in the Supercapacitor Energy Management System (SEMS) simulations. In this paper, a strategy, based on the Rainflow Cycle Counting Method, is established from long term experimental tests. This can facilitate an online estimation of the supercapacitor lifetime and storage energy management.
