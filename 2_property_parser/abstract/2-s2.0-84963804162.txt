Cathodic electrodeposition of MnO 2 from a nitrate solution, via pulsed base (OH - ) electrogeneration was performed for the first time. The deposition experiments were performed in a pulse current mode in typical on-times and off-times (i.e. t on = 1 s and t off = 1 s) with a peak current density of 2 mA cm -2 (I a = 2 mA cm -2 ). The structural characterizations conducted by XRD and FTIR techniques revealed that the prepared MnO 2 is composed of both α and γ phases. Morphological observation by SEM and TEM showed that the prepared MnO 2 is made up of nanobelts with uniform shapes (an average diameter and length of 50 nm and 1 μm, respectively). Further electrochemical measurements by cyclic voltammetry and charge-discharge techniques revealed that the prepared MnO 2 nanostructures have excellent capacitive behaviors, like a specific capacitance of 235.5 F g -1 and capacity retention of 91.3% after 1000 cycling at the scan rate of 25 mV s -1 .
