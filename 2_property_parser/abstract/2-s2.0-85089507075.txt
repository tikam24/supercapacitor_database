In present research, walnut like copper sulfide is prepared via a facile single-step potentiostatic electrodeposition method on conducting stainless steel substrate. The walnut like morphology of copper sulfide thin film lies of microplates and further microplates converted to nanogranuals, by means of a change in deposition time and thickness. Copper sulfide thin film electrode reveals a specific capacitance of 132 F g−1 at 50 mA cm−2. The film thickness changes with deposition time. The films acquire maximum thickness of 610 nm for 25 min of deposition. X-ray diffraction analysis revels that the CuS thin films is polycrystalline in nature and the crystallite size is 29 nm. The peak at 612 cm−1 in the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra confirms the formation of CuS. The wettability study shows the hydrophilic nature, the contact angle of water with CuS electrode is 66°, and the charge transfer resistance of CuS electrode is 7.78 Ω.
