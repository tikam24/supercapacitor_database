A series of metal oxide nanocomposites have been successfully synthesized by electrospinning technology. The obtained nanocomposites (Cu2O-Mn3O4-NiO) are an ordered arrangement of metal oxide particles (10nm), with the shape like bead chain. The acquired Cu2O-Mn3O4-NiO ternary nanocomposites were used as electrode materials to manufacture a supercapacitor. Electrochemical tests showed that the synthesis of nanocomposites made of electrode materials had good electrochemical performance in 6mol/L KOH electrolyte. The results showed that at a scan rate of 5mV/s, the specific capacitance of Cu2O-Mn3O4-NiO had a larger specific capacitance of 1306F/g than NiO, Cu2O-NiO and Mn3O4-NiO. The excellent electrochemical performance showed that the electrostatic spinning method is an effective technology for developing nanocomposites for energy storage devices.
