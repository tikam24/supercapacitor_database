In this work, a portable, lightweight and flexible automatic data acquisition system, easily adaptable to instrumental tests of electric double-layer capacitors (EDLC) samples of different parameter magnitudes is proposed and tested. The system can be configured to automatically acquire the electrical data to be used later in the modeling and characterization of the supercapacitors (SCs). The system consists mainly of a dedicated single-board computer that uses a laptop as a console and a custom electronic circuit that is easy to adapt. The experimental results and simulations are presented to show the applicability of the system.
