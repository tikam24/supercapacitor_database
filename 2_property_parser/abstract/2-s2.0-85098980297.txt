An amazing KCu7S4 nanowire array structure in-situ grown on Ni foam skeleton was fabricated. The morphology and size of KCu7S4 nanowire array can be adjusted by temperature and additive (ethylene glycol). The unique structure and suitable size of KCu7S4 nanowirearray greatly facilitate the charge transport of the electrode material and electrolyte, providing more active sites for redox reaction, which perfectly demonstrates the excellent electrochemical performance of the KCu7S4 electrode material. The KCu7S4 nanowire array with adding ethylene glycol in the synthesis process exhibits high specific capacitance of 2.57 F cm-2 (807 F g-1) at a current density of 3 mA cm-2, good cycling stability with 80% retention at 10 mA cm-2 for 1000 cycles and high energy density of 40.55 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 185 W kg-1. Moreover,the investigation demonstrates the great potential application of KCu7S4 nanowire array in supercapacitors.
