A series of nickel sulfides derived from the hexagonal Ni-MOF are vulcanized through adjusting the hydrothermal time and the thiourea concentration. Among all the obtained nickel sulfides, one sample Ni-S2-3, which inherits the Ni-MOF's morphology, shows the best electrochemical performance with a remarkable specific capacitance of 1128Fg-1 at 1Ag-1, a rate capacitance of 50% and a long cycle life of 74% retention after 5000 cycles. Furthermore, the asymmetrical supercapacitors (SCs) based on Ni-S2-3//AC exhibit a good supercapacitive performance with a maximum power density of 16.3Wh kg-1 at a power density of 800Wkg-1. All these results indicate that vulcanizing Ni-MOF is an effective way to fabricate a superior electrode material with excellent electrochemical performance for SCs.
