We studied the effect of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) materials on the supercapacitors made of activated carbon and transition metal oxides (ACMO). We tested the supercapacitors using two-probe cyclic voltammetry (CV) and checked the impedance using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at a frequency up to MHz. The results indicated that the 5% of the metal oxide in the ACMO increased the surface area and the capacitance. However, the addition of a low concentration of RGO (2%) to the ACMO decreased it.
