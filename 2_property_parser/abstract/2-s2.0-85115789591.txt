Advanced integrated electrode materials with designed core–shell nanostructure play a crucial role for the application in alternative energy storage system. Herein, hierarchical MoO3@NixCo2x(OH)6x core–shell arrays were equably grown on face of carbon cloth after a series of hydrothermal growth and electrochemical deposition processes. This core–shell arrays structure can not only provide large electroactive surface areas and high speed ion transport paths, but also keep the material structure stable during the process of redox reactions. Thus MoO3@NixCo2x(OH)6x displays excellent electrochemical performance (4.7 F cm−2 at 10 mA cm−2). Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled with MoO3@NixCo2x(OH)6x and carbon nanotubes, which delivers a maximal energy density of 0.50 mWh cm−2 at 4.25 mW cm−2, high specific capacitance and superior cycling stability (94.5% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles). We believe that MoO3@NixCo2x(OH)6x arrays could be a great prospective candidate energy storage materials.
