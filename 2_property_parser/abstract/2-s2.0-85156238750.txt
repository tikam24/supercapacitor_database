Supercapacitors are attracting extensive attention in energy storage fields thanks to their high safety, cost-effectiveness, and environmental friendliness. The carbon materials, especially for the porous carbon materials derived from renewable biomass materials, are important electrode materials with cost-effective feature for supercapacitors. However, the inferior ionic conductivity of biomass materials inhibits their electrochemical performance in energy storage devices. Herein, an immiscible liquid-mediated method is provided to improve the ionic conductivity of silk-derived nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NPC) electrodes. Natural Bombyx mori (silkworm) silk is used as a carbon source for the preparation of electrode of supercapacitor. Further introducing immiscible organic liquid into the NPCs promotes the ion transport in the inner pores of the electrodes. With the assistance of organic liquid, the supercapacitor presents a specific capacitance of 565.3 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. The supercapacitor shows the maximum specific energy and power density of 26.2 Wh kg−1 and 263.9 W kg−1, and holds a capacitance retention of approximately 93.3% after 10 000 cycles. This work provides a facile method for the rational design of carbon material derived from biomass material to fabricate electrode with high ionic conductivity, and the strategy will be extendable to other biomass materials for a wide range of applications.
