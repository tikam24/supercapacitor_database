We propose a new material for high power and high density supercapacitors with excellent cycle stability. Graphite oxide (PSS-GO) intercalated with poly(sodium 4-styrensulfonate) showed high performance of electric double layer capacitance (EDLC) compared to that of the pristine graphite oxide. Specific capacitance of the PSS-GO reached 190 F/g, and the energy density was much improved to 38 Wh/kg with a power density of 61 W/kg. Cycle test showed that the specific capacitance decreased by only 12% after 14860 cycles, providing excellent cyclic stability. The high EDLC performance of PSS-GO composite was attributed to the wide interlayer distance and simple pore structures accommodating fast ion kinetics. Â© 2010 American Chemical Society.
