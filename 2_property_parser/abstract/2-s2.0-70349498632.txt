Supercapacitor performance of nickel hydroxide powder electrode with different carbon conductor and nickel hydroxide/multi-walled carbon nanotube composite electrode had been studied by cyclic voltammetic method in 6 M KOH solution. Active carbon, Superp, Ketjen Black and multi-walled carbon nanotube were used as carbon conductor in nickel hydroxide powder electrode. It showed that multi-walled carbon nanotube conductor can bring good performance for nickel hydroxide powder supercapacitor electrode. Moreover, nickel hydroxide/multi-walled carbon nanotube composite was fabricated by hydrothermal method, using as supercapacitor electrode. Our findings show that 10 wt% nickel hydroxide loading on multi-walled carbon nanotube has good power performance. The capacitances for 10 wt% nickel hydroxide loading amount at high scan rate 100 and 500 mV/s were 221 and 118 F/g, respectively. Nickel hydroxide evenly loaded onto multi-walled carbon nanotube composite electrode has good conductivity and can contribute more capacitance. Â© 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
