A simple electrochemical reduction procedure can be applied to nanostructured composite films of polyaniline (PANI) and graphene oxide (GO), which results conversion of GO into reduced GO (rGO) with improved electroactivity of the PANI composite films. These also suffer from certain drawbacks like cyclic stability and lesser electrochemical properties. Three-dimensional hollow balls of graphene/polyaniline (3D-HBGP) hybrid and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)/polyaniline, sulfonated graphene/polyaniline (SG/PANI) and colloidal graphene oxide/polyaniline (PANI CGO) with high energy density 24.3 W h kg-1 and power density 28.1 kW kg-1 are good candidates for this purpose. This review summarizes developmental stage of different nanocomposites based on graphene and polyaniline.
