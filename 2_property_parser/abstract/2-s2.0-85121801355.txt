Transition metal oxides are generally designed as hybrid nanostructures with high performance for supercapacitors by enjoying the advantages of various electroactive materials. In this paper, a convenient and efficient route had been proposed to prepare hierarchical coral-like MnCo2O4.5@Co-Ni LDH composites on Ni foam, in which MnCo2O4.5 nanowires were enlaced with ultrathin Co-Ni layered double hydroxides nanosheets to achieve high capacity electrodes for supercapacitors. Due to the synergistic effect of shell Co-Ni LDH and core MnCo2O4.5, the outstanding electrochemical performance in three-electrode configuration was triggered (high area capacitance of 5.08 F cm-2 at 3 mA cm-2 and excellent rate capability of maintaining 61.69% at 20 mA cm-2), which is superior to those of MnCo2O4.5, Co-Ni LDH and other metal oxides based composites reported. Meanwhile, the as-prepared hierarchical MnCo2O4.5@Co-Ni LDH electrode delivered improved electrical conductivity than that of pristine MnCo2O4.5. Furthermore, the as-constructed asymmetric supercapacitor using MnCo2O4.5@Co-Ni LDH as positive and activated carbon as negative electrode presented a rather high energy density of 220 μWh cm-2 at 2400 μW cm-2 and extraordinary cycling durability with the 100.0% capacitance retention over 8000 cycles at 20 mA cm-2, demonstrating the best electrochemical performance compared to other asymmetric supercapacitors using metal oxides based composites as positive electrode material. It can be expected that the obtained MnCo2O4.5@Co-Ni LDH could be used as the high performance and cost-effective electrode in supercapacitors.
