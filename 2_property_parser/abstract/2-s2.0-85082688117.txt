Piezoelectric energy harvesting is one of the promising energy sources for wireless sensor networks and integrated devices. One way to enhance the efficiency of energy harvesting is through the electrical impedance matching. In piezoelectric energy harvesting system, the electrical impedance matching can increase the output voltage and energy from the generated electrical energy to the harvesting circuit. In this paper, the electrical impedance matching technologies for energy harvesting circuit to transfer the accumulated electrical energy to various output loads, including conventional electrolytic capacitors, supercapacitors and rechargeable Ni MH batteries, were intensively investigated to obtain maximum output energy. The harvested power through AC-DC rectifier circuit was used to light the LED lamp, which provides a prospect application in wireless sensor networks and portable devices.
