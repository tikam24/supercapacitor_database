The polyaniline/carbon nanotubes composites are prepared by in-situ electrochemical polymerization of polyaniline (PANI) on the surface of carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The morphology of the prepared composites is characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It is found that the PANI/MWCNTs composites have a fibrous structure. The electrochemical properties of the composites are investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronopotentiometry (CP). The specific capacitance of materials is investigated by modulating pipe diameter of multi-walled carbon nanotube and thickness of polyaniline. It is found that the specific capacitance of polyaniline/carbon nanotubes composite could reach 147.6 F/g with 50 nm pipe diameter of carbon nanotubes and 5 cycles for the deposition of polyaniline when the current density is 0.5 mA/cm2. These studies would provide scientific guidance and theoretical basis for the preparation of polyaniline/carbon nanotubes supercapacitor materials.
