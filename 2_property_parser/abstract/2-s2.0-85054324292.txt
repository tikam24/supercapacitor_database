In the current work, we present a green and scalable microwave mediated synthesis of shape engineered nano ironoxide supported on high surface area activated carbon (AC) derived from spent sawdust from mushroom cultivation. The derived composites were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution tunneling electron microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, Braun Emmet Teller surface area analyzer, thermo gravimetric analysis, and Raman spectroscopic techniques. The AC/ironoxide composite exhibited specific surface area of 907.51 m2/gm, showed the Fe to be in the form hematite (ά-Fe2O3) and was thermally stable up to 700°C. The ironoxide was found to be of nano size having flower like unique morphology. The nano composite material has a specific capacitance of 898 F/g at a scan rate of 10 mV/s and retained 95% of capacitance even after 10 000 charge-discharge cycles. The excellent stability and unique morphology makes the composite an alluring material for super capacitor applications.
