A composite system of poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/multi-walled carbon nanotubes has been investigated and characterized as a potential charge storage material for coupled dye-sensitized solar cell/electrochemical capacitor systems. The selected material can easily operate in organic media (lithium triflate/propylene carbonate) giving a specific capacitance of 95 F g -1 and energy density of 3.1 Wh kg -1. The combination of the composite material with dye-sensitized solar cell allows to obtain a photo-rechargeable supercapacitor (photocapacitor), destined to work with dies required organic media (here with N 719 dye). The photocapacitor system was built from mesoporous TiO 2 electrode, typical charge relay consisting of iodine/iodide redox couple and two charge storage electrodes separated by a liquid electrolyte. The system was tested under light illumination of 100 mW cm -2 with xenon lamp equipped with cut-off filters eliminating the ultraviolet and infrared part of the spectra.
