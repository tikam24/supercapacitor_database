Designing and fabricating unique nanostructured MnO2 electrode to improve their electronic conductivity for supercapacitor application with high electrochemical performance in terms of high specific capacitance, excellent cycle stability, and good rate capability, is still a big challenge. In this work, we report novel nickel foam supported 3D plate-like MnO2 materials as binder-free electrodes for supercapacitors. Benefiting from the unique 3D architectures, the as-obtained MnO2 electrode possesses a high specific surface area of 60.8 m2 g−1, exhibits a high specific capacitance of 680.6 F g−1 at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 and reveals the outstanding cycling behaviors with the capacitance retention about 91.2% and Coulombic efficiency of 100% after 4000 cycles. Furthermore, the SEM images of the MnO2 electrode show that the plate-like structure basically remains unchanged after long-term cycles, suggesting the outstanding stability of the as-prepared electrode materials. All the above supercapacitive achievements indicate that the nickel foam supported 3D plate-like MnO2 electrode can be a promising material for desirable supercapacitors. In addition, such unique 3D plate-like electrode architectures would be useful for other energy storage and conversion devices.
