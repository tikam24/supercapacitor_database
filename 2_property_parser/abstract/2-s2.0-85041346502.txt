Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are used in many civilian and commercial applications. The main challenge with UAVs is providing long run and light weight power source. This paper deals with the one of the important issues of providing power supply using super capacitor energy storage system for UAVs, which reduces the fluctuations and increases the flight time while it is flying. Super capacitors have less weight, fast charging as well as slow discharge which increasesflight time when compared to Li-PO batteries. Hence the analysis, design and working of supercapacitoris considered in this paper. The simulation results of theSuper Capacitor Energy Storage System(SCESS)showthat supercapacitor is showinggood performance.
