Nanocomposite of benzenesulfonic functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes doped polyaniline (PANi/f-MWCNTs) was synthesized via a low-temperature in situ polymerization method. The PANi/f-MWCNTs composite has a thin film of PANi coating uniformly on the surface of the f-MWCNTs. The electrochemical results show that PANi/f-MWCNTs nanocomposite possesses good rate response, which could ascribe to the uniform structure and the better conductivity of composite as well as the in situ doping/de-doping process between the benzenesulfonic acid groups of f-MWCNTs and PANi chain. In addition, the composite also has better capacity and cyclability than PANi/p-MWCNTs composite. It could attribute to the presence of f-MWCNTs, which makes more electrolyte contact with PANi to participate in faradaic redox reactions and dopes with the PANi polymer chain through the benzenesulfonic acid groups to form stable polyemeraldine salts.
