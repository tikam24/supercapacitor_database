Here we demonstrate a facile electrochemical polymerization and laser induction process to fabricate poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/reduced graphene oxide (PEDOT/rGO) nanocomposite, which can be used as supercapacitor electrode material. Firstly, a PEDOT film is deposited on ITO substrate using an electrochemical polymerization method and a graphene oxide (GO) film is successively deposited on as-prepared PEDOT film through a spin-coating method. Then, by using a laser-writing method, the GO film is transformed into the rGO and a PEDOT/rGO nanocomposite is obtained. The resulting nanocomposite shows high areal capacitance about 43.75 mF/cm2, which is nearly 3 times higher than that of the PEDOT film at a current density of 0.2 mA/cm2. The PEDOT/rGO nanocomposite exhibits excellent cyclic stability, which can retain 83.6% of its initial capacitance after 1000 charge-discharge cycles. Furthermore, this nanocomposite can be deposited on varied substrates as electrode materials, which shows promising application to prepare high performance energy storage materials.
