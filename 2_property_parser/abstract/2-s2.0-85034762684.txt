One of the hurdles in human's sustainable development is energy shortage. In refuting this problem, making efficient use of energy and finding clean and renewable energy sources are among encouraging ways. In the present study, an attempt was made to decorate adenine on the surface of rGO using diazonium reaction, and then it was employed as a supercapacitor. rGO is responsible for observing the property of electrical double layer capacitance in Adenine@rGO. Adenine, as a modifier at the surface of rGO, is electrochemically active and shows pseudocapacitive behavior in the form of Adenine@rGO. To investigate the supercapacitor behavior of Adenine@rGO, cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge analysis, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used in a three-electrode system in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. A maximum specific capacitance of 700 F/g was achieved at a constant current density of 0.5 A/g. The electrochemical stability of Adenine@rGO/GCE was studied for 1000 continuous charge-discharge cycles at a constant current density of 4.0 A/g. The results showed that 100% of the initial capacity is visible in all of 1000 cycles.
