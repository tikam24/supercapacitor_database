This paper introduces the design of classical PID with set point filter (N) PIDN controller making use of seagull optimization algorithm (SOA) subjected to squared error over integral (ISE) function for power system load frequency control (LFC). For this purpose, a realistic system of dual area conventional units is conceived and analyzed by laying load disturbance in area-1 of 1% step load (1% SLP). However, the efficacy of different time domain objective functions is tested and ISE is proven as the best among them. Moreover, the devices of ultra-capacitors (Ucs) are placed in dual areas, and unified power flow controller (UPFC) is incorporated with tie-line to further diminish the deviations in system responses.
