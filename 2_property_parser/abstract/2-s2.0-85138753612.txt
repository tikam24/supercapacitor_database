The current investigation is focused on modify optical, structural, electrical and electrochemical behaviors of PVA matrix by new hybrid ZnWMoO7 nanoparticles (NPs). The PVA/ZnWMoO7 nanocomposite (NCs) films have been fabricated via intercalation technique, where its structural and morphological features were investigated by XRD, SEM and FTIR. TEM result indicates that the size of nanoparticles (NPs) lies in the range of 7–18 nm. Current (I)–voltage(V) results showed dc-conductivity increased with increasing dosage of ZnWMoO7 NPs and I–V behavior indicates to ohmic dominant at voltage < 7 V followed by higher increasing in conductivity. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) displayed the PVA NCs have electrochemical stability between − 0.2 V and 0.8 V at a scan rate of 10 mV/S and the specific capacitance improved to 3.98 F/g for PVA/8wt% ZnWMoO7 NCs which is higher by 2 times compared to host PVA. The optical study reveals an increased refractive index from 1.18 to 2.16 at a wavelength of 300 nm, while the band gap energy (Eg) is reduced from 5.34 to 3.13 eV after inclusion PVA by 8wt% ZnWMoO7 NPs. Such results indicate that the NC films based on PVA/ZnWMoO7 NCs may be suitable for potential uses in opto-electronic and super capacitor applications.
