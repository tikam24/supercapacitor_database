Well-ordered manganese oxide (MnO2) arrays were directly grown on the treated carbon cloth (CC) though a simple electrochemical deposition method. The structures and the thickness of MnO2 film were controlled by tuning the deposition time. The morphologies and structures of MnO2 deposited on CC were examined by scanning electron microscopy, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. With appropriate reaction time, the MnO2/CC composite demonstrates a high specific capacitance of 291 mF/cm2 and a superior cycling stability at a current density of 0.2 mA/cm2. The specific capacitance shows a little improvement at the first 200 cycles and remains unchanged after continuous 2000 charge/discharge cycles. The MnO2 nanosheet arrays with high degree of ordering, combined with the flexible carbon cloth substrate can coffer great promise for supercapacitor applications.
