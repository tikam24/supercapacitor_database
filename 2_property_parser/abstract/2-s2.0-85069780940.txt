A facile microwave assisted hydrothermal method is used to synthesize the glucose derived water soluble crystalline graphene quantum dots (GQDs). Mixing of nanoparticles with polymers exhibiting superior physical properties like optical, electrical, and electrochemical or photo catalytic activity. A completely new nanocomposite of polypyrrole/graphene quantum dot (PGQD) was successfully obtained through in-situ polymerization of pyrrole in the presence of GQD suspension. The obtained composites were characterized by using FTIR to study the chemical interaction, and surface morphology was investigated using FESEM. The optical properties were studied using UV-Visible spectroscopy which shows absorption band at 239, 304 and 443nm confirms the formation of PGQD composite. The application of the PGQD composite are evaluated as a supercapacitor material by using Galvanostatic charging discharging (GCD) and Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. The specific capacitance of composite film was 239.7F/g shows the synergetic effect between the composite.
