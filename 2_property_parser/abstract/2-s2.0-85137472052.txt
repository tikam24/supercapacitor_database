Supercapacitors are high-capacity energy storage devices and are presently used in aerospace, transportation, and telecommunications. The incorporation of transition metal oxides and conducting polymers such as polypyrrole (PPY) improves the electrochemical behaviour. The characteristics of both materials allow for novel electrochemical applications. PPY composite materials have been used as low-cost and effective supercapacitor materials because of their ease of synthesis, superior physicochemical properties, and distinctive structure-property relationship. In this work, we have utilised polypyrrole and MoO3 based nanocomposite (PPY@MoO3) as supercapacitor materials. The synthetic method was found to be highly efficient and very low-cost. The PPY@MoO3 was characterised by several electrochemical analytical methods such as cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and impedance, respectively. The specific capacitance was found to be 363.3 F/g at a current density of 2 A/g and 275.1 F/g at a scan rate of 10 mV/s, respectively. The double layer capacitance has been found to be 2.4 × 10−2 F/cm2. The retention (%) of PPY@MoO3 was observed to be 93.5% after 5000 cycles. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
