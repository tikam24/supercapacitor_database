Carbon matrix composites are considered to be one of the most promising electrode materials for the wide application of supercapacitors. In this paper, graphene oxide (GO), cobalt nitrate [Co(NO3)2] and melamine were used to prepared nitrogen-doped graphene/carbon nanotubes/amorphous carbon (NC) composites which by using the catalytic action of cobalt on pyrolytic carbon source at high temperature, and then NC electrochemical properties were tested. The effects of metal and melamine addition levels on the structure and properties of carbon matrix composites were investigated. It was found that when the addition levels were 0.02mmol and 0.3g, respectively, the prepared materials had large specific surface area (380.5m2/g) and nitrogen content (6.29%). When the current density was 0.5A/g, the material specific capacitance was 137.1F/g, respectively with and when the current density is 5A/g, the specific capacitance was 113.5F/g, and the retention rate was 88.5%, showing excellent rate performance. After 5000 cycles, the capacity retention rate of the material was 104%, indicating good cycle stability. It was attributed to the fact that the three-dimensional structure can accelerate the ion transfer and nitrogen doping during charge and discharge processes, which can improve the material wettability and contribute part of pseudo capacitance, providing theoretical reference for the preparation of electrode materials for supercapacitors.
