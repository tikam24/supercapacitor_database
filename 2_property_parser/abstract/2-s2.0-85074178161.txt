In this paper, energy processes in combined power supplies with supercapacitors (nonlinear capacitors) and linear capacitors at their charge from a non-ideal DC source, for which there is a rechargeable battery, have been analyzed. The energy characteristics of charge circuits in combined power supplies with supercapacitors and linear capacitors have been obtained. An analysis of the dependence of the energy difference accumulated in the supercapacitor and in the linear capacitor in the process of charge (from zero initial conditions to voltage Uf = Un n), on the variations of the parameter n, has been performed. The dependence of the energy ratio accumulated in the capacitors during the charge period on the value of the final voltage on the terminals of the capacitors has been investigated.
