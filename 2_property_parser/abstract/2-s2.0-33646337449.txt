Mn-Pb nanocomposite oxide, as electrode material for supercapacitor, was successfully prepared by solid-state reaction of KMnO4 with manganese acetate and lead acetate at low temperature. The nanocomposite oxide was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The capacitive characteristics of the nanocomposite oxide in 1 mol/L Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte were investigated with cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry in a three-electrode system. It was found that the nanocomposite oxide was amorphous with the particle size of 10 nm. The nanocomposite oxide exhibited excellent capacitive properties within the potential range from -0.2 âˆ¼ +0.9 (V vs. SCE), indicating a promising electrode material for supercapacitor. The specific capacitance of the nanocomposite oxide decreased with increasing discharge current and it was 180.5 F/g by constant current discharge of 2 mA.
