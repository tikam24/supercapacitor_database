To minimize the global warming and the impact of greenhouse effect, renewable energy sources-based microgrids are widely studied. In this paper, the control of PV, wind-based renewable energy system and battery, supercapacitor-based energy storage system in a DC microgrid have been presented. Maximum power points for PV and wind have been obtained using neural network and optimal torque control, respectively. Nonlinear supertwisting sliding mode controller has been presented for the power sources. Global asymptotic stability of the framework has been verified using Lyapunov stability analysis. For load-generation balance, energy management system based on fuzzy logic has been devised and the controllers have been simulated using MATLAB/SimulinkÂ® (2019a) along with a comparison of different controllers. For the experimental validation, controller hardware-in-the loop experiment has been carried out which validates the performance of the designed system.
