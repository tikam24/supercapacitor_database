To allocate the power between lithium battery and ultracapacitor in hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) optimally, a new energy allocation strategy (EMS) is proposed based on the power management rules and model predictive control (MPC). In the proposed EMS, if the demanding power is large and the battery ultra-capacitor have enough energy, MPC strategy is applied, otherwise, the rule-based strategy is adopted. By using MPC strategy, the future velocity will be predicted, and the required power is calculated, the nonlinear MPC output is then solved by the sequential quadratic programming algorithm. The performances of the proposed strategy are tested on the HEV experimental platform by 3 typical driving cycles, i.e., ECE cycle, UDDS cycle and HWFET cycle, and its hybrid cycles. The experiments indicate that the proposed strategy help decrease the power consumption efficiently comparing with the rule based strategy.
