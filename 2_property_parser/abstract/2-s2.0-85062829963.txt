This paper proposes a highly reliable monitoring and equalization scheme for a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) with batteries (BTs) and supercapacitors (SCs). The system is properly designed for electric motor drives in building applications. However, the proposed system can also be applied in any other building applications by slightly changing the control algorithm. The high motoring reliability in the suggested system is attained by evaluating the performance of each SC and BT considering the history and the HESS operation. The high equalization reliability is achieved through a new topology and a control algorithm that properly manage an auxiliary SC-based ESS which serves as a backup energy bank in order to provide the required energy in any weak cells of the main HESS for equalizing their voltage as well as enhancing the dynamic performance of the main application. The effectiveness of the proposed monitoring and equalization control scheme has been validated by several simulation results that are extensively discussed throughout the paper.
