The commercialization aspect in electric double layer capacitors is highly dependent on source of carbon, its purity, and the specific capacitance with unique deliverable for proficient charge storage. Here, we report synthesis of interconnected mesoporous spherical carbon by direct flame synthesis using candle wax for symmetric supercapacitors with the non-aqueous approach. The heat treated candle soot (CST) at 450 °C results in a high purity carbon with the improved surface area of 608 m2 g−1 also the majority of pores in the range of 1–10 nm, which is ideal for charge storage in supercapacitors. The highest capacitance of 64 and 88.2 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 was obtained for 1 M TEABF4 in acetonitrile and EMIM BF4, respectively. A stability up to 82–85% can be achieved for 5,000 charge-discharge cycles. CST as a potent electrode material successfully delivered highest specific energy of 14 and 28 Wh kg−1 and specific power of 12.5 and 15 kW kg−1 in 1 M TEABF4 in ACN and EMIM BF4 electrolytes, respectively.
