This paper presents a reconfigurable switched-capacitor DC-DC step-up converter and is simulated in a 130 nm CMOS technology. The proposed power management unit converts any voltage between 470 mV and 740 mV, provided by a supercapacitor, to 1.2 V while providing 1 mW of output power. The converter presented an average maximum efficiency of 86.16 % for the converter and 65.01 % with the proposed control system during the 2/1 conversion ratio.
