Fiber-shaped photocapacitors (FPCs) based on shared bifunctional fiber electrodes for supercapacitors and solar cells hold great potential for the realization of self-powered systems for flexible wearable electronics. However, the reported electrodes for FPCs still face certain limitations, such as limited specific energy density, low total photochemical–electric energy conversion efficiency (ηtotal), and poor flexibility. Herein, hollow fibers consisting of partially reduced graphene oxide and a highly conductive polymer are assembled by wet-spinning and employed as shared bifunctional fibers to fabricate self-powered FPCs. Intriguingly, the FPCs achieve high flexibility and a ηtotal of 4.2%. This study illustrates a feasible way to design high-performance FPCs and their applications in flexible electronics.
