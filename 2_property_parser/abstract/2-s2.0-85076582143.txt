In this paper, an Sb/Cl-incorporated nickel foam (NF) electrode material was grown on acid-pretreated NF by one-step chemical vapor deposition using SbCl3 as the Sb source. The synthetic conditions can be optimized by adjusting the dosage of SbCl3. The sample exhibits excellent electrochemical properties due to its unique morphology of porous nanosheet clusters, with a high specific capacity of 1248 C g-1 at 1 A g-1 and excellent rate performance (capacity retention of 70.5% at 10 A g-1). An asymmetric supercapacitor fabricated with Sb/Cl-incorporated NF and activated carbon exhibits a high energy density of 57.6 W h kg-1 at a power density of 1202 W kg-1 with good cycling stability. The capacity retention after 10 000 cycles is 83.3%. Given these characteristics, this work provides a simple and scalable strategy for designing an electrode and a device with superior electrochemical performance in next-generation energy storage applications.
