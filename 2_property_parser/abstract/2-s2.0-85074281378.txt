Global energy demands due to growing population, using high energy vehicles and diminishing fossil fuels following environmental concerns triggers the global academic and research groups to pave more attention in renewable green energy systems. Various renewable energy systems such as solar energy, tidal energy, geothermal energy, bioenergy, batteries and supercapacitors have been used to fulfil the energy requirements. Among these energy systems, batteries have been extensively studied and more attention has been paid on supercapacitors in the recent times. Herein we report, preparation of MnCo2O4 in using simple microwave method. The formation of MnCo2O4 have been confirmed in XRD studies.. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy studies of the prepared samples show that these materials are flakes like morphology. Galvanic charge-discharge studies of the MnCo2O4 show high specific capacitance of 802 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1.
