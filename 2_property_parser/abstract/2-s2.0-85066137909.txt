We investigated the influence of surface oxidization of planar graphene electrodes on charge storage and ion dynamics of supercapacitors. Our approach compared two distinct ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes: tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate solvated in acetonitrile (TEA-BF4/ACN) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide solvated in acetonitrile (EMIm-TFSI/ACN). Both experimental electrochemical tests and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed positive, electrolyte-specific influences of hydroxyl-free electrode interfaces on capacitance. In the EMIm-TFSI/ACN system, the hydroxylated surface, because of its strong interaction with anions, impeded surface charge storage. On the other hand, in the case of TEA-BF4/ACN, the distribution and orientation of ACN across the system exerted vital influence on the capacitance, especially on the positive hydroxyl-free electrode. Furthermore, MD simulations of ion mobility with respect to the electrode surface in the lateral and perpendicular directions revealed significantly slower diffusion performance on the oxidized surface. Our efforts enhanced the level of fundamental understanding of the effects of hydroxyl groups on electrode-electrolyte interfaces and resulting supercapacitor performance.
