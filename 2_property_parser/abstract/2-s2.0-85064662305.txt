Nanostructured materials have greatly improved the performance of electrochemical energy storage devices because of the increased activity and surface area. However, nanomaterials (e.g., nanocarbons) normally possess low packing density, and thus occupy more space which restricts their suitability for making electrochemical devices as compact as possible. This has resulted in their low volumetric performance (capacitance, energy density, and power density), which is a practical obstacle for the application of nanomaterials in mobile and on-board energy storage devices. While rating electrode materials for supercapacitors, their volumetric performance is equally important as the gravimetric metrics and more reliable in particular for systems with limited space. However, the adopted criteria for measuring the volumetric performance of supercapacitors vary in the literature. Identifying the appropriate performance criteria for the volumetric values will set a universal ground for valid comparison. Here, the authors discuss the rationale for quantifying the volumetric performance metrics of supercapacitors from the three progressive levels of materials, electrodes, and devices. It is hoped that these thoughts will be of value for the general community in energy storage research.
