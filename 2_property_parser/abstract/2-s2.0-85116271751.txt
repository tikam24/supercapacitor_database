In the present study, three types of specific solid, core-shell, and hollow structured cobalt and iron co-doped MoS2nanocubes (denoted as s-Co-Fe-MoSx, c-Co-Fe-MoSx, and h-Co-Fe-MoSx) are controllably synthesized for the first time by regulating the reactant mass ratios. The prepared Co-Fe-MoSxnanocubes can function as a counter electrode in dye-sensitized and perovskite solar cells (DSCs and PSCs) and a working electrode in a supercapacitor. In the DSC system, the c-Co-Fe-MoSxnanocubes exhibit the maximum catalytic activity to the Co3+/2+redox couple regeneration, and the device achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.69%, significantly higher than the devices using s-Co-Fe-MoSx(6.61%) and h-Co-Fe-MoSx(7.63%) counter electrodes. Similarly, all of the prepared Co-Fe-MoSxnanocubes show decent activity in PSCs and the device using the c-Co-Fe-MoSxcounter electrode achieves the highest PCE of 6.88%. It is worth noting that, as the supercapacitor working electrode, the h-Co-Fe-MoSxexhibits a specific capacitance of 85.4 F g-1, significantly higher than the parallel values achieved by the s-Co-Fe-MoSxand c-Co-Fe-MoSxelectrodes under identical conditions.
