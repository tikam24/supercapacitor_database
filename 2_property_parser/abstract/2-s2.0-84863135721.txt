A well-organized composite of graphene nanosheets decorated with FeC 2O 4 particles was synthesized through a simple chemical precipitation method. The FeC 2O 4 nanoparticles obtained were 100-150 nm in size and homogeneously anchored on graphene sheets as spacers to keep the neighboring sheets separated. The FeC 2O 4-graphene exhbited excellent performances in absorption propties and supercapacitor make potential uses as environment and energy storage materials in future.
