A Ni/Co-based bimetallic metal-organic framework (Ni/Co-MOF) [CoNi(μ3-tp)2(μ2-pyz)2] (tp = terephthalic acid and pyz = pyrazine) was synthesized through a hydrothermal method. Structural characterization revealed that metal centers are equally occupied by Co2+ and Ni2+ ions. The supercapacitive behavior of the synthesized Ni/Co-MOF was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements in 3 M KOH as electrolyte. The Ni/Co-MOF exhibited an outstanding specific capacitance of 1049 F g-1 at a discharge current density of 1 A g-1, good rate capability (642 F g-1 at 10 A g-1), and 97.4% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first bimetallic MOF that is used in supercapacitors and its encouraging properties indicate that Ni/Co-MOF can be a promising candidate as an advanced electrode material for supercapacitors.
