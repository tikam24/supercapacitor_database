We report XRD and IR measurements of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMI-BF<inf>4</inf>) adsorbed in activated carbons, molecular sieving carbon, and single wall carbon nanohorn, where we specifically chose a wide range of pore sizes from 0.5 nm to 2.5 nm. Electron radial distribution function analysis reveals denser packing upon adsorption in two steps, for pore widths larger and comparable to the ion size. Average ion-distance was decreased by 0.05 nm in the latter case. With support of DFT calculations we identify a suppression of specific vibrational modes, which are interpreted as constrainment by the pore walls. Possible consequences for supercapacitor application are discussed.
