Ni3S2@polypyrrole/nickel foam (Ni3S2@PPy/NF) composite was successfully synthesized by combining a facile hydrothermal synthesis and a simple electrochemical-deposited process. For comparative study, the honeycomb-shaped Ni3S2 had in situ been grown on NF without the addition of any nickel salt to obtain the Ni3S2/NF composite. The electrochemical measurement results show that the area capacitance of the Ni3S2@PPy/NF electrode is 1.13 F cm−2 that is slightly lower than 1.26 F cm−2 of the Ni3S2/NF electrode at a high current density of 30 mA cm−2, yet its rate capability and cycling stability are far better than those of the Ni3S2/NF electrode. Meanwhile, an asymmetric supercapacitor on the basis of the Ni3S2@PPy/NF anode and the AC cathode exhibits a high energy density and power density of 17.54 Wh kg−1 and 179.33 W kg−1 at 2.5 mA cm−2, respectively; besides, the energy density is still 8.67 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 3587.41 W kg−1 even at 50 mA cm−2. Moreover, the capacitances of the device remain unchanged after 3000 galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles at a high current density of 30 mA cm−2. Furthermore, two such 1 cm2 devices connected in series can light five 40-mW LED indicators or power one of the same-power LED indicator for 20 min after being fully charged. The results demonstrate that our asymmetric supercapacitor has a promising potential in commercial applications.
