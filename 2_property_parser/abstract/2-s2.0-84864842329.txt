Here we report an in situ electrochemical oxidation method to synthesize birnessite-type MnO 2 electrodes for supercapacitors from cathodically deposited Mn 3O 4 thin films. Mn 3O 4 thin films composed of nanowall arrays with a porous structure were prepared by cathodic deposition at various temperatures. Nanoparticles were formed within the nanowalls when the deposition temperature is above 50 °C, building a nanoparticle/porous hierarchy architecture. Cyclic voltammogram (CV) was used to perform electrochemical oxidation on the Mn 3O 4 thin film. The birnessite-type MnO 2 phase was successfully achieved after the electrochemical CV cyclings, which is believed to be responsible for the significant increase in the specific capacitance of the supercapacitor. © 2012 American Scientific Publishers.
