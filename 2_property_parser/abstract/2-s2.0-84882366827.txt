In this paper, radiating dipole antennas have been fabricated from rolled carbon films, which are typically used for supercapacitor electrodes. Return loss and radiation pattern measurements for onion-like carbon (OLC) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) antenna samples are presented and compared to a copper standard. The OLC antenna's radiation pattern measurements show a peak gain of -1.48 dBi, just less than 3 dB of a copper dipole antenna. Compared to antennas made from MWCNT films, the OLC samples show better radiation performance despite a lower measured conductivity. Â© 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.
