Aqueous solutions combining multiple Keggin type polyoxometalates (POMs) were used to modify multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in order to fabricate composite electrodes for electrochemical capacitors (ECs). Electrodes modified with a mixture of PMo12O403 - (PMo) and SiW12O404 - (SiW) demonstrated electrochemical behavior very similar to that of a pure PMo electrode. However, a mixture of PMo with PW12O403 - (PW) appeared to exhibit a synergistic effect such that the modified electrodes displayed very different characteristic redox behavior from either of their pure components. The mixed PMo/PW-coated electrode showed five times the volumetric capacitance of the bare MWCNT and a much more close to ideal capacitive cyclic voltammogram (CV) as compared to that of either PMo or PW alone.
