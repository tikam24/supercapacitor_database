Wide applications of compression-resistant electronics have promoted the demands for energy storage devices with high compressive strength. Herein, we fabricated highly dense graphene architectures (DGAs) embedded with solid electrolyte by evaporation-induced shrinkage of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) hydrogels filled with phosphoric acid/polyvinyl alcohol (H3PO4/PVA) electrolyte solution. In such DGAs, rGO sheets remain a stacked structure and solid electrolyte is uniformly distributed throughout the DGAs, forming a good contact between rGO sheets and solid electrolyte by hydrogen bonding interactions. The DGAs exhibit a high weight density of 1.5 g cm−3, excellent modulus of 234 MPa and high conductivity of 13.5 S m−1. Furthermore, the all-solid-state supercapacitors based on DGAs achieved a superior volumetric capacitance of about 155 F cm−3 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. More importantly, the all-solid-state supercapacitors based on DGAs retain stable electrochemical properties under different compressive stresses.
