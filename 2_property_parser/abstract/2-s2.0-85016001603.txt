In this article, the nickel oxide membrane electrode incorporated with nickel and coated with carbon layer (M-NiO/Ni@CL) is prepared through phase-separation method followed by thermal annealing process. The effects of thickness and feeding ratio of precursor components on the structures and electrochemical behaviors are also investigated. The electrode membrane of M-NiO/Ni@CL with the thickness of 67 μm exhibits the highest specific capacitance of 375 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g, and even retains 353 F/g when the current density increasing 10 times (94.1%). In addition, an asymmetrical supercapacitor (ASC) cell based on the as-synthesized material of M-NiO/Ni@CL (positive electrode) and the activated carbon (negative electrode) is developed. The ASC device presents a high specific capacitance of 41.9 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g based on the total mass of cell within a voltage range of 0–1.6 V; more importantly, it shows an ultralong cycling stability, with 93.8% of capacitance retention after 5000 cycles. The high rate capability and the long-cycle life of NiO electrode are mainly due to the unique structure of membrane, the quantum-dots incorporation of nickel, and the thin layer of carbon coating.
