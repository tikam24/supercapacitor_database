Herein, we report the application of amorphous molybdenum sulfide (MoSx, x â‰ˆ 3) as the main active material for supercapacitor electrodes. MoSx was deposited at room temperature onto a high specific surface area electrode made of graphene-carbon nanotube hybrids directly grown on carbon paper (GCNT/CP), using an electrochemical deposition method. The MoSx/GCNT/CP electrode showed high specific capacitance. A gravimetric specific capacitance of 414 F g-1 was demonstrated at a constant discharge rate of 0.67 A g-1. The deposition of MoSx onto a conductive, high surface area support played a crucial role for a high specific capacitance. An up to 4.5-fold enhancement in specific capacitance was demonstrated when MoSx was deposited on GCNT/CP as compared to MoSx deposited on a simple carbon paper support. The MoSx/GCNT/CP electrode is suggested to be a novel candidate for supercapacitor applications.
