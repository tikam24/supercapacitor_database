The complex-architectured NiFe-LDH@FeOOH negative material was first prepared by simple two-step hydrothermal method. In this study, the porous nanostructure of FeOOH nanosheets features a large number of accessible channels to electroactive sites and the two-dimensional layered structure of NiFe-LDH nanosheets have an open spatial structure with high specific surface area, which enhance the diffusion of ions in the active material. Benefited from above advantages, the excellent electrochemical properties were demonstrated. NiFe-LDH@FeOOH nanocomposites present high specific capacitance (1195 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g), lower resistance and well cycling performance (90.36% retention after 1000 cycles). Furthermore, the NiFe-LDH@MnO2//NiFe-LDH@FeOOH supercapacitor exhibits 22.68 Wh/kg energy density at 750 W/kg power density, demonstrating potential application in energy storage devices.
