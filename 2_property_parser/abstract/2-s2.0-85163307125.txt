Aircraft electrification is one of the growing trends pushing towards a cleaner aviation. The More Electric Aircraft paradigm, having as objective the replacement of hydraulic/pneumatic actuators with electric ones, represents an intermediate step of this journey. In this work, a battery and a supercapacitor installed on the aircraft power grid are controlled through DC/DC converters in order to reduce the stress on both the mechanical and electric parts of the main aircraft generator. Stability properties of the considered grid are proved and a Second Order Sliding Mode control algorithm is applied for converters control. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is shown by detailed simulations in Matlab/Simscape/Electronics.
