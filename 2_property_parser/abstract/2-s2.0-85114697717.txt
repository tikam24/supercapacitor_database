The application of hybrid energy storage to distributed energy systems can significantly improve energy efficiency and reduce the investment operating cost of the system. However, inadequate efforts are found focusing on the investigation of the integration of the two systems and optimization configuration and operation strategy of systems. Therefore, a novel distributed energy system combining hybrid energy storage was proposed, and the system optimization configuration and operation strategy of the novel system were considered simultaneously. The hybrid system contained heat storage and two power storage forms, i.e., supercapacitors and lithium battery. The influence of hybrid energy storage on distributed energy systems was fully considered. Subsequently, a two-layer collaborative optimization method for the novel system considering energy efficiency, economy, and environmental protection was presented. The novel system was applied to a nearly zero-energy community. The results indicate that the primary energy-saving and pollutant equivalent emission reduction rates of the novel system are evaluated to be 54.8% and 63.6%, respectively, under the low-pass filter operation strategy combined with the secondary feedback adjustment of the supercapacitor charge state. The system configuration and operation strategy can be optimized simultaneously by the two-layer collaborative optimization method.
