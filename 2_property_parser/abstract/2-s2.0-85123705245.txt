In this article, hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) with high surface area of 1604.9 m2/g is prepared by the pyrolysis of rubberwood sawdust using CaCO3 as a hard template. The bio-oil pyrolyzed from the rubber sawdust, followed by the polymerization reaction to form resole phenolic resin, can be used as a carbon source to prepare HPC. The biomass-derived HPC shows a three-dimensionally interconnected morphology which can offer a continuous pathway for ionic transport. The symmetrical supercapacitors based on the as-prepared HPC were tested in 1.0 M tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate / propylene carbonate electrolyte. The results of electrochemical analysis show that the HPC-based supercapacitor exhibits a high specific capacitance of 113.3 F/g at 0.5 A/g with superior rate capability and cycling stability up to 5000 cycles. Hybrid lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) based on the HPC and Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) were also fabricated. The LICs have a maximum energy density of 113.3 Wh/kg at a power density of 281 W/kg. Moreover, the LIC also displays a remarkable cycling performance with a retention of 92.8% after 3000 cycles at a large current density of 0.75 A/g, suggesting great potential application in the energy storage of the LIC.
