The development of high-performance energy-storage devices is crucial for satisfying the rapidly increasing demands for new applications that require high-power, high-energy, and cost-effective energy-storage systems (ESSs). The supercapacitors have high power densities, long lifetimes, short charging times, and excellent safety characteristics for fulfilling these requirements. If hybridization of different chemical substances is made, then even better properties can be achieved. In this review article, different hybrid nanostructures for advanced supercapacitors are going to be discussed and compared to find the one which will demonstrate optimum properties. Here, graphene with its excellent electrical properties and porous carbon nanostructure resulting in large specific surface area will be kept as the constant part, while various other chemical substances are going to be added to produce different supercapacitors. These will include: hybrid of (1) graphene-wrapped Li4Ti5O12 and activated carbon, (2) copper oxide nanowire/graphene, (3) oxygen-deficient TiO2/graphene.
