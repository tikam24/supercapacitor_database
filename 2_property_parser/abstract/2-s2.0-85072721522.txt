This paper presents an efficient method to synthesize multi-heteroatom doped carbon materials where host-guest complexes are used as precursors. Inclusion of multi-heteroatom (nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S))-containing guest molecules (methyl orange (MO)/methylene blue (MB)) inner cavity of host molecules (β-cyclodextrin, β-CD) doped carbon frameworks with multi-heteroatoms. Produced materials exhibited a high performance such as supercapacitor electrodes with high specific surface area of (1580 m2/g), N content of 1.68%, specific capacitance of 291.5 F/g at 0.5 A/g current density, and a cycling stability up to 10000 cycles at 10 A/g current density. This study demonstrated great potential of the MO- and MB-included β-CD as electrode materials for supercapacitors.
