This chapter deals with understanding the effect of external magnetic field on the performance of supercapacitors fabricated using magnetically responsive materials, i.e. magneto-electric supercapacitors. Further, a simple theoretical model is also provided to explain the experimental data. A new theoretical model is required because the conventional models used to explain the supercapacitive behaviour do not have any terms, which consider the possibility of changing magnetic fields and its impact on electrochemical behaviour.
