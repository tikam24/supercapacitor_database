Construction of metal selenides with a large specific surface area and a hollow structure is one of the effective methods to improve the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors. However, the nano-material easily agglomerates due to the lack of support, resulting in the loss of electrochemical performance. Herein, we successfully design a three-dimensional graphene (3DG) encapsulation-protected hollow nanoboxes (CoSe2-SnSe2) composite aerogel (3DG/CoSe2-SnSe2) via a co-precipitation method coupled with self-assembly route, followed by a high temperature selenidation strategy. The obtained aerogel possesses porous 3DG conductive network, large specific surface area and plenty of reactive active sites. It could be used as a flexible and binder-free electrode after a facile mechanical compression process, which provided a high specific capacitance of 460 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1, good rate capability of 212.7 F g-1 at 10 A g-1 The capacitance retention rate is 80% at 2 A g-1 after 5000 cycles due to the fast electron/ion transfer and electrolyte diffusion. With the as-prepared 3DG/CoSe2-SnSe2 as positive electrodes and the AC (activated carbon) as negative electrodes, an asymmetric supercapacitor (3DG/CoSe2-SnSe2//AC) was fabricated, which delivered a high specific capacity of 38 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and an energy density of 11.89 Wh kg-1 at 749.9 W kg-1, as well as excellent cycle stability. This work provides a new method for preparing electrode material.
