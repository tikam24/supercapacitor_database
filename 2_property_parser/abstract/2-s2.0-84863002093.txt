Polyaniline doped by Zn 2+ ions was synthesized as nanocomposites with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) by in-situ oxidative polymerization and investigated as electrode material for supercapacitors. The uniform coating of polyaniline on MWCNT was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The effect of Zn2+ ions on nanocomposites were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The electrochemical performances were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), constant current charging/discharging cyclic test (CC) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) using a three-electrode system. The doped polyaniline composites show higher specific capacitance and better cyclic stability. Copyright Â© 2012 American Scientific Publishers.
