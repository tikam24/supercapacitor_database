We report a novel photonic processing technique as a next-generation cost-effective technique to instantaneously synthesize nanostructured manganese-cobalt mixed oxide reduced graphitic oxide (Mn-Co-rGO) for supercapacitor electrodes in energy storage applications. The active material was prepared directly on highly conductive Pt-Si substrate, eliminating the need for a binder. Surface morphological analysis showed that the as-prepared electrodes have a highly porous and resilient nanostructure that facilitates the ion/electron movement during faradaic redox reactions and buffers the volume changes during charge-discharge processes, leading to the improved structural integrity of the electrode. The presence of distinct redox peaks, due to faradaic redox reactions, at all scan rates in the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves and non-linear nature of the charge-discharge curves suggest the pseudocapacitive charge storage mechanism of the electrode. The electrochemical stability and the life cycle were examined by carrying out galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) measurements at 0.40 mA cm-2 constant areal current density for 80000 cycles, and the electrode showed 95% specific capacitance retention, exhibiting excellent electrochemical stability and an ultra-long cycle life. Such remarkable electrochemical performance could be attributed to the enhanced conductivity of the electrode, the synergistic effect of metal ions with rGO, and the highly porous morphology, which provides large specific surface area for electrode/electrolyte interaction and facilitates the ion transfer.
