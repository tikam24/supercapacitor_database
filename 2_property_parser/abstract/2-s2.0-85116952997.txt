PAN-based nanofibers prepared by electrospinning have large specific surface area, high mechanical strength, excellent nanostructure and good chemical stability. Based on PAN nanofibers, electrode materials for multi-directional design and synthesis show excellent electrochemical performance in supercapacitors and have broad application prospects. In this paper, according to the classification of electrode materials, the research progress of PAN-based porous structure electrode materials, heteroatom doped electrode materials and electrode materials composited with the three electrode materials including carbon-based materials, conductive polymers and metal oxides were reviewed in detail. These studies showed that the construction of pore structure, activation treatment and nitrogen doping can improve the specific surface area, electrochemical activity, wettability and graphitization of PAN-based carbon nanofibers. Carbon-based materials, metal oxides, conductive polymers were compounded with PAN-based carbon nanofibers. It can synergize the advantages of each component and make up for its own shortcomings, which greatly improved the specific capacitance, conductivity and cycle stability of the composite electrode material, and provided the possibility of preparing high-performance supercapacitors. Finally, the problems in the above research were proposed and the future development prospect of PAN-based electrode materials in supercapacitors was prospected.
