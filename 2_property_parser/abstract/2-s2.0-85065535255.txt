Rational design of earth-abundant porous transition metal-based nanomaterials (PTMNs)is of great importance for developing next-generation electrocatalysts of electrochemical energy devices. The development of inexpensive catalysts would meet the demand in the energy sector. Due to the perfect match between the porous features (large surface areas, high pore volumes, modulated pore structures)and transition metal advantages (unique d electron configurations, low cost nature, synergistic effect of multi-metal atoms, excellent stability), there is significant advance for the energy systems of electrochemical supercapacitors (ECs), batteries, water splitting and fuel cells (FCs). In this review, we systematically discuss the recent achievements in the typical oxides, sulfide, phosphide and carbrides of PTMNs for electrochemical energy storage and conversion. The novel design, fabrication, and applications performance of these nanomaterials are illustrated and compared. The current challenges and future prospects of PTMNs in EESC applications are also provided. We believe that this timely and critical review will stimulate increasing extensive studies and attract more attentions, further improving the development of promising PTMNs.
