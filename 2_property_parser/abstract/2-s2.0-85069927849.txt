Sodium–vanadium fluorophosphate (Na3V2O2 x(PO4)2F3−2 x, NVPF, 0 ≤ x ≤ 1) is considered to be a promising Na-storage cathode material due to its high operation potentials (3.6–4 V) and minor volume variation (1.8%) during Na+-intercalation. Research about NVPF is mainly focused on powder-type samples, while its ordered array architecture is rarely reported. In this work, large-area and uniform Na3(VO)2(PO4)2F cuboid arrays are vertically grown on carbon nanofiber (CNF) substrates for the first time. Owing to faster electron/ion transport and larger electrolyte–electrode contact area, the as-prepared NVPF array electrode exhibits much improved Na-storage properties compared to its powder counterpart. Importantly, a quasi-solid-state sodium-ion hybrid capacitor (SIHC) is constructed based on the NVPF array as an intercalative battery cathode and porous CNF as a capacitive supercapacitor anode together with the P(VDF-HFP)-based polymer electrolyte. This novel hybrid system delivers an attractive energy density of ≈227 W h kg−1 (based on total mass of two electrodes), and still remains as high as 107 Wh kg−1 at a high specific power of 4936 W kg−1, which pushes the energy output of sodium hybrid capacitors toward a new limit. In addition, the growth mechanism of NVPF arrays is investigated in detail.
