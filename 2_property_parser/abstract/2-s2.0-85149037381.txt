The development of electrode materials with nanostructures is of great importance in the field of supercapacitors. In the present research, the direct simultaneous deposition of Ni-Co nanosphere (Ni-Co NS) on nickel foam as a substrate has been performed by facile one-step electrodeposition method without any template to provide excellent electrical conductivity and efficiency of electrode materials. The SEM images of Ni-Co NS electrode showed a nanosphere shape. The electrochemical performance of the electrodeposited nanosphere has been investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in 3 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. The Ni-Co NS electrode showed a good specific capacity of 564.6 C g−1 at 2 A g−1 with rate capability of 70% in the current density range of 2–20 A g−1, reasonable cyclic stability of 86% after 5000 cycles at the scan rate of 70 mV s−1, low internal resistance, and high surface area of the nanospheres. Interestingly, an asymmetric supercapacitor fabricated using Ni-Co NS and activated carbon as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively, operating at the potential window of 1.5 V delivered high energy and power densities of 34.5 Wh kg−1 and 683 W kg−1, respectively.
