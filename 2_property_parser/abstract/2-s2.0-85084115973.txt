The present work reports the energy storage behavior of double perovskite Gd2NiMnO6 synthesized via facile wet chemical route. The XRD pattern revealed the formation of the monoclinic phase with P21/n symmetry. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis exhibited the presence of Gd3+, Ni2+/Ni3+, Mn2+/Mn3+/Mn4+ ions on the surface of Gd2NiMnO6. The scanning and transmission electron micrographs revealed the presence of agglomerated nanoparticles of heterogeneous shapes and sizes. For the first time, the energy storage performance of Gd2NiMnO6 electrode has been investigated using cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry techniques to demonstrate the nature of pseudocapacitance. The specific capacitance achieved by chronopotentiometry technique was ⁓400.46 Fg-1 at current density of 1Ag-1. Further, the calculated critical parameters that affect the performance of electrochemical study i.e., energy density and power density were ⁓20.23 Wh kg−1 and ⁓421.75 W kg−1, respectively at current density of 1 A g−1.
