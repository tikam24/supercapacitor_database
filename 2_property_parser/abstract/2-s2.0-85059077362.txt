Smart textile has been an attractive and promising issue in the field of artificial intelligent system. As the critical component of smart textile, the energy storage textiles are tending toward the directions of lightweight, portable, wearable and flexible. Developing flexible and wearable supercapacitors (SCs) has become a promising strategy to achieve seamless integration to garment. Herein, the planar flexible all-solid SC model was proposed in our work based on the graphene-and-MnO2-deposited fibrous nonwoven fabric. Graphene nanosheets and MnO2 were deposited on the prepared cellulose nonwoven fabric via capillarity-assisted assembly coating method and in-situ chemical growth method respectively. The assembled graphene/MnO2 SC exhibits good electric conductivity, excellent flexibility, a high specific capacitance of 138.8 mF/cm2, outstanding cycle life and bending properties of remaining 87.6% of the initial capacitance under 180° bending angles for 1000 cycles. The effect of the substrate texture structure (nonwoven and woven structure) was also investigated. To demonstrate the application of our all-solid SC, three devices connected in series could easily light six LED with a logo of “smiling”. The assembled GMNF-SC can be acted the reasonable energy storage candidates for the wearable devices with the seamless integration to garment.
