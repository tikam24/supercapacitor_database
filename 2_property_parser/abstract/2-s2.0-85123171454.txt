Metal-organic frameworks, also called porous coordination polymers, are special type of crystalline porous materials built by coordination of organic linkers to metal ions/clusters. Their unique features such as structural diversity and tailorability as well as high specific surface area etc. have made them highly advanced and multipurpose materials with applications in diverse fields. However, poor conductivity and low stability limits the capability of traditional MOFs. To deal with these shortcomings, fusion of electrically conducting graphene into MOFs is a feasible option. Herein, an effort has been made to summarize recent research in the synthesis of MOFs/graphene materials and their applications in varied fields including adsorption, gas separation, water splitting, dye and pollutant removal etc. In addition, specific applications of MOFs/graphene materials in sensing, enantioselective capturing and anti-fouling have also been explored. The aim of this review is to apprise the researchers with a comprehensive summary of the most recent advancements in this field.
