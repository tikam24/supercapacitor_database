Nowadays, great effort has been devoted to designing carbon aerogels with compressibility, elasticity, wide linear sensitivity and multifunctional characteristics. Herein, a biomass-mediated strategy was applied to synthesize nitrogen doped carbon aerogels (C-NGD) by using the calcinated mixture of glucose & dicyandiamide nanosheets (C-GD) and cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) as sustainable, cheap and massive precursors. The synthesized C-NGD has considerable elasticity, compressibility and fatigue resistance. The interaction between C-GD and CNFs leads to a super stable wave-layered structure that can support an ultrahigh compression strain (95%) and long-term compression (3000 cycles, at a 50% strain). Particularly, a wide-range linear sensitivity can be obtained under 0–10 kPa, with a high sensitivity of 10.08 kPa−1. These advantages enable the carbon aerogel to be applied in wearable piezoresistive sensing devices to detect body motion and biosignals. Besides, C-NGD also shows potential applications for supercapacitors and triboelectric nanogenerators. Thus, this biomass-derived carbon aerogel is a kind of multifunctional material toward flexible electronics, and energy conversion/storage devices.
