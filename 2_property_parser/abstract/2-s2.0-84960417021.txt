Lanthanum selenide (La2Se3) nanocubes thin film is prepared via successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method and utilized for energy storage application. The prepared La2Se3 thin film is characterized by X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy and contact angle measurement techniques for structural, surface morphological and wettability studies, respectively. Energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDAX) is performed in order to obtain the elemental composition of the thin film. The La2Se3 film electrode shows a maximum specific capacitance of 363 F g-1 in a 0.8 M LiClO4/PC electrolyte at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1 within 1.3 V/SCE potential range. The specific capacitive retention of 83 % of La2Se3 film electrode is obtained over 1000 cyclic voltammetry cycles. The predominant performance, such as high energy (80 Wh kg-1) and power density (2.5 kW kg-1), indicates that La2Se3 film electrode facilitates fast ion diffusion during redox processes.
