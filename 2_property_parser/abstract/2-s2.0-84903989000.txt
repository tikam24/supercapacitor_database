A supercapacitor composite electrode was effectively fabricated by using cyclic voltammetric deposition of poly(pyrrole- co-2-formylpyrrole)-multiwall carbon nanotube composite, P(Py-co-FPy)MWCNT. The charge storage of the threedimensional nanofibril of the P(Py-co-FPy)-coated MWCNT composite electrode was excellent and reached the specific capacitive value of up to 535 F g -1.
