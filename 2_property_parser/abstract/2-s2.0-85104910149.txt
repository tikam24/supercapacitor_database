Heat-resistant supercapacitors with excellent mechanical strength are highly required for flexible and wearable electronics in our daily life. Here, high-performance and heat-resistant solid-state supercapacitors based on poly(para-phenylene terephthalamide) fibers/Ag/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)&carbon nanotubes (PPTA/Ag/PCNTs) have been fabricated for the first time. Due to the toughness of the PPTA fibers and the excellent electroconductivity of the composite fiber, the PPTA/Ag/PCNTs-based supercapacitor exhibits good electrochemical performance together with brilliant mechanical strength and bending durability. Moreover, the heat resistance of tough PPTA/Ag/PCNTs fiber and ionic liquid gel electrolyte endow the supercapacitor with stability at temperatures as high as 80 Â°C and the capacitance can return to more than 80% after the heat treatment. The power density or energy density of the supercapacitor assembled on PPTA/Ag/PCNTs fiber electrodes is higher than that of any other polymer fiber-related supercapacitor. This work adds to the study of high-performance supercapacitors based on polymer fibers and provides the possibility to apply PPTA fiber for energy storage devices with flexibility and heat resistance.
