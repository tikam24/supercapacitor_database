With the increasing industrialization and growing population, there is a great demand in developing efficient energy storage devices. One such device is a supercapacitor, which has been gaining attention in the past decade with its excellent energy and power density. By varying the electrode materials of the supercapacitor, its properties could be fine tuned to a greater extent. A heterogeneous functional material such as graphene is the widely used electrode material among the carbonaceous electrode materials. Graphene, a 2D structured material often suffers from agglomeration thereby limiting its performance. Restacking of sheets into a 3D structure enables them to provide numerous properties beneficial in improving the supercapacitance. This review focuses on the synthesis and application of various heterogeneous 3D graphene derivatives such as foam, sponge, aerogel, hydrogel, fibers, tubes, spheres etc., in supercapacitors.
