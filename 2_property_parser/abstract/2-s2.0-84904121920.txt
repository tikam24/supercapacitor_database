Herein, we describe a supramolecular approach to synthesize tough ionogels through self-initiated ultraviolet polymerization. The prepared ionogel can be used as the integrated electrolyte and separator in the all-solid supercapacitor. The electrochemical performance can be tuned by the temperature, and a higher value can be achieved at higher temperature. This journal is Â© the Partner Organisations 2014.
