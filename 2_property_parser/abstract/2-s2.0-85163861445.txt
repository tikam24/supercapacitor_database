The degradation of batteries is so harsh due to the rapid charging and discharging cycles which are associated with the quick discharge of the battery and the effect on the battery performance due to high peak current. When the battery is unable to support the load for the required time, forces the user to use oversized energy storage systems, which can supply the amount of energy required but the constraints on the size, weight, and capital must be satisfied. This study shows the effect of peak current on the performance of the Battery, and how to prevent such reduction in time by properly handling the usage of the energy storage systems. This study contains a simulated MATLAB model, and a comparison is made on different peak current levels, keeping the parameters like ambient temperature and current rate fixed. From the analysis, the loss in the battery support time with the peak of the discharge current is obtained.
