Highly delaminated nickel aluminum layered double hydroxides (NiAl-LDHs) nanosheets were directly synthesized in one-step reverse microemulsion. Using them as the building blocks, the graphene oxide (GO)/NiAl-LDHs nanocomposites could be constructed by simple electrostatic self-assembly. The structure of the as-prepared nanocomposites was further optimized by changing the amount of GO to exploit better super-capacitance properties. Results showed that GO/NiAl-LDHs composite containing 12 wt% GO exhibited the best electrochemical properties with a maximum specific capacitance of 959 F g−1 at current density of 1 A g−1 and the highest capacitance retention of 67% even at 10 A g−1, whereas that of pure NiAl-LDHs was only 29%. The significant improvement stems from the layer structure that formed by strong interaction between negatively charged GO and positively charged NiAl-LDH nanosheets. Moreover, the GO/NiAl-LDHs material was utilized as the cathode in asymmetric supercapacitor, with excellent energy density and power density performances as well as excellent electrochemical stability. Our simple synthesis strategy of monolayer NiAl-LDHs nanosheets and its nanocomposites demonstrate the potential to design artificial 2D materials for energy application in a large scale.
