In this paper, a scheme of stand-alone off-grid solar photovoltaic water pumping system based on supercapacitor is proposed. Supercapacitor has the characteristics of a high power density and a large cycle life over commercial batteries. The core objective of this paper is the utilization of these supercapacitor properties to enhance the performance of a direct coupled solar photovoltaic water pumping system (SPVWPS).The results are analyzed based on without and with supercapacitors based SPVWPS. The experiment clearly depicts that the supercapacitor based water pumping system gives better performance in terms of daily water output and the system performance index than the direct coupled SPVWPS.
