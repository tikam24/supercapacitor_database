As a kind of electrode material, hard carbon has the advantages of high theoretical capacity, excellent rate performance and stable structure. In recent years, it has been getting increased attention to synthesize hard carbon by pyrolysising biomass with unique hierarchical microstructure. In this thesis, the domestic and overseas researches about biomass derived hard carbon used in Li-ion batteries, Na-ion batteries and supercapacitor were summarized. Firstly the common resources of biomass was listed. Second, the microstructure advantage of biomass-derived hard carbon was analyzed. Third, the synthesizing and surface modification methods to enhance the charge/discharge capacity and Initial Coulombic Efficiency (ICE) were illustrated. Considering about these advantages, including low cost of raw material, environment-friendly preparation process and exceptional electrochemical performance, biomass-derived hard carbon is expected to apply in the field of electrochemical energy storage extensively.
