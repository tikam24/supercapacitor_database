To deal with two major problems of electric vehicle (EV): the short driving range and the short life of batteries, a hybrid power system was designed and applied to the EV. It was composed of an ultracapacitor with high-specific power and long life, four lead-acid batteries with high-specific energy, and a bi-directional DC/DC converter. To improve the stability and reliability of the system, based on researching driving process and μ synthesis robust control, the driving mathematical model of the system was established, and the driving μ synthesis robust controller for the system was designed. The simulation experimental results show that the hybrid power could not only increase the starting current, but also reduce the batteries' discharge current and lengthen the life of batteries. Additionally, the μ synthesis robust controller is superior to PID controller at response speed, steady-state tracking error and resisting disturbance. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
