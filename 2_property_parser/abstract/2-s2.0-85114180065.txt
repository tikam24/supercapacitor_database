Organic-based energy harvesting devices can contribute to a sustainable solution for the transition to renewable energy sources. The concept of ionic thermoelectrics (iTE) has been recently proposed and motivated by the high values of thermo-voltage in electrolytes. So far, most research has focused on developing new electrolytes with high Seebeck coefficient. Despite the major role of the electrode materials in supercapacitors and batteries, the effect of various electrodes on energy harvesting in iTE devices has not been widely studied. In this work, the conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is investigated as the functional electrodes in iTE supercapacitors. Through investigating the thermo-voltage of iTEs of the same electrolyte with varying composition of PEDOT electrodes, it is identified that the different PSS content greatly affects the overall thermo-induced voltage coefficient, Seff (i.e., effective thermopower). The permselective polyanion in the electrode causes cation concentration differences at the electrode/electrolyte interface and contributes to an interfacial potential drop that is temperature dependent. As a result, the overall thermo-voltage of the device possesses both an interfacial and a bulk contribution. The findings extend the fundamental understanding of iTE effect with functional electrodes, which could lead a new direction to enhance the heat-to-electricity conversion.
