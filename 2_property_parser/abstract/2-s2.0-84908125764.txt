Fiber-like polyaniline (PANI)/carbon nanohorn (CNH) composites (PACN composites) were prepared as electrode materials for supercapacitor by simple method that involves in-situ polymerization of aniline in the presence of CNH in acidic (HCl) medium with noteworthy electrochemical performances. Thus, the prepared PACN composites show high specific capacitance value of ≈ 834 F/g at 5 mV/s scan rate compared to ≈ 231 F/g for pure PANI and CNH (≈ 145 F/g) at same scan rate of 5 mV/s. CNHs are homogeneously dispersed throughout the matrix and coated successfully. Thus, it provides more active sites for nucleation and electron transfer path. In addition, the composites show high electrical conductivity in the order of ≈ 6.7·10–2 S·cm–1 which indicates the formation of continuous interconnected conducting network path in the PACN composites. Morphological study of the PACN composites was carried out by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM).
