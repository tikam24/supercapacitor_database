In this paper, mesoporous carbons were successfully sythesized by direct pyrolysis of ferric citrate salts in a nitrogen atmosphere. The morphology of the samples were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM). N2 adsorption-desorption test shows that the specific surface area of mesoporous carbon MCs -800 was 1 918 m2/g. The pyrolysis process of Ferric citrate was studied by TG technology in nitrogen atmosphere. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Galvanostatic charge/discharge (GC) measurements are applied to evaluate the electrochemical potential of MCs. Based on the results, we can find out that the CV curves of MCs-800 prepared by directly pyrolysising ferric citrate yield a shape of rectangular. Galvanostatic charge/discharge measurement demonstrates that samples at different current densities present well triangular shape, and the anode and the cathode process basic symmetric, suggests that the sample has good electrochemical stability and reversibility.
