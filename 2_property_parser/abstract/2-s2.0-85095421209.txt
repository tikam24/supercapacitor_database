The use of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides as electrodes for energy storage devices is rapidly increasing due to their intriguing electrochemical properties. In this contribution, we demonstrate the high-performance supercapacitive properties of hydrothermally prepared rhenium disulfide nanostructures using Li2SO4 and TEABF4 electrolytes. Physico-chemical characterizations, such as X-ray diffraction analysis, laser Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, reveal the formation of rhenium disulfide with good stoichiometry. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance analyses reveal the presence of ideal capacitive properties in the rhenium disulfide electrode. The rhenium disulfide electrode possesses a specific capacitance of about 189.28 F g-1 obtained from charge-discharge analysis at a current density of 0.5 mA cm-2 measured using a three-electrode configuration. The electrochemical studies of a rhenium disulfide symmetric supercapacitor device demonstrate the high-performance capacitive properties with a high cell capacitance of 35.75 F g-1 and high energy density of 3.17 W h kg-1 with excellent cyclic stability. The specific capacitance and energy density of a rhenium disulfide symmetric supercapacitor were boosted to 51.4 F g-1 and 28.55 W h kg-1 using TEABF4 electrolyte. Furthermore, the solar cell charged ReS2 SSC can efficiently power electronic devices for a long time, improving its effectiveness for the development of backup energy systems. The experimental results elucidate the potential use of rhenium disulfide nanostructures as an electrode material for high-performance supercapacitor devices.
