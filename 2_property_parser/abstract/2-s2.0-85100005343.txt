Rational design of the electrode materials in distinctive architecture and tailored composition is critical for regulating their electrochemical properties. Herein, the novel porous zinc-cobalt sulfides (ZCS) bead-curtain-like arrays (BCA) supported by three-dimensional Ni foam (NF) (denoted as ZCS/NF BCA) are fabricated as advanced electrode for supercapacitors (SCs), which exhibit remarkable electrochemical performances in respect of superb capacity of ~837 C g−1 (specific capacitance of ~1860 F g−1) at 1 A g−1 and ultra-long cycling stability (~92.9% retention after 5000 cycles at 6 A g−1). Furthermore, the assembled hybrid supercapacitors based on ZCS/NF BCA delivers ultrahigh energy density of ~88 Wh kg−1 with a maximum power density of ~800 W kg−1. The excellent properties may be ascribed to the combined contributions from the hierarchical bead-curtain architecture of ZCS/NF BCA composite and the bimetallic sulfide with abundant valence states for rich redox reactions.
