Transition metal sulfides have been used in energy storage field recently, while single component can no longer meet increasing requirements of energy storage devices. Combining metal sulfides with carbon is proved to be feasible. Herein, microwave-assisted synthesis of MoS2/graphene composites is proposed. Uniform and small MoS2 nanoparticles can be rapidly grown on graphene by this method, which endows as-prepared composites with superior capacitive properties. The resulting MoS2/graphene composites exhibit a specific capacitance of 401.1 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 95.0% capacitance over 10000 cycles at 5 A g−1. Furthermore, they exhibit a high energy density of 26.4 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 1015.4 W kg−1, disclosing outstanding capacitive performances.
