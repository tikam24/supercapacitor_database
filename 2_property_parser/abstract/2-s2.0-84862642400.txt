The electrochemical capacitance for a double layer of ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) nanofibers functionalized under differing conditions is presented. OMC nanofibers were prepared using the molding method from SBA-15 and sucrose. Functionalisation was performed using varying HNO3 concentrations at 110°C and 120°C assisted by microwave radiation over 3 minutes. The transmission electron micrographs of the resulting fibers are reported. The capacitance, surface area and functional groups as functions of the acidity and heat treatment were analysed via cyclic voltammetry, nitrogen adsorption-desorption, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively. Ordered nanofibers treated with 7.7 M HNO3 at 110°C exhibited the highest capacitance. © J. New Mat. Electrochem. Systems.
