Abstract Present work reports electropolymerization of aniline onto stainless steel substrate using room temperature ionic liquid N-methyl-2-pyrrolidonium hydrogensulfate [NMP][HSO<inf>4</inf>] by potentiodynamic electrodeposition method. To study the effect of electropolymerization cycle number on the electrochemical performance, the number of scans is varied from 1<sup>st</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> cycle. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is used for the phase identification of polyaniline (PANI) films. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) was used to study the electrochemical activity of PANI films. The highest specific capacitance of 581 Fg<sup>-</sup><sup>1</sup> and energy density of 96.6 whkg<sup>-1</sup> are obtained for the sample, deposited using four cycle.
