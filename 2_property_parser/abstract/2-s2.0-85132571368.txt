In dual-motor drive systems, a supercapacitor is connected to a common direct current (DC) bus through a DC/DC converter for the storage and utilization of regenerative energy, which is an effective energy saving method. However, the uncoordinated control of this type of system results in undesirable power circulation and reduced energy utilization efficiency. In this paper, an optimal power tracking control strategy based on a power flow predictive model is proposed. The power flow of the system is analyzed and a power flow predictive model is established. In addition, an objective function is deduced from the perspective of optimal performance tracking and minimum grid side energy consumption. The reference power of a supercapacitor is obtained in real time under constraints. The power flows among the grid side, the motors, and the energy storage unit are fully coordinated to realize a reasonable energy distribution. Experimental results indicate that the energy utilization efficiency of the system is improved by 25.4% in comparison with double closed-loop control in one working period.
