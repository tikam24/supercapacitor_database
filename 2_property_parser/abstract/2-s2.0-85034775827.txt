A smooth delivery of the power generated by renewable sources has become a relevant requirement for ensuring proper power quality. This paper studies the quality of electric energy in microgrid of tens of kilowatts. Indeed, the integration of a fast element of storage with supercapacitor in a microgrid constituted by a wind turbine and photovoltaic generator reduced significantly the fluctuations of power at the terminals of electric charge. Different tests under different climactic conditions showed the ability of supercapacitor to absorb the rapid fluctuations caused either by the renewable energy sources or by the load itself.
