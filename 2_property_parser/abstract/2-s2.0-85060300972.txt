In recent years, significant progress have been made in supercapacitor-based portable applications, where the switched-resistors circuit functions as a traditional cell balancing circuit. However, the existing charging control methods lack explicit consideration of the relatively high system temperature, leading to the decrease of the system life span and the serious thermal effect. In this paper, a temperature-suppressed charging method has been proposed to keep the system temperature at a low level during charging process. A proof is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. Laboratory hardware setup has been completed and experimental results show that the average temperature of the system can be reduced by at least 1.2 Â°C compared with existing methods.
