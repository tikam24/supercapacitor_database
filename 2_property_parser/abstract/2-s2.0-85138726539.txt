Herein, we present an interfacial engineering strategy to construct an efficient hydrothermal approach by in situ growing cobalt-doped@MnO2 nanocomposite on highly conductive nickel foam (Ni foam) for supercapacitors (SCs). The remarkably high specific surface area of Co dopant provides a larger contacting area for MnO2. In the meantime, the excellent retentions of the hierarchical phase-based pore architecture of the cobalt-doped surface could beneficially condense the electron transportation pathways. In addition, the nickel foam (Ni foam) nanosheets provide charge-transport channels that lead to the outstanding improved electrochemical activities of cobalt-doped@MnO2. The unique cobalt-doped@MnO2 nanocomposite electrode facilitates stable electrochemical architecture, multi-active electrochemical sites, and rapid electro-transports channels; which act as a key factor in enhancing the specific capacitances, stability, and rate capacities. As a result, the cobalt-doped@MnO2 nanocomposite electrode delivered superior electrochemical activities with a specific capacitance of 337.8 F g–1 at 0.5 A g–1; this is greater than pristine MnO2 (277.9 F g–1). The results demonstrate a worthy approach for the designing of high-performance SCs by the grouping of the nanostructured dopant material and metal oxides.
