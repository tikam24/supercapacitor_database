Electronic textiles, also known as e-textiles or garment devices [1] have found a variety of applications in the military and medicine to monitor soldier or patient vitals, as well as in athletic garments to give real-time feedback to athletes on their performance. However, many of these garments require a power source, such as a battery, but have thus far only integrated conventional coin cell or pouch cell batteries into the fabric.
