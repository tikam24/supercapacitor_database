MnO2@MoS2/Polypyrrole ternary composite is prepared through hydrothermal methods and a simple oxidation process by using MnO2@MoS2 sheet as the substrate and polypyrrole. The ternary composite serves as an electrode for pseudocapacitor which has more superior electrochemical properties compared with the binary complex. The supercapacitor electrode consists of two dimensional MoS2 layers as load skeleton, MnO2 providing electrochemical performance and polypyrrole improving high electric conductivity. These three components form a compact structure and synergistic effect leads to enhancing sufficient oxidation reduction for supercapacitor performance. Hence, MnO2@MoS2/ Polypyrrole structure possesses higher specific capacitance of 490 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g and excellent cycling stability of 90% after 1000 cycles at 1 A/g. Here, Polypyrrole is also used as the bender material, exhibiting mechanical flexibility for electrode. The results of this study provides a simple method to produce an effective material for flexible pseudocapacitor electrodes for higher energy storage devices.
