This study aimed to improve the electrochemical performance of MgFe2O4 (MFO) by combining it with g-C3N4 (g-CN). The hydrothermal process was used to produce electrodes directly on the nickel foam surface. XRD, FTIR, SEM, and TEM analyses were made to describe the electrodes in detail. CV, GCD, and EIS measurements were performed electrochemically at various scanning rates and current densities. According to the findings, g-CN-MFO electrode was successfully synthesized in spongy structure on Ni-foams. The areal capacitance (Ca) of g-CN-MFO was measured as 600 mF/cm2, which is 152% higher than MFO. At the same time, the energy and power densities of g-CN-MFO were calculated to be 13.3 mWh/cm2 and 200 mW/cm2 at 1 mA, respectively. EIS results showed that this increase was probably due to easier diffusion of electrolyte ions onto the electrode surface. As a result, the g-CN-MFO electrode can be considered a promising anode material for supercapacitors due to its low cost, ease of fabrication, and strong electrochemical performance.
