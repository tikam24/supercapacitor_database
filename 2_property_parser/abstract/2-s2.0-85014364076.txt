3D electrodes are of significant importance for the development of wearable electronics. In this manuscript, nitrogen doped graphite felt (NGF) and Ni1.4Co1.6S4 have been selected as a 3D conducting matrix and redox-active species for pseudocapacitor electrodes, respectively. The hydrothermal growth of Ni1.4Co1.6S4 in the presence of NGF yields stand-alone and bendable composite electrodes where Ni1.4Co1.6S4 forms porous nanosheets dispersed uniformly along the NGF surface. The experimental results show that the Ni1.4Co1.6S4/NGF electrode achieves a remarkable specific capacitance of 1625 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, which is maintained at 1465 F g−1 when the current density is increased to 20 A g−1. After cycling at a current density of 20 A g−1 for 2000 cycles, the Ni1.4Co1.6S4/NGF electrode still delivers 90.2% of its original specific capacitance. Such encouraging rate capability and cycling stability of the Ni1.4Co1.6S4/NGF electrode are attributed to the desirable Ni1.4Co1.6S4 nanostructure and the synergistic effect of the good electron conductivity and excellent surface property of the NGF substrate. The outstanding electrochemical performance of the Ni1.4Co1.6S4/NGF electrode makes it a promising candidate for 3D pseudocapacitor applications.
