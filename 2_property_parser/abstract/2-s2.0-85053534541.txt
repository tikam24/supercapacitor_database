This methodological and numerical computing based study involves in developing a methodology, which is capable of harvesting lightning energy. Till now the natural lightning is not a practicable and efficient source of energy, so this paper also proposed a methodology which has the ability to generate natural lightning in laboratory environment and it can store energy from lightning in reasonable way. This paper presents the overview of Lightning energy plant and the systematical concept of it. Simulation model of lightning energy plant has been proposed in Matlab/Simulink environment. Present work initiates a new line of thought about lightning experiment in low lightning occurring area. A new lightning triggering proposal using UAV or Drone has been initiated in this study. The efficiency and viability of proposed scheme can be examined with further experiment and empirical model.
