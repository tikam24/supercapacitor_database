Electrodes are fabricated using activated carbon@FeOOH and MoSe2. The synthesis of both electrode materials individually is done by a one-step hydrothermal process. The structural, morphological and chemical information's are investigated by XRD, FESEM and FTIR respectively. The electrochemical properties are investigated by EIS, CV and GCD. The Nyquist plot gives the value of Rb and Rct as 1.0 Ω and 1.3 Ω respectively. The cell shows a maximum specific capacitance of 110 F/g at the scan rate of 40 mV/s and the GCD shows a specific capacitance of 87.5 F/g at a high current density of 10 A/g. The energy density and power density calculated at current density 10 A/g are 31.11 Wh kg−1 and 4479 W kg−1, additionally, the maximum power density is 16000 W/kg, which is obtained at a current density of 40 A/g. The cell shows structural stability up to 5000 cycles with a capacity retention of 79%. The overall electrochemical performance of asymmetric electrodes (activated carbon@FeOOH and MoSe2) indicated its potential application in supercapacitors at commercial scale.
