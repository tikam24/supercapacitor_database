Two-dimensional (2D) nanoflakes of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) are directly developed on the titanium (Ti) substrate (VO@Ti) as an innovative electrode for pseudocapacitor. The designed VO@Ti electrode offers impressive capacitance of 1520 Fg-1 at 1.5 Ag-1 and superb long-term reliability with a 99% retention over 12000 cycles at 20 Ag-1 based on the merits of highly exposed active sites and improved electrical conductivity.
