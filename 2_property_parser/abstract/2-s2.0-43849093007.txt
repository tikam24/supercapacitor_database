Present work explored a room temperature, simple and low cost chemical route for the cobalt oxide film onto copper substrate from cobalt chloride (CoCl2·6H2O) precursor and characterization for its structural and electrochemical properties for supercapacitor application. The morphology and crystal structure of the film were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques, respectively. The electrochemical supercapacitive properties of cobalt oxide film were evaluated using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge methods. The film showed maximum specific capacitance of (165 F/g) in 1.0 M aqueous KOH electrolyte at scan rate 10 mV/s. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
