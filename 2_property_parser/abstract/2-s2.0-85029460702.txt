Portable and wearable sensors have attracted considerable attention in the healthcare field because they can be worn or implanted into a human body to monitor environmental information. However, sensors cannot work independently and require power. Flexible in-plane micro-supercapacitor (MSC) is a suitable power device that can be integrated with sensors on a single chip. Meanwhile, paper is an ideal flexible substrate because it is cheap and disposable and has a porous and rough surface that enhances interface adhesion with electronic devices. In this study, a new strategy to integrate MSCs, which have excellent electrochemical and mechanical performances, with sensors on a single piece of paper is proposed. The integration is achieved by printing Ni circuit on paper without using a precoating underlay. Ink diffusion is also addressed to some degree. Meanwhile, a UV sensor is integrated on a single paper, and the as-integrated device shows good sensing and self-powering capabilities. MSCs can also be integrated with a gas sensor on one-piece paper and can be charged by connecting it to a solar cell. Thus, it is potentially feasible that a flexible paper can be used for integrating MSCs with solar cell and various sensors to generate, store, and use energy.
