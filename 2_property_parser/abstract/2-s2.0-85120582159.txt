Energy storage and production is one of the significant issues of the 21st century, motivating the search for new materials for energy storage devices. Supercapacitors (SCs) play a prominent role among the class of energy storage devices and conversion systems since they provide greater specific capacitance, high power density, longer life span, fast chargeâ€“discharge rate, excellent circulation feature, low cost, and are safe to use. The selection of electrode material has great importance in the performance of the supercapacitor. Two-dimensional (2D) layered nanomaterials gained much interest in the fabrication of electrode materials due to their unique physicochemical properties. The current review explores the synthesis and application of novel 2D materials, such as graphene, MXene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), carbon nitrides, metal oxides/hydroxides, and black phosphorus (BP), as supercapacitor electrodes in detail.
