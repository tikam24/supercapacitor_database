The hierarchically porous carbons (HPCs) are prepared by sol-gel self-assembly technology at various surfactant concentrations (from 0 to 0.55 mol L-1). The influences of the surfactant (CTAB) concentration on the physical and electrochemical properties of the activated HPCs are investigated by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm, cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, cycle life, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and self-discharging in 6 M KOH electrolyte. The results demonstrate that the concentration of surfactant template is a crucial factor impacting the characteristics of HPCs. With the change of surfactant concentration, the activated HPCs at CCTAB = 0.27 mol L-1 (HPCs-3) shows the largest specific surface area of 689 m2 g -1. In addition, the activated HPCs show excellent supercapacitive behaviors and three sections self-discharge mechanism. Especially, the activated HPCs-3 appears superior electrochemical stability, low IR drop of 0.01 V, and the maximum specific capacitance of 272 F g-1 obtained from cyclic voltammetry at the scan rate of 1 mV s-1. Moreover, the supercapacitor used the activated HPCs-3 as electrode active material exhibits a specific capacitance of 61 F g-1 at the current density of 1 A g-1, and keeps a specific capacitance of 60 F g-1 after 5000 consecutive charge/discharge cycles.
