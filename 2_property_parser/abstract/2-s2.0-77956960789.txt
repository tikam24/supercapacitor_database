This paper developed a complete model which can simulate in details the transient dynamic performance of the Micro-Grid (MG) during and subsequent to islanding process. Wind speed fluctuations cause high fluctuations in output power of wind turbine which lead to fluctuations of frequency and voltages of the MG especially during islanding mode. In this study, new PI pitch controller and energy storage ultra capacitor are proposed to smooth the output power of wind turbine to reduce frequency and voltage fluctuations. Results proofed the effects of the proposed controllers in improvement of the MG performance.
