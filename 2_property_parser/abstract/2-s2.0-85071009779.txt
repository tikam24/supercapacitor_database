Layered double hydroxides are widely used as electroactive materials for supercapacitors. However, they exhibit poor rate performances at high current densities. To improve the rate performance of layered double hydroxides, a stamen-petal-like CeO2/NiMn layered double hydroxides composite is synthesized successfully by a one-step hydrothermal method. During the hydrothermal reaction, stamen-like CeO2 precipitates first, followed by the crystallization of petal-like NiMn layered double hydroxides sheets around the CeO2 stamen-like particles. By adjusting the amount of Ce(NO3)3 in the reaction mixture, an optimal composite electrode is obtained, which exhibits maximum specific capacities of 1956.0 F g−1 (1173.6C g−1) and 1261.4 F g−1 (756.8C g−1) at 1 A g−1 and 20 A g−1, respectively, and a much better rate performance compared with the traditional NiMn layered double hydroxides and CeO2 composite. A hybrid capacitor assembled using the optimal composite and activated carbon shows a high specific capacitance of 145.7 F g−1, and a capacitance retention rate of 91.9% after 5000 cycles at 10 A g−1. The maximum energy density is 51.8 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 809 W kg−1. The excellent performance is attributed to the special petal-like structure of the layered double hydroxides sheets, which provides a higher specific surface area and abundant pathways for ion transport. In addition, the CeO2 particles among the petal-like layered double hydroxides sheets effectively reduce the internal electrochemical resistance of the composite electrode, thereby according a high rate performance.
