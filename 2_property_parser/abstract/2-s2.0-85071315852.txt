This paper presents the Dynamic and Transient modeling of the light rail transit (LRT), including the passenger loading and unloading effect in stations. The EMTP-RV model of the system has been developed to show how the traction power substation (TPSS)system is reacting while train load changes from one station to the other in time domain analysis. Effect of using stationary super capacitor is also considered to reduce starting inrush current and absorbing regenerative breaking. Mechanical breaking is also included in the model which is used when train is approaching the station. The base and enhanced models and analysis presented in this paper can be used for the analysis of dynamic and transient behavior of the large light rail transit system in various modes of operation.
