Hydrogen has emerged as the most environmental friendly energy conversion option; nevertheless, finding a cost-effective hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst in basic media is currently of great interest. Herein, the synergistic design of transition tellurides with an advanced 2D Ti3C2Tx matrix has been interestingly explored using a facile hydrothermal synthetic approach. Unique morphologies were decorated on 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene revenues in realizing excelling physicochemical properties. The 2D hybrids of CoTe2/Ti3C2Tx achieve an admirably smaller Tafel slope of 95 mV/dec with 200 mV of overpotential at 10 mA/cm2 which was better than NiTe2/Ti3C2Tx signifying the faster H2 evolution rate. That infers the validity of combining tellurides with 2D MXene strategy in cooking highly efficient transition metal chalcogenides based HER electrocatalyst.
