Supercapacitors with superior performance and long cycling ability are attractive for the next-generation energy storage devices. Herein, an unique hybrid of nickel hydroxide carbonate nanobelts densely and strongly anchored on reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (HC/RGO) has been designed and synthesized through a facile hydrothermal approach. The as-prepared HC/RGO composites display a nearly two-dimensional architecture. Electrochemical investigation shows that the HC/RGO composite electrode has a maximum specific capacitance of 1662.4 F/g (3.5 F/cm2) at 1.0 A/g with excellent rate capability (64.7% capacitance retention when increasing the current density from 1.0 to 10.0 A/g) and good cyclic stability. The outstanding electrochemical property of HC/RGO composite electrode is possibly attributed to the intrinsic nature of Ni2(OH)2(CO3), the conductive RGO support, and the ultrathin thickness of Ni2(OH)2(CO3) nanounits which can accelerate the electron transport and facilitate the redox reactions. This hydroxycarbonate-based hybrids with excellent electrochemical performance provide an new avenue for designing high-performance supercapacitor electrodes.
