(Ir0.3Sn(0.7-x)Cex)O2 ternary oxide electrode materials (0<x<0.5) were obtained by thermal decomposition method on Ti substrate at a moderate temperature of 360℃. The influence of the compositions on microstructure and capacitive performance of the Ti/(Ir0.3Sn(0.7-x)Cex)O2 electrodes was investigated by XRD, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry(CV). The results show that a certain amount of Ce can reduce the degree of crystallization of rutile phase oxide in coating, optimize the microstructure of the oxide coating, and therefore improve the capacitive properties of the electrode material. When x is 0.2, the ternary oxides electrode reaches its maximum specific capacitance of 414 F/g, which is about three times of that of the Ti/IrO2-SnO2 electrode. The electrode shows a high specific energy density, when the power density is 4.97 kW/kg, the corresponding energy density reaches 82.88 W∙h/kg. When x is more than 0.3, the electronic/protonic conductivity, frequency response characteristics as well as capacitive property of the Ti/(Ir0.3Sn(0.7-x)Cex)O2 electrodes are seriously deteriorated with increasing the Ce content. Therefore, the Ce content should be controlled in less than 0.2 (mole fraction).
