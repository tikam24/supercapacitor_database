The development of advanced electrode materials with high performance and low-cost for energy conversion and storage techniques, such as water splitting and application as a supercapacitor, is significant in terms of future renewable energy systems. In this work, a unique NiOOH-decorated α-FeOOH nanosheet array (ASF) has been fabricated, with the help of alkaline oxidative etchant solution (AOES), using sintered 316L stainless steel felt (SF) as substrate, which can be viewed as a "pancake", while the α-FeOOH nanosheet, as well as the other elements uniformly embedded in it, acts as the skeleton. The formation mechanism of the ASF was discussed in detail based on X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and density functional theory calculations. The results indicate that the oriented growth of α-FeOOH was influenced by the surface adsorption for reducing the surface energy of the facet and electrostatic repulsion effect, to form the unexpected nanosheet structure. The 2-dimensional nanosheets could afford large specific surface area, and the active components (including Fe and Ni elements) distributed uniformly on the α-FeOOH nanosheets, enabling the sufficient exposure of electrochemical active sites and facilitating the effective contact between them and the electrolyte. As a consequence, the ASF shows an outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER, the overpotential is only 256 mV at 10 mA cm -2 , with low Tafel slope of 45 mV dec -1 ) and supercapacitor performance (the specific capacity is 748.13 mF cm -2 at 1.5 mA cm -2 (554.17 F g -1 , 1.1 A g -1 ), with good rate capacity and cyclic stability) performances.
