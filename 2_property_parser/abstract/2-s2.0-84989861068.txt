Core/shell structures of carbon-based materials/ metal oxide have been considered as potential candidates for electrochemical devices due to their improved pseudocapacitance/electrical double layer capacitance and high conductivity/ superior surface area. The development of multiple core-shell structures of MWCNT@MnO2@PPy was analyzed as a standard procedure for mass production of supercapacitor electrodes. The relative concentration of carbon nanotubes in the composite was varied to optimize the double layer capacitance contribution in overall response of device. Resulting structures presented capacitance in order of 272.7 Fg-1 and reasonable cycling performance.
