The present paper demonstrates the suitable material and preparation methods of membrane electrode for micro-supercapacitor. By means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), AC impedance, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and capacitance value diffusion tests, it characterizes and compares the electrochemical function of polypyrrole (PPy), polypyrrole/graphene oxide(PPy/GO), polypyrrole/graphene oxide - ruthenium oxide (PPy/GO-RuO2) membrane electrodes and the electrical property of MEMS supercapacitors. The study shows that in the electrochemical tests the function of PPy/GO-RuO2 is optimal among the three membrane electrodes and the value of its specific capacitance is 26.250 mF/cm2, its energy density 0.036 Wh/m2, power density 13.125 W/m2 at the scan rate 100 mV/s. The specific capacitance of PPy/GO-RuO2 remains 93.2% of the orginal after 5000 times of CV, and in the capacitance diffusion test, its diffussion value is the highest, and does not change with the change of frequency when the frequency reaches 260 Hz. The energy storage, elease properties, stability of PPy/GO-RuO2 membrane electrode and electrical property of its corresponding device is obviously better than those of PPy and PPy/GO. As such, PPy/GO-RuO2 composite applies to the functional membrane at the surface of Si-based structures and is useful for the improvement of the properties of micro-supercapacitor.
