The successful design of a hybrid supercapacitor with high power and energy density is mainly based on innovative materials and unique structures. Herein, self-supported Ni-Co(CO3)0.5(OH)Â·0.11H2O@MnNiCo-OH (Ni-CCH@MnNiCo-OH) with a hollow core/shell cactus-like structure was synthesized as a battery-type positive electrode and KOH-activated ZIF-67 derived Co, N dual-doped hierarchical ZIF-67-C-KOH was prepared as a capacitive-type negative electrode. Benefiting from the optimized ZIF-67-template modification and polymetallic co-deposition tactics, the positive electrode exhibits an outstanding specific capacity of 8.2 C cm-2 at 1.5 mA cm-2 (1029.3 C g-1 at 1 A g-1) and an impressive cycling retention of 88% after 3000 cycles at 20 mA cm-2, which are better than those of Ni-Co3O4@ZIF-67-Co3O4, Ni-CCH@NiCo-OH and Ni-CCH@MnCo-OH electrodes. Likewise, ZIF-67-C-KOH profits from the nitrogen-rich and porous properties of the precursor and can attain a specific capacitance of 262.4 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 as well as an excellent rate performance of 82% at 10 A g-1. The assembled Ni-CCH@MnNiCo-OH//ZIF-67-C-KOH hybrid device has a maximum voltage window of 1.8 V and achieves a specific capacitance of 187.3 F g-1 at 1 A g-1, a high energy density of 84.29 W h kg-1 at a power density of 900 W kg-1 as well as a fantastic stability up to 5000 cycles (74.91% retention at 2 A g-1), showing enormous potential in energy-storage applications.
