Binary transition metal sulfides demonstrate abundant morphological features and high redox activity. By studying the relationship between different morphological characteristics of active materials and electrochemical performance, high-performance supercapacitors can be discovered. In this work, binary Ni3S2/MoS2 composites in situ grow on the current collector Ni foam via electrochemical deposition and subsequently hydrothermal reaction, then it was directly used as a binder-free electrode for supercapacitors. The micro-morphological evolution process was investigated by controlling the hydrothermal time from 3 to 12 h. The electrochemical characterization showed that Ni3S2/MoS2@NF-9 (hydrothermal reacted for 9 h) with fluffy and abundant nanopores demonstrated the highest specific capacity (341.7 C g−1 at 1 A g−1), best rate performance (50% capacity retention from 1 to 20 A g−1), and superior charge transfer ability compared with others. Ni3S2/MoS2@NF-9 was also used as a positive electrode to assemble Ni3S2/MoS2@NF-9//RGO hybrid supercapacitor (HSC), which displayed a specific capacity of 129.2 C g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and specific energy of 26.9 Wh·kg−1 at 375 W kg−1.
