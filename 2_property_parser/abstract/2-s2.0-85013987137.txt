In this paper, a simple but innovative algorithm is developed to effectively reduce peak-to-average power ratio for electric vehicles powered by battery pack (BP) alone under real-life load fluctuation. A converter-supercapacitor pack (SP) coupled Hybrid Energy Storage topology upon which such algorithm is deployed is proposed to divert excess power that would otherwise damage BP into SP via power converter (PC) in a regulated fashion. Along with the algorithm itself, a simplified HESS model is also developed in Matlab to validate such algorithm and simulation results prove its effectiveness across various real-life drive cycles with significantly extended battery lifecycle.
