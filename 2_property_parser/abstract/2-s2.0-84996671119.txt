Realization of a highly flexible, lightweight, and high performance flexible supercapacitor was achieved using three-dimensional graphene on flexible graphite-paper. A simple and fast self-assembly approach was utilized for the uniform deposition of chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown high quality 3D-graphene powders on a flexible graphite-paper substrate. The fabricated paper-based symmetric supercapacitor exhibited a maximum capacitance of 260 F g−1 (15.6 mF cm−2) in a three electrode system, 80 F g−1 (11.1 mF cm−2) in a full cell, high capacitance retention and a high energy density of 8.8 Wh kg−1 (1.24 μWh cm−2) at a power density of 178.5 W kg−1 (24.5 μW cm−2). The flexible supercapacitor maintained its supercapacitor performance well, even under bent, rolled, or twisted conditions, signifying the excellent flexibility of the fabricated device. Our straightforward approach to the fabrication of highly flexible and lightweight supercapacitors offers new design opportunities for flexible/wearable electronics and miniaturized device applications that require energy storage units that meet the demands of the multifarious applications.
