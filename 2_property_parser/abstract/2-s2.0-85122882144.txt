Dendritic polyaniline, long fibrous polyaniline, dendritic polyaniline/graphene and long fibrous polyaniline/nitrogen-doped graphene aerogels are employed as precursors to produce nitrogen-doped continuous nanocarbons through direct carbonization. The microstructure, element composition, and electrochemical properties of polyaniline-based aerogels derived nanocarbons are systematically investigated. The results show that nanocarbons derived from dendritic polyaniline, long fibrous polyaniline, dendritic polyaniline/graphene and long fibrous polyaniline/nitrogen-doped graphene aerogels have a continuous hierarchical porous structure, high specific surface area of 273.9, 487.7, 241.4 and 295.9 m2•g-1, respectively, high nitrogen molar fraction of 7.82%, 9.62%, 7.91% and 10.17%, respectively, and high specific gravimetric capacitance of 268, 311, 280 and 362 F•g-1 at the current density of 0.5 A•g-1, respectively, as well as excellent rate capability and cycle stability.
