Elaborating the development of functional materials with excellent performance for supercapacitors is important in energy storage devices. In the present study, nanoflower-like MCoP (M = Ni and Fe) composites were successfully fabricated on Ni foam (denoted as NF@MCoP) by a cost-effective hydrothermal and low-temperature phosphating method. Simultaneously, the unique three-dimensional structure, nanoflower morphology, and the conductive substrate provide a favorable large electroactive area, shorter electron transfer distance, and rapid electron conductivity. The as-synthesized nanoflower-like MCoP composites exhibit outstanding energy density, power density, and long-term cycling stability. These results show that the developed electrode materials with excellent performance have great application prospects in the field of supercapacitor applications.
