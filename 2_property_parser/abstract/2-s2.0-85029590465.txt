PPy/PANI double-layer nanotubes anchored reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets with three-dimensional architecture (3DGP) have been obtained for supercapacitors applications. The freestanding electrode yields specific capacitance (542 F g−1 at current density of 1 A/g) and excellent cycle stability (92.1% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles in a three-electrode cell configuration). The further assembled symmetric supercapacitor device exhibits a high energy density of 20.8 W h kg−1 at a power density of 250 W kg−1 and good cycle stability (capacitance loss of 7% up to 2000 cycles). The exceptional electrochemical performance of 3DGP can be ascribed to the unique structure and the synergistic effects of the components: (1) Integrating the highly capacitance matrix PPy/PANI coaxial nanotubes hybrid in rGO to enhance the reversible faradic reactions can boost the utilization rate of the electrode materials and circumventing the predicament of pseudo materials. (2) The desirable interactions between highly conductive rGO films and polymer chains construct a high-performance network, which facilitates rapid transport of the electrolyte ions in the electrode. (3) The as-prepared electrode materials fabricated into electrodes directly decrease the “dead weight,” for the addition of binder and conductive agents can be avoided.
