In this study, we sprayed a graphene oxide–multiwalled carbon nanotube (GM) suspension in isopropyl alcohol–water onto a Nafion membrane. The electrodeposition of polypyrrole (PPy) was carried out on Nafion to complete the fabrication of a solid-state symmetric supercapacitor. Nafion 117 membranes are used as electrolyte separators in the preparation of supercapacitors. The characterization of the symmetric supercapacitor was done by X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The electrochemical properties of the symmetric solid-state supercapacitor were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques in 1M lithium chloride. A specific capacitance of 90.4 mF/cm2 (258.3 F/g1) was obtained for the supercapacitor at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Maximum energy and power densities of 10 W h/kg and 6031 W/kg were obtained for the fabricated supercapacitor. In such a symmetric configuration, the highly interconnection networks of GM–PPy provided good structure for the supercapacitor electrode, and the good interaction between PPy and GM provided fast electron- and charge-transportation paths so that a high capacitance was achieved. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
