Nickel oxide-manganese oxide (NMO) nanowires were synthesized, as binary nanocomposite, by simple hydrothermal technique in the wt% of NiO: MnO2 as 2:1. Also, manganese oxide (MO) and nickel oxide/Manganese oxide/activated carbon (NMO/AC) as binary and ternary composites, respectively, were produced for comparative study. All the materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) for crystalline information, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for morphological details, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) for the indication of vibrational modes, and at the end, cyclic voltammetry analysis (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge analysis (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy for specific capacitance (Cs) and other super capacitive features. The best results were achieved for NMO nanowires as they exhibited a specific capacitance of 1634.4 Fg-1 at 12 Ag-1 while for NMO/AC, Cs declined to 1347 F/g. After 10,000 cycles, the specific capacitance of NMO was still sustained at 96.5% which shows magnificent cycling stability. The results show that doping of nickel cation amplifies the electrochemical performance of NMO material as an electrode for supercapacitor application.
