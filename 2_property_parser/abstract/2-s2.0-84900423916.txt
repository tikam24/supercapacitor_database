Reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) aerogels decorated with divalent cobalt ions were synthesized via a one-pot hydrothermal self-assembly route. The interaction of Co(II) ions with 3D r-GO aerogels was investigated by spectroscopic techniques, including Raman, attenuated total reflectance infrared, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies. The excellent electrochemical properties of the aerogels were confirmed by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge tests, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in an acid electrolyte (1 M H2SO4). The Co(II) ion-modified r-GO aerogels can be used as high-performance hybrid supercapacitor materials with a specific capacitance of 387.2 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 current density and a good cycling stability without capacity decay over 1000 cycles. The mechanical integrity enhancement of the hybrid r-GO aerogel framework and the improvement in its unique capacitive performance are attributed to the efficient interconnection produced by electro-active Co(II) ions.
