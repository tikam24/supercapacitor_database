Morphological and optical properties have been investigated for electrochemically deposited polyaniline (PAni) thin films on various substrates, having different transparent conducting oxides (TCO) layer viz. ITO and FTO. Different substrates have facilate the nucleation formation for the growth of nanostructures and control the length of the diameter of nanofibrils. Diameter of the nano-fibrils can facilate the transfer of ions and electrons and hence it affects the pseudocapacitor nature of thin films. Contact angle measurements of thin films depict that hydrophilic nature of PAni thin films also depend on different substrates. Moreover, morphology dependent electrochemical performances of PAni thin films were investigated using cyclic voltametry. Photoluminescence emission has shown pronounce effect due to the variation of substrate. PAni thin films can be used as supercapacitors by tuning their capacitance by varying substrate used as working electrode.
