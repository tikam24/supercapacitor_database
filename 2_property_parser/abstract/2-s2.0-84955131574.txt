The precursor Ni(OH)2 was synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method with hexamethylenetetramine((CH2)6N4) as precipitant and template, and then NiO was gained after calcination. The phase and morphology of the synthesized product were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM), and the electrochemical capacitive characterization was performed using cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronopotentiometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in a 6mol/L KOH aqueous solution electrolyte. The result shows that spherical NiO without impurity was synthesized, the average diameter of the spheres is 5 um and these spheres were constructed by the interactive arrangement of many nanoflakes in three dimensions. This kind of NiO shows the typical electrochemical characteristics of pseudo capacitance with high specific capacity and excellent rate capability. The specific capacity can reach 515F/g at the current density of 1A/g.
