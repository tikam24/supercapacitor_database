Layered transition metal hydroxide, a clay-like material, possessing characteristics of large specific surface area, adjustable fraction, and plentiful active components make it a potential energy storage material, especially in the background of energy and environment crisis. Herein, comprehensive applications of cobalt-aluminum-based LDHs for supercapacitors are proposed. Binder-free electrodes were successfully synthesized such as Co3Al1-LDH/Ni, Ni2Co1Al1-LDH/Ni and Ni1Co2Al1-LDH/Ni using a rapid green hydrothermal approach. Subsequently, further sulfuration was carried out to obtain a heterostructure of sulfide/layered hydroxide. The electrochemical energy storage properties of binder-free electrodes were investigated, which show that the performance of ternary LDH electrode is better than that of binary one, and the incompletely sulfuration Ni1Co2S/Ni has the optimal electrochemical performance among all electrodes, with a specific capacitance of 2186 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. The Ni1Co2S//AG hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) device assembled with Ni1Co2S as positive electrode and active graphene as negative electrode delivers an energy density of 13 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 749 W kg−1, good rate capability and cycling stability.
