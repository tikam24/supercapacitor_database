MnO2 is synthesized by the chemical deposition method then doped with L4060 multiwall carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The structure of the samples is characterized by X-ray and the microcosmic appearances of the samples are imaged by SEM. The results show that the product is a mixture of Î±-MnO2 and y- MnO2, and the sample before CNTs doped resembles flocculent in appearance but pipes run through obviously after treated. The electrochemical performance of the samples are measured by cyclic voltammetry, constant current and A. C impendence. The results of electrochemical tests show that the sample with 5% of CNTs doped has the best capacitance performance; discharge specific capacitance of MnO2 before/after CNTs doped is 202 F/g and 349 F/g respectively, advance by 77.27%; impedance characteristic is improved, RESR and RE can decline by 58.14% and 47.37% respectively after CNTs doped.
