In this work, we have synthesized the CuS/Cu(OH)2 nanocomposite electrode materials by the simple solvothermal method. The crystal structure, phase purity and the presence of functional groups in the metal sulfide/ hydroxide are confirmed by XRD and FTIR techniques. The SEM images of nanocomposite have sphere like morphology with small agglomerations. Electrochemical results show the high specific capacitance of CuS/Cu(OH)2 composite is 845.5 F/g (capacity of 93.9 mAh/g) which is higher than that of individuals of Cu(OH)2-419.7 F/g (capacity of 46.6 mAh/g) and CuS-738.3 F/g (capacity of 82 mAh/g) at a fixed current density of 1 mA/cm2. Further, the composite gives a better result as in the form of capacitance retention (78.6%) over 1000 continuous chargeâ€“discharge cycles. Consequently, the results suggest that CuS/Cu(OH)2 nanocomposite can be used as a promising electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
