The annealing approach is usually used to synthesize carbon-based materials. We use polystyrene (PS) microspheres as a template to composite with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) loaded by Cu-Ni ions. After One-step high-temperature treatment, the PS microspheres disappear, and the composite materials become a three-dimensional porous structure. At the meantime, the Cu-Ni ions are reduced and attached to the material (CNTs/Cu-Ni/CP (CMP)). Then, the CMP material is coated with Polyaniline (PANI). The two-step high-temperature treatment accomplishes the Nitrogen-doped process of the material (CNTs/Cu-Ni/CP@CPANI (CMPN)). Electrochemical analysis indicates that materials have a high specific capacitance value (356F/g at 0.5 A/g). After 10,000 cycles of charging and discharging, the capacitance retention rate is 92.57 %. The assembled symmetrical supercapacitor possesses outstanding energy and power density (11.92 Wh kg−1 at 700.73 W kg−1).
