Zinc oxide (ZnO)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposites was successfully prepared by scalable chemical reduction method with presence of rGO and studied for their properties as electrode materials in energy storage applications, such as supercapacitors. The prepared samples were characterized by using different analytical techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The electrochemical properties of ZnO/rGO nanocomposites were studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV), and galvanostatic charge-discharge studies. ZnO/rGO nanocomposite electrodes were shown maximal integral area of CV loop indicates that the composite produces positive synergistic effects in specific capacitance. (ZnO:rGO) achieves a specific capacitance as high as 280 F/g when compared with the individual value of the two components, 125 F/g and 137 F/g for pure ZnO and rGO.
