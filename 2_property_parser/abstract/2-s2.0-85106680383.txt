In the present study, molybdenum disulfide-reduced graphene oxide (MoS2-RGO) composite was synthesized via a hydrolysis of lithiated MoS2 (LiMoS2) and the electrochemical performance of the nano sheets was evaluated for super capacitor applications. The MoS2-RGO composite electrode exhibited high specific capacitance (203 F g-1) with excellent cycling stability, compared with MoS2. The high electrochemical performance of the MoS2-RGO composite electrode is mainly attributed to the improved electron and ion transfer mechanism involving synergistic effects of MoS2 and RGO.
