In order to enhance actual capacitance of Co3O4, a hierarchically structure of bimetallic Ni-Co composite material was designed. The cobalt carbonate hydroxide nanosheets were grown in situ on carbon fiber cloth (CC@CCH NS)by hydrothermal methodÅ¾Hthen the layered nickel-cobalt double hydroxide was grown on cobalt carbonate hydroxide nanosheets by electrodeposition. After annealing the CC@CCH NS@NiCo LDH, a hierarchically structure CC@Co3O4@NiCo2O4composite material was obtained. The characterization indicated that CC@Co3O4@NiCo2O4composite has a specific capacitance of 1 175 mF/cm2at a current density of 2 mA/cm2H when the current density increases to 20 mA/cm2,he specific capacitance remains at 1 068 mF/cm2HAfter for cycling 5 000 times at a current density of 15 mA/cm297.1% of the initial capacitance is retained Cand the electrochemical performance are higher than that of CC@Co3O4, which means that.
