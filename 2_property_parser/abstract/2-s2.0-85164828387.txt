In this work, we reported the electrochemical performance of a type of carbon fabric-based supercapacitor by coating MnOx@rGO nanohybrids on carbon fabric with a simple one-step hydrothermal method. We studied the mass ratio of MnOx to rGO on the electrochemical properties of the carbon fabric-based supercapacitors. We found that as the mass ratio is 0.8:1 for MnO@rGO, the supercapacitor with a loading of 5.40 mg cm−2 of MnO@rGO nanohybrids on carbon fabric exhibits a specific capacitance of 831.25 mF cm−2 at 0.1 mA cm−2 current density. It also shows long-term cycling capacitance retention of 97.2% after 10,000 charge–discharge cycles at a current density of 0.4 mA cm−2. We speculate that the high electrochemical performance results from the strong interfacial bonding between the hierarchical architecture of MnO@rGO nanohybrids and carbon fabric.
