The paper reports the electrodeposition of polypyrrole thin film by galvanostatic mode of deposition. The structural study of polypyrrole film is characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The surface morphological study is carried out with scanning electron microscope (SEM) techniques. The XRD and FTIR spectroscopy study shows the formation of amorphous and conducting polypyrrole thin film. SEM images shows that the substrates are uniformly coated with polypyrrole thin films. The surface wettability study is carried out by means of contact angle measurement. Surface wettability study shows that the films are hydrophilic in nature. The testing of polypyrrole film electrode as a supercapacitor is made with the help of cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge measurement and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy study. The value of specific capacitance was found to be 381 F g−1 in 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution at scan rate 5 mV s−1 in the −1.0 to +1.0 V versus saturated calomel electrode. However, the value of Coulombic efficiency, specific energy and specific power of polypyrrole thin film electrode is observed to be 96.54 %, 762.60 Wh kg−1 and 281,000 kW kg−1.
