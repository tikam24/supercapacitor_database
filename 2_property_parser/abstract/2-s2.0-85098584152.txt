To grasp research progress and forecast future development trends in the comprehensive utilization of porous materials derived from tobacco waste, different technologies in the literature were summarized from two respects, the direct utilization of tobacco waste and the preparation and application of porous carbon materials. The results showed that: 1) The majority of the research focused on the later of the above two aspects. 2) The preparation methods of carbon materials were relatively mature, including direct carbonization and physical or chemical activation. Further innovation in the preparation method was relatively limited, however the mechanism of material preparation and controllable preparation of carbon materials for different purposes were still worthy of further study. 3) The derivatization of carbon materials and their application in the field of electrochemistry (supercapacitor) were two important paths for the high value utilization of tobacco waste in the future. 4) In addition to the technology development process, the topics such as the whole life cycle environmental assessment involving the technical route and the "cost-benefit" analyses of the full industrial chain also needed to be strengthened.
