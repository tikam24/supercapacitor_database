Uniform carbonaceous spheres covered with MnO<inf>2</inf> nanoparticles (CMnO<inf>2</inf>-1) or nanosheets (CMnO<inf>2</inf>-2) were successfully prepared via a facile in situ seed-assisted method which could accomplish the controlled fabrication of the composites with tunable morphology and mass loading of MnO<inf>2</inf>. When employed as active materials for supercapacitor electrodes, CMnO<inf>2</inf>-2 exhibited larger specific capacitance, higher rate capability and better cycling stability than CMnO<inf>2</inf>-1 due to the fast ion penetration and smaller charge-transfer resistance. It is believed that these results may provide an alternative way to improve the redox kinetics and reversibility of metal oxides-based pseudocapacitors.
