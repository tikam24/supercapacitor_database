Both photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy is renewable energy that has intermittent power generation and implication for poor power stability. The multi-input DC-DC converter is one of the proven solutions that can be applied to multi-generation systems. In this research, simulations will be carried out to evaluate the performance of multi-input DC-DC converters with perturb and observe MPPT algorithm in off-grid hybrid PV-Wind with battery and supercapacitor energy storage based on solar irradiance intermittencies conditions. From the results, it was found that a multi-input DC-DC converter can rapidly lower ripple voltage on the load side from 12% to 1 - 2% in consequence of intermittent irradiancy even without the implementation of the algorithm on wind turbine output. Also, overshoot and undershoot of the system can be absorbed by the supercapacitor and stored effectively by the battery so that power losses can be reduced. Therefore, the multi-input converter with the proposed Perturb and Observe algorithm can be used as one of the solution concepts for hybrid renewable energy electrical systems.
