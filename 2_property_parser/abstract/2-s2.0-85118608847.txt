This study proposes an energy delivery system with buffering and recovery capability for energy storage device applications. In recent years, energy storage devices have been widely applied in, for example, batteries and super-capacitors. Moreover, these devices are usually used in integrated applications, and the properties of each battery or super-capacitor must be considered with respect to the given application. This study proposes an energy delivery system with a power sharing converter and a symmetrical-bridge-type resonant circuit. This system can operate in energy delivery and buffering modes. Furthermore, surplus energy can be stored in storage devices through an energy recovery mode. The proposed system performed well in various aspects including energy delivery in experiments with a prototype circuit. The results aid circuit design in energy storage device applications.
