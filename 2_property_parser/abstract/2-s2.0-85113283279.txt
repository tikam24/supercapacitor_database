This paper represents a dynamic power management system for a PV and Wind based hybrid microgrid using battery energy storage system (BESS) and supercapacitor. The normal load variations are supported by battery energy storage while sudden changes in load or transient loads are supported by using supercapacitor bank. The dc microgrid is simulated under variable load and solar insolation. It was observed that power management system is efficient to keep dc bus voltage constant in all situations. The sudden changes in dc bus voltage due to transient loads have been effectively nullified by using supercapacitor. Hence stress on the battery is reduced and its life time will be enhanced.
