As pseudocapacitive materials, conducting polymers are generally attractive as they have high charge density and are inexpensive. In this study, two novel conjugated ladder polymers based on phenoxazine are synthesized and applied as electrode materials in aqueous symmetric supercapacitors. Their electrochemical properties are investigated in a two-electrode configuration. Owing to the good hydrophilicity and perfect backbone conjugation, the acid-doped polymer greatly outperforms the intrinsic polymers, and achieves a specific capacitance of 311 F g−1 with an energy density of 10.1 W h kg−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 in aqueous sulfuric acid. This material is therefore a potential competitor to the classical polymer electrode materials for use in powerful supercapacitors. In addition, a type of sheet-like supercapacitor is also developed to verify the practicality of the material, which was easily used as a tandem capacitor.
