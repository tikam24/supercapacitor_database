A novel product consisting of a homogeneous tin oxide nanowall array with abundant oxygen deficiencies and partial Ni-Sn alloying onto a Ni foam substrate was successfully prepared using a facile solvothermal synthesis process with subsequent thermal treatment in a reductive atmosphere. Such a product could be directly used as integrated anodes for supercapacitors, which showed outstanding electrochemical properties with a maximum specific capacitance of 31.50 mAh·g−1 at 0.1 A·g−1, as well as good cycling performance, with a 1.35-fold increase in capacitance after 10,000 cycles. An asymmetric supercapacitor composed of the obtained product as the anode and activated carbon as the cathode was shown to achieve a high potential window of 1.4 V. The excel-lent electrochemical performance of the obtained product is mainly ascribed to the hierarchical structure provided by the integrated, vertically grown nanowall array on 3D Ni foam, the existence of oxygen deficiency and the formation of Ni-Sn alloys in the nanostructures. This work provides a general strategy for preparing other high-performance metal oxide electrodes for electrochemical applications.
