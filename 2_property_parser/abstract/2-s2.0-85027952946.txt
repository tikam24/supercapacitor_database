Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are promising supercapacitor electrode materials due to their high specific capacitances. However, their electrochemical performances such as rate performance and energy density at a high current density, are rather poor. Accordingly, a facile strategy is demonstrated for the synthesis of the integrated porous Co-Al hydroxide nanosheets (named as GSP-LDH) with dual support system using dodecyl sulfate anions and graphene sheets as structural and conductive supports, respectively. Owing to fast ion/electron transport, porous and integrated structure, the GSP-LDH electrode exhibits remarkably improved electrochemical characteristics such as high specific capacitance (1043 F g-1 at 1 A g-1) and ultra-high rate performance capability (912 F g-1 at 20 A g-1). Moreover, the assembled sandwiched graphene/porous carbon (SGC)//GSP-LDH asymmetric supercapacitor delivers a high energy density up to 20.4 Wh kg-1 at a very high power density of 9.3 kW kg-1, higher than those of previously reported asymmetric supercapacitors. The strategy provides a facile and effective method to achieve high rate performance LDH based electrode materials for supercapacitors.
