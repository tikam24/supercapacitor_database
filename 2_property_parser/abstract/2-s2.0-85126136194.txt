Robust and electrochemically stable electrodes are critical for emerging energy storage devices. In this work, we describe the synthesis and characterization of an asymmetric pseudocapacitor with a P(nBA-stat-BzMA)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO, 5 wt %) nanocomposite cathode incorporating a low content of lignosulfonate (LS, 5 wt %) and a P(nBA-stat-BzMA)/rGO anode. Besides the advantageous green source and low cost of LS, its properties as a binder and its redox groups contribute to the electrochemical performance improvement of the pseudocapacitor. First, the electrochemical optimization and characterization of an asymmetric unit cell is performed. Subsequently, a series of 10 unit cells are arranged in a "stack of cells" electrochemical tests show this assembly to have a capacitance of 4.90 F cm-3(8.60 F g-1), maximum power of 610 W kg-1, energy of 4.32 W h kg-1, loss of electroactivity of 1.8%, capacitance retention of 98%, and Coulombic efficiency of 108% after 1000 charge-discharge cycles at a constant current of 0.12 A cm-3. Morphological analysis revealed an increase in surface roughness after LS incorporation within the cathode. Electrode-electrolyte resistances were calculated via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, which allowed us to propose a model of electrode-electrolyte interaction for this system.
