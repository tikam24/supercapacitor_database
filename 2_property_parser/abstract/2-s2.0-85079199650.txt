A tiny and portable micro-spectrometer which is bullet-like deployable and also inexpensive and disposable is specifically designed for assaying the soil composition of Lunar, Martian, and asteroids. This micro-spectrometer uses the principle of Fresnel diffraction that allows a tiny embodiment with a nanometer resolving power of spectral signal. A bullet-like micro-spectrometer has an integration of a super capacitor as a power source, a charging coil for super capacitor, a light emitting diode (LED) or laser diode light source and driver, an analog to digital converter (ADC) circuit, and a telemetry system with antenna string. A LED or laser diode runs in a burst mode to generate deep or vacuum ultraviolet (UV) to excite target material. When the excited state of target material undergoes a singlet or triplet transition, this transition process yields fluorescence or luminescence which is a material-dependent, Micro-spectrometer senses and uses this spectral emission from material to identify the spectral signature of material. This data after ADC is transmitted to a receiving station.
