Despite the availability of a large number of alkyl tetrahydrofurfuryl ethers that have a wide range of applications, pure bis(tetrahydrofurfuryl) ether (BTHFE) has not been previously synthesized. Here, we report the synthesis of BTHFE (consisting of the RR, SS, and meso stereoisomers) at greater than 99 % purity from tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, using (tetrahydrofuran-2-yl)methyl methanesulfonate as an intermediate. Additionally, we demonstrate that BTHFE can be used as a non-volatile solvent in poly(3,4-propylenedioxythiophene)-based supercapacitors. Supercapacitor devices employing solutions of the ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methyl-imidizolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide in BTHFE display similar performances to those prepared by using the neat ionic liquid as an electrolyte, although solution-based devices exhibit a somewhat higher resistance.
