Supercapacitor holds a broad prospect in application with plentiful advantages of high current charge/discharge capability, superior power density, and admirable capacity sustainability. Electrode materials are central to supercapacitors, and they face the challenges of meeting the requirements including low cost, high specific surface area, desirable conductivity, and stable performance. Herein, a facile selenic acid etching strategy is designed by engaging NiCo-based acetate hydroxide as the precursor to realize Se-doped NiCo2O4/C nanoprisms with typical hollow/porous structures (Se-NiCo2O4/C HNs) as the electrode for high-performance supercapacitor. Specifically, these unique hollow nanoprisms could increase the contact area between the material and electrolyte, further improving the electrochemical activities. Meanwhile, Se-doping could regulate electronic construction effectively, creating enormous active sites and tuning surface charge transfer properties. Moreover, highly conductive carbon could boost charge transfer and offer enormous electrochemically active sites, thus elevating the capacitive behaviors. By reason of the synergistic effect of the hollow structure, Se-doping, and the highly conductive carbon, the as-fabricated Se-NiCo2O4/C HNs acquire noticeable specific capacitance (348.9 C/g at 1 A/g) and exceptional rate performance (about 97% capacitance retention at fivefold of current density). Impressively, the advanced asymmetrical supercapacitor assembled by Se-NiCo2O4/C HNs as cathode delivers a desirable energy density and reaches 30.1 Wh/kg at a power density of 415.7 W/kg, which is highly considerable to the recent transition metal oxide-based devices. Overall, with the attractive properties, the presented approach sheds light on future energy storage to meet the power requirements.
