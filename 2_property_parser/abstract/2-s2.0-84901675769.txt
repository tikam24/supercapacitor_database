Simple preparation methods of chemically versatile and highly functionalizable surfaces remain rare and present a challenging research objective. Here, we demonstrate a simultaneous electropolymerization and electro-click functionalization process (SEEC) for one-pot self-construction of aniline- and naphthalene-based functional polymer films where both polymerization and click functionalization are triggered by applying electrochemical stimuli. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) can be applied for the simultaneous oxidation of 4-Azidoaniline and the reduction of Cu(II) ions, resulting in polymerization of the former, and the Cu(I)-catalyzed alkyne/azide cycloaddition ("click" chemistry). Properties of the films obtained can be tuned by varying their morphology, their chemically "clicked" content, or by postconstruction functionalization. To demonstrate this, the CV scan rates, component monomers, and "clicked" molecules were varied. Covalent postconstruction immobilization of horseradish peroxidase was also performed. Consequently, pseudocapacitance and enzyme activity were affected. SEEC provides surface scientists an easy access to a wide range of functionalization possibilities in several fields including sensors, fuel cells, photovoltaics, and biomaterials.
