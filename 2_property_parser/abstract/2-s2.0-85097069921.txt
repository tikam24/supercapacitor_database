Tremendous efforts have been devoted for designing the excellent electrochemical electrode structures, exhibiting good electrochemical characteristics for supercapacitor applications. Herein, nickel sulfide nanoplates on graphene oxide thin film (GO[sbnd]NSNPs) were fabricated on nickel foam using hydrothermal method. The structural, morphological, electrical and electrochemical study was carried out using the X-ray diffractometer, scanning electron microscope, four probe electrical set up and electrochemical work station. GO[sbnd]NSNPs showed oxidation and reduction peaks in cyclic voltammetry curves and recommended the pseudocapacitive nature. The specific capacitance and specific energy was found as 1745.50 Fg−1 and 87.30 WhKg−1 at 5 mAcm−2, respectively, through galvanostatic charge and discharge profile using three electrodes system. While, the measured specific energy from two electrodes symmetric measurements was 15.72 WhKg−1 at 1 mAcm−2. Hence, GO[sbnd]NSNPs electrodes were suggested as suitable for high performance asymmetric and symmetric supercapacitor applications.
