Supercapacitors have been emerging tool with high power density in energy storage system. The energy storage capability of supercapacitors depends on electrochemical performance of transition metal oxide based electrode materials. Because of the co-existence of two metal ions and synergistic effects of elements, binary metal oxides, AB2O4 (A or B = Ni, Co, Mo, Mn, and so on), have more active reaction sites and high electrical conductivity than other binary transition metal oxides. To improve the best electrochemical performance, cobalt manganese oxide (CoMn2O4) is synthesized via simple hydrothermal method. The CoMn2O4 rod is characterized to analyse its crystalline structure, functional group vibrations, surface morphology and elemental conformations. The electrochemical performance of CoMn2O4 is analysed using cyclic voltammetry, galvano-static charge–discharge and electrochemical impedance spectrum techniques. The cyclic voltammetry result reveals that pseudo capacitive behaviour of CoMn2O4 compound. The charge–discharge cycling stability of CoMn2O4 rod is analysed in 5 A g−1 up to 10,000 cycles. Asymmetric supercapacitor is fabricated using CoMn2O4|| Activated Carbon which also obeys pseudo capacitive behaviour. The energy density is analysed as 28.7 Wh kg−1 at current density 1 mA for asymmetric supercapacitor device. Graphical Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
