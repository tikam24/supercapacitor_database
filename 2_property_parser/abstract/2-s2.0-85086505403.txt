Model predictive control (MPC) facilitates online optimal resource scheduling in electrical networks, thermal systems, water networks, process industry to name a few. In electrical systems, the capability of MPC can be used not only to minimise operating costs but also to improve renewable energy utilisation and energy storage system degradation. This work assesses the application of MPC for energy management in an islanded microgrid with PV generation and hybrid storage system composed of battery, supercapacitor and regenerative fuel cell. The objective is to improve the utilisation of renewable generation, the operational efficiency of the microgrid and the reduction in rate of degradation of storage systems. The improvements in energy scheduling, achieved with MPC, are highlighted through comparison with a heuristic based method, like Fuzzy inference. Simulated behaviour of an islanded microgrid with the MPC and fuzzy based energy management schemes will be studied for the same. Apart from this, the study also carries out an analysis of the computational demand resulting from the use of MPC in the energy management stage. It is concluded that, compared to heuristic methods, MPC ensures improved performance in an islanded microgrid.
