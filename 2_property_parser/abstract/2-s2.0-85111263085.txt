Excellent wettability of electrode materials is an important prerequisite for high-efficiency energy storage devices. Inspired by the capillarity, we design a new type of block carbon material with vertical channel array that can generate capillary tension and then enhance the hydrophilicity in aqueous liquid. When applied to supercapacitors, this electrode not only exhibits an excellent affinity (e.g., 0°) for aqueous electrolyte, but also can be directly utilized as an electrode without any additions. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that this novel hydrophilic and binder-free electrode enjoys satisfactory performances including high capacitance (e.g., 2452 mF cm−2 at 5 mA cm−2), long cycling life in coin-type device (e.g., 100% after 10 000 cycles). Furthermore, the pure carbon-assembled quasi-solid-state supercapacitor could deliver an appealing energy density up to 5.49 mWh cm−2 at a power density of 50.0 mW cm−2. This work presents the strategy of hydrophilic conversion of materials through rational structural construction for the first time, and demonstrates an ultra-facile supercapacitor electrode which is full of practical application value.
