Due to the large requirement of portable consumer electronics in the present era, much efforts were devoted for the development of light weight, flexible and even wearable technologies. Here, CoFe2O4/reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/polyaniline (PANI) (CCGP) composite is synthesised and efficiently utilized as negative electrode. Similarly, the prepared rod shape β-Co(OH)2 is served as positive electrode. Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy results revealed the existence of covalent bond between rGO and PANI. This covalent bond enhances the fast charge carrier transfer that leads to improve the performance of CCGP. As well as the pores containg rod shape β-Co(OH)2 supports to access large amount electrolyte ions. Potential dependant charge storage mechanism is revealed from Power's law for the charge storage of CCGP. Trasatti plot corroborates that CCGP provides more inner surface charge storage contribution than CoFe2O4 (CC) and CoFe2O4/rGO (CCG) electrodes. The fabricated hybrid fiber supercapacitor delivers a high length capacitance (1.41 F m−1), energy density (270 × 10−8 Wh cm−1) and excellent cycling stability. Connecting two devices in series successfully powered the light emitting diode to glow, which reveals the good reliability of the device for energy storage applications.
