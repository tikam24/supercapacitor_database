A novel nitrogen self-doped porous lamellar carbon materials were prepared by pyrolysis method, in which metal-free phthalocyanine used as a carbon source, and nanosized SiO2 and SWCNTs used as templates at the same time. The mesoporous structure is contributed by the nanosized SiO2 self-sacrificing template, and the microporous structure is produced by pyrolysis of Pc/SWCNTs. By adjusting the ratio between SWCNTs, nanosized SiO2, and phthalocyanine, the microscopic morphology and the electrochemical performance of porous carbon materials can be regulated. Benefit from its superior pore structure and large specific surface area, the nitrogen self-doped porous lamellar carbon materials show excellent electrochemical performance. When the mass ratio of the three was Pc/SWCNTs/SiO2 = 1:0.05:0.5, the nitrogen self-doped porous lamellar carbon material shows the largest specific capacity of 283.9 F/g at 1 A gâˆ’1 as a supercapacitor anode material. And after 5000 cycles, the composite material still maintained a specific capacity of 88.7 %, demonstrating excellent stability. The specific capacity under the two-electrode system of Sample 3 is 260.36 F/g, showing high energy density and power density (36.2 Wh/kg, 1041.2 W/kg). Therefore, this nitrogen self-doped porous lamellar carbon material has potential value as a supercapacitor anode material.
