The combination of a supercapacitor with a large power and a conventional battery, the composite power supply will improve the performance of electric vehicles, such as low power density and short cycle times of the individual batteries. The use of parallel staggered technology in the DC/DC converter, the composite power supply topology has been changed, which will greatly improve the overall performance of the composite power supply. The fuzzy control method is used to manage the energy of the energy storage system, and the simulation model of the electric vehicle composite power system is built under the MATLAB / Simulink environment. Simulation results show that the use of supercapacitor - battery composite power system, you can combine the advantages of both of battery and supercapacitor, it improves the power of output of the electric vehicles and optimizes process of the battery's discharge. Supercapacitor played a 'cut peak fill valley' role in the process of simulation, battery has more effective protection. Therefore it enhances the electric vehicle power performance and energy efficiency. And it have better economic applicability.
