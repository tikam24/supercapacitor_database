Tellurium nanoparticles (Te Nps) were synthesized by wet chemical method and characterized by XRD, Raman, FESEM, TEM, XPS, UV–Vis and FL. The Nps were coated on graphite foil and Glassy carbon electrode to prepare the electrodes for supercapacitor and biosensor applications. The supercapacitor performance is evaluated in 2 M KOH electrolyte by both Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge method. From charge-discharge method, Te Nps show a specific capacitance of 586 F/g at 2 mA/cm2 and 100 F/g at 30 mA/cm2 as well as an excellent cycle life (100% after 1000 cycles). In addition, the H2O2 sensor performance of Te Nps modified glassy carbon electrode is checked by CV and Chronoamperometry (CA) in phosphate buffer solution (PBS). In the linear range of 0.67 to 8.04 μM of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), Te NPs show a high sensitivity of 0.83 mA mM− 1 cm− 2 with a correlation coefficient of 0.995. The detection limit is 0.3 μM with a response time less than 5 s.
