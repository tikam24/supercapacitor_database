In this study, samples of activated mesoporous carbon are fabricated with pore structures with cylinder and gyroid nanostructures through the templating effect of amphiphilic poly(ethylene oxide-block-caprolactone) (PEO-PCL) and by using specific resol/PEO-PCL weight ratios (e.g., 60:40 for cylinders; 55:45 for gyroids). After carbonization and KOH activation, the activated mesoporous carbons were tested as electrode materials for electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC) supercapacitors. The electrochemical properties were examined by using three-electrode (6 m KOH(aq) as electrolyte) and CR2032 coin-cell (1 m tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEABF4)/CN as the electrolyte) systems. The gyroid carbon samples provided specific capacitances higher than those of the cylinder carbon samples in both aqueous and organic systems: 155 F g−1 compared with 135 F g−1 in 6 m KOH(aq), and 105.6 compared with 96 F g−1 in 1 m TEABF4/MeCN, after 100 charge/discharge cycles. It is suspected that the bi-continuous mesochannels of the gyroid-type activated mesoporous carbons provided a relatively higher effective adsorption surface area; in other words, the greater surface area for energy storage originated from a moderate pore size and an interconnected pore structure.
