Three-dimensional (3D) graphene-pyrrole/carbon nanotubes/polyaniline (GPCP) nanohybrids were successfully prepared through a facile and scalable method with the assistance of supercritical CO2 (SC CO2), which could be used as efficient electrode materials for supercapacitors. Our experimental results indicate that SC CO2 can not only help combining multi-component nanocomposites but also improve the conductivity of the nanohybrids. The electrochemical measurements show that the specific capacitance of the as-prepared nanohybrids with the assistance of supercritical CO2 can run up to 400 F g-1, which verify that SC CO2 provides an effective route to the scalable production of 3D nanohybrids for the potential application in supercapacitors.
