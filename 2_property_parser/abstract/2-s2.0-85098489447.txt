Here, cobalt hydroxide/porous graphene/functionalized MWNTs three-component nano-hybrid is electrochemically co-implanted onto Ni foam and its supercapacitive capability is compared with the pristine Co(OH)2/Ni electrode prepared through the similar method. The functionalized multi-walled nanotubes and porous graphene (f-MWNTs-PG) composite is first prepared through hydrothermal method. Then, the simultaneous co-deposition of Co(OH)2/f-MWNTs-PG hybrid is achieved from f-MWNTs-PG dispersed 10 mM Co(NO3)2 aqueous bath. The characterization results showed a uniform growth of Î²-Co(OH)2 platelets onto the f-MWNTs-PG electrophoretically implanted onto the Ni foam. An enhanced surface area of 304.4 m2/g with mesoporous texture was observed for the hybrid material, where pristine Co(OH)2 had surface area of 234.55 m2/g. Co(OH)2@f-MWNTs-PG/Ni hybrid exhibited an excellent capacitive behavior, i.e., specific capacitances as high as 1426 and 1075 F/g at 1 and 10 A/g, and low capacity losses of 5.9% and 10.5% after 6000 cycling at 1 and 3 A/g, respectively. However, the Co(OH)2/Ni showed low capacitance values of 1029 and 544 F/g at 1 and 10 A/g, and also high losses of 15.6% and 43.5% at the current loads of 1 and 3 A/g, respectively. The improved performance of hybrid electrode was ascribed to the synergetic effects between f-MWNTs/PG and hydroxide platelets in the composite form.
