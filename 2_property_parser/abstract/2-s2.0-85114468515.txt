Corncob, as a sustainable biomass waste, is mainly composed of hemicellulose. Herein, on the basis of natural corncob as substrates, Fe/N co-doped porous carbon spheres were designed via a consecutive FeCl3-mediated hydrothermal reaction and mild KHCO3activation route for supercapacitor electrode materials. Owing to the low hydrolysis temperature of hemicellulose and hydrolysis promotion of Fe3+, the corncob-derived hydrochar exhibited special carbon sphere morphology. Interestingly, the carbon sphere morphology was well-preserved upon the melamine-mediated KHCO3activation. As a result of the short ion diffusion distance, unique packing architecture, and developed micro-mesoporous structure of the carbon spheres, optimized CCAC-Fe-M-50% manifested superior ion transfer kinetics and rate performances (87% up to 20 A g-1). Meanwhile, the electrochemical investigation of CCAC-Fe-M-50% in a three-electrode setup illustrated high capacitance (338 F g-1at 1 A g-1). In a two-electrode setup, the CCAC-Fe-M-50%||CCAC-Fe-M-50% device revealed supreme cyclability (102.7% retention after 5000 cycles) and extremely lowRct(0.59 Ω) andRs(4.54 Ω). These superior properties were attributed to the largeSBET(2305.7 m2g-1), the multiple redox possibilities (Fe3+, Fe2+, and N functional groups), and the carbon sphere morphology with a micro-mesoporous structure, which enhanced ion physisorption, pseudocapacitance, and electrolyte/ion diffusion, respectively. Besides, the fabricated CCAC-Fe-M-50%||CCAC-Fe-M-50% device in a neutral electrolyte demonstrated a superb energy density (ED) of 18.60 Wh kg-1at the power density (PD) of 455 W kg-1. The currently presented strategy with superior results might lead to the novel development of biomass-based ultraperformance electrode materials for supercapacitors and other high-tech applications.
