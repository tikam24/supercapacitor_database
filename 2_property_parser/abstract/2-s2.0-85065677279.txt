Standalone operation of a photovoltaic energy generating system is difficult due to the variation of solar irradiation and temperature. Batteries used in storage systems for renewable power can undergo many irregular cycles of charge / discharge. In turn, this can also have a detrimental effect on the life of battery and can increase project costs. To ensure long life span, a good cost and good performance of the system, two embedded energy sharing methods between the energy storage system battery and the auxiliary energy storage system such as supercapacitors is proposed. The supercapacitor guarantees a long cycle life but suffers from a low energy density and high cost. Combining the two storage devices is possible to obtain good compromise in terms of energy density and a long cycle life. However, a management and control strategy of the DC bus is proposed and simulated in MATLAB/Simulink environment.
