In this work, Fe2O3/rGO composites with high capacitive performance were synthesized via a facile hydrothermal route. The morphological and structural characteristics of the synthesized material were obtained by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The three-electrode system was employed for investigating the electrochemical performance in 6 M aqueous electrolytic solution of KOH. The electrochemical data reveals that the Fe2O3/20%rGO shows as high as 171 F g-1 specific capacitance at 1 A g-1 discharge current density within the operated voltage window -0.9V-0V, which is 55% higher than that of the bare Fe2O3. After 1000 cycles, the capacity reservation was retained at 74%. The results indicate that the synthesized Fe2O3/rGO material could be a potential candidate for applications in an environmentally friendly commercial electrode.
