Currently, advanced electrode materials have excellent potential in energy storage as the result of their high specific surface area and strong electron and ion transport capacity. Herein, a tribasic composite material Cu-WOx@C is obtained by calcining {PW12O40}@metal-organic frameworks under the protection of nitrogen, which is the first time to use this way to synthesize tribasic tungsten oxide. The Cu-WOx@C electrode displays excellent electrochemical properties with the ultrahigh specific capacitance of Cu-WOx@C is 4531 F g−1, which is much better than 2361 F g−1 of {PW12O40}@metal-organic frameworks precursor at a current density of 4.3 A g−1, and also the highest in the recorded tungsten-based materials. The Cu-WOx@C exhibits remarkable cycling stability (93% after 5000 cycles) at a high current density of 22 A g−1. The fabricate aqueous symmetric supercapacitor by using Cu-WOx@C electrode exhibited a wide voltage of 1.8 V with a maximum energy density of 229 Wh kg−1 and a maximum power density of 11.9 kW kg−1 in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. These properties show that Cu-WOx@C is likely to be a next-generation of alternative electrode material for using in practical application.
