Activated carbon/manganese oxide (MnOx) composites were prepared by the thermal decomposition of Mn(NO3)2 that was impregnated on the surface of activated carbon XC-72 with a specific surface area of 250 m2·g-1 and on YEC-8 with a specific surface area of 1726m2·g-1 at 200 °C. The surface morphology and crystalline structure of the composites were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. The electrochemical properties of the composites were tested by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and impedance spectroscopy. We found that α-Mn2O3 and α-Mn3O4 were formed when the composites were annealed at 200 °C. At mass ratios of C and MnOx of 2:1 and 9:1, the specific capacitance of MnOx in the composites of XC-72/ MnOx was 499 and 435 F·g-1 and the specific capacitance of MnOx in the composites of YEC-8/MnOx was 554 and 606 F·g-1, respectively. This suggests a significant contribution of pseudocapacitance from MnOx to the specific capacitance of the electrode. © Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.
