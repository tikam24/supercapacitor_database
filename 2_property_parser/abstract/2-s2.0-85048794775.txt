Hybrid controllers are capable of improved performance over their linear counterparts. In particular, reset controllers like the PI+CI are capable of fast flat response for lag dominant plants. Grid connected power converters especially interfacing energy storage systems to grids are required to have fast response to varying load demands to ensure minimum variation in grid parameters. Application of PI+CI controllers in such systems can improve their performance. In this work the improvement brought about by use of PI+CI controller employed for energy storage system power converters is highlighted by comparing it with PI controller based system under load variations. A DC microgrid with Fuel cell-supercapacitor based storage elements are considered here. The design criteria and simulation results are presented here.
