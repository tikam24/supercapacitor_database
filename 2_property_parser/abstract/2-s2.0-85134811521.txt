Planar on-chip micro-supercapacitors are recognized as one of the most competitive energy sources for electronics. Here, we showed ultrahigh performance all-solid-state planar on-chip micro-supercapacitors with photolithographic interdigital electrodes based on modified liquid-air interface self-assembly technique. The electrode width which is narrower than other existing lithography is only on the order of 10° μm (electrode width is 4 μm and the gap width is 4 μm). Planar on-chip micro-supercapacitors prepared with reduced graphene oxide films as electrodes had the energy density of 124.4 mWh cm−3, the corresponding time constant of 2.15 μs and the displayed stack capacitance of 895.74 F cm−3. In addition, it exhibited excellent cycle stability with a capacitance retention of 98.9% after 10,000 cycles. The demonstrated planar on-chip micro-supercapacitors have a good application foreground in the preparation of high-performance integrated micro-devices.
