Electrode architecture design is of critical importance to the development of advanced hybrid electrode materials for supercapacitors. Here, we report a novel electrode architecture that is composed of Fe2O3 nanocubes and carbon nanotube functionalized carbon. This functionalized electrode demonstrates superior electrochemical performance, characterized by a high capacitance of 1687 mF cm-2 at a current density of 2 mA cm-2, excellent cycling stability, and 95.8% retention after 20 000 cycles. This work presents a new approach for fabricating advanced hybrid electrode materials for supercapacitor applications.
