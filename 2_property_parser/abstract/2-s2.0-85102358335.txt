The latest research progress of graphene/MnO2 composites in supercapacitors is reviewed. The theoretical specific capacitance of MnO2 is as high as 1370 F/g, but the actual specific capacitance is far less than the theoretical value due to the limitation of MnO2 layer thickness. The combination of graphene and MnO2 and the anchoring of MnO2 nanostructures between graphene nanosheets can effectively inhibit the stacking of graphene and enhance the interfacial charge transfer. With the help of the synergistic effect of the two, it is expected to achieve high specific capacitance, high conductivity and good cycle stability. The preparation method and electrochemical performance of graphene/MnO2 composite were introduced. The electrochemical performance was further improved due to the introduction of conductive polymer. Finally, it is pointed out that graphene/MnO2 composites and devices still face a series of problems such as safety and reliability, large-scale production and cost reduction. With the continuous maturity and breakthrough of technology, it is expected to be applied in industry, transportation and daily electronic devices.
