The high electrical conductivity, good hydrophilicity, and various surface terminal configurations of MXenes have exposed extensive attention in the field of energy storage. Ti3C2Tx MXene was synthesised via a facile chemical process. A study of Ti3C2Tx MXene's structure, composition, and morphology was carried out using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy (RS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). A detailed study of the influence of aqueous electrolytes on the charge storage performance of Ti3C2Tx MXene was conducted by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), cyclic stability (CS), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). In addition, it is proposed that Ti3C2Tx MXene's surface terminations affect its capacitance behaviour in aqueous electrolytes. Ti3C2Tx MXene in 3 M (KOH) alkaline electrolyte has good electrochemical performance, with a specific capacitance (Cs) of up to 92 F/g at 2A/g, making it a potential material for supercapacitors.
