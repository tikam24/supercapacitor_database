In this paper, cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was employed to prevent the restack of the thermally reduce graphene oxide (TRG) sheets. A facile approach was demonstrated to effectively enlarge the interlayer distance of the TRG sheets through the ionic interaction between the intercalated CTAB and ionic liquids (ILs). The morphology of the composites and the interaction between the intercalated ionic species were systematically characterized by SEM, SAXS, XRD, TGA, and FTIR. In addition, the performance of the EDLC cells based on these TRG composites was evaluated. It was found that due to the increased interlayer distance (0.41 nm to 2.51 nm) that enlarges the accessible surface area for the IL electrolyte, the energy density of the cell can be significantly improved (23.1 Wh/kg to 62.5 Wh/kg).
