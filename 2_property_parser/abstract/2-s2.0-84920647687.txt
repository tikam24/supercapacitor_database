In this study, to make a stable electrode material for a supercapacitor, we selected a polyaniline and titanium dioxide (TiO2) hybrid material. Peroxotitanium acid was used to oxidize aniline in the presence of sulfuric acid to a poly(aniline sulfate) salt-titanium oxide composite in one step. IR, X-ray diffraction, and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) analyses supported the formation of the composite. The poly(aniline sulfate) salt-titanium oxide composites (50 wt % each) showed an amorphous, flakelike morphology having a conductivity value of 8 × 10-3 S/cm with an excellent yield and stability (300C).This composite material in the cell configuration showed a specific capacitance of 320 F/g at a 0.33 A/g discharge current density. Thirty thousand charge-discharge (CD) cycles at a heavy CD current density of 3.3 A/g were carried out on the supercapacitor cell. The values of equivalent series resistance (ESR) (8-9 Ω) and efficiency (100-98%) were found to be independent of the cycle number with an excellent retention capacity of 83%.
