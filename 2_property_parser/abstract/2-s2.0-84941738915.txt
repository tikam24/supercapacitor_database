Ni20[(OH)12(H2O)6][(HPO4)8(PO4)4]·12H2O nanorods are successfully synthesized via a one-pot hydrothermal reaction. A high-performance flexible asymmetric all-solid-state supercapacitor based on the obtained Ni20[(OH)12(H2O)6][(HPO4)8(PO4)4]·12H2O nanorods (positive electrode) and graphene nanosheets (negative electrode) is successfully assembled. It is the first report of this nanomaterial applied for all-solid-state supercapacitors. Interestingly, a maximum volumetric energy density of 0.446 mW h cm-3 at a current density of 0.5 mA cm-2 and a maximum power density of 44.1 mW cm-3 at a current density of 6.0 mA cm-2 are achieved by the as-assembled device. What's more, the device also shows excellent mechanical flexibility and little capacitance change after over 5000 charge/discharge cycles at a current density of 0.5 mA cm-2.
