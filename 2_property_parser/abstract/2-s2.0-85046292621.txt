The simulation and hardware based experiment in this presented paper shows a possibility of increasing the reliability of solar power under diffused condition by using super capacitor module. This experimental setup can be used in those areas where the sun light is intermittent and under the diffused radiation condition. Due to diffused radiation, solar PV cells operate very poorly, but by using this setup the power efficiency can be increased greatly. Sometimes dependent numerical models are used to measure the voltage and current response of the hardware setup in MATLAB Simulink based environment. To convert the scattered solar radiation to electricity using the conventional solar PV module, batteries have to be linked with the rapid charging or discharging device like super capacitor module. The conventional method consists of a charging circuit, which dumps the power if the voltage is below certain voltage level, but this circuit utilizes the entire power even if the voltage is low under diffused sun light conditions. There is no power dumped in this circuit. The efficiency and viability of this labscale experimental setup can be examined with further experiment and industrial model.
