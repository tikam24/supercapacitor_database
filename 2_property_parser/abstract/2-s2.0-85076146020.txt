This paper proposes the integration of a train line for regenerative braking into a DC MicroGrid composed of PV generation, hybrid energy storage system (battery and supercapacitor) and DC local load. The energy generated from regenerative braking is absorbed by the supercapacitor, which is able to deal with bursts of power without affecting the stability of the system. The control scheme is based on singular perturbation analysis, where we can split the overall system in two interconnected subsystems with different time-scales dynamics, solving the non-minimal phase problem for DC/DC converters. Therefore, a simplified control strategy is obtained to control the train's converter and to assure stability of the whole MicroGrid. Simulation results show that the proposed control strategy can integrate regenerative braking from train as a renewable source in the MicroGrid.
