Transition metal oxides (TMOs) can provide high theoretical capacitance due to the change of multiple valence states of transition metals. However, their intrinsic drawbacks, including poor electrical conductivity, lower energy density, and huge volume expansion, will result in the pulverization of electrode materials and restricted electrochemical kinetics, thus leading to poor rate capability and rapid capacity fading. Composite electrodes based on transition metal oxides and carbon-based materials are considered to be promising candidates for overcoming these limitations. Herein, we reported a preparation method of hybrid ZIFs derived Zn-doped Co3O4/carbon (Zn-Co3O4/C-230) particles semi-embedded in wood-derived carbon skeleton for integrated electrodes. A large specific surface area, excellent conductivity, and electrochemical stability provide a larger electrochemical activity and potential window for the electrode. Prepared Zn-Co3O4@CW-230 electrode (0.6 mm thick) displays ultrahigh area specific capacitances of 7.83 and 6.46 F cm−2 at the current densities of 5 and 30 mA cm−2, respectively. Moreover, a symmetric supercapacitor assembled by two identical Zn-Co3O4@CW-230 electrodes delivers a superior area-specific capacitance of 2.61 F cm−2 at the current densities of 5 mA cm−2 and great energy densities of 0.36 mWh cm−2 (6.0 mWh cm−3) at 2.5 mW cm−2, while maintaining 97.3% of initial capacitance over 10,000 cycles. It notably outperforms those of most carbon-based metal oxides, endowing the Zn-Co3O4@CW-230 with extensive prospects for practical application.
