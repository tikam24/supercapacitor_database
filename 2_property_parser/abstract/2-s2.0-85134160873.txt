Electrical equipment insulation damage, metal shell conduction on rainy days, and wire short circuits are easy to produce leakage, which form step voltage on the ground and endangers the life and safety of nearby personnel. In addition to the existing leakage protector, a new method is proposed to use leakage energy to obtain energy and early warning. The step voltage generated by the leakage current is collected through the electrode, which is rectified and reduced by the nano power LTC3588, while energy is stored in the supercapacitor for the superheterodyne transmitting module to send the leakage signal to the nearby receiving device. Based on the possibility of the superheterodyne transmitting module sending the leakage signal, it is judged whether leakage occurs here. The experimental results illustrate that when 10 mA leakage occurs in a 220 V wire, the electrode distance is 1.0 m, while the energy extraction device can obtain 360 MW of power for the superheterodyne transmitting module to send the leakage signal.
