Cd2+ doped iron oxide nanoparticles (Cd-IONs) with magnetite crystal structure and 10-20 nm sizes were prepared through cathodic electro-synthesis (CES) method. In this procedure, IONs are galvanostatically deposited on stainless steel cathode with applying simple electrochemical conditions. The prepared both IONs were used as supercapacitor electrode material and their performances were determined through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostat charge-discharge (GCD) tests. The Cd-IONs sample exhibited specific capacitance as high as 206 F g−1 and cycling stability of 93.9% after 2000 cycling at 0.5 A g−1. The electrochemical data confirmed the proper capacitive ability of the Cd-IONs.
