Tubular manganese dioxide (MnO2) is synthesized by hydrothermal method, and a silicon dioxide (SiO2) used as template is wrapped on the as-synthesized MnO2. Then poly(styrene-co-divinylbenzene) (PS) as heteropolymeric carbon precursor was wrapped on as-prepared MnO2/SiO2 to form intermediate product MnO2@SiO2@PS. The intermediate products were treated by carbon tetrachloride, stripped template and carbonized, thus the final product MnO2/porous carbon composite (MnO2@PC) with core–shell structure was obtained. The core–shell structural composite is used as an electrode of supercapacitors, which combines high conductivity and high surface specific area of porous carbon material and high electrochemical activity of MnO2. The resulting core–shell MnO2@PC exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 196.2 F g−1 at a discharge density of 1 A g−1 with capacitance retention of 78.52% over 5000 discharge/charge cycles.
