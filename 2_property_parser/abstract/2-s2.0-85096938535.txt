Interfacial engineering is one of the feasible pathways to tune the characteristics and functions of nanomaterials. In this report, we successfully synthesized crystalline CoWO4/amorphous Co−B heterostructures that enable superior electrochemical performance. The electrodes overcome the defect of low conductivity of cobalt tungstate and also expose more active sites. The optimized CoWO4/Co−B electrode has a remarkable specific capacity of 177.4 C g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and a great specific capacity retention of 100% at 5 A g−1 after 10,000 cycles with reasonable cycling stability. Moreover, the Co−B/CoWo4 electrode and activated carbon electrode are combined to assemble an asymmetric supercapacitor, which achieves 22.26 W h kg−1 maximum energy density at 200 W kg−1 and a capacity retention of 95.65% after 10,000 cycles at 2 A g−1. In general, the work shows the unique characteristics of the crystalline/amorphous nano-heterostructure and provides a direction for future studies on increasing the electrochemical character and application of nanomaterials through regulating the interface contact of composites.
