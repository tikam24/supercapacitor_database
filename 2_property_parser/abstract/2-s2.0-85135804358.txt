This paper presents an adaptive power management strategy (PMS) that enhances the performance of a hybrid AC/DC microgrid (HMG) with an interlinking converter (IC) integrated with a hybrid energy storage system (HESS). The HESS is made up of a supercapacitor (SC), a battery, and a fuel cell (FC) with complementary characteristics. The modeling of the test system, which consists of an IC control structure with virtual synchronous machine-transient (VSM-T) droop and HESS control, is outlined in this article. The modified IC topology improves the power-sharing between sub-grids and enhances the steady-state and transient responses. The novelty of the proposed strategy is that the power ratio index-based power management approach is executed through a single controller using local measurements. Furthermore, the adaptive nature of the reference generation improves the active and reactive power-sharing of the IC and the simultaneous voltage regulation at AC and DC sub-grids. The performance of a HMG under varying loading and irradiation, distributed generation (DG) outage, and electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) charging are analyzed on a modified IEEE 13-bus HMG test system and validated using OPAL-RT real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments. Furthermore, the adaptive nature of reference generation in the proposed approach improves power-sharing during both volatile and normal loading. The proposed PMS provides a voltage improvement of 7.92% at the AC sub-grid, and 0.42% at the DC sub-grid of the HMG.
