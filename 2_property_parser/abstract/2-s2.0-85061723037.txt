Micro/nanomaterials consisting of Ni Χ Co−P−O were synthesized via a facile, one-pot solvothermal method and then used as positive electrode materials in asymmetric supercapacitors. The obtained Ni x Co−P−O (sample C) electrode materials displayed a typical micro/nano-flower morphology. A large capacitance of 956 F g −1 could be delivered when Ni x Co−P−O (sample C) composites were used as electrodes in supercapacitors. Furthermore, a high cell voltage (1.8 V), which allowed a high energy density of 47.68 Wh kg −1 at a power density of 884.78 W kg −1 , was obtained using micro/nano-flowers Ni x Co−P−O (sample C)//activated carbon (AC) in an asymmetric capacitor (ASC). The high electrochemical performance and typical micro/nano-flower morphology make the Ni x Co−P−O composites (sample C) promising electrode materials for supercapacitors.
