A composite supercapacitor electrode material, MnO2 decorated cobalt-iron Prussian blue analogue (CoPBA), has been rationally designed and fabricated through a facile precipitation method. The surface encapsulation of MnO2 onto CoPBA can result in improved electrochemical performances, because the uniformly covered MnO2 increases not only the electrical conductivity for faster ion transport but also the specific capacitance by providing more active sites. A maximum specific capacitance of 945F gâˆ’1 at 1 A/g is observed for CoPBA@MnO2, which is 3.2-fold and 6.7-fold of those of pure CoPBA and MnO2, respectively. This study is expected to provide a good reference for designing high performance electrode materials with ease and low cost.
