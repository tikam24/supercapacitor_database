Aniline was mixed with thiophene and oxidized by ammonium persulfate in the presence of sulfuric acid via an aqueous polymerization pathway (PAT-AP). Aqueous polymerization was also carried by sodium lauryl sulfate surfactant, and also by interfacial and electrochemical polymerization pathways. Polymers prepared were characterized by physical, spectral, and electrochemical methods. Nanofibers (30-60 nm diameter) was obtained in the case of aqueous polymerization pathway, whereas interfacial (40-60 nm) and electrochemical polymerization pathways show particulate (500-600 nm) morphology. Polymer samples were used as electrode materials in supercapacitor. Among the four different pathways, PAT-AP nanofibers show higher capacitance of 614 F g-1 at 1 mV s-1. The values of specific capacitance, energy, and power densities of PAT-AP were found to be 400 F g-1, 20 W h kg-1 and 1200 W kg-1, respectively, at a current density of 2 A g-1. The retention capacitance is 78% after completion of 1000 cycles.
