The essence of any electrochemical system is engraved in its electrical double layer (EDL), and we report its unprecedented reorganization by the structural isomerism of molecules, with a direct consequence on their energy storage capability. Electrochemical and spectroscopic analyses in combination with computational and modelling studies demonstrate that an attractive field-effect due to the molecule's structural-isomerism, in contrast to a repulsive field-effect, spatially screens the ion-ion coulombic repulsions in the EDL and reconfigures the local density of anions. In a laboratory-level prototype supercapacitor, those with β-structural isomerism exhibit nearly 6-times elevated energy storage compared to the state-of-the-art electrodes, by delivering ∼535 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 while maintaining high performance metrics even at a rate as high as 50 A g−1. The elucidation of the decisive role of structural isomerism in reconfiguring the electrified interface represents a major step forward in understanding the electrodics of molecular platforms.
