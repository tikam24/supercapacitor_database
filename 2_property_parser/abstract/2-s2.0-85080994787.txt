The functionalization of pristine carbon nano-onions (p-CNOs), obtained by thermal annealing of nanodiamonds, with L-lysine was carried out through two synthetic routes: i) amidation of previously oxidized p-CNOs (lys-CNOs); and ii) by formation of diazonium salts to produce the corresponding aliphatic carbocation that is added to the outer shell of the nanomaterial (slys-CNO). Characterization was carried out by ATR-FTIR and Raman spectroscopy. Additionally, the degree of functionalization was estimated by TGA. The specific capacitance of the functionalized nanomaterials was determined by cyclic voltammetry, using the method of the linearization of the peak current as a function of the sweep rate, obtaining values of 16.49 F g−1, 4.03 F g−1 and 32.72 F g−1 for p-CNOs, lys-CNOs and slys-CNOs, respectively. Finally, an evaluation of the electrochemical system was carried out through EIS. Our results show that the oxidation method has a great influence on the electrical properties of CNOs as evidenced in the capacitance.
