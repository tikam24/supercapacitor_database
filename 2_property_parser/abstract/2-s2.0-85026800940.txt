Alloy nanostructures had received much attention for their applications in energy, catalysis, and optics. This paper described a facile ultrasonic approach for the synthesis of Ni–B alloy nanorods (Ni–B NRs). The crystallinity, chemical state, surface area and surface morphology of Ni–B NRs were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR–TEM) analyses, respectively. The electrocatalytic behavior of Ni–B NRs toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was studied by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and Tafel polarization methods in 0.1 M aqueous KOH. The LSV results of Ni–B NRs showed very low OER onset potential of 1.44 VRHE with an overpotential of 212 mVRHE. The Ni–B NRs attained 10 mA/cm2 of current density at a very low potential of 1.61 VRHE than bare SS (1.87 VRHE) and bare Pt (2.50 VRHE). Further, Ni–B NRs showed a low Tafel slope of 45 mV/dec when compared to other standard materials, revealed the fast OER kinetics. The calculated specific capacitance of synthesized Ni–B NRs was 581 F/g, from the results of cyclic voltammetry at a scan rate of 2 mV/s. The electrocatalytic and supercapacitor studies exposed that the synthesized Ni–B NRs can be used as an electrocatalyst for OER as well as pseudocapacitor for commercial electric vehicles.
