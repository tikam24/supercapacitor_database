A novel asymmetric supercapacitor device for energy storage is fabricated using K0.3WO3 nanorods as negative electrode and nitrogen-doped porous carbon (CBC-1) based on agricultural wastes corn bract as positive electrode. The K0.3WO3 nanorods are composed of some thinner needle-shaped nanorods which are parallel to each other, and the CBC-1 reveals rough surface of coral-like frameworks with abundant nanopores. The structures can provide high surface area, low diffusion paths and intercalation/de-intercalation of electrolyte ions between the electrode/electrolyte interfaces. Thus, the asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits high energy density about 26.3 Wh kg−1 at power density of 404.2 W kg−1 in the wide voltage region of 0–1.6 V, as well as a good electrochemical stability (80% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles). Such outstanding electrochemical behaviors imply the CBC-1//K0.3WO3 asymmetric supercapacitor is a promising practical energy-storage system.
