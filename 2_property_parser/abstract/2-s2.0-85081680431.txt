In this study, ultra-thin two-dimensional (2D) metalloporphyrinic metal-organic framework (MOF) nanosheets were grown on nickel oxide (NiO) nanoparticles; a successful synthesis of new type of hybrid nanosheets was developed. The structure and morphology of hybrid nanosheets obtained by instrumental characterization showed that a composite of 2D Cu-TCPP (tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)phosphonium porphyrin) MOF nanosheets and NiO nanoparticles was synthesized. The obtained hybrid nanosheets can be used in many applications including supercapacitors and electrochemical sensors for glucose detection. Compared with conventional 2D MOFs and NiO nanoparticles, hybrid nanosheets have high specific capacitance (2394 Fg-1, 5 Ag-1). The obtained hybrid nanosheets were successfully used as a glucose sensor and showed a high sensitivity of 4.6 μA μm-1 cm-2. The study shows that this new electrode material is expected to be used to develop high performance capacitors and effective non-enzymatic glucose sensors.
