Past several years, the distributed energy resources (DERs) have been substantially focused to fulfill the world's escalating energy needs. Amongst the existing energy resources, the green renewable resources are best possible way out as they are environment friendly. In this regard, wind energy reflects the cost-effective and finest results in DERs. However, augmenting wind energy with the existing power supply system causes power instability and quality problems, for the period of low voltage ride through or dip/sag. In this research, we analyze the power quality (PQ) issues associated to the wind farm integration (WFI), which emerge through doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) based microgrid. These induced problems are dealt with Ultracapacitor (UCAP) integration to the DFIG which also stabilizes the system voltage. Comparisons among the different scenarios (i.e. distributed power system with or without UCAP) have been made using standard selected measures on two simulation platforms namely, DIgSilent Power Factory and MATLAB/Simulink, which further analyzed by SWOT Analysis.
