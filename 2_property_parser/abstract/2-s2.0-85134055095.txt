Reduced graphene oxide wrapped metal chalcogenides nanostructures endure to pique interest as multifunctional materials, particularly in the discipline of energy storage and conversion because of the larger surface area. The present study presents a simple hydrothermal approach to construct the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) wrapped chromium sulfide (rGO/Cr2S3/NF). A wide range of analytical techniques like X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to analyze the structural and morphological properties. Due to the robust and porous structure of the rGO/Cr2S3/NF nanocomposite used as a binder-free electrode, which facilitates electrolyte diffusion and outstanding electrochemical performance. The electrochemical performances like cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves confirm the pseudocapacitive nature of rGO/Cr2S3/NF nanocomposite in an alkaline environment. The specific capacitance of rGO/Cr2S3/NF obtained via CV curves at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 is 2563.12 F g−1 with an energy density of 87.50 Wh kg−1 and power density of 1607.14 W kg−1 at 2.0 mA cm−2 current density. Additionally, rGO/Cr2S3/NF nanocomposite exhibited good stability up to 1000 cycles, because rGO offers outstanding electrical conduction between the porous nickel foam (NF) current collector and Cr2S3. The exemplary electrochemical behavior of fine-tuned rGO/Cr2S3/NF nanocomposite favors practical application in supercapacitors as a nanostructure electrode material for future applications.
