Lithium ion capacitor is a kind of energy storage device assembled with capacitive positive electrode material and battery negative electrode material. It combines the advantages of both lithium ion battery and super capacitor, and has high energy density, high power density and long cycle life. However, due to the unbalanced capacity and kinetic imbalance between the anode and cathode, the electrochemical performance of lithium-ion capacitors is greatly limited. Generally, the power density of lithium-ion capacitors depends on the negative electrode material, while the energy density depends on the positive electrode material. Therefore, to improve the energy density of lithium-ion capacitors, it is necessary to develop the positive electrode material with high specific capacity and high conductivity. At present, carbon material is a potential electrode material because of its low cost, wide source, high specific surface area and rich pore structure. In this paper, the electrochemical properties, advantages and disadvantages of various carbon materials (including activated carbon, template carbon, graphene and biochar, etc.) as cathode materials for lithium-ion capacitors are reviewed and analyzed. Finally, suggestions and prospects for the research of cathode materials for lithium-ion capacitors are put forward.
