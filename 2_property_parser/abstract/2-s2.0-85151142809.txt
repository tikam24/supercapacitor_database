Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with porous structures are beneficial for electrochemical energy storage. Herein, the in-situ growth of the S-doped Ni-MOF nanosheet (S-NMN) on the surfaces of nickel foams was prepared via a facile solvothermal process. Owing to the rich active sites, small transport barrier, and excellent mechanical stability, the fabricated S-NMN-2 electrode displays a high specific capacity (1952 mF cm-2 at 1 mA cm-2), satisfactory rate performance, and remarkable cyclic stability. For practical application, the assembled S-NMN-2//AC device achieves a high energy density of 0.189 mWh cm-2 at the power density of 1.600 mW cm-2 with prominent cycling stability (93.27% capacity retention after 4000 cycles). The facile strategy of etching nickel foam demonstrates a new idea for developing high-performance supercapacitor materials.
