In this work, a new kind of two-dimensional coordination polymer (CP)-conductive polymer hybrid is developed and firstly used as electrode material for supercapacitor. The combination of 2D CP (Cu-TCPP, TCPP = 5, 10, 15, 20-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin) with polypyrrole (PPy) greatly enhances the charge storage capacity (∼500 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) when compared with that of the pure 2D coordination polymer, PPy and the sample prepared by physical mixing. This improvement in electrochemical performance is most likely due to the synergistic effect between the 2D CP and PPy. Particularly, an all solid-state symmetric supercapacitors is also fabricated and tested. The favorable electrochemical performance and flexibility demonstrate its great potential applications in energy storage. What's more, this strategy may also be extended to fabricate other conductive polymer and 2D CP hybrids.
