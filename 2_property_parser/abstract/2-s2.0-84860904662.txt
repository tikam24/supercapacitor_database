This paper depicts a new configuration for modular hybrid power conversion systems, namely, multi-hybrid generation system (MHGS), and parallel connection at the output, such that the converter of each unit shares the load current equally. This is a significant step towards realizing a modular power conversion system architecture, where smaller units can be connected in any series/parallel grouping to realize any required unit specifications. The supercapacitor (SC) as a complementary source is used to compensate for the slow transient response of the fuel cell (FC) as a main power source. It assists the FC to meet the grid power demand in order to achieve a better performance and dynamic behavior. Reliable control of the proposed MHGS with multiple units is also a challenging issue. In this paper, a simple control method to achieve active sharing of load current among MHGS modules is proposed. The simulation results verify the performance of the proposed structure and control scheme. Â© 2012 IEEE.
