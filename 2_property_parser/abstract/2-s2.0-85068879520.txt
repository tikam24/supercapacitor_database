The paper presents the design of and experimental research on a resistojet thruster with a dedicated power supply system based on supercapacitors. First, the description of two research stands used in different stages of the research is presented. The experimental approach divides the research into two phases. The first part focuses on optimization of the heating chamber, which has a laboratory power supply as a power source. Seven configurations of the chamber – differing in the number of coaxial channels and spiral heaters – are presented together with the results of the optimization process. The second stage describes research into thruster-like conditions with both power supply systems – supercapacitor based and with a laboratory power supply – with the geometry chosen based on the optimization process. A comparison is presented of propulsion parameters for various pre-heating times, power levels and power supply types, with a cold gas system as a reference.
