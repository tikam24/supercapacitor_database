Ultrafine cube-shape Ce2Sn2O7 nanoparticles crystallized in pure pyrochlore phase with a size of about 10 nm have been successfully synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. Conditional experiments have been conducted to optimize the processing parameters including temperature, pH, reaction duration, precipitator types to obtain phase-pure Ce2Sn2O7. The crystal structure, morphology and sizes and specific surface area have been characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD), Raman spectrum, transmission electron microscope (TEM), high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET). The as-synthesized Ce2Sn2O7 ultrafine nanocubes have been evaluated as electrode materials for pseudo-capacitors and lithium ion batteries. When testing as supercapacitors, a high specific capacitance of 222 F/g at 0.1 A/g and a good cycling stability with a capacitance retention of higher than 86% after 5000 cycle have been achieved. When targeted for anode material for lithium ion batteries, the nanocubes deliver a high specific reversible capacity of more than 900 mAâˆ™h/g at 0.05C rate. The rate capability and cycling performance is also very promising as compared with the traditional graphite anode.
