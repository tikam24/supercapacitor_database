Supercapacitors (SCs) with the advantages of high power density, fast charge/discharge and no memory effect have been regarded as potential energy storage devices. Mo-based materials have been extensive used as active electrode materials in pseudocapacitors due to their high theoretical specific capacities, eminent electrochemical activities, as well as highly reversible redox reactions. However, the serious self-aggregation and huge volume change of Mo-based materials can cause a dramatic capacity decay during the electrochemical process. Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) synthesized through electrospinning technology are endowed with excellent mechanical strength and satisfactory electrical conductivity, which are regarded as an ideal matrix for composite materials. Hitherto, Mo-based materials incorporated with CNFs through electrospinning technology have arisen intensive attraction in SCs. The electrospinning strategy can realize evenly dispersed Mo-based materials in CNFs. The as-prepared Mo-based nanocomposite fibers with good flexibility and brilliant chemical properties can validly avoid the self-aggregation and enhance the electrochemical performance. In this review, the basic process and principle of the electrospinning technique, strategies to prepare CNFs with special structure, and various Mo-based nanocomposite fibers are introduced. In addition, the application of the Mo-based nanocomposite fibers in SCs, as well as the current situation and challenges of Mo-based nanocomposite fibers are also summarized.
