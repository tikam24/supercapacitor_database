Because of its unique metallic property and excellent conductivity, nickel nitride (Ni3N) has received considerable interests in both electrochemical energy systems (EES) and energy conversion systems (ECS). However, pristine Ni3N has unsatisfactory performance in these devices because of limited electrochemical active sites. Revitalizing the morphology and modulation of the electronic structure by introducing defects or heterostructures have been proven effective in enhancing the performance of Ni3N electrode in both EES and ECS. This review will first provide an overview of the recent development of transition metal nitrides in energy application in comparison with other types of electrodes. Then, the general synthesis, electrochemical properties, modification strategies, and operating mechanism of Ni3N in energy storage devices and electrocatalysis are elaborated in detail. The associated challenges and possible mitigation in energy storage and electrocatalysis are also discussed. This review may inspire further research in pushing Ni3N-based materials for diverse applications in many energy systems.
