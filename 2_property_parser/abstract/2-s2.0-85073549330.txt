The research and application of renewable energy sources and electromobility implies a subordinate but not negligible problem, the energy storage. The most important sources of clean energy, related to solar and wind power plants, are in fact intermittent and therefore require their management in energy collection, even more in the long term. Additionally, electromobility and several other applications may need huge peak power. All this kind of problems cannot be solved always by electrochemical batteries. An alternative to them is represented by supercapacitors (SCs), energy storage devices specialized in high power, exhibiting also a very long life cycle. In this chapter, we will illustrate the state of the art of their operation, typologies, applications and all that a wide-ranging interdisciplinary literature offers us about how this type of technology could be used more and more in the near future.
