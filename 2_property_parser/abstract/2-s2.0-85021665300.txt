The successful applications of supercapacitors and adsorbents hinge on the development of highly stable and efficient materials. Herein, we report a facile approach to fabricate a novel type of three dimensional porous materials composed of elongated TiO2 nanotubes (eTNTs) and reduced garphene oxide (rGO). The eTNTs-rGO composites is the graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets joins with commercially available TiO2 nanoparticles through the hydrothermal process combined with mechanical stirring, which converts the TiO2 nanoparticles to elongated TiO2 nanotubes (eTNTs) and the alkaline medium simultaneously converts GO to rGO. The electrochemical performance of eTNTs-rGO composites is measured by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The specific capacitance is 338 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The eTNTs-rGO composites electrode exhibited long-term cycle stability, retaining about 93.3% specific capacitance after 3000 cycles. Additionally, the eTNTs-rGO composites show excellent adsorption capacity for bisphenol A, which can reach 159.3 mg g−1. The superb electrochemical performance and adsorption capacity demonstrated the potential of eTNTs-rGO composites as an attractive material for energy storage and environmental.
