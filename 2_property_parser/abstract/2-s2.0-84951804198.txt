Hybrid nano-architecture for supercapacitors has been designed by growing three-dimensional ZnO@MnO2 coreeshell nanocables on Ti/RuO2 + TiO2 substrate (titanium plate covered with RuO2+TiO2 coating). Electrochemical depositions were utilized for constructing this coreeshell nanostructure, which involved potentiostastic deposition of ZnO nanorod arrays and potentiodynamic deposition of multivalent and partially hydrous manganese oxide. According to cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic chargeedischarge measurements, ZnO@MnO2 coreeshell nanocables electrode exhibits higher specific capacitance and better rate capability than those of pure MnO2 electrode. The specific capacitances of ZnO@MnO2 coreeshell nanocables reach 537.8 F g-1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1 and 613.5 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopies also confirm that ZnO@MnO2 coreeshell nanocables electrode has better electrochemical characteristics. Furthermore, ZnO@MnO2 coreeshell nanocables losses 10.2% of the initial capacitance after 5000 chargeedischarge cycles, which demonstrates its excellent cycling stability. These results indicate that the electrochemical property of manganese oxide has been greatly enhanced due to the supporting of ZnO nanorod arrays, and ZnO@MnO2 coreeshell nanocables is promising electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.
