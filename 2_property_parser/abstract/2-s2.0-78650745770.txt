According to the operating characteristics of the wind power flow optimization and control system, an improved supercapacitor euqivalent circuit model is proposed, which characterizes termimanl behavior of the supercapacitor in the time ranges from several seonds to several minutes as well as the influence of lekage current in hours range. By the method of circuit analysis, parameter identification of the model is deduced in detail. The smilation and expriment results indicate the model and its parameter idenfication method proposed in the paper are feasible and effective. Â© (2010) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
