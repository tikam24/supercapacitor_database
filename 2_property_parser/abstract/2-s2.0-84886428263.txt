Silicon nanowires (SiNWs) synthesized by Hot-Wire Chemical Vapor Process (HWCVP) via vapor-liquid-solid mechanism are explored as electrodes for supercapacitor application. The electrochemical properties of SiNWs in two electrode configuration were evaluated by galvanostatic charge/discharge test and cyclic voltammetry at different scan rates. A specific capacitance of 800 μF/cm2 at 10 mV/sec scan rate is obtained and the capacitive behavior is maintained even at higher scan rates. All electrochemical measurements were carried out in 1M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. Scanning Electron Microscopy was also employed for characterization of SiNWs morphology. © 2013 IEEE.
