Microgrids often contain DGs (distributed generators) like wind generators whose output varies randomly and even unpredictably. This affects the microgrids in terms of voltage and frequency stability. To cater for the random nature of disturbances, probability based fuzzy logic controls (FLC) may prove effective. This article proposes compensation of the system real and reactive power of a microgrid through a VSCsupercapacitor energy storage device operated through a FLC (fuzzy logic control) strategy. A microgrid containing a micro alternator, PMSG based wind generator, PV system along with a supercapacitor energy storage system has been considered in this study. The fuzzy control was tested with different types of disturbances including three-phase faults on the microgrid bus. While the system exhibited unstable behavior for the particular operation, the FLC based supercapacitor control was observed to be very effective in controlling the slowly varying electromechanical as well as electrical transients in the microgrid. The controls restored normal operating conditions in about 2 seconds following very severe fault on the system.
