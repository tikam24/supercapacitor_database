Flexible and wearable energy storage devices are expected to provide power support for the burgeoning smart and portable electronics. In particular, textile substrate and wearable technology derived supercapacitors (TWSCs) bear the inherent merits of high flexibility, stretchability, washability and compatibility over the non-textile devices, therefore, attract the excitement for achieving high performance and truly wearable energy storage products. In this review, the fundamental mechanisms of supercapacitor and typical technologies of wearable textiles are presented, with emphasis on the main advantages and progress of TWSCs. In view of the current challenges of TWSCS, we propose the strategies for the performance improvement, with expectation to open new avenues to promote the future development of the flexible and wearable supercapacitors.
