A low cost synthesis of catalyst free carbon nano-onions (CNOs) and nitrogen post doped CNOs (N−CNOs) using grapeseed oil is reported. Successful incorporation of nitrogen atoms into the lattice of CNOs was confirmed by XPS, resulting in 1.7 % nitrogen content. BET and Raman analysis showed an increase in the specific surface area and the ID/IG ratio of carbon, respectively after N incorporation. The specific capacitance of the CNOs increased upon nitrogen doping and as a result, N−CNOs exhibited superior electrochemical performance compared to pristine CNOs. Our results demonstrate that N−CNOs are a promising electrode material for energy storage in supercapacitors.
