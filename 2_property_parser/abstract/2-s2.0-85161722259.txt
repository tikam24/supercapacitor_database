The Mixed Metal Sulfide of (FeNiS2) has drawn a lot of interest as a potential electrode for an asymmetric supercapacitor, but challenges remain due to its poor cycle stability and low electrical conductivity. In this study, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) serve as the fundamental structural support for the tightly bound FeNiS2 discs, which are further immobilised using an external elastic protective layer of polypyrrole (PPy). The creation of a CNT/FeNiS2@PPy nanotube@nanodisk heterostructure that acted as a good electrode option for Ni Foam is described in this research. The heterostructure was created using a simple and affordable hydrothermal and polymerization approach. The novelty of this study, the fabrication of electrodes via a capacitive/diffusive technique, was clearly identified by using the power law and Trasatti method. As a result, asymmetric supercapacitors primarily employ the redox interaction between ferrous and ferric ions (Fe2+/Fe3+). These outstanding chemical properties have caught the interest of many people and led to a substantial amount of study on iron-based cathodes. The resulting binder free CNT/FeNiS2@PPy electrode has a huge specific capacitance of 1541 Fg−1 at 2Ag−1 and a reversible high-level capacity retention of 98.1 % after 10 K extended cycles at high current density 10 Ag−1. The Assembled Asymmetric supercapacitors constructed of CNT/FeNiS2@PPy and activated carbon also generated a power density of 9375 Wkg−1 and an energy density of 28.9 Whkg−1 at a 1.6 V potential. This study provides a framework for the optimal material preparation and logical electrode material design, including the enhancement of the characteristics of Ni Foam-based materials for use in supercapacitors.
