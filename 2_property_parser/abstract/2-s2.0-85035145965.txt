A facile two-step strategy is developed to design the large-scale synthesis of hierarchical, unique porous architecture of ternary metal hydroxide nanowires grown on porous 3D Ni foam and subsequent effective sulfurization. The hierarchical Zn–Co–S nanowires (NWs) arrays are directly employed as an electrode for supercapacitors application. The as-synthesized Zn–Co–S NWs deliver an ultrahigh areal capacity of 0.9 mA h cm−2 (specific capacity of 366.7 mA h g−1) at a current density of 3 mA cm−2, with an exceptional rate capability (≈227.6 mA h g−1 at a very high current density of 40 mA cm−2) and outstanding cycling stability (≈93.2% of capacity retention after 10 000 cycles). Most significantly, the assembled Zn–Co–S NWs//Fe2O3@reduced graphene oxide asymmetric supercapacitors with a wide operating potential window of ≈1.6 V yield an ultrahigh volumetric capacity of ≈1.98 mA h cm−3 at a current density of 3 mA cm−2, excellent energy density of ≈81.6 W h kg−1 at a power density of ≈559.2 W kg−1, and exceptional cycling performance (≈92.1% of capacity retention after 10 000 cycles). This general strategy provides an alternative to design the other ternary metal sulfides, making it facile, free-standing, binder-free, and cost-effective ternary metal sulfide-based electrodes for large-scale applications in modern electronics.
