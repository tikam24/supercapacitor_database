TiN thin film electrodes for supercapacitors were deposited successfully on textured silicon substrates by reactive magnetron sputtering and silicon surface texturization. The areal specific capacitance of the rough TiN electrodes was nearly two-fold higher than that of the smooth electrodes. Meanwhile, the textured TiN electrodes exhibit rough surfaces comprising a large number of random pyramids and good cycling stability with about 28% decay in capacitance value after 3500 cycles. In addition, the rough electrodes also exhibit relatively favorable charge transfer and ion diffusion due to their higher effective surface area. These results demonstrate that TiN electrodes on textured silicon substrates will have promising prospects for high-performance supercapacitors.
