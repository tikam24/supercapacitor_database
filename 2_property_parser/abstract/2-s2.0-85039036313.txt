The purpose of the paper was searching for new “green” energy sources. The changes in the mechanism and the selectivity of components binding from the enzyme mixture extracted from black radish adsorbed on kaolin and aerosil are demonstrated. The differences in the binding mechanisms of metal-containing sites of enzyme molecules based on the implementation of the spatial separation of enzyme fragments containing Fe, Ni, Cu and Zn-ions are mentioned. The implementation of the charge division forms of heterostructures improves the oxidation activity and stability of the immobilized enzyme mixture and creates conditions for the formation of regions capable for specific adsorption of a charge. The spatially separated binding of enzyme fragments to an inorganic carrier exhibits the stabilizing effect on the formation of the areas capable for charging and accumulating red-ox transformations. Electrochemical methods have shown a possibility for the formation of structures responsible for the accumulation of energy, like a supercapacitor, in the immobilized systems consisting of graphene covered by a natural enzyme bound to an inorganic carrier.
