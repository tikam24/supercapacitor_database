Today supercapacitors became an option to store and release electrical energy, common in many applications. A transport more efficient and less pollutant is a target of many car manufacturers. The success of this new vehicle structures technology development depends on the energy storage using batteries and supercapacitor. Therefore, many systems today are based on vehicle battery technology, because they have a relatively high energy density and are known designers. Supercapacitors features allow new approaches to design and open opportunities to develop a new structure of system thrust is aimed at increasing performance, efficiency and decrease pollution. In the drive systems that use power from a voltage source variable supercapacitors can be used both to develop the power necessary to start and to recover braking energy. These systems can be completely electric (tram, trolley, etc.) or using combustion engines. The energy that is generated from vehicle braking is captured by the vehicle battery and supercapacitor is then used to start or various braking systems: electromagnetic skates, pneumatic systems, etc. Supercapacitors integrates traction system by means of static power converters.
