This study uses rayon woven fabrics as the raw material for activated carbon fabrics (ACFs), which were manufactured by oxidation, carbonization and activation engineering in a continuous semi-open high-temperature furnace. First, the activated carbon fabrics are prepared under two specific manufacturing conditions with different production rates and flow rates of steam activation at 1000 °C. Then the electrochemical prosperities of the ACFs are evaluated by a three-electrode device. The experimental results show that the BET specific surface area and electrical capacitance are higher with a lower production rate. Moreover, the steam activator higher flow rate under the proposed approach. ACFs with a 2332.1 m2/g specific surface area and 78.7 % mesopore ratio result in a higher electronic conductivity of 430.4 F/g at the low rate charge (5 mV/s) and with 60 % capacitance retention during the high-speed charging-discharging process (100 mV/s). © 2014 The Korean Fiber Society and Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.
