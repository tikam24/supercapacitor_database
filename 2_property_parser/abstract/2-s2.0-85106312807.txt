The development of new and especially safer electrolytes is an important task in the development of modern electrochemical energy storage devices. One promising approach to reach this goal is the deployment of ionic liquids as electrolyte. In this review-perspective article we are considering protic ionic liquids (PILs) and we are critically comparing their characteristics, syntheses as well as benefits and drawbacks to the more prominent aprotic ionic liquids. Furthermore, we analyzed in detail the use of PILs as electrolytes in supercapacitor as well as battery. In the last part of the manuscript an outlook regarding the challenges of improving and expanding the use of PILs as electrolytes in energy storage devices, including established and prospective systems and materials, is given.
