Sm-doped Ni-Al layered double hydroxides (LDHs) were successfully prepared via hydrothermal-assisted coprecipitation method. The structure and surface morphology of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The electrochemical performance of the samples as prepared was measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). These results show that Sm-doped Ni-Al LDH exhibit higher specific capacitance 2177 F·g-1at a current density of 1 A·g-1, compared with pure Ni-Al LDH with a specific capacitance 1312 F·g-1at same current density.
