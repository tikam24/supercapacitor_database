The proceedings contain 19 papers. The topics discussed include: new way for concealed object detection using passive THz images without their viewing; Millimeter waves sensor modeling and simulation; modulation and frequency response of GDDs in the millimeter wave/THz region; high frequency resonant tunneling diode oscillator with high output power; terahertz modulation using a bandpass filter combined with a graphene supercapacitor; bolometric kinetic inductance detector technology for submillimeter radiometric imaging; comparison of objects detection capabilities in LWIR and THz ranges; textile influence on remote identification of explosives in the THz range; channel calibration for digital array radar in the presence of amplitude-phase and mutual coupling errors; and spatio-spectral characteristics of THz radiation from two-color femtosecond filament.
