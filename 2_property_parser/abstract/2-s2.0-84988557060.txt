The ordered arrays of nanostructure with vertically aligned tube like structure hold great promise as an electrode material for high-performance energy storage devices. Such binder-free structure of Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been synthesized by anodization of titanium (Ti) foil. The use of TiO2 nanotube as an electrode material attain a specific capacitance of 207 F g− 1 at 5 mV s− 1 scan rate in 1 M potassium hydroxide (KOH) electrolyte. Extra ordinary cycling performance with 103% capacitance retention of their initial capacitance for 1500 cycles has been achieved, suggests its promising candidate as highly stable electrode material for supercapacitor application.
