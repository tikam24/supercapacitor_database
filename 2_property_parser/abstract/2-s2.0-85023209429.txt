On the basis of a recent report by Deng et al. in Nature Communications, we have identified the origin of the quite different behaviors of isostructural Ni(OH)2 and Co(OH)2 as electrodes of a hybrid supercapacitor to be a different orientation of the crystal c axis in relation to the short dimension of platelet particles. We suggest that the favorable ordering in Co(OH)2, but not in Ni(OH)2, could be stabilized by a 3d orbital ordering that removes an orbital degeneracy of the octahedral-site Co2+ ions.
