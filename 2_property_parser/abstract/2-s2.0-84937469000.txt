We demonstrate an on-chip concept of the energy storage integrated with crystalline silicon solar cells using a laser scribed graphene oxide film, which can lead to the miniaturization in size and the minimization in cost of optoelectronic devices. The integrated solar supercapacitor with 62% columbic efficiency is directly written on the reverse side of solar cell without any loss in the solar cell performance. The energy and power density of the obtained energy storage devices are comparable to those of electrolytic capacitors even after a number of charging-discharging measurements.
