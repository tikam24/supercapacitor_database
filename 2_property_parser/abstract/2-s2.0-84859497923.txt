The PANI/CNTs composite material was prepared through emulsion polymerization, and then the product had been modified by the induction-coupled oxygen plasma to get the electrode material for supercapacitor. The influences of the modification time on the electrode material surface property and its electrochemical properties were investigated. Based on the analysis of the SEM and FTIR, the results revealed that the particle size of the composite material become smaller and less aggregation of the particles were obtained, and some active fuctional groups were introduced. The electrochemical tests demonstrate that the PANI/ CNTs composite material modified by the oxygen plasma after 10 min has perfect supercapacitive properties, the specific capacitance is 287.8 F-g-1, which is 1.7 times before the modification. Meanwhile its equivalent series resistance (ESR) decreased by 67.7%. The PANI/CNTs composited material modified by the oxygen plasma is an excellent electrode material for the supercapacitor. It also reveals that the oxygen plasma modification is an efficient method for the preparation of electrode material.
