Low-cost and ecofriendly porous biocarbons were fabricated from konjaku flour via precarbonization and potassium hydroxide (KOH) activation. The obtained biocarbon ACK-5 derived from a precarbonized carbon/potassium hydroxide (KOH) mass ratio of 1:5 possessed an ultrahigh specific surface area of 1403 m2 g-1 and hierarchical porous structures with the existence of micro- to macropores. When ACK-5 was employed as a supercapacitor electrode in 6 M KOH, it showed a high specific capacitance of 216 F g-1 and excellent cycling stability with capacitance retention remaining 93.7% after 5000 cycles. Moreover, the ACK-5 sample acquired a supramaximal specific capacitance of 609 F g-1, and the high energy density of ACK-5//ACK-5 symmetrical cells reached up to 9.2 Wh kg-1 when p-phenylenediamine serving as a redox electrolyte was added into KOH electrolyte. The reported simple fabrication strategy would leverage a green biomass precursor for the preparation of supercapacitors.
