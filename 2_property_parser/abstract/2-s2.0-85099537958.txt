The paper has introduced a cost effective design of supercapacitor for satellite applications. The design and implementation of supercapacitors that has made use of DVCCTA in a cost effective manner demonstrates that the designed system can effectively function as a hybrid system of super capacitor along with battery and can increase the satellite life. The DVCCTA supercapacitor and the designed system found to be at least 4.5 times cheaper than the EDLC based design also offers enhanced capacitance. The results can support in enhancing the longevity of satellites.
