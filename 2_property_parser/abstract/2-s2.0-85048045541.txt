Micro-grids have been one of the principle ways of meeting the new electricity demand in rural areas and issues already existing in the system due to the ever increasing penetration of renewable energy sources(RES) in the generation share. The challenges we face in Micro-grids due to these RES is probably not new since they also then to happen with Nonrenewable resources however the issue is the frequency of these outages or less production of power because of the intermittent nature of these RES. In this paper we will see one such issue where the power dips suddenly due to fault or decrease in generation and how supercapacitor(SC) helps in managing a constant voltage profile by supplying the necessary reactive power to the system. The simulation performed on LTSpice software doesn't consider the reason behind this decrease in power supply rather focuses only on the effect of mitigation on the voltage and power profile. The simulation results clearly show the effectiveness of using SC to take in the effects of sudden decrease in voltage which in a system purely made up of battery might have damaged the battery and also the it shows the speed at which SC can help in discharging power when needed and thus preventing unnecessary tripping of breakers or damage of electrical devices due to such voltage sags. Although a combination of battery and SC is the most ideal way of dealing with such issues of by utilizing the benefits which they give individually however in this paper only the effect of SC based system has been considered since the main aim of the paper is to show the suitability of SC in Micro-grids.
