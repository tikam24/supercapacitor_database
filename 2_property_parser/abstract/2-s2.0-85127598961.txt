Abstract: A hybrid (Reduced Graphene Oxide) RGO+ nano-WO3 flexible electrode on carbon cloth substrate has been designed for application as flexible supercapacitor electrode. The electrode has been designed by electrochemically reducing the graphene oxide onto a hydrothermally deposited nano-WO3 on flexible carbon cloth electrode for this purpose. The electrode exhibits an enhanced supercapacitor behaviour in comparison with nano-WO3 alone electrode. The hybrid RGO+ nano-WO3 electrode shows areal capacitance of approximately 200 mF/cm2, which is more than three times the value obtained from nano-WO3 (63 mF/cm 2) only. It also displays superior stability of 500 cycles while the stability of nano-WO3 is limited up to 250 cyclic voltammogram cycles. Performance of the RGO+ nano-WO3 flexible electrode is enhanced due to the fact that it has an increased surface area (nearly twice as compare to nano-WO3 only) because of incorporation of RGO to form a hybrid electrode.
