In this paper, one modified electrostatic self-assembly strategy was proposed to achieve new ternary three-dimensional (3D) graphene-based aerogel composite for smart supercapacitor (SC) candidates, where graphitic-C3N4 (g-C3N4) was selected as a component of increasing the electrochemical active center. Herein, the precursor RuO2/g-C3N4@graphene oxide was prepared by protonized g-C3N4, positively charged RuO2 colloid nanoparticles (NPs), and negatively charged graphene oxide (GO), which was subsequently transformed to the designed 3D RuO2/g-C3N4@reduced graphene oxide (rGO) aerogel composite (RCGA) via simple hydrothermal and lyophilization processes. In the electrochemical study, RCGA exhibited superior capacitive performance with a high specific capacitance of 704.3 F g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1 and excellent performance. Superior performance also was obtained in the asymmetric device. These results highlight the potential applications of this facile strategy in fabricating N-doped 3D rGO aerogel composite for high-performance SC.
