A successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method at room temperature is used to fabricate nickel sulphide-nickel hydroxide composite (NSH) layers on nickel foam electrode for asymmetrical supercapacitor applications. Electrode preparation by this method excludes the use of a binder, which normally dampers the electrochemical behaviour due to its inherent insulating property. The composite coated nickel foam (NF) substrate delivers a specific capacity of 108 C/g at 3 A/g in a three-electrode system. Electrodes show good stability even at a high current density of 50 A/g in a potential window of 0.65 V. The co-existence of nickel sulphide and nickel hydroxide in the composite contributes to the excellent electrochemical behaviour. An asymmetrical supercapacitor (ASC) device NSH// KOH// MAC is constructed with NSH as the positive electrode, modified activated carbon (MAC) as the negative electrode, and KOH soaked Whatman filter paper as the separator. The ASC delivers a maximum energy and power density of 51 Wh/kg and 18 kW/kg, respectively.
