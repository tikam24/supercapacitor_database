A three-dimensional (3D) flower-like MoS2/Bi2S3 heterojunction is successfully synthesized through a simple one-step hydrothermal route. The special 3D morphology, achieved by assembling 2D MoS2 nanosheets onto 3D Bi2S3 micro-flowers, helps to promote the photogenerated electronâ€“hole separation and the electronic conduction. Thus, the as-prepared MoS2/Bi2S3 heterojunction exhibits a prominent photocatalysis activity and electrochemical performance. Compared with pure Bi2S3 (11.8%) and MoS2 (49.2%), the heterojunction demonstrates the higher percentage of methylene blue degradation (76.2%). The enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the effective separation of the charge carriers between Bi2S3 and MoS2, which is not possible with individual materials. When the MoS2/Bi2S3 heterojunction is tested as a supercapacitor electrode, it shows an optimum capacitance of 100.2 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g, which is about 22-times higher than that of pure Bi2S3 (4.5 F/g). With the key findings, the potential of metal sulfides heterojunction for multifunctional applications is highly expected.
