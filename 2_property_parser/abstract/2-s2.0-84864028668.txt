A facile approach for the synthetic fabrication of iron oxide (Fe <inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>) particles is presented and their potential application towards energy storage (as an electrode material within a supercapacitor) is explored. The Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> asymmetric supercapacitor is found to deliver a maximum specific capacitance of ∼120 F g<sup>-1</sup> at a current density of 0.1 A g<sup>-1</sup> in an aqueous electrolyte solution (3M KOH) retaining 93.70% of its initial capacity over 1000 cycles. Additionally, an iron based hydrogen superoxide [FeO(OH)] supercapacitor is readily fabricated and is found to exhibit a maximum specific capacitance of ∼400 F g<sup>-1</sup> at a discharge current of 0.1 A g <sup>-1</sup> in a 3M KOH solution. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
