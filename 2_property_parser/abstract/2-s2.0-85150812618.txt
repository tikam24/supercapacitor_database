In this study, solid residues (BR) from the black cumin (Nigella sativa) processing industry, an abundant and sustainable raw material, were converted into high surface area mesoporous activated carbon (AC) under optimum production conditions using a single-stage K2CO3 assisted carbonization method. The optimal AC (BRAC) which had the highest BET surface area (2211 m2/g), total pore volume (1.262 cm3/g), and mean pore diameter (2.8 nm) was achieved in the conditions of a K2CO3 impregnation ratio of 1:1, a carbonization temperature of 900 °C, and a carbonization period of 1 h. To test its adsorption performance from the aqueous phase, methylene blue dye, oxytetracycline antibiotic, and lead metal ions were selected as model water pollutants and found to be 714.3, 833.3, and 500.0 mg/g, respectively, at 25 °C Also, the electrode made of BRAC showed electrochemical capacitor performance with a high gravimetric capacitance (210 F/g) and cyclic stability (95 %).
