Biochar is a carbon-rich solid that can be prepared through heat treatment of biomass under an inert atmosphere. In the present work, biochar prepared from different feedstocks, namely, Litchi chinensis (Litchi) seeds, Syzygium cumini (Jamun) seeds, and pine cone, were evaluated for charge storage in the form of supercapacitors. The physicochemical and electrochemical properties of the biochar were highly dependent on the preparation temperature and the choice of feedstock. Among the three feedstocks, Litchi seed-derived biochar showed the highest specific capacitance of 190 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in a symmetric cell configuration. N and O heteroatom functionalities in the Litchi seed-derived biochar, higher specific surface area, and pore volume for electrolyte adsorption were responsible for its superior capacitive performance as compared to Jamun seeds and pine cone biochar.
