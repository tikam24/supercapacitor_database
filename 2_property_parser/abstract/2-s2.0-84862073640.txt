A series of ordered mesoporous carbons used as electrode material for supercapacitor with different surface area and pore size distribution were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method. N 2 adsorption and desorption isotherms, small angel XRD and TEM were used to characterize the pore structure of the ordered mesoporous carbons, and the electrochemical performances of the ordered mesoporous carbon materials were tested in 1M Et 4NBF 4|PC electrolyte. The results show that the BET surface area of the ordered mesoporous carbons increase at first and decrease afterwards with the increase of the amount of the furfuryl alcohol added, and ordered mesoporous carbon with CMK-5 structure was prepared with less amount of the furfuryl alcohol added, whereas that with CMK-3 structure was synthesized with more amount of the furfuryl alcohol added. The results of electrochemical characterization show that the magnitude order of the specific capacitance of the ordered mesoporous carbons is almost in good agreement with that of the BET surface area at the charge-discharge current density of 1m A Â· cm -2. The rate capability of the ordered mesoporous carbon with CMK-3 structure is found to be the best, and it is also better than that of disordered mesoporous carbon.
