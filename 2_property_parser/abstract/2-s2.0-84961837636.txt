A nano-network structure is beneficial in obtaining a high specific surface area, which is important in achieving high specific capacitance and energy density. A low-cost and high-yielding preparation approach of nano-network MnO2/polyaniline (MP) composites with enhanced electrochemical properties was developed. Nano-network MnO2/polyaniline composites were synthesized for supercapacitor electrode materials with a high specific surface area of 480 m2/g which could largely increase the utilization of MnO2 compared with other bulk or low specific surface area MnO2/polyaniline materials. For nano-network MnO2/polyaniline composites, the highest attainable specific capacitance could reach 497 F/g. It also exhibits good cycle stability with the cycle retention of 88.2% after 5000 cycles at 10 A g-1.
