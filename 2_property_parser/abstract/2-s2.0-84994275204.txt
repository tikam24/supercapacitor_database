In this work, hierarchical Carbon sphere@NiMoO4 (C@NiMoO4) composite was successfully synthesized by cost-effective two-step hydrothermal method. The samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis and Thermogravimetric analysis. The Electrochemical measurement demonstrated that hierarchical C@NiMoO4 electrode materials exhibited good specific capacitance (Csp) of 268.8 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 in 2 M NaOH aqueous electrolyte solution, as well as good cycling stability (88.4% retention after 2000 cycles). Compared to pure NiMoO4, the excellent capacitive properties and stability suggest that the hierarchical structure C@NiMoO4 could be promising electroactive material for supercapacitors.
