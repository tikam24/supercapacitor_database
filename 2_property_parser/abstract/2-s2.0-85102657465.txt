Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are expected to be promising pseudocapacitve materials because of their potential redox sites and porous structures. Nevertheless, the conductivity inferiority of MOF strongly decreases their structural advantages, therefore resulting in unsatisfying electrochemical performance. Herein, we propose an efficient strategy to enhance conductivity and thus electrochemical properties, in Ni(OH)2 is electrochemically deposited on carbon nanowalls as the precursor for oriented MOF. The synthesized vertically oriented MOF sheets show an almost triple high capacitance of 677 F g−1 than MOF powder of 239 F g−1 at the current density of 2 A g−1. Correspondingly, an asymmetric supercapacitor is fabricated, which can deliver a maximum energy density of 20.7 Wh kg−1 and a maximum power density of 23 200 W kg−1. These promising results indicate that modulating the conductivity of MOF is the key step to pursuit upgrading electrochemical performance.
