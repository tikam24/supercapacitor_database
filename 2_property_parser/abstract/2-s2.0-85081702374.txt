This paper proposes to consolidate a piezoelectric roadway energy harvesting system and a dynamic wireless charging system to improve the energy autonomy of electric vehicles. A conceptual design of the integrated system is presented and the benefits of the integrated system in enhancing the vehicle energy autonomy are analyzed. By comparing the typical power densities of the energy harvesting and wireless charging systems, this paper shows that the vehicle energy dependence on the power grid can be reduced by approximately 20%. To exploit the benefits of the integrated system, this paper outlines multiple open research and development issues.
