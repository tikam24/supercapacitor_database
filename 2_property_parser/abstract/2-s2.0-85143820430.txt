Activated carbon materials derived from biomass for supercapacitors have received great attention due to their natural abundance and low cost. The agricultural waste walnut green peel can be a promising activated carbon electrode material and resource utilization of it would effectively alleviate the environmental pollution problem. Here we reported the N-doped activated carbon materials (N/ACs) from walnut green peel using melamine as the nitrogen source. N/ACs showed obvious pore structure, high specific surface area, low resistance, and fast charge transfer rate. Thereinto, the optimized N/AC-2 showed the most excellent and better capacitive performance, with the specific capacitance of 304.5 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. N/AC-2 exhibited high energy density (40.05 W h kg−1) and power density (22.5 kW kg−1) as the supercapacitor electrode. In addition, the capacitance retention rate of N/AC-2 remained 95.2% after 3000 cycles at 10 A g−1. Our work demonstrated that the prepared N/ACs would be more promising electrode materials for supercapacitors.
