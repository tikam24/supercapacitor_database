Parameter extraction is important for the safe, reliable and efficient operation of supercapacitor ener-gy storage system. In order to overcome the problems such as complexity, few effective data and difficult online extraction, a parameter extraction method of supercapacitor is proposed by compensating the internal resistance to eliminate the hysteresis difference during balanced charging and discharging process. The method fully uses the physical characteristics that the curves of supercapacitor capacitance vs. terminal vol-tage are not coincident due to the internal resistance voltage drop during the charging and discharging process, so as to accurately extract the parameters from all the data in charging and discharging process, which can effectively eliminate the influence of dynamic process on parameter extraction accuracy. Theoretical analysis and experimental study show that the proposed method can extract the equivalent parameters of supercapacitor under the conditions of different temperatures and currents, providing the effective support for system performance test, optimal control, and efficient operation and maintenance.
