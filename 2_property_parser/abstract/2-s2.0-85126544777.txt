Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) haves been intensively studied as active electrode materials for supercapacitors. However, few studies have been systematically investigated the electrochemical performance of MOFs as electrode materials by adjusting the raw material components and reaction conditions to regulate and control MOFs morphology structures. Herein, a series of nickel/cobalt MOFs (Ni/Co-MOFs) with different morphology structures were synthesized by one-pot solvothermal method via adjusting raw material components and reaction conditions. Results show that three-dimensional (3D) juniperus sabina-like Ni/Co-MOF has optimal electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 982.5 ​F/g at 0.5 A/g. Meanwhile, the asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits the capacitance of 132.0 ​F/g at 0.5 A/g, and the corresponding energy density and power density are 46.9 ​Wh/kg and 400.0 ​W/kg, respectively. The work presents a novel strategy to regulate and control the morphology structures of MOFs by adjusting the raw material components and reaction conditions to achieve the optimal electrochemical performance of MOFs.
