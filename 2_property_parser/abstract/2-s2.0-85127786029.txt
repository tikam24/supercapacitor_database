Many effort has been devoted to develop efficient active (electrode materials, electrolytes etc.) as well as passive (current collector, separator, binder etc.) components for supercapacitor device fabrication. Also, a proper integration of electrodes in a device is needed for improved energy storage performance. Though few works has already been carried out, but still opportunities are there to work in the energy storage systems. In this chapter, summary of the book and scopes to work for betterment of charge storage in supercapacitors has been presented.
