Electrospinning has recognized as the most versatile and adaptable method for the fabrication of nanofibers. Fiber scientists have extensively introduced original solutions for harvesting and storing energy from nanofibers in order to improve storage capacity and environmental impact of electrospun supercapacitors, anodes, and cathodes. Among these efforts, graphene gained significant interests for researchers, a multifaceted molecule possessing many unique and desirable properties such as high strength, flexibility, optical transparency, and conductivity. This makes graphene as superior as to many other nanomaterials like carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and conductive nanometallic particles. The reported properties and applications of this two-dimensional (2D) structure have opened up new opportunities for the lightweight future devices and systems. This review article aims to present an overview of the advancements in graphene-based electrospun conductive nanofibers, supercapacitors, and graphene-based electrospun anodes and cathodes for lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. Details of the electrospinning processes, reduction methods, and electrical properties are discussed to yield insights on how significant improvements can be made in future developments.
