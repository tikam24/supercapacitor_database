Growing MnO2 nanofibers on graphitic hollow carbon spheres (GHCS) is conducted by refluxing GHCS in a KMnO4 aqueous solution aimed to enhance the electrochemically active surface area of MnO2. The stoichiometric redox reaction between GHCS and MnO4- yields GHCS-MnO2 composites with controllable MnO2 content. It is found that these ultrathin MnO2 nanofibers are vertically grown on the external surface of the GHCS, yielding a composite electrode showing good electron transport, rapid ion penetration, fast and reversible Faradic reaction, and excellent rate performance when used as supercapacitor electrode materials. An asymmetric supercapacitor cell with GHCS-MnO2 as the positive electrode and GHCS as the negative electrode can be reversibly charged/discharged at a cell voltage of 2.0 V in a 1.0 mol L-1 Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte, delivering an energy density of 22.1 Wh kg-1 and a power density of 7.0 kW kg-1. The asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits an excellent electrochemical cycling stability with 99% initial capacitance and 90% coulombic efficiency remained after 1000 continuous cycles measured using the galvanostatic charge-discharge technique.
