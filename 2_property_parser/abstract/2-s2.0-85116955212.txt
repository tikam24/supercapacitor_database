Supercapacitors have widely been applied in electric vehicle, rail traffic, new energy, electromagnetic launch and laser weapons owing to their high power density, long cycling life, safety and reliability. However, the active carbon, as key electrodes for supercapacitor, is still imported from Japan and South Korea due to the lack of domestic industrialization, which greatly restricts the development of supercapacitors and their downstream industry. This paper summarized the effect of physical and chemical property of active carbons on its electrochemical performances and the industry status of active carbons for supercapacitors. The heat and mass transfer issues during the productive process that limited the quality of active carbons were also discussed. To better guide the domestic industrialization, it was highly desired to establish the comprehensive index system of active carbon for supercapacitor based on the current technology. Meanwhile, simulation study focused on manufacturing technique and equipment was needed to solve the problems of poor stability and consistency of domestic active carbon, ensuring the independence controllable production of critical materials for supercapacitor industry.
