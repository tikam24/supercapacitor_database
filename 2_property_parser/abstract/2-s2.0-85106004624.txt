The effective incorporation of novel and highly conductive hybrid functional nanomaterials onto flexible and porous substrates is extremely desirable to develop flexible supercapacitors. Herein, a novel 2D/0D-MoS2/SnS2 on a flexible cellulose paper substrate has been demonstrated for its utilization in flexible supercapacitors. The surface morphology and particle size of the MoS2 and SnS2 QDs, elemental composition, absorption spectra, and crystallinity have been analyzed thoroughly. Further, to explore the supercapacitor applications, the electrochemical response has been studied. The obtained results demonstrate that both the pristine MoS2 and MoS2/SnS2 QDs composites on cellulose paper exhibited excellent electrochemical performance. The specific capacitance for the pristine MoS2 and MoS2/SnS2 QDs displayed 422.2 F g-1 and 277.1 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 current density using a conventional two-electrode system. The drop-casting of SnS2 QDs provides better electrochemical active sites, which contributed to the enhanced specific capacitance of the composite structure. Moreover, it is shown that cellulose paper as an electrode material, using MoS2 and MoS2/SnS2 QDs, is applied as a supercapacitor for potential utilization in wearable electronics applications.
