Over the past decade, as a new type of electrochemical energy storage device, supercapacitors with the advantages of high power density and long cyclic stability have received extensive academic and industrial attention. Recently, metal and metal oxide nanoparticles-composited porous carbon as the electrode materials have been developed for high-performance supercapacitors. This article reviews the latest progress in supercapacitors in key performance parameters of the specific capacitance and cyclic stability related to the electrode materials of porous carbon composited with nickel, iron, cobalt, titanium, vanadium, ruthenium, copper, zinc, manganese metals and their oxides. Finally, the prospects and challenges in the design, preparation and structure optimization of metal and metal oxide-based porous carbon electrode materials to enhance the performance of energy storage for supercapacitors are also discussed.
