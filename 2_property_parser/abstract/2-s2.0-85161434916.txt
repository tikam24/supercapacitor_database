The objective of this work was to discuss the energy management system (EMS) and control for hybrid energy storage systems (HESS) that include a fuel cell (FC) and a supercapacitor (SC). To begin with, the recommended additional energy storage devices were simulated and are most likely designed to match the characteristics of FCs. Furthermore, to effectively meet the charging requirements, the behavior of the hybrid electric systems was promoted using fuzzy logic (FLC) as the main controller, focusing on the overall vehicle speed and the state of charge of the supercapacitor (SOC). Furthermore, for smooth implementation and continuous coordination of the hybrid electric system with respect to the output converter, set-point generation, and power supervision, a robust nonlinear control based on backstepping combined with super-twisting sliding mode control was developed. To conclude this study, a numerical simulation was used to compare a typical PI associated with a deterministic rule-based EMS to a backstepping super-twist sliding mode control combined with fuzzy logic in the extra-urban driving cycle test scenario applied to FC electric vehicles. The analysis showed that the proposed control reduces the hydrogen consumption of the FC while maintaining the excellent state of charge of the supercapacitor.
