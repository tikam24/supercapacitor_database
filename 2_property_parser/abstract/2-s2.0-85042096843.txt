Supercapacitors (SCs), also named as electrochemical capacitors (ECs), have received much attention as one of the most significant energy storage devices with the rate of fast charge/discharge speed and non-pollution. In this work, the α-MoO3 was synthesized by a simple electrospinning technique, and α-MoO3/MnO2 composite materials were synthesized by using a facile water bath method, where the MnO2 microspheres grew uniformly around α-MoO3 microchips. Morphology and structure of the samples are evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. Furthermore, the electrochemical properties of the samples were elucidated by cyclic voltammograms (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 1 M NaOH electrolyte. The electrochemical results demonstrated that α-MoO3 and α-MoO3/MnO2 composite materials exhibited specific capacitance of 76F/g and 109 F/g respectively at common scan rate of 10mv/s. The enhanced electrochemical behaviors could be ascribed to rational design of MnO2 microspheres adhering on α-MoO3 microchips, which supplies more pathways for accelerating fast electron and ion transfer by the synergistic effect of two electroactive materials. Indeed, these remarkable findings will enable low-cost α-MoO3/MnO2 attractive for high-performance supercapacitors.
