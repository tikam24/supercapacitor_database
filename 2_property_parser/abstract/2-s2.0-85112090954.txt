One-dimensional iron hydroxide@cadmium hydroxide nanostructures have been prepared by sequentially converting cadmium hydroxide into iron hydroxide via simple and cost-effective cation exchange reaction based on solubility product to design electrochemical supercapacitive electrode. Surface architecture of iron hydroxide@cadmium hydroxide nanostructures in the form of core–shell enables easy and effective electrochemical reactions which have been studied via electrochemical cyclic voltammetry and charge–discharge studies. Interestingly, iron hydroxide@cadmium hydroxide electrode exhibits specific capacitance of 368 F g−1 at current density of 0.5 A g−1 along with electrochemical impedance analysis. Capacitance retention performed at the scan rate of 50 mV s−1 for 5000 cycles results in 52% capacity of its initial.
