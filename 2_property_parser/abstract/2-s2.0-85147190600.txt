Simultaneous rare-earth doping at A and B sites have impacted various properties of BFO at room temperature. In this work, the dielectric and magnetic properties of BFO, are tailored by doping La and Se. Bi0.92La0.08Fe1âˆ’xSexO3, (x = 0%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 100%) nanostructures are prepared using sol-gel technique. Structural analysis reveals that increased doping has reduced and eliminated the secondary phases of nanostructures. Absorption spectra showed a wide blue shifted absorption, indicating multiple electron transitions and the bandgap values decreased upon doping. Improved room temperature dielectric properties with increased doping indicates these nanostructures as viable candidates in energy storage applications. The improvements in ac-conductivity, impedance and modulus spectrum of doped nanostructures are observed. Specific capacitance of 36.22 F/g for Bi0.92La0.08Fe1O3 at 10 mV/s and 21.48F/g for the Bi0.92La0.08Fe0.9Se0.1O3 sample was observed. Weak ferromagnetism is observed in M-H loops with increased Se concentration that also finds applications in magnetic storage devices.
