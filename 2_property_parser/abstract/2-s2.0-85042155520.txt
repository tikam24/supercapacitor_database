Transition metal sulfides, as an important class of inorganics, can be used as excellent electrode materials for various types of electrochemical energy storage, such as lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, supercapacitors, and others. Recent works have identified that mixing graphene or graphene derivatives with transition metal sulfides can result in novel composites with better electrochemical performance. This review summarizes the latest advances in transition metal sulfide composites with graphene or graphene derivatives. The synthetic strategies and morphologies of these composites are introduced. The authors then discuss their applications in lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and supercapacitors. Finally, the authors give their personal viewpoints about the challenges and opportunities for the future development about this direction.
