A novel approach for hierarchically porous S-doped carbon was developed. Owing to the obviously reduced particle size and greatly enhanced meso-/macropores, electronic conductivity and surface polarity as well as the active sites available for Faradaic reactions, the resultant S-doped carbon electrode shows an excellent supercapacitor performance.
