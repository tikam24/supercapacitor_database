Among the various active materials, nickel hydroxide is one of the most promising pseudocapacitive materials; however, its electrochemical performance is restricted because of its low conductivity, inadequate structure, and weak stability. In this study, we have indicated that the pseudocapacitive performance of a Ni(OH)2 electrode could be considerably increased by GO compositing with the uniform nanostructure due to shortened ion diffusion paths and preventing interface resistance. Ni(OH)2 nanoplatelets with β-phase structure were obtained using chemical deposition. By using x-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and field-emission scanning electron microscopy, the morphology and structure of the nanoplatelets of the electrode were investigated. The as-prepared Ni(OH)2/GO electrode, as a pseudocapacitor electrode, exhibited a great specific capacitance of 1027 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, and a perfect cycling stability of 92.3% after 1000 cycles. This work provides an efficient and effective way to manufacture an electrode material for energy storage devices and especially for high-performance supercapacitors.
