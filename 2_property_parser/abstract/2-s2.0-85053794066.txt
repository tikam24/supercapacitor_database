Electrode material is the key component of a supercapacitor, the highly accessible surface area, efficient electrons/ions migration channels, robust structural stability and redox activity of electrode material are pivotal prerequisites for harvesting optimal capacitive performance. Herein, a ternary cobalt hydroxide carbonate-nickle hydroxide-reduced graphene oxide composite (CN-rGO) with porous nanowire arrays architecture was deposited onto Ni foam substrate through confined hydrothermal reaction directed by surfactant micelles. The as-prepared CN-rGO nanowire arrays exhibit mesoporous texture with high specific surface area, which allows sufficient soaking of electrolyte with short diffusion path length. Additionally, the vertically aligned nanowires with incorporation of reduced graphene oxide offer efficient channels for migration of electrons generated by faradic components. Both features enable the sufficient faradic reactions and charge storage of the CN-rGO electrode. Under optimal Co:Ni feeding molar ratio of 7:3, the battery typed faradic CN-rGO electrode offers superior specific capacitance (2442 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), good rate capability (65% capacitance retaining ratio within 1–20 A g−1) and cycling stability (70% maintaining ratio after 2000 charge-discharge cycles). When used as faradic electrode of hybrid supercapacitor (HSC), balanced energy density (42.9–26.2 Wh kg−1), power density (393–3519 W kg−1) and cycleability (80% initial capacitance maintaining ratio undergoes 5000 charge-discharge cycles) can be delivered simultaneously, highlighting the potential of the micelles directed CN-rGO nanowire arrays electrode in efficient energy storage device.
