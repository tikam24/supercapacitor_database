It is a highly desirable but still a challenging task to find a simple, fast and straightforward method to greatly improve the electrochemical properties of a Co 3 O 4 electrode for pseudocapacitors. In this study, we demonstrate that developing an amorphous Co-phosphate (Co-Pi) shell via in situ surface derivatization on a Co 3 O 4 nanowire (NW) surface facilitates the diffusion and reaction of electrolyte ions and leads to distinctive conductivity. Because of these advantages, 1D nanostructures and the synergistic effect between Co 3 O 4 and amorphous Co-Pi, the resulting core-shell Co 3 O 4 @Co-Pi nanowire (NW) array exhibits high capacitance (1692 F g -1 at current density of 1 A g -1 ). In addition, high rate capabilities and retention capacity of 86% after 6000 cycles at 20 A g -1 are achieved. By using the Co 3 O 4 @Co-Pi core-shell hybrid NW array and activated carbon as the anode and cathode, respectively, asymmetric pseudocapacitors are assembled that exhibit high capacitance (energy density of 35.69 W h kg -1 at power density of 558 W kg -1 ) and super-long cycle life (82% capacitance retention after 40 000 cycles). Our synthesis method provides a new technology for the design of composites of transition metal oxides/hydroxides and phosphates for electrochemical energy storage applications.
