Herein, we are reporting a rapid one-pot synthesis of MoS2-decorated laser-induced graphene (MoS2-LIG) by direct writing of polyimide foils. By covering the polymer surface with a layer of MoS2 dispersion before processing, it is possible to obtain an in situ decoration of a porous graphene network during laser writing. The resulting material is a three-dimensional arrangement of agglomerated and wrinkled graphene flakes decorated by MoS2 nanosheets with good electrical properties and high surface area, suitable to be employed as electrodes for supercapacitors, enabling both electric double-layer and pseudo-capacitance behaviors. A deep investigation of the material properties has been performed to understand the chemical and physical characteristics of the hybrid MoS2-graphene-like material. Symmetric supercapacitors have been assembled in planar configuration exploiting the polymeric electrolyte; the resulting performances of the here-proposed material allow the prediction of the enormous potentialities of these flexible energy-storage devices for industrial-scale production.
