Abstract: Assemblies of colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are attractive for a broad range of applications because of the ability to exploit the quantum confinement effect and the large surface-to-volume ratio due to their small dimensions. Each application requires different types of assemblies based on which properties are intended to be utilized. Greater control of assembly formation and optimization of the related carrier transport characteristics are vital to advance the utilization of these materials. Here, we demonstrate on-demand control of the assembly morphology and electrical properties of highly crosslinked CQD solids through the augmentation of various assembly methods. Employment of electric-double-layer (EDL) gating on these assembly structures (i.e., an amorphous assembly, a hierarchical porous assembly, and a compact superlattice assembly) reveals their intrinsic carrier transport and accumulation characteristics. Demonstrations of high electron mobility with a high current modulation ratio reaching 105 in compact QD films and of a record-high areal capacitance of 400 Î¼F/cm2 in an electric-double-layer supercapacitor with very thin (<100 nm) QD hierarchical porous assemblies signify the versatility of CQDs as building blocks for various modern electronic devices.
