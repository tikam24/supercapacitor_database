A simple hydrothermal process for fabrication of a nanocomposite comprising Fe2O3 anchored on three-dimensional (3D) reduced graphene oxide aerogel (rGOA) was developed by using Fe(NO3)3 and graphene oxide (GO) as precursors and urea as precipitation agent. The morphology and structure of the Fe2O3/reduced graphene oxide aerogel (Fe2O3/rGOA) composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and Raman spectroscopy. An interconnected 3D network structure, which can allow rapid electrolyte ions diffusion and fast electron transport, was formed by the self-assembly of graphene oxide sheets decorated with Fe2O3 nanoparticles. The particle sizes of Fe2O3 ranged from 30 to 50 nm and were hardly affected by the amount of Fe2O3 loaded into rGOA. The electrochemical properties of the Fe2O3/rGOA composites were studied using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurement by a three-electrode system. The as-prepared Fe2O3/rGOA composites exhibited a specific capacitance as high as 522 F g-1 at 20 A g-1 within the operated voltage window (-1.1 to 0.3 V). The excellent electrochemical performance of Fe2O3/rGOA was interpreted to be due to the synergistic effect of Fe2O3 particles and rGOA.
