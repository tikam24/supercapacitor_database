The research on supercapacitors (SCs) is one of the hot topics in the field of energy storage, and the intrinsic ageing mechanism of SCs is significant from both the economic and the scientific point of view. In this paper, the negative effects of decay of the key structural components on ageing of SCs were investigated by factorial design and analysis of variance (ANOVA). The ANOVA results showed that the degree of the negative influence on ageing of SCs could be ranked in descending order as anode > separator > cathode. The ageing would be accelerated due to the interaction between the electrode and separator, especially at a high charge-discharge current density. Further, the intrinsic chemical ageing mechanism of SCs was revealed by the morphology, microstructure, and chemical composition analyses of the fresh and aged key components (the electrode carbon materials, current collectors, and separators) with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), etc. Moreover, the minimum pore width of electrode carbon materials suitable for electrolyte ion diffusion was obtained by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which corroborated the assumption that the pore structure deterioration was one of the direct causes of capacitance loss for aged SCs. Generally, the ageing mechanism of key components of SCs could be a reference to develop advanced electrode materials and separators for SCs.
