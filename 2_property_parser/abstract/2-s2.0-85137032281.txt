High-efficiency electrocatalysts are required for the hydrogen evolution reaction processes used in clean-energy applications. Single-component materials have limited physicochemical properties and do not meet the requirements of high-performance material applications. More complex materials must therefore be developed for these purposes. This study involves growing flower cluster-like NiMoO4 nanorod arrays on reduced graphene oxide-modified nickel foam (NF/rGO) substrates by a simple two-step hydrothermal method, followed by NiMoO4 nanorod modification with Co3S4 nanoparticles, to achieve an efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) strategy for NF/rGO/NiMoO4 @Co3S4 core-shell structure composite catalysts. The proposed vertically aligned NiMoO4 nanorods served as the core framework, providing abundant specific surface area and fast charge transfer channels. The Co3S4 particles grown on the NiMoO4 nanorods provided sufficient electrochemical active sites for full contact with the electrolyte solution. In the 1.0 M KOH solution, the NF/rGO/NiMoO4 @Co3S4 core-shell structure exhibited a low overpotential of 40 mV for HER at a current density of 10 mA cmâˆ’2. These properties indicate that the proposed material could be used in HER processes in energy applications.
