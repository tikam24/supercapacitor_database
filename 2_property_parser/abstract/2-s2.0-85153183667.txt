Porous materials with multiple hierarchy levels can be useful as lightweight engineering structures, biomedical implants, flexible functional devices, and thermal insulators. Numerous routes have integrated bottom-up and top-down approaches for the generation of engineering materials with lightweight nature, complex structures, and excellent mechanical properties. It nonetheless remains challenging to generate ultralight porous materials with hierarchical architectures and multi-functionality. Here, the combined strategy based on Pickering emulsions and additive manufacturing leads to the development of ultralight conducting polymer foams with hierarchical pores and multifunctional performance. Direct writing of the emulsified inks consisting of the nano-oxidant—hydrated vanadium pentoxide nanowires—generated free-standing scaffolds, which are stabilized by the interfacial organization of the nanowires into network structures. The following in situ oxidative polymerization transforms the nano-oxidant scaffolds into foams consisting of a typical conducting polymer—polyaniline. The lightweight polyaniline foams featured by hierarchical pores and high surface areas show excellent performances in the applications of supercapacitor electrodes, planar micro-supercapacitors, and gas sensors. This emerging technology demonstrates the great potential of a combination of additive manufacturing with complex fluids for the generation of functional solids with lightweight nature and adjustable structure-function relationships.
