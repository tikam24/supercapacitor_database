Vertically-aligned Co(OH)2 nanosheets were cathodically electrodeposited on a piece of gold coated polyethylene terephthalate (Au-PET) as an electrode material for supercapacitor. The Co(OH)2 electrode showed a high capacitance of 2695 F g-1 at 8 A g-1 in 1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. Besides, the films were employed to assemble symmetric all-solid-state supercapacitors with PVA/LiCl gel served as solid electrolyte. The device exhibits an areal capacitance of 50.5 μF cm-2 at the current density of 2 μA cm-2 accompanied by excellent cycle stability.
