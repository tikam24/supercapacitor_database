Sulfonated aramid (SA) fiber modified graphene nanoplatelet (GnP) paper was fabricated employing simple vacuum filtration technique. The SA macromolecules were noncovalently attached on the surface of GnP through π−π interactions. Robustness of the film was characterized via dynamic mechanical analysis study. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was employed to investigate the extent of surface functionalization. The specific capacitance of 166 F/g was obtained for the sulfonated graphene nanoplatelet composite paper with 97% of specific capacitance retained after 1000 cycles establishing the cyclic stability of the said composite paper. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
