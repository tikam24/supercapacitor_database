Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is one of the versatile commercially important acrylic polymers. It is a well-known polymer due to its enhanced mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties. Various nanofillers have been incorporated in PAN to significantly improve the mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of resulting nanocomposite. This review comprehends efforts devoted to PAN-based nanocomposite reinforced with carbon nanotube, graphene, and graphene oxide. The interaction between PAN and carbon nanostructure has been concentrated to develop high-performance nanocomposite. The scientific and technological development in the field of PAN/carbon nanofiller nanocomposite particularly in membranes, biosensor, lithiumâ€“sulfur batteries, supercapacitor, and photocatalysts has also been expressed. Moreover, future prospects in scientific and technological disciplines have been addressed.
