A hydroquinone mediated PVA-H2SO4 gel electrolyte (PHHQ) and activated carbon from bio-waste were prepared for supercapacitor fabrication. PHHQ delivered a higher capacitance (941 F g-1 at 1 mA cm-2) and energy density (20 Wh kg-1 at 0.33 W g -1) than the PVA-H2SO4 gel electrolyte (425 F g-1 at 1 mA cm-2, 9 Wh kg-1 at 0.33 W g -1).
