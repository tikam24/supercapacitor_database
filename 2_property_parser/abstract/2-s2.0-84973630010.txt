We study the synthesis and electrochemical performance of molecular precursor-derived ceramic (PDC)/carbon nanotube-embedded graphene self-supporting composite papers as Li-ion battery and supercapacitor electrodes. The composite papers are prepared using vacuum filtration of PDC-graphene oxide (GO) dispersion, followed by thermal reduction at 500 Â°C. Tested as a Li-ion battery electrode, the composite papers deliver a reversible capacity as high as 300 mA h g-1 (normalized with respect to total mass of the electrode) with negligible capacity loss after 1000 charge/discharge cycles. Boron-doped silicon carbon nitride (Si(B)CN) outperforms its undoped counterpart (SiCN) in terms of rate capability, cyclic stability, and coulombic efficiency. Among the PDC materials analyzed, Si(B)CN-CNT-rGO demonstrates the lowest ohmic resistance and highest specific capacitance of approximately 269.52 F g-1 at a current density of 5 A g-1, making it a promising electrode material for electrochemical energy storage applications.
