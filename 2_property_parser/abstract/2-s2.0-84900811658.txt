We report a novel RuO2-NPG//Co(OH)2-NPG asymmetric supercapacitor with a high specific capacitance and a wide potential window in which bifunctional nanoporous gold is used as both the highly conductive supports of the pseudocapacitive oxides and the 3D current collectors in the device. The RuO2-NPG and Co(OH)2-NPG electrodes can reach specific capacitances of 1300 F g-1 and 1800 F g-1, respectively, which provide comparatively high specific capacitances in relation to metal oxide/carbon electrodes, giving rise to an asymmetric oxide pseudocapacitor with a large capacitance of ∼350 F g-1, high working voltage of 1.6 V and an ultrahigh energy density of ∼120 W h kg -1. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.
