The sole aim of the present article was to develop a highly efficient electrochemical double-layer capacitor (EDLC) using a solid polymer electrolyte. Solution cast technique was adopted to fabricate an efficient EDLC. Solid biopolymer electrolytes were synthesized based on corn starch as a host polymer and sodium chloride as well as ionic liquid (1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide) as dopants. The ionic conductivity of present system has been carried out using impedance spectroscopy. Detailed electrical, structural and thermal studies of polymer electrolytes have been carried out. An efficient EDLC has been fabricated using carbon-based electrodes and maximum conducting biopolymer electrolyte which shows promising result.
