The aim of this work is a behavioral study of the supercapacitors modules under conditions similar to an industrial application. In this article, the test bench used to study this problem is presented with its main characteristics. Then a cycling process is proposed and results are presented. These results show the great dependence between the temperature of each element and the voltage dispersion.
