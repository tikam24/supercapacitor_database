Nanostructured NiCo2S4 films on Ni foams were successfully synthesized through a facile method, involving hydrothermal growth of NiCo-precursor and subsequent sulfidation process of NiCo2S4. The influence of different surfactants were investigated, including morphology, phase structure and electrochemical performance of NiCo2S4 electrodes. With the addition of surfactants during the hydrothermal processes, the nanostructured NiCo2S4 self-organized and agglomerated into nanosheets, showing outstanding influence on the morphology by the surfactants. Among these electrodes, the NiCo2S4 electrode modified with SDS exhibited an optimal capacitance of 2893 F/g at 0.5 A/g, a superior rate capability of 1890.6 F/g even at 10 A/g, and good cycling stability of 96.1% over 1000 cycles. These results indicate that nanosheet NiCo2S4 would be promising electrode materials for supercapacitor applications.
