Novel VOx nanomaterials as high performance electrode materials of supercapacitors were successfully synthesized by solvothermal method using V2O5, H2O2, (NH4)2SO4 and EG (Ethylene Glycol). These as-prepared nanomaterials are hierarchical microspheres with diameter of~5 Î¼m, which formed from hyperbranched growth of nanoribbons. According to XRD and TEM, these hierarchical VOx microspheres consist of V6O13 with metallic conductivity and VO2. These materials exhibited a tremendous specific capacitance of 581 F/g, with corresponding volumetric specific capacitance of 3.94 F/cm3, at 0.6 A/g in the potential range of 0 to 1.2 V when used as supercapacitor electrodes in a solution of 1 M LiNO3. The energy density is as high as 29 Wh/kg, which is much higher than those of many other symmetrical supercapacitors. In addition, the capacity retention of 65% was achieved even after 2000 cycles, demonstrating high performance of vanadium oxide nanomaterials used in supercapacitors.
