We report a novel method to prepare working electrode (Manganese oxide (MnO2)/solar exfoliated graphene (SEG) composite) for supercapacitor application. This working electrode was prepared by making composite of ionic liquid functionalized MnO2 over SEG. Cyclic Voltammetry and Galvanostatic charge–discharge studies were carried out to analyse the electrochemical performance of MnO2/SEG composites. The synergistic effect of the MnO2:SEG (1:3) composite exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with specific capacitance of 745 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1 and good cycling stability retaining 97% of its initial capacitance even after 1000 cycles. To compare the electrochemical performance of MnO2/SEG, Mn3O4/graphene oxide (GO) composite was prepared by in-situ and chemical reduction method. The strategic synthetic design of hybrid nanocomposites using SEG showed higher capacitance than Mn3O4/GO composite. This simple, scalable, environment friendly approach to prepare graphene by solar exfoliation method and making composite with metal oxide (MO) in suitable ratio could open up new opportunities for next generation energy storage systems.
