This paper presents an energy management method in an electrical hybrid power source (EHPS) for electric vehicular applications. The method is based on the flatness control technique (FCT) and fuzzy logic control (FLC). This EHPS is composed of a fuel cell system as the main source and two energy storage sources (ESSs)a bank of supercapacitors (SCs) and a bank of batteries (BATs)as the auxiliary source. With this hybridization, the volume and mass of the EHPS can be reduced, because the high energy density of BAT and high power density of SC are utilized. In the proposed novel control strategy, the FCT is used to manage the energy between the main and the auxiliary sources, and the FLC is employed to share the power flow in the ESS between the SC and the BAT. The power sharing depends on the load power and the state of charge of the SC and the BAT. EHPS is controlled by the regulation of the stored electrostatic energy in the dc buses. The main property of this strategy is that the energy management in the power source is carried out with a single general control algorithm in different operating modes, consequently avoiding any algorithm commutation. An EHPS test bench has been assembled and equipped with a real-time system controller based on a dSPACE. The experimental results validate the efficiency of the proposed control strategy.
