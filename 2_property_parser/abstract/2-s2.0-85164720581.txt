NiCo2O4/NiMoO4 hierarchical composite structure is used for high-performance supercapacitors electrode materials. The electrode material is grown directly on the conductive carbon cloth, which effectively reduces the contact resistance between the collector and the active material, and provides a favorable skeleton structure for NiCo2O4/NiMoO4. In this work, NiCo2O4/NiMoO4 electrodes were prepared under optimal conditions of primary hydrothermal time of 12 h, annealing temperature of 350 °C, and secondary hydrothermal time of 8 h. The optimized hierarchical NiCo2O4/NiMoO4 electrode exhibits a high areal capacitance of 3.85 F·cm−2 (at a current density of 4 mA·cm−2) and better cycle stability than the NiCo2O4 and NiMoO4 electrode, respectively. The constructed asymmetric supercapacitor NiCo2O4/NiMoO4//AC has a satisfactory energy density of 38.69 Wh·kg−1 at 228.56 W·kg−1 power density. At the current density of 4 mA·cm−2, ASC devices still have a capacity retention rate of 90.88% after 5000 cycles, indicating their potential application in energy storage devices.
