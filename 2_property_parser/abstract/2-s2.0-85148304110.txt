It is very important to develop electrode materials with good mechanical flexibility and excellent electrochemical performance to adapt to the development of flexible electronic devices, and the preparation of non-binder flexible electrode is a good strategy. In this work, nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNT) were grown in situ on the surface of carbon cloth (CC) by a simple method and directly used as binder-free electrodes for supercapacitors. The electrochemical tests show that the electrode can achieve an areal capacitance of 4081.6 mF/cm2 when the ampere density is set at 2mA/cm2, and when the ampere density is promoted 10 times to 20mA/cm2, this electrode can still retain 72.8% of the areal capacitance at 2mA/cm2. The flexible electrode can also retain 90.3% of an areal capacitance after 5000 recharge/discharge cycles at a set ampere density of 10 mA/cm2 and 97.6% of its areal capacitance after 50 bending cycles. The electrode was assembled into a symmetrical supercapacitor for electrochemical performance testing, and an areal capacitance of 572.6 mF/cm2 can be maintained when the ampere density is set at 2 mA/cm2, and an energy density of 79.53 and 40.28 µWh/cm2 at a power density of 1000 and 10,000µW/cm2, separately. The excellent electrochemical performance is mainly attributed to the following three points: (1) No binder is used to avoid the problems that affect the conductivity and utilization rate of active substances caused by the binder. (2) The electrode material has a large specific surface area and has more active sites for electrochemical reaction. (3) The presence of N and O is of great help to improve the electrochemical performance of the electrode material.
