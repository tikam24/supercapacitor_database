In summer 2004 and 2006 the TOHYCO-Ridera bus with supercapacitors and IPTb was operated by the IIEEc for public transport services in Lucerne. A second generation version of a supercapacitor storage SAIVTd was implemented and tested. A very important step in industrializing hybrid vehicles with SAM became fulfilled. The quite unique combination of a drive-chain system by means of supercapacitors and IPT, the project experiences and the issue on the efficient energy use are presented in this paper. Also the specification of a new SAM is discussed in detail. The future SAM has to be designed in a way that it is open enough for different drive systems on the market. In two main topics of the paper the concept includes technical aspects of combining supercapacitors within the balancing circuitry as well as a CAN-bus interface that make it more easy to integrate an adequate energy-management. Finally, the significance for new hybrid-bus projects will be pointed-out. Â©2007 IEEE.
