The pseudo-capacitance material Manganese dioxide (MnO2) is widely used as electrode materials for supercapacitors; however, its poor electrical conductivity hinders the realization of high specific capacitance. Herein, the MnO2 and Ti3C2Tx (MXene) were deposited on carbon cloth (CC) by a facile two-step electrodeposition method for synthesizing free-binder MnO2/Ti3C2Tx/CC composite electrode. Benefiting from the excellent conductivity of Ti3C2Tx and the excellent pseudo-capacitance performance of MnO2, the as-obtained composite electrode exhibited a higher specific capacitance (411.5 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1). In addition, all-solid-state flexible asymmetric supercapacitors were successfully assembled from the positive electrode of MnO2/Ti3C2Tx/CC and the negative electrode of Ti3C2Tx/CC. The as-assembled supercapacitor presented a large operating voltage of 1.7 V, a high energy density of 24.3 Wh Kg−1 at a power density of 850 W Kg−1. This work provides a simple and efficient approach to prepare composite electrodes and fabricate all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitors with high electrochemical performances.
