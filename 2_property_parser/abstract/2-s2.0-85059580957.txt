A hierarchical architecture of coupling graphene and 2D WS 2 for high-performance supercapacitors is fabricated by a facile ice-template approach. The hybridization content of WS 2 in graphene architecture strongly affects the morphology structure and surface chemical nature of the electrode, and can significantly enhance electrochemical behaviors. As proposed, the hierarchical WS 2 /graphene architectures (WGA) showing rough and wrinkled surface can facilitate electrolyte diffusion and increase the wettability during the measurement. Meanwhile, the formation of 1T WS 2 and covalent bonds at WS 2 /graphene interface are component for the improvement of pseudocapacitive behavior of WGA; A high performance like a superior specific capacitance (383.6 F g âˆ’1 ), good rate capability (79.9%) and excellent cyclic stability (102.5%) is found due to the fast proton insertion into the WS 2 nanoflakes. This work provides an efficient and facile strategy to construct the hierarchical architectures for pseudocapacitive capacitors.
