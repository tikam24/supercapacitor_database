Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are being developed for use in both civil and defence applications to capitalise on the potential of autonomous performance under conditions that are not conducive to inhabited aircraft. The More-Electric Aircraft (MEA) concept is likely to be employed in modern UAV system designs, where conventional mechanical means of power distribution, such as pneumatic and hydraulic systems, are replaced with electrical power distribution in order to enhance efficiency and improve the availability and maintainability of aircraft systems. This paper presents an overview of the research challenges associated with the control, protection and integration of advanced power system components that exist in the systems level development and optimisation of UAV electrical networks. Whilst it is widely acknowledged that modelling and simulation will be the key enabler in the development of such systems, the successful development of useful system models is also a substantial undertaking. This paper describes the development of a MEA twin generator UAV power system model and reviews the specific modelling challenges faced during this process. Research opportunities and potential limitations of the simulation software in addressing key research issues are explored, with simulation results employed to support these arguments as necessary.
