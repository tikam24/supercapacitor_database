There is an increasing demand for high-performance energy storage devices, as the technologies related to this field are being highly regarded as a viable option for the generation and storage of energy serving as a possibly reliable energy grid. Yet, due to the harsh requirements to be met, there is a need to combine different materials to take advantage of their desired properties while diminishing the undesired ones. In that sense, the fabrication of composites based on polymeric materials, transition metal-based, and carbon-based nanomaterials is further described in this chapter. First, a brief introduction is provided that discusses the main concepts, issues, and the role of nanocomposites in energy. Second, there is a conceptual description of the most researched electronic devices with an emphasis on supercapacitors but also Li-ion and Li-S batteries, and fuel cells for the water-splitting process in terms of their mechanism and operating principles. The third session dives into recent examples related to the use of nanocomposites in supercapacitors divided into sub-sessions of composites based on conducting polymers with carbon-based nanomaterials, transition metal oxides, and transition metal sulfides. Similarly, the fourth session covers nanocomposite research for battery applications. The final session provides some discussion of recent work with polymeric nanocomposites for the development of flexible supercapacitors. Thus, this chapter is expected to provide a solid knowledge of the technology of nanocomposites from the concept to the proper design of experiments to serve as a guidance for the younger scientific community.
