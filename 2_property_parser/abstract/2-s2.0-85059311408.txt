Mesoporous NiCoP is synthesized by a one pot solvothermal route and is studied for its morphology, structure, composition. As charge storage in electrochemical supercapacitors is a surface phenomenon, its electrochemical characterizations will be of high interest. The specific capacitance of the as prepared NiCoP is 188 C/g (418 F/g) at 8 A/g and 140 C/g (311 F/g) at a higher specific current density of 20 A/g in 3 M KOH. Interestingly, capacity retention after 5000 cycles at high current of 20 A/g is 97%. Mesoporous NiCoP is a promising electrode material, which exhibits high specific capacity and very long cycle life.
