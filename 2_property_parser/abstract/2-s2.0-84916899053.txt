We utilized a simple dipping-and-polymerization method to prepare an interesting electrode material consisting of polypyrrole (PPy) polymerized on a wood transverse section slice (WTSS), and fabricated a wood-based supercapacitor. The novel electrode has a 3D honeycomb porous framework, a high capacitance (0.61 F cm-2) and excellent flexibility. These make the PPy-coated WTSS electrode an excellent alternative candidate for flexible energy storage.
