A hybrid electric vehicle powered by battery and ultra-capacitor can be a solution to the rapidly changing power cycle of the vehicle on uneven terrain wherein battery satisfies long term energy and ultra-capacitor satisfies high power requirements. This paper deals with design of a control strategy that combines features of both sources and also stores energy generated during regenerative braking of the permanent magnet dc motor. The control strategy used is a bandwidth allocation scheme which assigns power to be fed by both sources and minds the integrity of sources. In order to verify the results, a simulation is conducted using MATLAB/SIMULINK software.
