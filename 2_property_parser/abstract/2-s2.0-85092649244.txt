In order to meet the requirement of high maneuverability of UAV's continuous-type electromagnetic catapult, its energy storage system must achieve high energy density and power density. Therefore, a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) composed of battery (BAT), super capacitor (SC), and bi-directional DC-DC converter is designed, a topology of charge discharge circuit and energy management strategy of fuzzy control are proposed, and simulation analysis is carried out. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can reduce the number of storage batteries effectively and increase the power density of the storage system under the same conditions. In addition, the discharge current of ultracapacitor can be reduced, and the charge and discharge time in the continuous ejection interval can be shortened toincrease the ejection rate. the proposed scheme lays the foundation for improving the performance of UAV's continuous-type electromagnetic catapult.
