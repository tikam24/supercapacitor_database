For the creation of next-generation biocompatible energy technologies, it is urgently necessary to examine environmentally acceptable, low-cost electrode materials with high adsorption, rapid ion/electron transit, and programmable surface chemistry. Because of their wide availability, environmentally friendly nature, and affordability, carbon electrode materials made from biomass have received a lot of interest lately. The biological structures they naturally possess are regular and accurate, and they can be used as templates to create electrode materials with precise geometries. The current study is primarily concerned with recent developments in research pertaining to biomass-derived carbon electrode materials for supercapacitor applications, including plant, fruit, vegetable, and microorganism-based carbon electrode materials. Also provided is a summary of alternative synthesis methods for the conversion and activation of biomass waste.
