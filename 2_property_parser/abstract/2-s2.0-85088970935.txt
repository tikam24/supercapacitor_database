MgCo2O4 is newly become a significant electrode material for high performance supercapacitor application since it possesses a high theoretical capacitance. In this work, the MgCo2O4 materials have been prepared using cost-effective CTAB assisted hydrothermal synthetic method followed by suitable calcination process. Crystalline behavior, bonding properties and surface morphologies of the prepared materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analysis and scanning electron microscopic techniques. During this endeavour, the nanorods structure was obtained with the appropriate concentration of CTAB template. The electrochemical properties of freshly prepared MgCo2O4 materials have been analyzed using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and chronopotentiometry techniques. The cyclic voltammetric measurement was offer the specific capacitance of 784 Fg−1 at a scan rate of 5 mVs−1 with good rate capability. In addition, chronopotentiometric curves exhibit the specific capacitance of 711 Fg−1 at a current density of 1 Ag−1. Furthermore, the cyclic stability analysis displayed attractive stability such as 94% of initial capacitance retained after 2000 consecutive CV cycles at a high scan rate of 100 mVs−1. These findings demonstrate that the convenient utilization of MgCo2O4 as a supercapacitor electrode application.
