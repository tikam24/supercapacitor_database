In order to enhance the performance of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) supercapacitor, two methods were used. One was to activate the CNTs to increase its specific surface area. The other was to coat the CNTs with MnO2 to introduce pseudocapacitance. The samples were analyzed by TEM, BET, cyclic voltammetry and gal-vanostatic charge/discharge. The results show that activation and MnO2 deposition can enhance the performance of the CNTs supercapacitors effectively. At a current density of 5 mA/cm2, the specific capacitance of CNTs was 46 F/g, while the activated CNTs and CNTs/MnO2 composite reach a specific capacitance of 87 F/g and 150 F/g, respectively. And supercapacitors based on activated CNTs and CNTs/MnO2 composite keep fairly excellent power performance.
