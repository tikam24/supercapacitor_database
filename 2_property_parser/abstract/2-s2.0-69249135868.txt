A novel EDOT-nonylbithiazole-EDOT based bis(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene)-(4,4′-dinonyl-2,2′-bithiazole) comonomer was synthesized and was electrochemically deposited onto carbon fiber electrode as an active electrode material. An electrochemical impedance study on the prepared electrodes is reported in this paper. Capacitive behavior of the carbon fiber microelectrode/poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene)-(4,4′-dinonyl-2,2′-bithiazole) system was investigated with cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Variation of capacitance values by scan rate and specific capacitance values at different potentials are presented. Specific capacitance value for a galvanostatically prepared polymer film with a charge of 5 C cm-2 was obtained about ∼340 mF cm-2. Effect of the solvent and the deposition charge on the capacitive behavior of the film was investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. An equivalent circuit model was proposed and the electrochemical impedance data were fitted to find out numerical values of the proposed components. The galvanostatic charge/discharge characteristic of a film was investigated by chronopotentiometry and the morphology of the films electrodeposited at different deposition charges were monitored using FE-SEM. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
