The graphene-Ag 2 O/polyaniline (GAP) composite has been synthesized by in-situ polymerization. It has been observed that Ag 2 O nanoparticles exist on the porous spongy background of PANI (polyaniline). The optimized composition of the synthesized composite exhibits an extraordinary specific capacitance of 1572 Fg -1 at 0.05 Ag -1 current density and good cyclic stability of 85% over 3000 charge-discharge cycles. The extraordinary electrochemical performance indicates the positive synergistic effect of PANI, graphene and Ag 2 O. The Ag 2 O nanoparticles might be responsible for improved electrical conductivity, and graphene might contribute in enhancing the electrochemical stability of the PANI electrode.
