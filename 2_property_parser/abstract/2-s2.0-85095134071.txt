Solar pyrolysis of renewable biomass has huge potential for sustainable production of fuel or chemical feedstock for the activated carbon materials. Here, we report a method for producing high-quality carbon nanofiber (CNF) precursor and subsequently CNFs as a low-cost and eco-friendly energy storage material. Specifically, pinewood is pyrolyzed with solar energy to generate a phenol-rich bioliquid precursor that is found to be a strong candidate for synthesizing binder-free flexible electrode materials via electrospinning. The CNFs prepared with 30% solar-driven bioliquids and 70% polyacrylonitrile have a high specific surface area and rich microstructure, which are the key to its electrochemical performance in terms of specific capacitance (349 F g−1 at the current density of 0.5 A g−1) with notable rate performance, reversibility, and cycling stability in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. Thus, solar bioliquids are feasible CNF precursors, and such derived CNFs have potential to be applied in energy storage devices. The development of cost-competitive and environmentally friendly CNFs is imperative. Wang et al. report the application of solar energy for generation of bioliquid from pinewood. Carbon nanofibers derived from these bioliquids are used for the fabrication of flexible binder-free electrodes with notable electrochemical properties.
