RuO2-SnO2-graphene (RSG) nanocomposites were synthesized imder co-precipitation/hydrothermal conditions. Ehiring the co-precipitation, RUO2 and SnO2 nanoparticles were anchored to partially reduced graphene oxide, which acted as a dispersant for achieving more electrochemical active sites. The morphology and structure change were characterized through scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The electrochemical performance was evaluated through chronopotentiometry, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results showed that the corporation of SnO2 and partially reduced graphene oxide to RuO2 significantly influenced the morphology and crystalline process, and thus enhanced the comprehensive elecfrochemical performance. Samples with hydrothermal treatment exhibited higher crystallinity and specific capacitance of 154 F/g ∼ 200F/g at 1 A/g. Samples without hydrothermal treatment showed relative higher specific capacitance of 250 F/g ∼ 436 F/g at 1 A/g.
