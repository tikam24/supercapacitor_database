The popular pursuit of a high interior surface area, although leading to increasing capacitance records for carbon-based supercapacitor electrode materials, also produces low volumetric capacitances. We herein reported a porous nitrogen doped carbon material with a relatively low specific surface area of 403 m2 g-1 and a total pore volume of only 0.29 cm3 g-1, exhibiting a very high gravimetric capacitance of 400 F g-1 and a volumetric capacitance of 507 F cm-3 in a three-electrode system. Simultaneously, the energy density reaches 26.1 W h kg-1 at a power density of 200 W kg-1, and maintains 7.44 W h kg-1 at 5000 W kg-1, in a symmetric two-electrode test conducted in 6 M KOH solution. The result implies a maximized utilization of the interior surface and the significant capacitance contribution resulted from each unit surface, for which a systematic investigation on the critical structural features has been given.
