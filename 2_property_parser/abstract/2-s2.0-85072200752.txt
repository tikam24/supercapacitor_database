Progress toward the development of advanced supercapacitor technologies is closely associated with the continuous evolution of nanostructured electrode materials. Herein, work is described in which an inner/outer layer nanostructured hexagonal tungsten oxide (h-WO3)-polyaniline (PANI) hybrid nanomaterial has been elaborately designed and synthesized by a hydrothermal-electrodeposition method. The surface morphology, molecular structure, crystal phase, and chemical composition of the hybrid nanomaterial were studied by FESEM (EDX), FTIR, XRD (SXRD), TEM, and XPS. The resulting WO3-PANI hybrid exhibits a significantly enhanced gravimetric specific capacitance (278 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g) with an outstanding areal specific capacitance of 979 mF/cm2, good rate performance (77.2% capacitance retention from 0.5 to 10 A/g), and stable cycling performance (91.9% capacitance retention over 1500 cycles). The outstanding electrochemical properties of the WO3-PANI electrode are ascribed to its ingenious nanostructure design and the synergistic effects of each component. The symmetric supercapacitors based on WO3-PANI electrodes show a high areal capacitance and remarkable flexibility, suggesting potential application in flexible energy storage devices. Based on analysis and study the band structure and the electrochemical properties of the PANI-coated WO3 hybrid electrode, a possible mechanism for the synergistic effects was proposed in a new perspective.
