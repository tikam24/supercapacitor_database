In this work, NiCo2O4 nanorods and rGO supported NiCo2O4 (NiCo2O4/rGO) are synthesized. The samples are evaluated by XRD, Raman, XPS, SEM, TEM, CV, EIS, and galvanostatic charge/discharge. The charge transfer resistance of NiCo2O4/rGO obtains 7.59 Ω, which is 7.6 times lower than that of NiCo2O4 (57.5 Ω). Also, the specific capacity of NiCo2O4/rGO hybrid found to be 63.2 mAh g−1 at discharge current density of 0.5 mA cm−2. The high specific surface area of rGO and the electrostatic interactions between rGO and NiCo2O4 enhance the electroactive sites of material and increase the specific capacitive and energy storage. NiCo2O4/rGO exhibits excellent charge storage and high rate capability with 55% capacitive retention at 4 mA cm−2. Both specific surface area of rGO and specific nanorod morphology of NiCo2O4 contribute significantly to the high electrochemical performance of NiCo2O4/rGO for energy storage.
