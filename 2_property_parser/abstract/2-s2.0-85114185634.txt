The supercapacitors have been identified as one of the significant elements in electrochemical applications. This work discusses the development of nanocomposites to improve the performance of supercapacitors. Hence, the precipitate of SnO2and MoS2were synthesized in different composition by using hydrothermal method to check the suitability of materials. Thiourea and ammonia hepta molybdate tetra hydrate dissolved in deionized water results in Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). The resultant obtained was mixed with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The precipitate Tin Oxide (SnO2) was prepared by mixing the NaOH in dissolved tin chloride Penta hydrate and hydrazine hydrate. The X-Ray diffraction and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) techniques were used to analyze the structure and material characteristics. The electrochemical performance and material capacitance of the three different SnO2and MoS2composition has been examined using Cyclic Voltammetry (CV). The SEM analysis results indicated that SnO2structure is polyhedralha and MoS2is layered. The CV analysis showed that the combination of SnO2and MoS2has high capacitance compound with respect to other composition.
