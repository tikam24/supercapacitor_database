Intelligent sensing systems based on the edge-computing paradigm are essential for the implementation of Internet of Things (IoT) and Agriculture 4.0 applications. The development of edge-computing wireless sensing systems is required to improve the sensor’s accuracy in soil and data interpretation. Therefore, measuring and processing data at the edge, rather than sending it back to a data center or the cloud, is still an important issue in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The challenge under this paradigm is to achieve a sustainable operation of the wireless sensing system powered with alternative renewable energy sources, such as plant microbial fuel cells (PMFCs). Consequently, the motivation of this study is to develop a sustainable forage-grass-power fuel cell solution to power an IoT Long-Range (LoRa) network for soil monitoring. The stenotaphrum secundatum grass plant is used as a microbial fuel cell proof of concept, implemented in a 0.015 m (Formula presented.) -chamber with carbon plates as electrodes. The BQ25570 integrated circuit is employed to harvest the energy in a 4 F supercapacitor, which achieves a maximum generation capacity of (Formula presented.) mW. The low-cost pH SEN0169 and the SHT10 temperature and humidity sensors are deployed to analyze the soil parameters. Following the edge-computing paradigm, the inverse problem methodology fused with a system identification solution is conducted, correcting the sensor errors due to non-linear hysteresis responses. An energy power management strategy is also programmed in the MSP430FR5994 microcontroller unit, achieving average power consumption of 1.51 mW, ∼19% less than the energy generated by the forage-grass-power fuel cell. Experimental results also demonstrate the energy sustainability capacity achieving a total of 18 consecutive transmissions with the LoRa network without the system’s shutting down.
