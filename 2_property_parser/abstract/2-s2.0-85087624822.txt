The main goal during charging a battery made of supercapacitors connected in series is reaching the rated voltages across all cells at the end of the charging process. The voltage imbalance is due to the tolerance in the nominal capacitance of the cells. The voltage equalization could be done by active and passive balancing methods. This work proposes active equalizing method with increasing charging current of the cell higher capacitance. For adding additional charging current to each cell, individual converters are used. The values of the additional charging currents have been obtained.
