In this work, both graphene and nitrogen-doped graphene coated with SnO2 nanoparticles were synthesized through a chemicalsolution route, graphene-based thin films were prepared by a blade coating method, and solid-state supercapacitors were fabricated employing graphene-based films and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-H3PO4 gel as electrodes and electrolyte, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy was used to characterize the morphology of the obtained graphene based films. Energy dispersive X-ray and X-ray diffraction analyses were carried out to investigate the composition and crystal structure of the as-obtained graphene based materials. The electrochemical performance of the asfabricated supercapacitors was measured using cyclic voltammetry. Thermo gravimetric analysis was conducted to study the thermal stability of the added polymer (acrylic resin) during heat treatment. Â© The Electrochemical Society.
