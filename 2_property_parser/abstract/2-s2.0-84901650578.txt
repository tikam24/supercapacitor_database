Hydrous ruthenium oxide (RuO2 · nH2O) nanoparticles with various particle sizes and water contents were synthesized in sub- and supercritical water in a very short reaction time of 15 min. The particle size, surface area, morphology, crystalline structure, and electrochemical properties were analyzed and compared with those of commercial RuO2 particles. Ultrafine spherical RuO2 · 0.6H2O nanoparticles with an average size of 4.2 nm were produced in subcritical water (250°C, 300 bar), while larger and more highly crystalline rod-shaped RuO2 · (0.3-0.5)H2O particles were produced in supercritical water (400°C, 300 bar). The use of NaOH under the supercritical water conditions resulted in a decrease in particle size. The hydrous RuO2 nanoparticles synthesized in subcritical water exhibited a much higher specific capacitance (255 F g-1) at a scan rate of 10 mV s-1 than those synthesized in supercritical water (77 F g-1) and commercial RuO2 (8 F g-1). © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.
