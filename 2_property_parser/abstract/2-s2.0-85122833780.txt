Potassium ion hybrid capacitors (PIHCs) have attracted considerable interest due to their low cost, competitive power/energy densities, and ultra-long lifespan. However, the more sluggish insertion kinetics of battery-type anodes than capacitor-type cathodes in PIHCs seriously limits their practical application. Therefore, developing advanced anodes with high capacitor and suitable K+ intercalation is imperative and significant. A novel core–shell structure of Ni-Co oxide/Ni-Co oxyphosphide (NCOP) nanowires are designed and constructed in this study via efficient and facile strategy. Combining the merits of the core–shell structure and the massive active sites in the oxyphosphide layer, the as-prepared NCOP composites manifest highly reversible capacitors and outstanding rate capability. Meanwhile, the insertion and conversion potassium storage mechanisms of the NCOP are successfully revealed through in situ X-ray diffraction and density functional theory calculations, respectively. Furthermore, the PIHC was assembled with NCOP anode and borocarbonitride cathode, which displays a large energy density and high-power density, along with an exceptional capacity retention of ≈90% over 10 000 cycles at 1.0 A g−1. This work provides the anion regulation strategy for modifying the transition metal oxide and constructing the advancing electrode materials for next-generation energy storage and beyond.
