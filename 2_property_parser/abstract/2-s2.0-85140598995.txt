World energy demand has risen dramatically and continues to do so in recent decades as a result of excessive population growth and rapid industrialization. As an energy storage device, the supercapacitor plays a vital role in this industry. In the present study, spinel-like nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4) samples are fabricated by a simplistic and time-efficient co-precipitation route with diverse pH values (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9). The purity and cubic phase of the synthesized materials are evaluated through X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis provided the details of morphology and element composition respectively. The three-electrode setup is used for the electrochemical properties in which platinum wire, Ag/AgCl electrode, and synthesized sample are utilized as the counter electrode, reference electrode, and working electrode respectively. The shape of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) confirmed the battery-like behavior of the synthesized material. The GCD further calculated a high specific capacity (C/g) for the NiCo2O4sample with pH = 5 (146C/g) at 2.0A/gcurrent density.
