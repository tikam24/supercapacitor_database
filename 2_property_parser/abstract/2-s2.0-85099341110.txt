Biochar is rarely used in electrochemical energy storage, owing to its low specific surface area and poor electrochemical characteristics. To avoid the use of seriously corrosive chemicals for the development of pores, a green and facile one-step process was introduced to prepare biochar with high specific surface area without any additional chemicals, using three types of marine biomass waste (kelp, undaria pinnatifida, and Enteromorpha prolifera) as precursors and in-situ salts as activating agent. The biochar possessed high specific surface areas (621–1140 m2 g−1) and exhibited excellent energy storage characteristics (190.0–278.5 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1). Furthermore, the perfect cyclic stabilities were also demonstrated with the capacity retentions of 96%–98% after 5000 cycles. However, the washed marine-biomass-derived biochars were produced under the same conditions, but only possessed poor specific surface areas of 50–226 m2 g−1 and exhibited low capacitances of 23.4–105.3 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. Therefore, the results demonstrated that the existence of in-situ salts on the marine algae could drastically promote the development of the porous structure, particularly micropores and mesopores. This study offers a promising synthesis for the application of biochar to the energy storage field.
