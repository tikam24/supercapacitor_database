Thin film supercapacitors are produced by using electrochemically exfoliated graphene (G) and wet-chemically produced graphene oxide (GO). Either G/GO/G stacked film or sole GO film are sandwiched by two Au films to make devices, where GO is the dielectric spacer. The addition of graphene film can increase the capacitance about two times, compared to the simple Au electrode. It is found that the GO film has very high dielectric constant, accounting for the high capacitance. AC measurement reveals that the relative permittivity of GO is in the order of 104 within the frequency range of 0.1-70 Hz. Â© 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.
