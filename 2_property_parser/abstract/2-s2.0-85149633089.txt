The report is associated with the investigation of the impact of selenium powder aging in hydrazine hydrate acting as a reducing agent on the electrochemical performance of the molybdenum diselenide/activated carbon (MoSe2@AC) composite-based electrodes, and its supercapacitor application. The MoSe2@AC composite is formulated via the simple hydrothermal method. The composite formation is validated via structural, chemical bond, and morphology investigation. Among all synthesized samples, six days aged sample coded M6AC appears to exhibit the best electrochemical performance. The specific capacitance estimated for M6AC material-based fabricated symmetric cell is around 394 F g−1 at the 1 A g−1 using KOH (6 M) electrolyte. The energy and power density delivered by the same cell at 1 A g−1 is about 55 W h kg−1 and 845 W kg−1 correspondingly. Furthermore, we have tested the real-world usability of the M6AC symmetric cell by illuminating different voltage cum colors light emitting diodes (LEDs). The 26 red LEDs in the parallel connection illuminate for approximately 32 min with the aid of our fabricated symmetric cell as the power source. For easy understanding of the readers, we also report the self-proposed charge storage mechanism linked with the glowing LEDs using our obtained experimental results. Thereby, the observed outcomes associated with the M6AC material indicate that it has immense potential for scaling its performance at the industrial cum commercial level to resolve the energy crisis problem of the society.
