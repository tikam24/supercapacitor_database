Using atomic layer deposition, vertically-aligned multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) supercapacitors were coated with conformal and uniform layers of titanium oxide to introduce pseudocapacitive charge storage properties to the electrodes. The results suggest that the addition of a controlled thickness of titania to the MWCNT structure improves the performance of the capacitors, with an increase in specific capacitance (more than 300%) as compared to the control supercapacitors, with values up to 73 F/g normalized to electrode mass (MWCNT and titania) and 1,364 F/g normalized to titania mass. Furthermore, the series resistance of the control supercapacitors (1.21 ω) did not significantly increase with the addition of titania, until 300 atomic layer deposition cycles were performed. Improvements of the specific power and energy were also observed, with the maximum specific power and energy seen being 24.8 ± 4.8 W/g and 14.0 ± 4.1 Ws/g respectively.
