Due to its excellent performance, Co3O4 are redeemed as a promising supercapacitor material. However, problems like its low ion diffusion speed limit its application. In this paper, by preparing composite materials of Co3O4 and Zn(OH)F, the ion diffusion path of Co3O4 material is extended and the electrochemical performance of the material is enhanced. The composite material grown in situ on nickel foam was synthesized by hydrothermal method, and the optimum experimental route was determined through the selection of zinc and cobalt sources and the optimization of hydrothermal conditions and calcination conditions. When the current density is 1 mA/cm2, the capacity of Co3O4@Zn(OH)F composite material is as high as 5.68 F/cm2, showing relatively stable electrochemical performance, this is because the addition of Zn(OH)F material extends the diffusion path of ions. Subsequently, the physical properties of the composite material with good performance were characterized. The XRD tests showed that the synthesized material was composed of Co3O4 and Zn(OH)F, with high crystallinity and no other impurity peaks. Through SEM analysis, there are nanowire and spheroidal structures that can be found in the micro scale, and the nanowires are interwoven with each other to form snowflake shape, which can provide more transfer paths for charge transfer. The EDS test and element analysis show that all elements are evenly distributed. According to the result of the XPS test, the valence states of each element in the material coincide with those of Co3O4 and Zn(OH)F. The FT-IR test showed that the presence of Zn(OH)F did not affect the structure of Co3O4 material. In conclusion, by adopting the synthesis method described in the text, the ion diffusion performance of Co3O4 is improved, which also proves the possibility of its industrial application as supercapacitor material.
