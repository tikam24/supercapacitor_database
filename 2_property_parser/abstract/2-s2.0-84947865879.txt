This paper investigates the modeling approach based on the Matlab SimPowerSystems Toolbox (SPS) of a fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV). The objective of this approach is to increase the accurate modeling of the power source, the power converter and the load to evaluate the full system performances since the simulation step. In this study, a supercapacitor (SC) is associated as an auxiliary device with the FC to ensure the power reversibility in the drive train. The FC and the SC are connected to the dc bus throughout an interleaved boost converter (IBC) and an interleaved buck-boost converter (IBBC) respectively. The control of the proposed system is designed using the discrete proportional integral (PI) controllers and the digital width pulse modulation (DPWM). The proposed controller improves the dynamic performance of the IBC converters by achieving a robust bus voltage and inputs currents against load disturbances. The converter is designed through simulation using SPS and the results are discussed.
