One pyrazole carboxylic complex, namely, {[Cd(Hpzca)2(H2O)3]·H2O}n (1), where H2pzca is 1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid, has been synthesized under solvothermal condition, and the crystal structure was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The X-ray study reveals that complex 1 is a 1D polymer. While it was used as the electrode material for a supercapacitor, exhibited large specific capacitance, high rate capability and good cycling stability. Capacitances of 106 F g−1 could be achieved at a rate of 0.5 mVs−1 and the retention was maintained at about 93% even after 1000 cycles.
