Supercapacitors (SC) have attracted attention as energy storage devices due to their high density and long cycle performance. SCs used in devices operating in stretchable systems require stretchable electrolytes. Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) are an ideal replacement for liquid electrolytes. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyvinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene (PVDF-HFP) have been widely applied as a polymer-matrix-based electrolytes for supercapacitors because of their low cost, chemically stable, wide operating temperature range, and high ionic conductivities. Herein, we describe the procedures for (1) synthesizing a gel polymer electrolyte with PVA and PVDF-HFP, (2) measuring the electrochemical stability of the gel polymer electrolytes by cyclic voltammetry (CV), (3) measuring the ionic conductivity of the gel polymer electrolytes by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), (4) assembling symmetric coin cells using activated carbon (AC) electrodes with the PVA-and PVDF-HFP-based gel polymer electrolytes, and (5) evaluating the electrochemical performance using galvanostatic charge-discharge analysis (GCD) and CV at 25 Â°C. Additionally, we describe the challenges and insights gained from these experiments.
