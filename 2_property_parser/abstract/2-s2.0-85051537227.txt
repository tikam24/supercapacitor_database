The authors present the study and control of a new concept of hybrid generator in order to improve the behaviour of a synchronous generator during transients. The solution adopted is to place an energy storage system in parallel with the synchronous generator. The storage system consists of an inverter with a supercapacitor on the DC bus. A control law with a best compromise between energy exchanged in the supercapacitor and group speed efficiency has been developed and presented. To achieve that, a feedback control with integration of the deviation using a linear matrix inequalities approach has been used for current loop synthesis of the regulators. A second control law was developed to regulate the variable voltage across the supercapacitor. All validations were made on an experimental test rig. Experimental tests highlighted the significant contribution of this hybridisation to the motor speed variations and to the terminal voltage of the generator during impact or load shedding.
