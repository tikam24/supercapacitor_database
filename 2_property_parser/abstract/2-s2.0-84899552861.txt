A composite material consisting of polyaniline nanofibers (PANi NFs) coated graphene nanosheets (GNS) and PANi NFs has been coated on cotton cloth and plastic sheet. Morphological, structural and compositional analyses showed an excellent interaction between the components of the composite. This has reflected in the composite's electrochemical behavior. The first discharge specific capacitances of GNS, PANi NFs and the composite electrodes have been measured as ∼59.79, ∼156.9 and ∼325.84 F/g, respectively. The composite material has been found to exhibit electrochemical behavior that is a combination of electric double-layer capacitor behavior of GNS and pseudo capacitor behavior of PANi NFs. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.
