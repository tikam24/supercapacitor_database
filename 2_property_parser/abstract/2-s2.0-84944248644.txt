Nanoclay based ternary graphene/polypyrrole (PPy) nanocomposite were synthesized by both in-situ and ex-situ chemical oxidative polymerization approach. The surface morphology analysis by scanning electron microscope and field emission microscope revealed both nanoclay and graphene was coated with PPy. Electrochemical performances of all nanocomposites were analyzed with cyclic voltammetry, potentiostatic charging-discharging and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The in-situ nanocomposite showed relatively higher specific capacitance (347. F/g) as compared to ex-situ nanocomposite, at a scan rate of 10 mV/s in 1. M KCl as an electrolyte. The variation of specific capacitance with sequential addition of nanoclay was explored. These features collectively demonstrated the potential and attractive application of the as synthesized nanocomposite for energy storage.
