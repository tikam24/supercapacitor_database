Regular nanoarrays are ideal structures for supercapacitors; however, they often require multiple operations during their preparation. Therefore, it is very important to obtain such structures easily and quickly. In addition, the synergy between elements is crucial for the composition design of electrode materials. In this study, NiCoSe2@CC electrode materials were successfully obtained by electrodeposition using flexible carbon cloth as a collector and having efficient synergy between the Ni and Co elements to meet the demand for flexible devices. The regular microstructure and highly efficient synergistic composition enabled the electrode material to exhibit a capacitance of 3150 mF cm−2 and to maintain 85% cycle retention after 2500 cycles. Furthermore, this was matched with an activated carbon (AC) electrode to prepare a flexible solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor. A specific capacitance of 78 F g−1 was exhibited at a current density of 0.25 A g−1, and this could be maintained at 85% at 30 mA cm−2 during 5000 cycles of testing, showing promising application potential.
