Most of braking energy which made by high-speed train in braking process is recovered by energy consumption brake or feedback into power networks currently. Energy consumption brake would lead to energy waste, and feedback into power networks may cause harmonic pollution. The braking energy recovery system based on super-capacitor energy storage can recover the braking energy in braking process and release it in starting or accelerating. However, the system have some shortcomings, such as the large energy storage capacity configuration and high expensive. In the paper, an integrated braking energy recovery method and an optimal configuration method were proposed which can solve above problems, the DC/DC converter and the coordinated control strategy was designed. The correctness and validity of the proposed method were verified by simulation and experiments on the Shanghai 1.5km Maglev Test Line.
