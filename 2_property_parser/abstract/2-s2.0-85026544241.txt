Based on the magnetic coupled resonance theory, a wireless power transfer (WPT) system features plate core structure is porposed to realize constant current charging for the variable load. The main factors that affect the transfer power, system efficiency and charging current are analyzed by the equivalent circuit model. Based on the dynamic characteristic of supercapacitor's equivalent load resistance during the constant current charging process, different values of power resistor are used to simulate its charging characteristic. Firstly, the regulation of charging current by the secondary side Buck converter is analyzed and the relationship between duty cycle and charging current is obtained. Then, constant current charging is achieved by PI control algorithm. Secondly, through the theoretical analysis and simulation, the parameters of the magnetic coupler are optimized and designed. Finally, the experimental setup is built to validate the system design method. When the transfer distance is 15cm and the range of load resistance is 0.5~5Ω, 29A constant charging current is achieved. Furthre, when load resistance is 3.2Ω, the designed system realizes 87.7% system efficiency and 2.58kW transfer power.
