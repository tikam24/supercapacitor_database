An ordered mesoporous WO3−x material was employed for use as a supercapacitor electrode. This material exhibited a high rate capability and an excellent capacitance (366 μF cm−2, 639 F cm−3), which were probably attributed to the large ordered mesopores, high electrical conductivity, and high material density. © 2010 Royal Society of Chemistry.
