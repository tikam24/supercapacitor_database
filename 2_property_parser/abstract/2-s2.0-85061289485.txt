The current challenge of the still poor electronic conductivity is one of the major bottlenecks to obtain the large reversible capacitance and rapid rate capability for MnO 2 -based supercapacitor electrodes. Herein, we report the synthesis of a binder-less Ni/MnO 2 electrode with hierarchical MnO 2 nanosheets anchoring on the foamed-Ni support frameworks, and the mass loadings of MnO 2 on the foamed-Ni and the nanostructural morphology are optimized to enhance its electrochemical performance. Such hierarchical nanosheet structure of MnO 2 can improve its electrolyte-accessible surface area and the foamed-Ni framework can effectively enhance its electronic conductivity, which can be beneficial to improve its capacitance and rate capability. The Ni/MnO 2 electrodes reveal an areal capacitance of 2.31 F cm −2 at the current density of 1 mA cm −2 , which can maintain 1.48 F cm −2 (64.1%) at 20 mA cm −2 , exhibiting high capacitance and excellent rate capability. Moreover, the Ni/MnO 2 electrode-based supercapacitor exhibits a superior energy density of 160.1 mWh cm −2 and an outstanding cycling stability of 86.8% capacitance retention after 9000 cycles, indicating that such binder-less Ni/MnO 2 offers a promising electrode material for the high-performance supercapacitor.
