Featuring abundant pore structure, the metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have invoked new feasibilities to the full potential of electrode materials in emerging supercapacitors. Here, a novel honeycomb-like Ni3(NO3)2(OH)4@Ni/Co-BTC is elaborately fabricated by growing Ni3(NO3)2(OH)4 on the surface of Ni/Co-MOF substrate by solvent thermal method. The Ni3(NO3)2(OH)4@Ni/Co-BTC-based supercapacitor with extremely high specific capacity (1959 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) is contributed to the unique honeycomb-like structure of electrode. The capacitance contribution analysis indicates that Ni3(NO3)2(OH)4@Ni/Co-BTC belongs to pseudocapacitive materials. The reported strategy is expected to provide new insight into electrode designing for high-capacity supercapacitors, thus broadening the application of MOFs in this field.
