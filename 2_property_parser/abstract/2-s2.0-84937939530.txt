Abstract Uniform fibrous-structured hollow mesoporous carbon spheres (FHMCSs) have been synthesized by a simple template method using fibrous-structured mesoporous silica microspheres and resol precursor as silica template and carbon sources, respectively. It is found that FHMCSs have an ultra high specific surface area of 1121 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> and large pore volume of 1.3 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>. The high surface-to-volume ratio is a favorable factor to obtain high specific capacitance and excellent rate performance. As expected, when used as supercapacitor electrodes, the FHMCSs exhibit high specific capacitance of 359.2 F g<sup>-1</sup> at current density of 1 A g<sup>-1</sup> and excellent cycle stability (92% retention after 5000 cycles). The energy density of the FHMCSs can be estimated to be 49.9 Wh kg<sup>-1</sup> at a power density of 500 Wh kg<sup>-1</sup>. Moreover, the FHMCSs electrode shows high energy density of 36.4 Wh kg<sup>-1</sup> even at the power density of 10000 W kg<sup>-1</sup>, suggesting a potential application in supercapacitors and other energy storage fields.
