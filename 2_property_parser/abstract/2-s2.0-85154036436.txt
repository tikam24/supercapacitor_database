Self-powered electrochemical sensors based on enzyme biofuel cells (EBFC) attracted widely attention, but still faced with challenges of low efficiency of solid electrode adsorbing enzyme and insufficient enzyme active site. In this work, the sandwich-graphdiyne (S-GDY) material is used internally to enhance the EBFC performance, and external energy conversion devices are connected to coordinate signal amplification. The results indicate that the detection limit is as low as 0.16 fM (S / N = 3), and the sensitivity is 16.1 Î¼A/pM, contributing to the dual-drive cascade amplification effect. Moreover, the catalytic hairpin self-assembly (CHA) technology to achieve accurate identification of the target miRNA-141, and the real-time data acquisition obtained through smartphones. The integration of electrochemical response in supercapacitor detection mode is convenient for the rapid on-site monitoring of the target. The work promotes the development of miniaturized and portable devices, and expands the application of self-powered sensors in the medical diagnosis field.
