Implementation of green energy storage system via integrating natural materials has become an indispensable requirement for a sustainable future. In this study, polyaniline (PANI) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) filled flexible porous mixed matrix membrane (MMM) were developed from chitosan (CS) and cellulose acetate (CA) for supercapacitor applications. The results reflect that the unique membrane morphology of the MMM electrode aid for the better areal capacitance of 30.69 mF/cm2 at a scan rate of 25 mV/s when compared with CA/CS (CC) paper based electrode having same compositions of PANI and MWCNT (15.71 mF/cm2 at a scan rate of 25 mV/s). The present strategy paved way to biopolymer based mixed matrix membrane (MMM) having facile fabrication, high porosity and flexibility as sustainable electrode materials for energy storage applications.
