The rational design of hierarchical nanostructure consisting of multiple components with remarkable electrochemical performance is regarded as a significant technique for fabricating high-performance energy storage devices. Herein, self-supported tree-like (Ni,Co)Se2/Ni(OH)2 heterogeneous nanoarrays on carbon cloth (CC) used as electrode materials of supercapacitors (SCs) are designed and synthesized by a multi-step approach. The (Ni,Co)Se2 core can boost electron transport due to excellent conductivity, and the shell layer of Ni(OH)2 nanoflakes improves the surface area. Profiting from the cooperative effects of two active materials and core-shell architecture, the tree-like (Ni,Co)Se2/Ni(OH)2 composite delivers a superior capacity, outstanding rate capability and still retain 151.3 mAh g−1 after 3000 charge/discharge cycles. Meanwhile, the flexible hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) fabricated by the (Ni,Co)Se2/Ni(OH)2 and activated carbon (AC) also manifests a satisfied energy density of 0.79 mWh cm−2 under 1.35 mW cm−2. Therefore, it can be considered that the as-prepared hierarchical (Ni,Co)Se2/Ni(OH)2 nanoarrays are promising candidate for HSC devices in energy storage and conversion.
