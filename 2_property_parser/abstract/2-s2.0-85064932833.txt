In this article, polyaniline nanofibers/reduced graphene oxide (PANI-NFs/rGO) nanocomposites were prepared by a one-pot hydrothermal method. Under the condition of high temperature and high pressure, graphene oxide (GO) was reduced to rGO and aniline was in-situ polymerized to form PANI-NFs using ammonium persulfate as oxidant. The morphologies and structures of PANI-NFs/rGO nanocomposites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and Raman analysis. The results show that PANI-NFs uniformly grow on the surfaces of rGO sheets, which can act as spacers to prevent the aggregation of rGO. Combining with FTIR and Raman analysis, it can be concluded that PANI-NFs/rGO nanocomposites are successfully prepared. The electrochemical performances of PANI-NFs/rGO nanocomposites were tested by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge. The PANI-NFs/rGO nanocomposites exhibit superior electrochemical performances compared to the PANI-NFs. With 10 wt% of GO loaded, the PANI-NFs/rGO nanocomposite exhibits highest specific capacitance of 942 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. The PANI-NFs/rGO nanocomposites also demonstrate good rate capacity and high cycling stability under the high discharging current density (10 A g−1), the specific capacitance can still reach to 680 F g−1. After 1000 charge–discharge cycling at a current density of 5 A g−1, 78% of specific capacitance can be retained. The enhanced capacitive performances can be attributed to the facile electron conduction pathway brought by the even distribution of highly conductive rGO nanosheets.
