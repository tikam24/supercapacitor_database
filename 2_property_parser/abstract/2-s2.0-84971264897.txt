Due to its unique layered structure compared with those tunnel structures of α-, β-, and γ-MnO2, δ-phase MnO2 is widely investigated as pollutant degradation catalysts, supercapacitor cathodes, and so forth. However, it is still challenging to effectively dope the δ-MnO2 to improve its performance although doping of other structures has been widely reported. In this study, a facile anion route is used to dope Ti in hydrothermal process for preparation of highly active hierarchical δ-MnO2 catalyst. The Ti doping process is performed successfully at a growth temperature of 140 °C, considering keeping the active δ-phase and producing the active lattice oxygen, which is identified by X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), and Raman spectra. On the other hand, low temperature (<120 °C) induces low doping concentration (<0.5 atom %) and high temperature (>160 °C) changes the δ-phase to α-phase. The doping process is proposed to be the incorporation of the hydrolyzed [Ti(OH)6]2- into the [MnO6] sheets with similar octahedral structure. The Ti-doped δ-MnO2 has the highest catalytic oxidation property over benzene, which can be attributed to both the active oxygen induced by Ti doping, and the abundant pore structures, such as the interlayer spaces (∼0.7 nm), mesopores (e.g., 4-5 nm and 8-9 nm), and macropores between the nanoflake assembles facilitating the gases diffusion and reactions. All these results hold the promise for the effective anion doping route for δ-MnO2 applied in high efficiency and low cost degradation of volatile organic compound contamination in air as well as in other catalytic applications.
