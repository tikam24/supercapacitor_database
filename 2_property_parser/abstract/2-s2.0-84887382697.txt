Wind energy is one of the fastest growing renewable energies in the world today, but the disadvantage is that wind power generation is intermittent, depending on weather conditions. Energy storage is necessary to get a smooth output from a wind system. This paper presents the control and energy management of a Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) with Battery-Supercapacitor hybrid energy storage, and an AC residential load, connected to the utility grid which is used as a backup source. Mathematical model is detailed for each component of the studied system. An overall power management strategy is designed for the system to coordinate the power flows among the different energy sources and the load demand. Simulation studies have been carried out using MATLAB/Simulink to verify the system performance under different scenarios. Â© 2013 IEEE.
