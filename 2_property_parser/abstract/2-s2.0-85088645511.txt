Lithium ion capacitors have attracted enormous interest in recent years due to their high energy density, high power density as well as long cycle stability. However, it remains as a grand challenge to find a suitable battery-type anode material with low Li-ion insertion potential and fast electrochemical kinetics. In this work, we demonstrate that the 3D porous Li3VO4@C composites synthesized by a facile freeze-drying-assisted thermal treatment method can be favorably used for high-performance lithium ion capacitors. Benefiting from the uniformly distributed Li3VO4 nanoparticles and interconnected conductive carbon networks, the 3D porous Li3VO4@C anode displays a fast kinetics for both charge-transfer and ion-diffusion, excellent rate capability (317 mAh/g even at a high rate of 10 A/g) and superior cycling stability (322 mAh/g at 5A/g after 2000 cycles). A lithium ion capacitor based on these 3D porous Li3VO4@C composites delivers high energy/power densities (129.7 Wh/kg at 251.8 W/kg, 52.8 Wh/kg even at 15.2 kW/kg), revealing the promising potential applications in high-performance and long life Lithium ion capacitors.
