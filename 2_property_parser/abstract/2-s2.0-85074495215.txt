Low-voltage ride-through is important for the operation stability of the system in balanced- and unbalanced-grid-fault-connected doubly fed induction generator-based wind turbines. In this study, a new LVRT capability approach was developed using positive–negative sequences and natural and forcing components in DFIG. Besides, supercapacitor modeling is enhanced depending on the voltage–capacity relation. Rotor electro-motor force is developed to improve low-voltage ride-through capability against not only symmetrical but also asymmetrical faults of DFIG. The performances of the DFIG with and without the novel active–passive compensator–supercapacitor were compared. Novel active–passive compensator–supercapacitor modeling in DFIG was carried out in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment. A comparison of the system behaviors was made between three-phase faults, two-phase faults and a phase–ground fault with and without a novel active–passive compensator–supercapacitor modeling. Parameters for the DFIG including terminal voltage, angular speed, electrical torque variations and d–q axis rotor–stator current variations, in addition to a 34.5 kV bus voltage, were investigated. It was found that the system became stable in a short time and oscillations were damped using novel active–passive compensator–supercapacitor modeling and rotor EMF.
