Hierarchical nanostructure, high electrical conductivity, extraordinary specific surface area, and unique porous architecture are essential properties in energy storage and conversion studies. A new type of hierarchical 3D cobalt encapsulated Fe3O4 nanosphere is successfully developed on N-graphene sheet (Co−Fe3O4 NS@NG) hybrid with unique nanostructure by simple, scalable, and efficient solvothermal technique. When applied as an electrode material for supercapacitors, hierarchical Co−Fe3O4 NS@NG hybrid shows an ultrahigh specific capacitance (775 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1) with exceptional rate capability (475 F g−1 at current density of 50 A g−1), and admirable cycling performance (97.1% capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles). Furthermore, the fabricated Co−Fe3O4 NS@NG//CoMnO3@NG asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device exhibits a high energy density of 89.1 Wh kg−1 at power density of 0.901 kW kg−1, and outstanding cycling performance (89.3% capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles). Such eminent electrochemical properties of the Co−Fe3O4 NS@NG are due to the high electrical conductivity, ultrahigh surface area, and unique porous architecture. This research first proposes hierarchical Co−Fe3O4 NS@NG hybrid as an ultrafast charge−discharge anode material for the ASC device, that holds great potential for the development of high-performance energy storage devices.
