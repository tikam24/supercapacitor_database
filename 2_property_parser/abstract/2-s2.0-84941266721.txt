In this report, nanoporous anodic nickel-based thin film was prepared by a facile electrochemical approach in a fluoride containing electrolyte. The morphology, crystalline structure and electrochemical performance of the as-anodised film were investigated by scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction and an electrochemical workstation. The influence of processing conditions such as anodisation voltage, fluorine ion concentration and acid concentration were studied and found to have a significant effect on the capacitance of as-anodised nickel-based film. Meanwhile, the time of the anodisation is also a key factor in the performance of the nickelbased film. The specific capacitance of anodic nanoporous thin film prepared at optimised condition (1 wt-% NH4F + 80 wt-% H3PO4, 3Â·5 V for 45 minutes) reached 225 mF cm-2 at the scan rate of 100 mV s-1.
