Graphene has attracted intensive interests from broad areas of chemistry, physics, and materials science, among others. Interest in graphene's thermoelectric (TE) applications has engendered a large pile of publications and a speeding-up pace of research, making review of such research timely. This is a review covering the TE properties and their optimization strategies of graphene and graphene-based hybrids, as well as their utilizations in TE and other functional devices.
