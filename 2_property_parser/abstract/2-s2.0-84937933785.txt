A spiro-type quaternary ammonium salt, spiro-(1,1â€²)-bipyrrolidinium tetrafluoroborate (SBP-BF<inf>4</inf>) was successfully prepared by an economical and efficient three-step process comprising the cyclization reaction of 1,4-dibromobutane and pyrrolidine, and subsequent ion exchange pathway with KOH followed by neutralization reaction via HBF<inf>4</inf> in the system of ethanol solution. <sup>1</sup>H NMR, <sup>13</sup>C NMR, FI-IR and XPS analyses showed the structure of SBP-BF<inf>4</inf>. The as-obtained SBP-BF<inf>4</inf> was dissolved in AN and used as the electrolyte for supercapacitor. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that, compared with commercial electrolyte TEMA-BF<inf>4</inf>/AN, SBP-BF<inf>4</inf>/AN exhibits high ionic conductivity, lower resistance and improved cycling performance, which is due to its smaller ion size and stable symmetry structure.
