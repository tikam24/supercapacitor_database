A facile route for assembling hollow shelled triple Mn-Cu-Al oxide nanomaterials (HMCA) using the microwave-assisted reduction technique is demonstrated, and the energy and environmental applications such as supercapacitor and photocatalyst are investigated. During the reaction time, MnO2, CuO, and Al2O3 formed a shell layer over the core SiO2 and assembled as a hollow geometrical nanostructure with a uniform size densely populated hairy outer appearance. We have shown that the resultant HMCA exhibited the synergistic effects of a nanocomposite and thereby revealed a distinctive collection of physical and chemical properties such as improved electrochemical capacitive performance capacities, enhanced photocatalytic activities, and increased adsorption. These features collectively confirmed the potential of HMCA as an attractive material for resourceful applications in environmental and energy storage issues.
