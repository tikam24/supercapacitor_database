In this strategy, a unique synthesized nanocube using 6 % Nickel doped tungsten oxide/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite (6 %Ni:WO3/rGO) is scrutinized for its feasibility as electrode material in supercapacitor material (SCs) application utilizing a simple one-step hydrothermal technique. The structural behavior, binding energies, and quality of the synthesized 6 %Ni:WO3/rGO nanocomposite were determined by XRD, FTIR, XPS and Raman analysis. The 6 % Ni:WO3 nanocubes in the Ni-doped WO3 nanocomposite were coated across the exterior of the rGO sheet, according to HR-SEM and HR-TEM images. The 6 %Ni:WO3/rGO (1112.1 at 5 mV/s) nanocomposite revealed enhanced specific capacitance, which was superior to the values of 6 % Ni:WO3 (398.02 at 5 mV/s), and eminent cycling performance possess 95 % retention after a cycle (5,000) at 1 A/g. The 6 % Ni:WO3/rGO has a high specific capacitance of 1385.8F/g and more energy density of 140.23 Whkg−1 at a power density of 2243 Wkg−1 at 1 A/g. This novel strategy should open the way for next-generation SCs with major energy storage capacities.
