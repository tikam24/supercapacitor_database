Two series of activated carbon materials had been successfully prepared by microwave activation and tube furnace heating treatment, for which sugarcane bagasse and ZnCl 2 were used as carbon resource and activating agent respectively. The electrochemical capacitive performance of activated carbon prepared by microwave activation was studied in aqueous and ionic liquid electrolytes. Nitrogen sorption determination shows that the pore structure is closely related to the concentration of activating agent, and the activating method shows rarely effect on the pore structure, while the microwave activation possesses significant advantage in heating efficiency and homogeneity. Structural characterization reveals that the pore size of activated carbons could be tuned from 2.5 nm to 7.0 nm as the concentration of ZnCl 2 solution increases from 20 wt% to 60 wt%. As evidenced by electrochemical measurements, the pore size plays a crucial role for the capacitive performance of activated carbons in ionic liquid electrolyte, and the larger the pore size, the better the capacitance. Ionic liquid supercapacitor could deliver much higher energy density than aqueous supercapacitor. AC60 could deliver 9.2 Wh/kg of energy density while maintaining 2.5 kW/kg of power density.
