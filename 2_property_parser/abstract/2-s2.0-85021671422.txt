Due to their controllable morphologies, tunable porous structures, diverse compositions and easy fabrication, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are an ideal class of precursor material to develop high performance carbon-based materials for energy applications. In this work, two-dimensional (2D) Co/Ni MOFs nanosheets with a molar ratio of Co2+ to Ni2+ of 1 : 1 were first synthesized at room temperature using thiophene-2,5-dicarboxylate (Tdc) and 4,4′-bipyridine (4,4′-Bpy) as organic linkers. As a precursor material, the as-synthesized 2D Co/Ni MOFs nanosheets were further pyrolized at 550 °C in N2 atmosphere to incorporate 2D CoNi alloy nanoparticles into S, N-doped carbon nanosheets (CoNi@SNC) with a surface area of 224 m2 g-1, a porous structure, and good conductivity. Interestingly, it was found that the 2D Co/Ni MOFs nanosheets can be directly used as electrode materials for supercapacitors, delivering a specific capacitance of 312 F g-1 at 1 A g-1, whereas CoNi@SNC derived from its MOFs precursor as an electrode material for supercapacitors exhibits a much higher specific capacitance (1970, 1897 and 1730 F g-1 at 1, 2, 5 A g-1, respectively) with long cycling life (retaining 95.1% of the value at 10 A g-1 after 3000 cycles) and excellent rate capability at a high charge/discharge current. Further, an asymmetric supercapacitor device was constructed with CoNi@SNC as the positive electrode and active carbon as the negative electrode, exhibiting an energy density of 55.7 W h kg-1 at a power density of 0.8 kW kg-1 with lifetime stability up to 4000 charge-discharge cycles (capacitance retention of ∼90.6%). The results demonstrate that electrochemical activation-generated CoNi oxides/oxyhydroxides on the surface of the CoNi alloy nanoparticles in alkaline electrolyte during electrochemical measurements are the electrochemical active species of the CoNi@SNC-constructed supercapacitor. Additionally, the high performance of the CoNi@SNC-constructed supercapacitor can be collectively attributed to its relatively high surface area, which is favourable for the exposure of electrochemical active sites; its porous structure, which promotes redox-related mass transport; and the combination of CoNi alloy nanoparticles with graphitic carbon, which functions as an electron collector to improve electron transfer.
