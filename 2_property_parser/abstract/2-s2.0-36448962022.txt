Prominently enhanced capacitive performance of well-dispersed Ru O2 nanoparticles (NPs) on nitrogen-containing carbon nanotubes directly grown on Si has been achieved. The function of nitrogen amalgamation is to create preferential sites on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with lower interfacial energy for attachment of Ru O2 NPs. This crucial phenomenon leads to a significant improvement of the overall specific capacitance up to the measured scan rate of 2000 mVs. This work demonstrates that superior electrochemical performances for supercapacitor applications can be achieved with Ru O2 -CNT -based electrodes using nitrogen-incorporation technique.
