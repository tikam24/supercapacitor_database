MXenes, a new family of 2D materials, combine hydrophilic surfaces with metallic conductivity. Delamination of MXene produces single-layer nanosheets with thickness of about a nanometer and lateral size of the order of micrometers. The high aspect ratio of delaminated MXene renders it promising nanofiller in multifunctional polymer nanocomposites. Herein, Ti3C2Tx MXene was mixed with either a charged polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA) or an electrically neutral polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to produce Ti3C2Tx/ polymer composites. The as-fabricated composites are flexible and have electrical conductivities as high as 2.2 × 104 S/m in the case of the Ti3C2Tx/PVA composite film and 2.4 × 105 S/m for pure Ti3C2Tx films. The tensile strength of the Ti3C2Tx/PVA composites was significantly enhanced compared with pure Ti3C2Tx or PVA films. The intercalation and confinement of the polymer between the MXene flakes not only increased flexibility but also enhanced cationic intercalation, offering an impressive volumetric capacitance of ~530 F/cm3 for MXene/PVA-KOH composite film at 2 mV/s. To our knowledge, this study is a first, but crucial, step in exploring the potential of using MXenes in polymer-based multifunctional nanocomposites for a host of applications, such as structural components, energy storage devices, wearable electronics, electrochemical actuators, and radiofrequency shielding, to name a few.
