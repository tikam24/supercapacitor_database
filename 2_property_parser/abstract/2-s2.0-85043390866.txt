Despite being considered a nuisance in society, traffic noise can be utilized as a source of electrical energy. This study presents how the integration of a piezoelectric transducer and a super-capacitor can be used to extract such noise into renewable energy in the form of electricity. A prototype was developed and installed strategically between the traffic-congested streets of Lerma and Nicanor Reyes within the university belt area in Sampaloc, Metro Manila, Philippines. The collected average noise level of approximately 75 dB generated 5.5Volts direct current on a small-scale simulation. The sound harnessed using optimal height positioning fully captured the highest decibel level because of the tendency of the sound to grow louder as the prototype gets closer to the source at 5.6 m, a mounting height without obstructions to pedestrians.
