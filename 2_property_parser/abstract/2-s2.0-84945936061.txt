We report a general method for the fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) macroporous graphene/conducting polymer modified electrode and nitrogen-doped graphene modified electrode. This method involves three consecutive steps. First, the 3D macroporous graphene (3D MG) electrode was fabricated electrochemically by reducing graphene oxide dispersion on different conducting substrates and used hydrogen bubbles as the dynamic template. The morphology and pore size of 3D MG could be governed by the use of surfactants and the dynamics of bubble generation and departure. Second, 3D macroporous graphene/polypyrrole (MGPPy) composites were constructed via directly electropolymerizing pyrrole monomer onto the networks of 3D MG. Due to the benefit of the good conductivity of 3D MG and pseudocapacitance of PPy, the composites manifest outstanding area specific capacitance of 196 mF cm-2 at a current density of 1 mA cm-2. The symmetric supercapacitor device assembled by the composite materials had a good capacity property. Finally, the nitrogen-doped MGPPy (N-MGPPy or MGPPy-X) with 3D macroporous nanostructure and well-regulated nitrogen doping was prepared via thermal treatment of the composites. The resultant N-MGPPy electrode was explored as a good electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with the current density value of 5.56 mA cm-2 (-0.132 V vs Ag/AgCl). Moreover, the fuel tolerance and durability under the electrochemical environment of the N-MGPPy catalyst were found to be superior to the Pt/C catalyst.
