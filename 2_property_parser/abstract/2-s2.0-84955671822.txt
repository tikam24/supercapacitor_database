In this study, the supercapacitive performances of manganese oxide films were investigated by adding different carbon nanomaterials, including carbon nanocapsules (CNC), multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and multi-layered graphene. The manganese oxide films were prepared with manganese acetate precursor by sol-gel method, and the post-treatment effects were also examined. With a heat-treatment above 300 °C, the as-prepared amorphous films transformed to a compound of Mn3O4 and Mn2O3 phases, and the smooth surface became rough as well. Cyclic voltammogram (CV) tests showed that the manganese oxide film, which was mixed with 0.05 wt% MWCNTs and annealed at 350 °C for 1 h, exhibited the optimized specific capacitance, 339.1 F/g. During 1000CV cycles, the specific capacitances of original manganese oxide film decreased gradually from 198.7 to 149.1 (75%) F/g. After same number of cycle tests, the modified films containing 0.025 wt% CNC, 0.05 wt% MWCNTs and 0.1 wt% graphene retained 201.8 (64.2%), 267.4 (78.9%) and 193.1 (57.4%) F/g respectively. The results indicates that the supercapacitive performance of manganese oxide films were significantly modified by carbon nanomaterials; in addition, the MWCNTs additive could also reduce the decay rate.
