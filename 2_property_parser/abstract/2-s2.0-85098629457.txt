The supercapacitors are a static energy storage device that can stock and supply energy at an enhanced rate. They exhibit a high-power density coupled with long cycling life which are highly significant for the superior energy storage platforms. In such a way, we prepared cobalt oxide nanostructures using mesoporous silica (M41) as template and used as an electrochemical supercapacitor. The synthesized M41/m-Co3O4 nanobuds were thoroughly characterized for its crystallinity, morphology, composition and surface area. The M41/m-Co3O4 nanobuds were utilized as a modified electrode material in the electrochemical system and studied in 1 M KOH as an electrolyte solution for cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electro impedance spectroscopy studies (EIS). The EIS ensures the effortless charge transfer mechanism which facilitates rapid ion diffusion leading to the high accumulation of charges. Thus, an impressive specific capacitance of 228.87 F gâˆ’1 with excellent cycling stability of 87.5% over 1000 cycles was achieved through our investigation.
