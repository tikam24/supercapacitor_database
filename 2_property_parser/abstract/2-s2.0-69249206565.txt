Cathodic electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method has been developed for the deposition of manganese dioxide films. It was shown that phosphate ester (PE) is an effective charging additive, which provides stabilization of manganese dioxide nanoparticles in suspensions. The influence of PE concentration and deposition voltage on the deposition efficiency has been studied. EPD has been utilized for the fabrication of porous nanostructured films with thickness in the range of 0.5-20 μm for application in electrochemical supercapacitors (ES). Cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry data for the films tested in the 0.1 M Na2SO4 solutions showed capacitive behavior in the voltage window of 1 V. The highest specific capacitance (SC) of ∼377 F g-1 was obtained at a scan rate of 2 mV s-1. The SC decreased with increasing film thickness and increasing scan rate in the range of 2-100 mV s-1. The deposition mechanism, kinetics of deposition and charge storage properties of the films are discussed. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
