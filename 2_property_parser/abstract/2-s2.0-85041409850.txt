The article describes a practical implementation of the induction motor (IM) drive system powered from photovoltaic (PV) panels. The system incorporates an energy storage device, in form of a supercapacitor bank, and enables an AC grid connection. Two system concepts are considered, thus a discussion about the favorable solution is given. A model installation was developed, and the chosen system components are described. Laboratory tests have been conducted and the results are presented.
