Metal compound based hybrid electrochemical energy storage (HEES) is currently emerging as a highly promising solution to provide enhanced storage capacity and high power performance. Properties of metal compound based redox active electrodes, including chemical composition, morphology, crystal structure and conductivity govern the performance of storage devices. In this perspective, we highlight the recent advances on HEES and discuss possible strategies to explore further the electrochemical response and to improve the storage performance. Redox active binders and redox active electrolytes, operating together with metal compound based electrodes, to provide additional charge storage will also be discussed.
