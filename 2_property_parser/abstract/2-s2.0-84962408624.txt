Di(1-aminopyrene)quinone (DAQ) as a quinonecontaining conducting additive is synthesized from a solution reaction of 1-aminopyrene and hydroquinone. To utilize the conductive property of DAQ and its compatibility with activated carbon, a composite electrode for a supercapacitor is also prepared by blending activated carbon and DAQ (3:1 w/w), and its supercapacitive properties are characterized based on the cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge. As a result, the composite electrode adopting DAQ exhibits superior electrochemical properties, such as a higher specific capacitance of up to 160 F•g1 at 100 mV•s1, an excellent high-rate capability of up to 1,000 mV•s1, and a higher cycling stability with a capacitance retention ratio of 82% for the 1,000th cycle.
