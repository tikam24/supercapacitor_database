MnO2 was prepared by using KMnO4 as the oxidant and NaHSO3 as the reducing agent. The samples were analyzed by N2 adsorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge were used to characterize the electrochemical performance of the samples. The results showed the as prepared MnO2 is amorphous with a diameter of 20 to 40 nm and a BET specific surface area of 155.4 m2 g-1. In an electrolyte of 1 mol L-1 (NH4)2SO4, the nanosized MnO2 had typical capacitive characterization in the potential region of -0.4-0.5V (vs. SCE). At a current density of 10mA·cm-2, the MnO2 had a specific capacitance of 325F·g-1.
