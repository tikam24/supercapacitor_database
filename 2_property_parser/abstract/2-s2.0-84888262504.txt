A novel nanostructure of cobalt hydroxide (i.e. nanocapsule) was prepared via cathodic electrodeposition and its electrochemical performance was investigated using cyclic voltammetry and charge-Cdischarge tests. The deposition experiments were performed in the pulse current mode (ton = 10 ms and toff = 10 ms) with applying the current density of 1 mA cm-C2 at low bath temperature of 1-C. The structural and morphological characterization by XRD, IR, SET, TEM and BET techniques showed that the obtained deposit has single crystalline β phase of Co(OH)2 with high surface area capsule-Clike morphology. Mechanism of the β-Co(OH) 2 nanocapsules was proposed and discussed. The electrochemical measurements displayed that the nanocapsules are capable to deliver specific capacitances of 1243.1, 1170.8, 1050.5 and 908.5 Fg-C1 at the scan rates of 2, 5, 10 and 25m Vs-C1, respectively, within the potential range of -C0.25-C0.55 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The results confirmed an excellent contribution of the nanocapsules in the redox reactions, suggesting the potential application in electrochemical supercapacitors. © 2013 The Electrochemical Society.
