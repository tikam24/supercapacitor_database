A magic invention of the material "Graphene" is nothing but a form of pure carbon. It is an isolated one atom thick layer of carbon allotropy named graphite, which is densely packed in a honeycomb lattice. The amazing and unique characteristics of graphene are suitable for designing process of supercapacitor, which is a very high energy storage device with low internal resistance. The high surface area per kg of graphene and high electrical conductivity are the major advantages of using graphene to design supercapacitor. The performance of Graphene based supercapacitor is simulated using MA TLAB (version R2013a). Showing the simulation results with equations, the parameters and characteristics of graphene based supercapacitor are compared to normal batteries. The versatile application of Graphene based supercapacitor by optimizing the high power density and high peak current is also described in this paper.
