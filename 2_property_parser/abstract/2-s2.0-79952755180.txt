An acidic cellulose-chitin hybrid gel electrolyte consisting of cellulose, chitin, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium, 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide, and an aqueous H2SO4 solution is investigated for electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs). This gel electrolyte shows a high ionic conductivity comparable to that observed in an aqueous 2 mol dm-3 H2SO4 solution in 0-80°C. An EDLC cell with the acidic hybrid gel electrolyte has higher capacitance than that with an aqueous H 2SO4 solution in the operation temperature (-10-60°C). Moreover, the capacitance retention of the EDLC cell with the acidic hybrid gel electrolyte is better than a cell with a H2SO4 solution at 60°C over 10,000 cycles. This suggests that the present acidic gel electrolyte has excellent stability in the presence of a strong acid even at a high temperature of 60°C. ©The Electrochemical Society.
