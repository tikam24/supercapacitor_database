In this study, we report the preparation of turbostratic-carbon/graphene from biomass amylose film by carbonization (N2 gas) and activation (CO2 gas) over different temperatures 600, 700, 800, 900, and 1000°C, respectively. The Raman spectroscopy results of the produced samples show that the values of the ID/IG ratio ranging from 0.75 to 0.99 are comparable to that of the commercial multilayer graphene and KOH treated multilayer graphene. The X-ray diffraction results of the produced samples show that a small decrease in the d002 (∼0.62 %) and d100 (∼0.57 %) values and a larger decrease in Lc (∼8.6 %) and La (∼27.2 %) values occurs as the carbonization and activation temperature increases, indicating that the increase in temperature has an effect on the growth of microcrystallites during carbonization and activation. This study demonstrates the potential of the amylose film to be used as a precursor for producing graphene flakes.
