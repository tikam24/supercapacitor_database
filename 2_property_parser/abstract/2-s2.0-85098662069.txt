Iron molybdate (Fe2(MoO4)3) with high valence electrons of Fe3+ and Mo6+ and rich redox reactions renders itself a prospective energy storage material for supercapacitor and lithium-ion battery. However, its low specific capacitance and poor rate performance restrict its rapid development. Herein, transition metal Ni doping of iron molybdate nanocomposites by hydrothermal growth is proposed to address these issues. As a supercapacitor anode, the Ni-doped Fe2(MoO4)3 (NFMO) nanocomposite with the optimal doping mole ratio (Ni/Fe = 0.25:1) shows a decent specific capacitance of 795.97 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, as well as superior rate capability. The as-obtained asymmetric supercapacitor with NFMO as the anode outputs an energy density of 82.44 to 47.87 Wh kg−1 at a power range of 849.91–8489.2 W kg−1. Moreover, the NFNO-0.25:1 battery anode outputs a high capacity of 1109.9 mA h g−1 with considerable rate performance. These results advocate doping is promising to advance the energy storage performance of iron molybdate electrochemical capacitors and lithium-ion batteries.
