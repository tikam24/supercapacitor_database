Transition metal oxides play an important role in energy storage. However, their wide applications suffer from low conductivity and poor stability. In this study, a NiCo2O4 embedded N-doped carbon (NC) composite (NiCo2O4@NC) was synthesized using a novel strategy that combines electrospinning and thermal treatment. NC provides an excellent microenvironment for the Faradic reaction of NiCo2O4, while NiCo2O4 endows an ultrahigh specific capacitance to the composite. The obtained NiCo2O4@NC electrode exhibited a high specific capacitance of 2000.6 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. Furthermore, an asymmetric cell based on NiCo2O4@NC shown excellent energy storage capability, exhibiting a high specific energy of 61.2 Wh kg−1 at 548.6 W kg−1. The superior electrochemical performance of the cell is attributed to the material properties of the components and the unique heterostructure of the composite. The results demonstrate that NiCo2O4@NC is a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.
