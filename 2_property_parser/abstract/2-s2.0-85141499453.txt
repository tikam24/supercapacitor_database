As an attractive electrode material of supercapacitors, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have been greatly exploited. However, the nearly exclusive microporous structure prevented their advantages from being fully utilized, restraining their electrochemical performance. In this work, a hierarchical porous Zr-MOF (HP-Zr-MOF) was prepared via ligand thermolysis method, and its electrochemical performance was investigated. HP-Zr-MOF exhibits a high specific capacitance (492.7 F g−1, 1 A g−1), and good rate performance (362.5 F g−1, 10 A g−1). An asymmetric supercapacitor based on HP-Zr-MOF and activated carbon electrodes was assembled, which delivers a specific capacitance of 107.5 F g−1, and an energy density of 38 Wh kg−1 with a power density of 1341 W kg−1 at 1 A g−1, showing prospective prospect of hierarchical porous MOFs-based electrodes in energy storage application.
