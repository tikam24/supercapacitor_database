The effectiveness of silicon carbide (SiC) nanowires (NW) as electrode material for micro-supercapacitors has been investigated. SiC NWs are grown on a SiC thin film coated with a thin Ni catalyst layer via a chemical vapor deposition route at 950 °C. A specific capacitance in the range of ∼240 μF cm-2 is demonstrated, which is comparable to the values recently reported for planar micro-supercapacitor electrodes. Charge-discharge studies demonstrate the SiC nanowires exhibit exceptional stability, with 95% capacitance retention after 2 × 105 charge/discharge cycles in an environmentally benign, aqueous electrolyte. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.
