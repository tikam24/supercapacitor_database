Micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) as high-power density energy storage units are designed to meet the booming development of flexible electronics, requiring simple and fast fabrication technology. Herein, a fast and direct solvent-free patterning method is reported to fabricate shape-tailorable and flexible MSCs by floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition (FCCVD). The nitrogen-doped single-walled carbon nanotubes (N-SWCNTs) are directly deposited on a patterned filter by FCCVD with designable patterns and facilely dry-transferred on versatile substrates. The obtained MSCs deliver an excellent areal capacitance of 3.6 mF cm−2 and volumetric capacitance of 98.6 F cm−3 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 along with excellent long-term cycle stability over 125 000 circles. Furthermore, the MSCs show good performance uniformity, which can be readily integrated via connection in parallel or series to deliver a stable high voltage (4 V with five serially connected devices) and large capacitance (5.1 mF with five parallel devices) at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, enabling powering the light emitting displays. Therefore, this method blazes the trail of directly preparing flexible, shape-customizable, and high-performance MSCs.
