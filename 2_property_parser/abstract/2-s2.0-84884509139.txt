A metallic manganese coating was successfully electrodeposited from an aqueous solution containingmanganese sulfate and ammonium sulfate at low temperature, and then converted to manganese oxideby anodic oxidation at room temperature. The morphology and pseudocapacitive performance of theobtained oxide were evaluated by SEM, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscope.The results show that the manganese oxide is amorphous and porous, which exhibits a near-rectangularCV curve with broad quasi-reversible redox peaks, and a specific capacitance of 214 F g-1at a CV scan rateof 5 mV s-1. After heat-treatment, the oxide shows a much more symmetrical and rectangular CV curve,better high-rate capability but a lower specific capacitance. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopyreveals that heat-treatment on this material can lead to a lower reaction resistance but a higher diffusionresistance and diffusion time constant.
