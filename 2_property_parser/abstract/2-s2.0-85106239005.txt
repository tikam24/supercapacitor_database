Although electrode materials based on metal organic frameworks (MOFs) were widely studied in the electrochemistry field, the origin of poor conductivity is still a bottleneck restricting their development. Herein, we constructed a conductive circuit by growing a layer of hydroxide on the surface of the Fe-MOF, and composite materials (Fe-MOF@Ni(OH)2) are applied in the fields of supercapacitor, OER, and electrochemical sensing. Fe-MOF@Ni(OH)2 not only maintains the intrinsic advantages of Fe-MOF, but also improves the electrical conductivity. Fe-MOF@Ni(OH)2 exhibits a high specific capacity of 188 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1. The energy density of the asymmetric supercapacitor (Fe-MOF@Ni(OH)2–20//AC) reaches 67.1 Wh kg−1. During the oxygen evolution reaction, the overpotential of the material is 280 mV at 10 mA cm−2, and the Tafel slope is 37.6 mV dec−1. The electrochemical sensing tests showed the detection limit of BPA is 5 μM. Hence, these results provide key insights into the design of multifunctional electrode materials.
