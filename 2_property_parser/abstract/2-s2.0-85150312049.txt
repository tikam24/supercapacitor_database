To fulfill the energy demand of the world, there is a need of sustainable energy sources and storage devices. Supercapacitor is one of the energy storage devices. Among the challenges of developing a good supercapacitor, the most important one is to prepare an electrode. Such electrodes are prepared using variety of physical and chemical methods. Among these, chemical methods are easier and cost-effective. Liquid phase deposition (LPD) is one of the simplest methods among the chemical methods. In this chapter, the main focus is on the electrode materials deposited by LPD method. The electrode materials deposited by LPD for supercapacitor applications are iron oxide (A-Fe2O3), copper oxide (CuO), and layered double hydroxides (LDHs). The chapter also explores the significant changes observed in the electrochemical performance due to deposition on different substrates like flat stainless steel (SS), mesh SS, graphene, nickel foam, e-MXene, and carbon nanotube paper. Such electrodes are evaluated for supercapacitive performance, and results are compared with the literature.
