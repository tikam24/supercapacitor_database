Nanocomposite electrodes receive much attention because of their excellent energy storage nature. Electrodes for supercapacitors have come a major source of interest. In this pursuit, the current work elucidates binder‐free coral reefs resembling ZnO/CoS2 nanoarchitectures synthesized on the surface of Ni foams employing the cost‐effective hydrothermal route. The Zno/CoS2 nanocomposite demonstrated excellent battery‐type behavior, which can be employed for supercapcitor application. Various analyses were carried out in the current study, such as X‐ray diffraction and high‐resolution scanning electron microscopy, which allowed defining the crystalline nature and morphology of surface with ZnO/CoS2 nanoarchitectures. Electrochemical measures such as cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge discharge, and potentiostatic impedance spectroscopy confirmed the battery‐type behavior of the material. The synthesized precursors of binder‐free ZnO/CoS2 nanostructures depicted an excellent specific capacity of 400.25 C∙g−1 at 1 A∙g−1, with a predominant cycling capacity of 88. 2% and retention holding of 68% at 10 A∙g−1 and 2 A∙g−1, even after 4000 cycles, representing an improvement compared to the pristine ZnO and CoS2 electroactive materials. Therefore, the electrochemical and morphological analyses suggest the excellent behavior of the ZnO/CoS2 nanoarchitectures, making them promising for supercapacitors.
