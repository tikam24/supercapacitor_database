Energy saving is the key point for economic development. Energy is conventionally wasted by a braking resistor in general elevator drives. The bidirectional DC-DC converter is used to control the power flow about power supply and the supercapacitor bank and the elevator motor. The supercapacitor bank stores the surplus energy in regenerative status and releases the storage energy in motor status. A novel energy saving control strategy with fuzzy logic controller is proposed in the ride-through system. Simulations are performed to study the behaviors of the energy saving system under all kinds of operating conditions. There is a 58.6% energy saving exclusive of the efficiency of gear and sheave in the simulation case. Simulation results prove the feasibility of the fuzzy logic control strategy in this hybrid energy system.
