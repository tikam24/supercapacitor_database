The presented article will describe an 'effectcause' model for the purpose of simulating the energy consumption of DC fed light rail vehicles. The model will assess the advantages of hybrid vehicles in terms of energy consumption, network power and voltage variations, line current and losses; and will help sizing and designing a supercapacitor based Energy Storage System (ESS) for both on-board, and stationary applications. The proposed modeling needs to allow the ESS sizing according to the objective that needs to be achieved, being braking energy recovery, voltage drop compensation and peak power shaving the most common goals of ESS use in hybrid vehicles. The needed power and energy levels will vary in function of the vehicle features and the driving cycle followed. This all can be determined by the quasi-static simulation tool to ease the design process. Another objective of the modeling tool is to evaluate the behaviour of the vehicle power flow controller, which manages the power from/to the ESS in function of the state of several variables.
