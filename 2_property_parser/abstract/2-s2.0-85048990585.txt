In order to solve the uneven distribution of carbon nanotube (CNT)/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) composite and enhance its electrochemical energy storage performances, a CNT/RGO macroscopic body was prepared by partially oxidation stripping CNT via modified Hummers method. The CNT is partially stripped to prepare the composite of CNT and graphene oxide, and subsequently processed by L-ascorbic acid auxiliary reduction, freeze-drying and annealing to obtain the macroscopic body of CNT/RGO composite, which can be directly assembled into electrochemical supercapacitor without any bonder agent. Characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and laser Raman spectroscopy, CNT and RGO are demonstrated to been distributed evenly in the obtained composite and their macroscopic body owes considerably large specific surface area (581.4 m2/g) with massive mesopores. The specific capacitance of CNT/RGO is up to 128 F/g (organic electrolyte) and only 4.37% decay rate is found after 2000 cycles, showing its superior potential in electrochemical energy storage field.
