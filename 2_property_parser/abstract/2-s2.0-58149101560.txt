In a single phase inverter, momentary power pulsate with double frequency of the output. In the case of UPS with single phase inverter, it causes the fact that DC input voltage to inverter is pulsated and output voltage is distorted. In this paper, to control this pulsating input voltage, the single phase PWM inverter is applied to a discrete-time model following control. The output characteristics of the inverter changed with of the voltage of Electric Double Layer Capacitor(EDLC) are described. The results are shown that this control method can amend for the change of the input voltage. Â© 2008 IEEE.
