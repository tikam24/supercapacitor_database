Graphene is an attractive soft material for various applications due to its unique and exclusive properties. The processing and preservation of 2D graphene at large scales is challenging due to its inherent propensity for layer restacking. Three-dimensional graphene-based nanomaterials (3D-GNMs) preserve their structures while improving processability along with providing enhanced characteristics, which exhibit some notable advantages over 2D graphene. This feature article presents recent trends in the fabrication and characterization of 3D-GNMs toward the study of their morphologies, structures, functional groups, and chemical compositions using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Owing to the attractive properties of 3D-GNMs, which include high surface areas, porous structures, improved electrical conductivity, high mechanical strength, and robust structures, they have generated tremendous interest for various applications such as energy storage, sensors, and energy conversion. This article summarizes the most recent advances in electrochemical applications of 3D-GNMs, pertaining to energy storage, where they can serve as supercapacitor electrode materials and energy conversion as oxygen reduction reaction catalysts, along with an outlook.
