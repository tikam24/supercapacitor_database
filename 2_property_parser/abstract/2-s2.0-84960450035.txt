Stretchable electrochemical supercapacitor exploiting laser-induced graphene (LIG) transfer onto elastomeric substrates is reported. Elastomeric energy-storage devices are fabricated using polymeric electrolyte and all-PDMS (all-polydimethylsiloxane) architecture. The symmetric LIG/PDMS supercapacitor can sustain repeated charge-discharge cycles without suffering significant deterioration of specific capacitance even under stretching and bending conditions.
