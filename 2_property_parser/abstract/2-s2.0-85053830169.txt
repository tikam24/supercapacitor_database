DC microgrids (DCMG) are widely spreading in many application from last decade due to its merits over counter parts available. Especially DCMGs gained more popularity in telecommunication, data centers, IT hubs, etc. As these loads are sensitive in nature, necessitates stiff bus voltage against all source/load variations. Present papers in the literature proposed either new control and management techniques or utilizes high power density storage devices for achieving this. However, these papers use extra converters and control processors. A new system is proposed by making the supercapacitor as DC link capacitor in DCMG. This eliminates extra converter and its control, DC link capacitor at each source output. Proposed system is simple, reliable and efficient in making bus voltage more rigid and hassle free. Simulation of proposed system is executed on isolated DCMG in Simulink/MATLAB platform to validate its effectiveness.
