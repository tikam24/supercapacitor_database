In electrochemical cells, magnetic resonance permits the analysis of electrode materials as they change during the redox reactions; it gives information on both crystalline and amorphous phases. Although static NMR is not very sensitive, in situ static NMR has advantages: we need one single cell, and we obtain the exact chronology and the quantity of the different phases.We give technical details on the cells, on in situ NMR technique, and on progress in applications. We present solid-state 7Li/31P examples on negative and positive electrodes for lithium-ion batteries. The bulk magnetic susceptibility effect on flat cells and the skin-depth RF penetration are addressed. In complete batteries, the determination of lithium dendrite deposit in nonstandard conditions is simple. In supercapacitors, electrolyte spectra are easy to obtain but the shifts are small and difficult to interpret.
