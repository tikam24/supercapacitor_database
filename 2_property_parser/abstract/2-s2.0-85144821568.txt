Flexible supercapacitors (SCs) have attracted growing interest as the power source for portable and wearable electronics. In the present work, we report the CNTs (Carbon Nanotubes) buckypaper integrated with electroactive 2D materials including graphene, graphene oxide (GO), and transition metal sulphides (TMDs), especially tin sulphide (SnS2). The flexible and free-standing, interface-enhanced CNT paper having homogeneously dispersed 2D materials was prepared using a traditional scalable casting method. The hybridized CNT films were thoroughly characterized to elucidate their structural and surface properties. Finally, such hybrid CNT films were used as free-standing electrodes without any binder for the fabrication of flexible-solid-state supercapacitor (FSSSs) devices. In the FSSS, the electrochemical interactions between hybrid CNT paper electrodes and a polymer gel electrolyte were studied. In the symmetric configuration, the CNT-SnS2 electrodes reach the highest areal and volumetric capacitance of 533 mF/cm2 and 63 mF/cm3, respectively, almost four times that of pristine CNT electrodes, whereas CNT-GO-based electrodes display high-rate capability. The CNT-SnS2-based symmetric FSSS devices exhibit an extended voltage window of 1.5 V with a high capacitance of 133 mF/cm2 and show high cyclic stability for 5000 cycles under 180 0 bendings.
