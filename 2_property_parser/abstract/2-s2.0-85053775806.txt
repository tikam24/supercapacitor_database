This paper is concerned with a physical model and computer simulation describing joint processes of attosecond bi-electronics and femtosecond electronics at the supra-atomic level of materials. It has been proved that an external attosecond pulse of electromagnetic radiation excites an electrostatic χ-string of the gauge electromagnetic field in materials, which entangles a subatomic electron pair (ē∼χ∼ē). This string is a result of spontaneous breaking of the gauge electronic field symmetry of the condensed state. The quantum coherence length of attosecond propagation in a subatomic entangled electron pair varies from 0.1 nm to 10 nm and determines a spatial supra-atomic level in non-equilibrium materials. Attosecond processes of bielectronics and femtosecond processes of standard electronics take place at the nanometre scale of materials from one to several thousand atoms. General approaches of thermo-field dynamics and quantum field chemistry of the condensed state describe joint parallel energy dissipation processes in the Fermi gas of electrons and the Bose gas of bi-electrons. Boundaries of bi-electron supercapacitor electrostatic χ-strings confine a part of nuclei and an electron Fermi gas inside their compact spatial basin. They create quantum nanoelectromechanical system energy storage. This paper presents main stages of the genesis of quantum nanoelectromechanical system energy storage using attosecond pulses of ultra-violet and soft X-ray radiation. The paper also provides computer modelling of the quantum nanoelectromechanical system with 500 atomic cuboids in the face centred cubic (FCC) crystal lattice of the palladium group metals at the temperature of 77 K. It is shown that these cuboids stable accumulate energy about 1 keV that corresponds with quanta of soft X-ray radiation.
