Large-scale uniform Ni-Co-Se bimetallic ternary nanowires have been successfully synthesized through a successive cation exchange. First, NiSe nanowires in situ grown on nickel foam (NF) were prepared by a facile solvothermal route. Next, a series of ternary materials possessing different proportions of Ni and Co were fabricated by a Co-exchange method using the Ni@NiSe material as a template, which effectively achieved morphological inheritance from the parent material. To explore the electrochemical performance, all synthetic materials were assembled into asymmetric supercapacitor devices. Among asymmetric supercapacitor devices, the Ni@Ni0.8Co0.2Se//active carbon (AC) device exhibited a high specific capacitance of 86 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 and excellent cycling stability with virtually no decrease in capacitance after 2000 continuous charge-discharge cycles. This device still delivered an energy density of 17 Wh kg-1 even at a high power density of 1526.8 W kg-1. These superior electrochemical properties of Ni@Ni0.8Co0.2Se as an electrode material for supercapacitor devices confirmed the synergistic effect between Co and Ni ions, suggesting their potential application in the field of energy storage.
