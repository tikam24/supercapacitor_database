In this paper, we report the successful design and synthesis of a novel hybrid hierarchical Bi2S3/MoS2nanosheet array on Mo foil by one-step hydrothermal reaction. The nanosheet array could not only provide large surface area and a close contact between the active materials and substrate, but also effectively weaken the agglomeration and restacking problems during the electrochemical reaction, ensuring the high rate and long-life. As a result, the hybrid electrode exhibits a strong synergetic effect for the facilitated electronic transport and enhanced electrochemical performance. When it is tested as supercapacitor electrode, the Bi2S3/MoS2hetero-structure shows a capacitance of 1.45 F cm−2at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is about 10 times of the pristine MoS2sample (0.12 F cm−2at 10 mA cm−2), and excellent cycling stability (96.5% retention after 1000 cycles).
