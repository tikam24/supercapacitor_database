The electrochemical properties of 2D nanomaterials are strongly dependent on their morphology and crystal structure. In this work, we have prepared 2D-MoS2 nanosheets with controlled morphology through the addition of cationic, anionic, and non-ionic surfactants using the hydrothermal method. The morphology of the as-prepared samples is confirmed with SEM and TEM analysis. Galvanostatic charge storage measurements show that the hydrangea flower-like MoS2 electrode has a high specific capacity of 304 C/g at 1 A/g current density. The fabricated symmetric supercapacitor with this electrode material gives a high energy density and power density of 37 Wh/kg and 650 W/kg, respectively, with high stability over 35,000 cycles.
