Nanocrystalline NiO electrode is successfully electrosynthesized for supercapacitor application. The nanocrystalline NiO electrode is characterized using scanning electron microscope (SEM). Nickel oxide is a highly porous and the film surface looked smooth and composed of fine elongated particles. The supercapacitive performance of NiO electrode is tested using cyclic voltammetry (C-V) technique in 0.5M Na2S2O3 electrolyte within potential range of -1.2 to +1.2 V. The effect of scan rate on the capacitance of NiO electrode is studied. The highest specific capacitance of 439 Fg-1 at the voltage scan rate of 50mVs-1 is achieved. Additionally stability and charging-discharging of NiO electrode are studied. Â© 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.
