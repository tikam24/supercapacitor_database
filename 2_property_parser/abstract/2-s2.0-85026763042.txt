A new covalent organic framework material (NWNU-COF-1) with hexagonal honeycomb-like structure linked by –NH– bond was synthesized by the condensation reaction of melamine and 2,4,6-trichloro-1,3,5-triazine and its structure and properties were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), N2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The BET specific surface area of NWNU-COF-1 is 301.149 m2 g−1, and the pore size is about 1.41 nm, and the preparation is simple and cheap. This material is expected to be used in the field of electrode materials of supercapacitor and adsorbent materials.
