Herein, high capacitive supercapacitor performance of porous carbon electrode material obtained from waste banana bract was created by two-step chemical activation using KOH. Based on the findings of the structural analysis, the effective pore size contribution to the electrochemical performance in a neutral electrolyte (1M Na2SO4) was examined using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques on porous carbon samples activated at temperatures between 500 and 800°C and exhibiting Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface areas ranging from 22.9 to 513 m2g−1. The highest specific capacitance of 472 Fg−1 was obtained by the typical rectangular CV profile in the potential window range of -0.2 to +1 V for 800 °C. At 1 Ag−1, the high energy density of 86 Whkg−1 at 1.28 kWkg−1 of power density was reached with the capacitance retention of 93.5% at 5000 cycles at 10 Ag−1. These findings demonstrate the viability of using porous carbon from waste bracts in high-performance supercapacitors.
