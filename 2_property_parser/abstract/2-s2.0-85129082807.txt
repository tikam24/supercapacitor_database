In a facile solvothermal process, a new WS2-based (W4S7F) phase is synthesized and used as an active material for supercapacitor electrode. The first principle calculations, confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) investigations, have revealed that the monoclinic structure of W4S7F is energetically more stable than metastable WS2 phases. Specific capacitance (Cs) of 774 F/g at 2 A/g is achieved in electrochemical investigations for W4S7F in 5 M LiCl compared to 353 F/g for WS2. The new phase also provides capacitance retention of 88.6% after 5000 cycles at 5 A/g. Mott-Schottky test shows that Fluorine (F) has brought 80% more charge carriers for the material. Besides, UVâ€“visible spectroscopy, coinciding with theoretical investigations, shows that the bandgap is reduced from 1.31 eV for WS2 to zero for W4S7F. Furthermore, 5 different electrolytes, LiCl, KCl, KOH, Na2SO4, and H2SO4 are studied. It is shown that potential window of the supercapacitor can be extended from 1 to about 1.9 V using 2 M KCl, which yields the best combination of capacitance and potential window among studied electrolytes. However, regarding charge storage, 5 M LiCl gives Cs of about 7 times more than other electrolytes by intercalation mechanism.
