The energy management issue of a hydrogen fuel cell (FC) with ultracapacitors (UCs) for applications with high instantaneous dynamic power is considered. Singular perturbation approach is employed for the control of two converters and converter losses. The proposed controller uses the current and voltage measurements of load. The convergence of the voltage controller under converter losses is analysed by using Lyapunov theory. According to a significant FC-UCs benchmark, experimental results highlight the interest of the proposed approach and also show the difficulty due to converter losses.
