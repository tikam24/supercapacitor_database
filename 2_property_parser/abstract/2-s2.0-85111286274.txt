We report all-solid-state Na+ ion electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) for the first time in this study. These are fabricated using a novel Na+ ion solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) and high surface area (877 m2-g−1) activated carbon electrodes. Using salt (NaI), polyethylene oxide (PEO) and nano particles of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NZSP), hybrid electrolyte films with compositions 10NaI-90[PEO1-xNZSPx], where 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.7 are synthesized by a novel milling assisted route. The freestanding flexible film for x = 0.7 exhibits a maximum ionic conductivity of ~ 10−4 Ω−1 cm−1 at room temperature. The 2032 type EDLC with graphite current collector and polymer electrolyte film of composition x = 0.4 exhibits notably high value of specific capacitance (~ 104 F-g−1), and specific energy (~ 44 Wh-Kg−1) with a voltage stability window of ~ 2 volts. The NZSP content in the electrolyte influence the EDLC performance. The EDLCs with graphite sheet as current collector offer superior performance as compared to copper. Galvanostatic charge-discharge studies suggest stability of these supercapacitors at least upto ~ 400 cycles.
