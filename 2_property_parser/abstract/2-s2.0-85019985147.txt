Electric Vehicles (EVs) adopting both batteries and supercapacitors have attracted a significant amount of attention in research communities due to its unique power sharing capabilities. A Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) can effectively reduce power stress that would otherwise be applied to batteries alone, and whose weight and size is still a common concern when competing against conventional ICE-powered cars. In this paper, a high-level control strategy is developed to adaptively split the load between two sources for an electric vehicle adopting HESS under real-life load fluctuations. A converter - Supercapacitor Pack (SP) coupled HESS upon which such an algorithm is deployed on, is proposed to divert excess power into the SP via a smart Power Converter (PC) which is located in between in order to regulate both behaviors. Such a power split strategy (PSS) is designed in such a way to track real-time load profiles and determines one important variable - the cut-off frequency. A simplified HESS model is first developed. The power split algorithm is coded in Matlab and then applied to this HESS model. Finally, the overall system is tested comprehensively over 4 EPA driving cycles. Simulation results prove its effectiveness in coping with even the harshest driving scenarios in real life.
