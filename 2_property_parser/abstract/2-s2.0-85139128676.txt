The WLTP Class 3 driving cycle is used in this article for the design of a battery and super-capacitor for electric vehicles. The energy demand for electric vehicle is calculated using WLTP drive cycle and the total power required for electric vehicle is calculated by calculating tractive force. A hybrid energy storage system (HESS) overcomes numerous shortcomings of a battery energy storage system (BESS), including reduced battery life, limited power density, etc. In a proposed system, a Li-Ion battery is coupled with a super-capacitor/Ultra-capacitor as a bidirectional converter, where the Li-Ion battery is the primary energy source, while the Super Capacitor/Ultra-capacitor is an auxiliary energy source. The range of battery and Super Capacitor/ultra-capacitor sizes for Tata Nixon 2020 are calculated and simulated using the MATLAB/SIMULINK environment to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed model.
