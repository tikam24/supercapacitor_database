This article proposes a load balancer to meet the unbalance voltage and charge balancing between capacitors issues. A distributed charge balancing in a 1-D grid of supercapacitor is studied in this paper. Different mathematical finding are developed and demonstrated. The stability of the 1-D grid of supercapacitors is shown by Matlab and described in the results analysis. Finally the MULTISIM platform simulator, was used to simulate and visualize the dynamic charge balancing of the 1-D grid of supercapacitors.
