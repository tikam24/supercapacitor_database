In the article a new structure of a three-loop control system for an energy storage device as part of a frequency-controlled electric drive is proposed. The energy storage device consists of a bidirectional DC/DC converter, with two IGBT transistors, and a block of supercapacitors. The developed control system is based on the principles of subordinate control and consists of 3 loops: the internal loop of the supercapacitor current, external loop for controlling the voltage on the input of PWM inverter and an intermediate loop of supercapacitor voltage. Controller structures for each loop are given. In comparison with transport applications, the energy storage device control system should have a higher performance, which leads to the requirement for considering the nonlinear properties of the DC/DC converter as a control object. The system efficiency is confirmed by the simulation results on the example of the flying shears electric drive.
