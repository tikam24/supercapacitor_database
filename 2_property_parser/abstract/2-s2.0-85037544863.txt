This paper studies the control strategy of stationary supercapacitor energy storage system in the application of urban rail transit.In the beginning, a mathematical model including trains, energy storage systems and braking resistors is established, and the influencing factors of energy distribution between supercapacitor and braking resistor when the train is braking are analyzed.Then the control strategy considering train's operating status is proposed.The proposed strategy adjusts the charging-voltage command dynamically according to the train's real-time power and position.Consequently, the charging power of supercapacitor is also regulated to ensure the energy storage system to work in its optimum state.In order to verify the feasibility of the proposed strategy, a real-train operation experiment is carried out using the supercapacitor energy storage system with MW-power level which is installed in Liyuan station of Beijing Subway Batong line.The field experiment shows that the proposed control strategy effectively improves the supercapacitor capacity utilization, thus increases the energy saving of energy storage system and reduces the total operating consumption of the urban rail system.
