Abstract A graphitized carbide-derived carbon (CDC), synthesized by chlorination of TiC at 1000Â°C, has high specific surface area (SSA), hierarchical micro- and meso-pores, and excellent electrical conductivity. However, the low hydrophilicity leads to poor supercapacitive in alkaline electrolyte. A strategy that introducing oxygen-containing functional groups onto the graphitized CDC by nitrate acid treatment is presented to improve its surface wettability. The treated CDC exhibits a great increase in specific capacitance (from 11.3 to 146 F g<sup>-1</sup>) and, most interestingly, an enhanced power capability, a rectangular shape being maintained in CV curves even at the scan rate of 500 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. The superiority of the treated CDC is caused by the improved wettability, maintained mesopores and high accessible SSA. Moreover, the introduction of oxygen-containing functional groups contributes the pseudocapacitance of graphitized CDC. Therefore, HNO<inf>3</inf> treatment is a promising way to improve the supercapacitive performance of graphitized carbon materials with mesopores and high specific surface area.
