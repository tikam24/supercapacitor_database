With the increasing use of supercapacitors (SCs) in the transportation and energy sectors, reliability which relates to the lifecycle performance and cost, becomes an important aspect to consider. While existing overviews of SCs mainly focus on materials, electrical and thermal modeling, voltage balancing, etc., this paper reviews the failure mechanisms, lifetime modeling, and reliability-oriented design of three types of SCs in energy storage applications. Systematic discussions on electric double-layer capacitors, pseudo-capacitors, and hybrid SCs are given. Scientific challenges and opportunities are also identified from an application perspective.
