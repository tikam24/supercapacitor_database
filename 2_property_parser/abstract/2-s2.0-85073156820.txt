The implementation of sustainable strategies based on the integral valorization of residues is the most efficient way to achieve a profitable circular economy. This comprehensive study highlights the potential of apple waste from juice and cider production as a precursor of porous carbons and provides guidelines to achieve a wide spectrum of physicochemical properties. Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of apple bagasse is proposed as a feasible integrated process with zero waste that allows stabilizing this highly pollutant residue in the form of a carbon-enriched solid while extracting valuable compounds in the aqueous phase. The liquid fraction resulting from HTC at 200 Â°C contains a high total phenolic content and antioxidant activity, the major products being catechol (1,2-dihydroxybenzene) and 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural (HMF). The successful upgrading of the solid byproduct into porous carbons provides additional advantage for a more cost-effective waste management. It is reported that a simple one-step activation leads to apple-derived carbons with specific surface areas up to 2000 m2 g-1 and electrochemical capacitances as high as 260-290 F g-1. Their excellent performance as supercapacitor electrodes make them very promising for the storage of electrical energy from renewable sources.
