Transition metal compounds containing nickel and copper have been investigated as electrode materials for energy storage. (Ni,Cu)(OH)2CO3 and α-Ni(OH)2 with different Ni/Cu ratios are synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method. All the samples show the similar dandelion-like morphology. It is demonstrated that the mole ratio of Ni to Cu is a key factor to influence the phase and electrochemical performances of the products. Carbonate anions will be intercalated into nickel copper layered double hydroxides with a hydrotalcite structure when the sample is nickel-rich, which will lead to much better electrochemical properties compared with the copper-rich samples with crystalline (Ni,Cu)(OH)2CO3 structure. Among all the materials, sample (Ni0.89Cu0.11)2(OH)2CO3 can deliver the highest specific capacitance of 1017.3 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and retain 68.5% of the original value after 4000 cycles at 5 A g−1. Meanwhile, an asymmetric capacitor which is assembled by using the optimized material as a positive electrode and activated carbon as a negative electrode exhibits a high energy density of 38.56 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 850.01 W kg−1 and a high power density of 8407.4 W kg−1 at an energy density of 21.7 Wh kg−1. Based on the above results, nickel copper carbonate hydroxides are of potential application for energy storage.
