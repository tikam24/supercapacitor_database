Polyaniline (NL-PANI) was prepared with ammonium sulfate (APS) as oxidant, and Nafion and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethane-sulfonate ([Emim]OTF) as soft template at room temperature. SEM as results show that NL-PANI is 3D nanofibrous structure with uniform size and pore distribution. The symmetric supercapacitor was assembled with NL-PANI as active substance and 1. 0 mol·L-1 H2SO4 as electrolyte. At a current density of 0. 1 A·g-1, the specific capacitance of NL-PANI is 650. 49 F·g-1. When the current density increases from 0. 1 A·g-1 to 1. 0 A·g-1, the specific capacity retention rate is 82. 46%. NL-PANI has excellent capacitance performance and rate performance.
