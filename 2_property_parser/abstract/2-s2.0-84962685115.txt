The ternary composite of polyaniline/boron doped nanocrystalline diamond/carbon fiber (PAni/BDND/CF) was produced and characterized regarding its application as electrode for supercapacitor device. BDND films were grown on CF by Hot Filament Chemical Vapor Deposition technique, using CH4, H2 and Ar, in order to obtain the BDND/CF binary composite. PAni synthesis was made on BDND/CF by using a NaCl/HCl solution with distilled aniline, during 60 min, producing the PAni/BDND/CF ternary composite. Both of them were morphological, structural, and electrochemically characterized. FEG-SEM images showed that BDND and PAni coatings covered and enwrapped the fibers. Raman spectra confirmed the quality of the composites. Cyclic voltammetry indicated that the ternary composite presented high current density and capacitance response. Charge/discharge curves showed great charge storage capacity and good electrochemical reversibility for the PAni/BDND/CF composite. In addition, its high capacitive response associated to its low charge transfer resistance was confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results. The ternary composite presented a specific capacitance of 294 F/g in 1 mol/L H2SO4. Therefore, PAni/BDND/CF showed to be a promising electrode material for supercapacitor application.
