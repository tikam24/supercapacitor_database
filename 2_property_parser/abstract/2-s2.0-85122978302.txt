A novel strategy of incorporating conducting additive to enhance the performance of NaMnPO4-based Na-ion supercapacitors is presented. It is observed that forming composite with a conducting polymer, leads to nearly two-fold increment in the specific capacitance of a Na-ion based system. The higher conductivity, fast Faradaic response alongside with greater number of ion transport channels lead to this improvement. Here, the best performance is obtained at an optimized polyaniline (PANi) percentage of 30 wt%, where a specific capacitance of 201 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 current density was observed. This is more than twice the value obtained by pure NaMnPO4. The fabricated supercapacitors also deliver 26.5 W h kg−1 specific energy and high cycling stability.
