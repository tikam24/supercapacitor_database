In this work, we developed a novel and facile method to fabricate a Co3O4/ZnO nanoheterostructure via a solid-solid conversion process using core-shell MOFs@MOFs as a template and source of cobalt and zinc. Herein, we set out to prepare core-shell structured ZIF-8@ZIF-67, which consists of ZIF-8 ([Zn(MeIm)2]n) (MeIm = 2-methylimidazole) as the core and ZIF-67 ([Co(MeIm)2]n) as the shell, through a seed-mediated growth method. Co3O4/ZnO nanoheterostructure was prepared through the thermal conversion of core-shell ZIF-8@ZIF-67. This hierarchical Co3O4/ZnO exhibits a high specific capacitance of 415 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 and an improved rate capability (93.2% retention at 10 A g-1). Asymmetric supercapacitors were fabricated using the Co3O4/ZnO heterostructure as the positive electrode and active carbon as negative electrode. The operation voltage is expanded to 1.4 V in aqueous electrolyte, revealing an energy density of 43.2 W h kg-1 at a power density of 1401 W kg-1. This MOF-driven strategy can be expanded to the preparation of other metal oxide nanoheterostructures by varying the type of MOFs, and may find potential application in high-performance supercapacitors.
