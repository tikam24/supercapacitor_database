The industries all over the world are increasing manifold and efforts are being made to generate energy using renewable sources to compensate for depleting fossil fuels. The large energy being generated using various non-conventional sources need to be stored for a long period for its efficient use. An ultracapacitor (UC) is a high-capacity electrochemical capacitor whose capacitance values are much higher than other usual capacitors. Hybrid ultracapacitor (HUC) uses electrodes with differing characteristics: one exhibiting mostly electrostatic capacitance and the other mostly electrochemical capacitance. In this project, we emphasize upon comparing the characteristics of UC and HUC and deciding the suitability of these in various industrial applications. Also, the concept of flash charging, which is recently gaining momentum for charging of ultracapacitor driven short distance city buses, is presented in this paper.
