In this study, we propose a versatile method for synthesizing uniform three-dimensional (3D) metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides (MXenes)/metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) composites (Ti3C2TX/Cu-BTC, Ti3C2TX/Fe,Co-PBA, Ti3C2TX/ZIF-8, and Ti3C2TX/ZIF-67) that combine the advantages of MOFs and MXenes to enhance stability and improve conductivity. Subsequently, 3D hollow Ti3C2TX/ZIF-67/CoV2O6 composites with excellent electron- and ion-transport properties derived from Ti3C2TX/ZIF-67 were synthesized. The specific capacitance of the Ti3C2TX/ZIF-67/CoV2O6 electrode was 285.5 F g−1, which is much higher than that of the ZIF-67 and Ti3C2TX/ZIF-67 electrode. This study opens a new avenue for the design and synthesis of MXene/MOF composites and complex hollow structures with tailorable structures and compositions for various applications.
