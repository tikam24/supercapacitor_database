Cobalt oxide (CoCo2O4) porous nanowires are synthesized by a microwave assisted hydrothermal process (MHP) followed by annealing. Electrochemical evaluations show that the MHP CoCo2O4nanowire arrays possess higher specific capacity (743.8 C g−1/206.6 mA h g−1at 1 A g−1), better rate performance (67.7% retention at 15 A g−1) and more excellent cycling performance (89.7% retention after 5000 cycles), compared to those prepared by a conventional hydrothermal process (CHP, 372.1 C g−1/103.4 mA h g−1, 60.3% and 71.2%). It is found that the introduction of microwave assistance led to an improvement in the precursor's purity. More importantly, the crystal structure of this precursor was distorted, which in turn resulted in an expansion in the crystalline lattice of the annealed CoCo2O4. Compared to the CHP, the as-synthesized CoCo2O4by the MHP showed a different crystallographic structure and micromorphology, which enlarged the withstand voltage range and improved the electronic conductivity of the electrode. Furthermore, the assembled CoCo2O4//microwaved carbon nanotube (m-CNT) battery-supercapacitor hybrid device displays a high energy density of 26.8 W h kg−1at 775.4 W kg−1power density with outstanding cycle life (82.3% capacity retention after 8000 cycles). In conclusion, the larger specific surface area, better electronic conductivity, and expanded crystalline lattice and voltage window, resulting from microwave assistance, enhance the electrochemical properties of the MHP CoCo2O4
