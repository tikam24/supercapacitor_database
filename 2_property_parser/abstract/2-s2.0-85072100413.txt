We have already designed a novel multicolor electrochromic (EC) device having hybrid capacitor electrochromic device based on 4,4'-biphenyl dicarboxylic acid diethyl ester and phenothiazine molecule with carbon electrode. In this paper, effect of electrical double layer capacitance on coloration performance was analyzed and discussed.
