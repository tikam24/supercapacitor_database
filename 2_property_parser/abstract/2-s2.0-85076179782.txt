Despite cobalt molybdenum sulfide (CoMoS4)-based materials are a prospective class of electrode material for supercapacitors, their relatively inferior rate capability and cyclic stability have severely restricted practical applications. Engineering multicomponent binder-free electrode material is deemed an effective approach to fulfill the demand of high-performance supercapacitors. Herein, the hierarchical core-shell hollow CoMoS4@Ni–Co–S nanotubes supported on flexible carbon cloth are designed through a scalable hydrothermal method combined with electrodeposition process. Due to the synergistic contribution of highly conductive CoMoS4 nanotubes core and highly active nickel cobalt sulfide nanosheets shell, the 3D hierarchical CoMoS4@Ni–Co–S nanotubes electrode achieves a remarkable specific capacitance of 2208.5 F g−1 at a rate of 1 A g−1 and extraordinary cycling life (91.3% capacitance retention over 5000 cycles at 3 A g−1). Moreover, the assembled CoMoS4@Ni–Co–S//activated carbon (AC) asymmetric supercapacitor presents satisfactory electrochemical performance, delivering an energy density of 49.1 W h kg−1 at a high power density of 800 W kg−1 and competitive cyclic stability (90.3% retention of initial capacity after 10000 cycles). This work designs an effective synthetic route and validates the potential prospects of binder-free 3D hierarchical architecture for developing high-performance and advanced energy storage devices.
