Amorphous ruthenium oxide (Ru O2) thin films of uniformly distributed spherical nanoregime grains were synthesized by the liquid-phase chemical bath deposition route at room temperature (333 K) for the first time. It is an attractive synthesis route to fabricate Ru O2 electrodes for high electrochemical supercapacitor applications. Chemically deposited Ru O2 thin films showed a bandgap energy of 3.37 eV and exhibited >400 Fg specific capacitance at the scan rate of 5 mVs in 0.5 M H2 S O4. Â© 2007 The Electrochemical Society.
