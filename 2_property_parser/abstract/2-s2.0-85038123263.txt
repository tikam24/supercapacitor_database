A lightweight, flexible, and highly efficient energy management strategy is highly desirable for flexible electronic devices to meet a rapidly growing demand. Herein, Ni–Co–S nanosheet array is successfully deposited on graphene foam (Ni–Co–S/GF) by a one-step electrochemical method. The Ni–Co–S/GF composed of Ni–Co–S nanosheet array which is vertically aligned to GF and provides a large interfacial area for redox reactions with optimum interstitials facilitates the ions diffusion. The Ni–Co–S/GF electrodes have high specific capacitance values of 2918 and 2364 F g−1 at current densities of 1 and 20 A g−1, respectively. Using such hierarchical Ni–Co–S/GF as the cathode, a flexible asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is further fabricated with polypyrrple(PPy)/GF as the anode. The flexible asymmetric supercapacitors have maximum operation potential window of 1.65 V, and energy densities of 79.3 and 37.7 Wh kg−1 when the power densities are 825.0 and 16100 W kg−1, respectively. It's worth nothing that the ASC cells have robust flexibility with performance well maintained when the devices were bent to different angles from 180° to 15° at a duration of 5 min. The efficient electrochemical deposition method of Ni–Co–S with a preferred orientation of nanosheet arrays is applicable for the flexible energy storage devices.
