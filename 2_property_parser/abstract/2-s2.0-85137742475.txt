Bagasse-based phosphorus-doped activated carbon was prepared with bagasse as carbon source and phytic acid as phosphorus source and activator, and applied to the field of supercapacitors. The effects of activation temperature and impregnation ratio on the iodine adsorption value, methylene blue adsorption value and electrochemical performance of activated carbon were analyzed. The mechanism of phosphorus doping to improve the electrochemical performance of activated carbon was explored through the combination of pore structure, phosphorus-containing functional groups and hydrophilic characterization. The results showed that the activation of phytic acid promoted the adsorption capacity and specific surface area of activated carbon, forming a microporous/mesoporous composite structure. Phytic acid was used as a phosphorus source to achieve phosphorus doping of activated carbon, and the binding types were C—P and C—P==O, C—P—O and C—O—P. The introduction of phosphorus-containing functional groups improved the hydrophilicity of activated carbon, and provided active sites for pseudocapacitance reactions, and thus improving electrochemical performance. Theoretical analysis of capacitance contribution indicated that diffusion behavior was not the main factor limiting its capacitance behavior, which was mainly affected by the electric double layer on the electrode surface and the pseudocapacitance reaction. Under the optimum conditions, when the activation temperature was 900℃ and the impregnation ratio was 1.5, the iodine adsorption value, methylene blue adsorption value and specific capacitance of phosphorus-doped activated carbon were 1321mg/g, 255mg/g and 222F/g (current density was 1A/g), respectively. After 9000 cycles, its capacitance retention rate was still as high as 98.77%, showing that phosphorus doping had the potential as a supercapacitor.
