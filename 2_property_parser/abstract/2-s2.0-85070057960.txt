Supercapacitors are typically used in applications requiring frequent and continuous charging/discharging cycles, but most of the models available in the literature are designed to predict their behavior for a single sequence. In this letter, we show first that the electrical response and metrics of supercapacitors under periodic voltage excitations can generally be obtained using Fourier series analysis and convolution operations of functions derived based on any suitable impedance model. We verified our analysis procedure with simulations using particle swarm optimization, and experiments conducted on a commercial device subject to all-positive triangular wave excitations as a case study.
