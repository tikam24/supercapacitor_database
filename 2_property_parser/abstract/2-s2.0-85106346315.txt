In this work, a facile method to prepare Bi2O3 decorated activated carbon (Bi2O3@AC) composites with high pseudocapacitive properties was presented. The inorganic–organic composites synthesized using commercial Bi2O3 and active carbon with different weight ratio. The composites were assessed using spectroscopic, microscopic, and diffractive techniques. Our assessments confirmed that active carbons were successfully doped with commercial Bi2O3 nanoparticles with different dopant rates. The electrochemical performance of as-prepared materials was researched by cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in 6 M KOH electrolyte. Higher specific capacitance was achieved for increased Bi2O3 nanoparticle in composites. The 20%-Bi2O3@AC had a maximum specific capacitance of 565 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g. In addition, the symmetrically assembled supercapacitor delivers a high energy density (23.0 Wh kg−1). Moreover, 67% of the initial capacitance is maintained after 1500 cycles at 200 mV/s, suggesting good cycling stability. Due to the synergistic effect of compositing a promising electrochemical performance was observed that was not obtained by bare AC or Bi2O3. As a result, the electrochemical properties of 20%-Bi2O3@AC composite is promising and it may be used as potential electrode for supercapacitor.
