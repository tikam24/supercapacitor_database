The growing demand for alternative renewable sources of energy apart from conventional fossil fuels gathered attention for exploring solar, wind, tidal geothermal energy, etc. However, the intermittent energy supply constraint the full-fledged utilization of these energy sources and hence, to address this issue, a new technique of integrated energy generation and storage systems (IEGSSs) is extensively explored. In this review, we have comprehensively discussed the ongoing research on various IEGSSs, and their different integration techniques constituting solar cells, batteries, and supercapacitors. This article also highlighted certain challenges faced by the IEGSSs which restrict their full-fledged application. Finally, some prospects that can flourish their utilization in the field of various portable devices, wearables, off-grid electrification, and IoT sensors for smart cities are discussed.
