To achieve effective energy conversion and storage device, a new type of electrode material with stable structure and large surface area is highly desirable. In this paper, a facile route was reported to synthesize hierarchical double-walled MnO 2 hollow nanofibers (MHNFs). Amine-functionalized SiO 2 hollow nanofibers were prepared as a template to adsorb the anionic MnO 4 − . After hydrothermal treatment, NH 2 -SiO 2 @MnO 2 hollow nanofibers were formed. Then by etching SiO 2 with HF, the MHNFs were obtained. The as-synthesized MHNFs were directly used as supercapacitor electrode, which achieved a specific capacitance value of 222.4 F g −1 , as well as superior cycling capability (94% after 5000 cycles). The MHNFs and activated carborn were employed to assemble an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) in 1 M Na 2 SO 4 solution. The device showed the highest energy density of 29.3 W h kg -1 at 90 W kg -1 and the highest power density of 7200 W kg -1 at 7.2 W h kg -1 within the voltage window of 0–1.8 V. These results make the as-fabricated MHNFs a suitable electrode material for high efficient electrochemical supercapacitor.
