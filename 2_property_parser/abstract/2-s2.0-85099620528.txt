In this work, a homologous Ni2P/NiCoP heterostructure is well formed by in situ embedding the NiCoP phase into the Ni2P matrix through a phosphorization transformation strategy. The resultant hybrid architecture with multi-phase and modulated electronic property enhances the structural stability and kinetics, which delivers a high specific capacitance/capacity (1487.6 F g−1/741.3 C g−1), enhanced rate capability (a 75.5% retention at 20 A g−1) and cycling stability. The as-assembled solid-state active carbon (AC)//Ni2P/NiCoP hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) exhibits a high specific capacitance/capacity of 130.2 F g−1/204.3 C g−1 with high energy/power densities and satisfied cycling stability.
