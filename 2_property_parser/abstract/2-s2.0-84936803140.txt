In the present study, graphene oxide nanoribbons (GONR) and reduced graphene oxide nanoribbons (RGONR) supported polyaniline (PANI) nanocomposites are synthesized via an in situ chemical polymerization method and investigated for supercapacitor electrodes. Electrochemical studies performed by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) measurements suggest that both nanocomposites possess enhanced specific capacitance (C<inf>sp</inf> as 740 F/g for GONR/PANI and 1180 F/g for RGONR/PANI at 5 mV/s). GONR/PANI and RGONR/PANI nanocomposites show good rate capability with high C<inf>sp</inf> upon increasing the current density from 2 to 20 A/g in GCD measurements, approximately 55% decay in C<inf>sp</inf> value of the nanocomposites is observed compared to pristine PANI (âˆ¼70%). The undertaken study signifies enhanced electrical and electrochemical properties of GONR/RGONR supported PANI nanocomposites due to a synergistic effect of GONR/RGONR and PANI. Furthermore, asymmetric devices are fabricated using GONR/RGONR as the negative electrode, while GONR/PANI and RGONR/PANI are used as the positive electrode, which exhibit significant enhancement in energy density and device performance.
