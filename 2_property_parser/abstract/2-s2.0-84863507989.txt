Aiming at the problem of the DC-link overvoltage and the dynamic reactive power supply in the low voltage ride through (LVRT) of the doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) wind turbine system, this paper proposes a LVRT scheme of DFIG based on the supercapacitor storage. The novel control strategy for the bi-directional converter and the grid side converter is established. Simulation model of the DFIG system is developed. Simulation results show that the presented scheme can efficiently reduce the DC-link overvoltage, supply reactive power to the power system through grid side converter, help grid recovery under system fault, and improve the LVRT capability of the system.
