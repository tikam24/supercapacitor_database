Herein we report the nanostructured polyaniline (PANI) growth on interconnected porous carbon (ICPC) by in-situ electropolymerization route. Structural and morphological investigation confirms the formation of ICPC and growth of PANI over the surface of carbon. Electrochemical performance of PANI/ ICPC was assessed by Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and chargedischarge cycle profile. The large surface area (750 m2 g–1) with interconnected pore structure of ICPC plays an imperative role for the penetration of aniline and leads to the formation of nanostructured PANI on its matrix. The achieved results revealed that anchoring of PANI on ICPC enhances the specific capacitance (861 Fg–1) than the individuals. Composite conquers a good cycling stability owing to the synergistic effect of PANI and ICPC be a sign of potential candidate for the fabrication of high-performance electrode materials for energy storage applications.
