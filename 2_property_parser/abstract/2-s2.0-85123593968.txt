Hybrid energy storages (HES) is becoming more compelling solution for electric vehicles (EV), as battery technologies fail to meet expected requirements. Enhanced longevity, better power density and longer range are only a few of the advantages that HES offers in comparison to the pure battery based storage. Since supercapacitors are recognized as one of the most prominent technologies for HES, selection of an adequate power converter becomes an issue. This paper illustrate the possibilities for the implementation of the interleaved DC-DC converter together with supercapacitor in HES. More precisely paper offers the modelling and simulation results of the converter subjected to the operation regimes specific for HES in standard electric vehicle.
