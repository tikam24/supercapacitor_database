Despite all the advantages related to the concept of DC microgrids, there are still challenges regarding their operation and control in the presence of massively integrated naturally intermittent renewable energy resources. In this paper, an energy-sharing scheme is proposed for coordinating the role of a DC electrical spring (DCES) and a hybrid battery energy source system (hybrid BESS) for improving the DC bus voltage when the main source of the DC microgrid is a PV system. The hybrid BESS, including a Li-Ion chemical battery and a supercapacitor, provides the capability of responding to any production command signal. The simulation results conducted on a test case show that DCES can effectively and positively contribute to the power shortage compensation process caused by a drop in PV production, dampen the oscillations, and release the stress from the hybrid BESS.
