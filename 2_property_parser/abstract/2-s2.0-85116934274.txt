A new electrode material consisting of MOFs (Zr-TAA, TAA: trans-aconitic acid) and MWCNTs was simply synthesized by one-pot reflux method and applied to high-performance supercapacitor. With advantages of improved conductivity and uniform pore-size distribution, the composite material shows enhanced electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 562.06 F g−1 and retains almost 100% of its initial capacitance after 1000 cycles when measured in 6 M KOH electrolyte. Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor assembled by Zr-TAA/MWCNTs-6 as positive electrode and carbon cloth as negative electrode exhibits a superior energy density of 17.53 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 902.5 W kg−1, which demonstrates its great practical value in electrochemical energy storage applications.
