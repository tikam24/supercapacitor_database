For the first time, high-performance fabric-based electrochemical supercapacitors using water-dispersible polyanilines (PANI)-poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid) (PAAMPSA) as electrode materials are demonstrated. PANI-PAAMPSA is directly dispersed into water and deposited on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fabrics to form electrodes of symmetrical flexible supercapacitors. The fabric supercapacitors using PANI-PAAMPSA exhibit significant specific capacitance of 60 Fg<sup>-1</sup>. In addition, the PANI-PAAMPSA-based supercapacitors demonstrate long-life cycling stability and high mechanical durability during the bending tests. Our work could open up opportunities of employing the water-soluble PANI-PAAMPSA in various areas such as solution-based energy-storage, as well as flexible and light weight functional devices.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]
