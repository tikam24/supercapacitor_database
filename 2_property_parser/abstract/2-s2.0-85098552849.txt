The bi-metallic oxides envisage potential alternatives as to the transformation of energy and cathode material for storage. Some prominence attributes like supremacy on power and energy density, high cyclic stability, and quick response to form supercapacitor is an essential matter among like energy storage devices. In the present investigation inspecting those views of supercapacitors, the new manganese vanadium oxide has been synthesized by microwave synthesis and followed by a hydrothermal process using water and DMF solvent separately. The mixed oxide possesses distinct morphology with crystal change depending upon the solvent. It contains the high active surface, which gives more electrochemically active sites for energy storage as well as multi-valence redox response with ion intercalation. The sample has been characterized using X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy for confirming phase, characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy for morphological features. Electrochemical analyses of as-synthesized samples are explored thoroughly to apprehend the view of the approach of that system in an energy storage device. The specific capacitance is improved to be 130F/g in the current density of 0.5A/g and 225F/g at a scan rate of 2mV/s for DMF solvent than water. This mixed metal oxide depicts enhanced stability, and up to 2,000 cycles, it is increasing up to 110% at a current density of 3Ag^{-1}. It depicts a high energy density of 6Whkg^{-1} at the power density of 1560Wkg^{-1} in the current density of 2.8Ag^{-1}. The potential value specific capacitance, rated capacity, and long cycle stability make it an excrescent candidate to realize the compulsion for the engineering of new advanced materials for energy storage applications.
