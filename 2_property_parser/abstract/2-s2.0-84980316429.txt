In this study, the Short cluster shape or honeycomb shape graphene oxide/polyaniline/metal hydroxide (GO/PANI/metal hydroxide) nanocomposite was prepared by one-step in site polymerization with nickel ions or cobalt ions added. The contents of Ni2 + and Co2 + in the GO/PANI/metal hydroxide nanocomposite could be easily tuned by altering the mass ratio of metal salts in the reaction solution. The electrochemical data showed that, when the GO/PANI/metal hydroxide nanocomposites with only doping Ni2 +, GO/PANI/Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite had the highest specific capacitance of 743F/g compared with GO/PANI/Co(OH)2 nanocomposite 723F/g. Specific capacitance value of the supercapacitor was stable with a capacitance degradation of 15.6% over 2000 cycles. The electrochemical performance demonstrates that the shape controllable GO/PANI/metal hydroxide nanocomposite was excellent electrode material used in supercapacitors.
