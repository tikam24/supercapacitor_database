A proton-conducting coordination polymer of anionic one-dimensional (1D) chains of Zn2+ phosphate and protonated imidazole with the formula of [Zn(HPO4)(H2PO4)2](ImH2)2 has been used as a novel supercapacitor material in aqueous electrolytes. This material stores charges via a proton-hopping mechanism.
