Energy storage devices capable of delivering high energy and power are crucial in fulfilling the ever-increasing energy demands. Supercapacitors (SCs) are electrochemical energy storage devices for next-generation applications, exhibiting high energy and power output with ultra-long cycle life. Biomass-derived porous carbon materials are extensively used for the realization of many green energy storage solutions owing to their low cost, abundance, and sustainable characteristics. This study explored an inherently doped hierarchically porous carbon (HPC) derived from an aromatic root, vetiver for SC application. HPC with innately doped iron oxide nanoparticles and heteroatoms (nitrogen and oxygen) was prepared using a facile chemical activation method. The influence of pyrolysis temperature on HPC's morphology, pore structure, and energy storage characteristics was investigated. HPC prepared at 800 °C (HPC-800 °C) demonstrated a tubular morphology with a large specific surface area of 1879 m2 g−1 and a total pore volume of 0.91 cm3 g−1. The tubular morphology in combination with inherent functionalities in HPC augments the transport of ions and electrons within the carbonaceous matrix. Reaping these benefits, the as-fabricated symmetric SC using HPC-800 °C electrodes exhibited a maximum energy density of 67.8 W h kg−1 and power density of 15,000 W kg−1 with ~ 88% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles. This study opens a scope for developing green supercapacitors for next-generation energy storage systems.
