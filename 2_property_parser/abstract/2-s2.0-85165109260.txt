KOH-activated carbon materials prepared from biomass-derived carbon source, cellulose and lignin, were compared. Mixtures of different ratios of cellulose and lignin were used to partially mimic biomass as carbon source. This allows tailoring and optimizing of the KOH activated carbon materials by getting rid of the restriction of the intrinsic proportion of cellulose and lignin in specific biomass. The results indicate that cellulose use results in a more porous structure, whereas lignin use leads to more partially activated graphite structure. The activated carbon material (CL1) prepared from blend of cellulose with lignin in mass ratio of 1 : 1 exhibits a high specific surface area of 2000.39 m2 g−1, and in TEABF4/ACN (tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate dissolved in acetonitrile) electrolyte it showed a maximum specific capacitance of 136.10 F g−1, a maximum energy density of 18.11 Wh kg−1, and a capacitance retention of 85.04 % under current density as high as 15 A g−1.
