Supercapacitors (SCs), also known as ultracapacitors, are energy-storing devices that are proposed to be the most potent option in the upcoming generation of energy-storing devices that will eventually boost or replace batteries in several applications. Many research has already shown interest in SCs to develop energy storage having high performance. This will enhance the rapid growth in several sectors of low-power electronics. It will cover a huge market. But for commercialization and widespread utilization, their energy density still needs to be enhanced and costs need to be reduced. Many research challenges still need to be identified and overcome. In this paper, a comparison of supercapacitor and other energy-storing devices and the current trend toward the development of SCs were discussed. Different classifications of supercapacitors were also presented. Some promising materials such as activated carbon, carbon nanotube, graphene, conducting polymer, polyaniline, polypyrrole, metal oxides, transition metal-sulfides for preparing electrodes, and types of electrolytes were also discussed.
