Silicon (Si), as the second most abundant element on Earth, has been a central platform of modern electronics owing to its low mass density and unique semiconductor properties. From an energy perspective, all-in-one integration of power supply systems onto Si-based functional devices is highly desirable, which inspires significant study on Si-based energy storage. Compared to the well-known Si-anode Li-ion batteries, Si-based supercapacitors possess high power density, long life, and simple working mechanisms, which enables their ease of integration onto a wide range of devices and applications. Besides Si, silicon carbide (SiC), as a physicochemically stable wide-bandgap semiconductor, also attracts research attention as an energy storage material in harsh environments. In this review, a detailed overview of latest advances in materials design, synthesis methods, and performances of Si-based and SiC-based supercapacitors will be provided. Some successful integrated devices, future perspectives, and potential research directions are also highlighted and discussed.
