The selection of the less expensive Power Conditioning System (PCS) is the aim of the work where two types of PCS are taken into consideration. The first type of PCS is based on Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) while the second one is based on Supercapacitor Energy Storage (ScES). The comparison is based on installed power as the criterion. An illustrative example is given in the work.
