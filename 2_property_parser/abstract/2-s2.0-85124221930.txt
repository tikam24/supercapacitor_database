The synthesis of cobalt nanocrystals deposited cerium oxide (Co-CeO2) on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets using a facile hydrothermal technique is described in this paper. The Cobalt deposited CeO2/RGO electrode shows outstanding electrocatalytic activity. The phase, morphology, and elemental composition and oxidation states of Co-CeO2 validated by PXRD, HRTEM-EDX and XPS respectively. The average surface area of the Co-CeO2/RGO composite is shown to be 81.125 m2/g as estimated by N2 adsorption isotherm. The cobalt doped with CeO2 nanoparticles over graphene sheets studied by HRTEM coupled with EDX. The electrochemical behavior of the Co-CeO2/RGO nanocomposite was studied using as an electrode by cyclic voltammetry (CV), Galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The specific capacitance of the material Csp was found to be 843.8 Fg−1 at a lower current density of 1.0 Ag−1. Furthermore, with a power density of 230Wkg−1, it has a greater energy density of 93.19 Whkg−1.
