Supercapacitors composed of carbon nanotube (CNT) micropores in the room-temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMI+BF4-) are studied via molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations. It is found that the distribution of RTIL ions inside the micropore varies significantly with the pore size. Internal solvation of small (6,6) and (7,7) CNTs with an electrified interior wall is effected almost exclusively via counterions. Surprisingly, these counterions, even though they all have the same charge, lead to a charge density characterized by multiple layers with alternating signs. This intriguing feature is attributed to the extended nature of RTIL ion charge distributions, which result in charge separation through preferential orientation inside the electrified nanotubes. In the case of larger (10,10) and (15,15) CNTs, counterions and co-ions develop multilayer solvation structures. The specific capacitance normalized to the pore surface area is found to increase as the CNT diameter decreases from (15,15) to (7,7). As the pore size further reduces from (6,6) to (5,5), however, the specific capacitance diminishes rapidly. These findings are in excellent agreement with recent experiments with carbon-based materials. A theoretical model based on multiple charge layers is proposed to understand both the MD and experimental results. Â© 2010 American Chemical Society.
