The main objective of this work is to develop a hybrid energy storage to use in full or hybrid electric vehicles. The hybrid energy storage system consists in a combination of batteries and supercapacitors. The supercapacitor bank and the batteries are connected through a DC/DC converter, allowing bi-directional transfer of energy. The operation modes with the power transfer features are directly related with the acceleration or braking of an electric vehicle. The operation of the proposed solution is illustrated with simulation and experimental results. To test the proposed solution, a prototype was built allowing to verify experimentally the performance of the proposed solution. Â© 2014 IEEE.
