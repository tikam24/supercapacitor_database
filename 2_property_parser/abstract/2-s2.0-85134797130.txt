Supercapacitors have been presumed as an evolving green energy device to meet current energy storage demand, which owned the various features such as better cycling behavior, rapid charge/discharge performance, and high power density. The electrode materials selection is playing the excessive significance to improve the supercapacitor's electrochemical characteristics. This study elaborated the synthesis of molybdenum ditellurides (MoTe2), molybdenum disulfides (MoS2), and molybdenum diselenides (MoSe2) nanoarray structures using one-step chemical kinetics as favorable candidates for supercapacitor devices. The structural and morphological characteristics were evidently authorized the formation of molybdenum dichalcogens. The constructed supercapacitor using MoTe2 electrode has explored the enhanced storage behavior with the specific capacitance of 416 F.g−1 at 2 A.g−1 applied current which is superior to their analog phase of MoS2 (173 F.g−1) and MoSe2 (283 F.g−1) electrodes by the half-cell studies. Furthermore, constructed asymmetric device using the MoTe2 and activated carbon produced the capacitance of 138 F·g−1 at 2 A.g−1 applied current along with a high specific energy of 49 Wh.kg−1 at specific power of 961 W.kg−1 and admirable retentive performance of 95.5% after 5000 cycles.
