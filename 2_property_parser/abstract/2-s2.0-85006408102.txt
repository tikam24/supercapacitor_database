Four types of α-MnO2, β-MnO2, γ-MnO2 and δ-MnO2 powders were synthesized by relatively simple methods. The differences in crystal structures and surface morphologies for these forms of MnO2 were investigated by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and specific surface area analysis (BET). The electrochemical performances were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and stability analysis. Based on the experimental results, four kinds of MnO2 electrodes showed good capacity properties, and the α-MnO2 electrode had the largest specific capacity due to the highest specific surface area and porosity. The remaining three types of MnO2 electrodes had similar specific surface areas, and the β-MnO2 electrode had better rate discharge property and stability due to its lower developed pore structure.
