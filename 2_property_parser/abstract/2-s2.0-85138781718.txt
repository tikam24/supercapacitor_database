Efficient renewable energies are needed to meet the energy demands of modernized civilization. Therefore, this study evaluated composite Co1-xZnxS (0.04 ≤ x ≤ 0.34) (CZS-1 to CZS-6) thin film electrodes produced using a chemical growth approach as effective energy storage devices. Systematic integration of Zn2+ in the CoS host formed the polycrystalline Co0.24SZn0.76 (cubic) phase. The electrochemical measurements revealed a high diffusion rate and low series resistance, resulting in an excellent specific capacitance (Cs) of 1288 F g−1 at a current density of 2 mA cm−2 with better rate performance. In addition, the optimal electrode (CZT-5) showed a better power density of 8.86 kW kg−1 and an energy density of 44.4 Wh kg−1 with excellent capacitive retention (85% after 5000 cycles). The enhanced performance could stem from the spongy rose flower-like nanostructure with a covered network of polygonic petals. Consequently, the replacement of Co2+ with Zn2+ also contributed by exchanging the oxidation states of targeted atoms, including Co2+, Co3+, Zn2+, and S2−. Moreover, surface topographical insight states that crystalline growth of the CZS samples with hillocks and valleys and CZS-5 sample exhibited maximum total roughness.
