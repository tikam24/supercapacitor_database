3D graphene frameworks/Co3O4 composites are produced by the thermal explosion method, in which the generation of Co3O4 nanoparticles, reduction of graphene oxide, and creation of 3D frameworks are simultaneously completed. The process prevents the agglomeration of Co3O4 particles effectively, resulting in monodispersed Co3O4 nanoparticles scattered on the 3D graphene frameworks evenly. The prepared 3D graphene frameworks/Co3O4 composites used as electrodes for supercapacitor display a definite improvement on electrochemical performance with high specific capacitance (≈1765 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1), good rate performance (≈1266 F g−1 at a current density of 20 A g−1), and excellent stability (≈93% maintenance of specific capacitance at a constant current density of 10 A g−1 after 5000 cycles). In addition, the composites are also employed as nonenzymatic sensors for the electrochemical detection of glucose, which exhibit high sensitivity (122.16 µA mM −1 cm−2) and noteworthy lower detection limit (157 × 10−9 M, S/N = 3). Therefore, the authors expect that the 3D graphene frameworks/Co3O4 composites described here would possess potential applications as the electrode materials in supercapacitors and nonenzymatic detection of glucose.
