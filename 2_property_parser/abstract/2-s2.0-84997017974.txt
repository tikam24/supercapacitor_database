Electrospinning is the most facile and highly versatile approach to produce 1D polymeric, inorganic, and hybrid nanomaterials with a small diameter, controllable dimensions, and designed architectures. In particular, with large surface area, high porosity, low density, good directionality, and tunable composition, electrospun nanofibers and mats are regarded as ideal candidates for various kinds of electrochemical energy storage devices such as supercapacitors (SCs). In this review, the recent progress in electrospun electrode materials for SCs is presented, covering the architecture design and their electrochemical performance. After a brief introduction about SCs, the basic principles of the electrospinning technique are discussed. Following, attention is paid to the discussion of various electrospun nanofibers and mats including 1D carbons, metal oxides, metal sulfides, metal nitrides, conducting polymers and composite nanomaterials with various types of architectures as electrodes for SCs. The relationship between the composition, architecture, and the electrochemical performance is discussed in detail. Finally, some challenges and perspectives of future research of the electrospun nanofibers and mats for high performance SCs are highlighted. It is anticipated that this review would provide the researchers some inspiration for constructing new types of energy storage devices.
