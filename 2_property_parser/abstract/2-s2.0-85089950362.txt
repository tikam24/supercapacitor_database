This study investigates the mitigation of transient overvoltages (TOVs) in a microgrid supplied by renewable distributed generation resources, which include photovoltaic (PV) generators, hydro generation unit, and wind power generators. ATP/EMTP is used in this study as electromagnetic transient software. Accurate simulation models are needed to carry out the study. Therefore, a three-phase PV system model based on the equivalent Newton-Raphson circuit is used, and the efficiency of the PV system components is studied. Then, the use of the PV generation system model for switching studies is investigated using two different electrical systems. The use of different mitigation methods for TOVs at the microgrid is investigated. Three different mitigation methods are considered. First, a device to compensate reactive power such as static var compensator (SVC) is represented as a TOVs mitigation method. Then, adding a supercapacitor as TOVs mitigation method is evaluated. After that, a combination of active and reactive power simultaneously to mitigate TOV, by the addition of SVC to a supercapacitor, is investigated. The grid-connected mode and isolated mode of the microgrid are considered. The results show that the usage of SVC with supercapacitor has the ability to mitigate the transient overvoltage and the waveforms are more regular. .
