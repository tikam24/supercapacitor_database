Due to its porous architecture, laser-induced graphene (LIG) has become a viable option for prospective use in a variety of sectors, particularly the electrical field. LIG is essential for flexible electronics, especially in bioelectronics, sensors, and actuators; these cutting-edge applications are made possible by specially designed porosity, electrical conductivity, composition, and morphology. Due to the environmental concerns with the synthetic polymers typically employed for the synthesis of LIG, the production of LIG from biomass is a new step in the direction of sustainable development and blossoming research areas. However, the research is still in its early stages, and there are relatively few studies on the use of LIG generated from biomass. As a result, this study aims to shed light on the developments of biomass-derived LIG and thereby inspire young researchers.
