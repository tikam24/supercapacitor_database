Cellulose has been explored as a tentative renewable carbon source to convert into micro- and meso-porous carbon (MMC) via carbonizing cellulose aerogel at a temperature of 700 °C without further activation. The obtained MMC materials based on cellulose possess a specific surface area of 646 m2 g−1, a pore volume of 0.4403 m3 g−1, with an optimal pore structure that consists of the micropores in average size of 1.49 nm and the mesopores in the range of 2.25 ∼ 3.32 nm. A two-electrode symmetric supercapacitor based on the MMC materials exhibits a comparable high electrochemical performance with a large capacitance (up to 160 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1), an high energy density of 17.81 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 180.11W kg−1 in the voltage range of 0 V to 1.8 V. The mesoporous can provide a good channel to further facilitate the electrolyte ion penetrating inner pores, while the microporous can store more electrolyte ions. The above cooperative effect of MMC is the key to the high-performance of the supercapacitors.
