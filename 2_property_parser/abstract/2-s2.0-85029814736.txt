The urchin-like polyaniline (i.e. PANI) microsphere was polymerized using the sulfonated polystyrene microsphere (i.e. SPS) as template, and its structure was successfully conformed by the X-ray photoelectron spectrum, Raman spectrum, Ultraviolet-visible spectrum, and TGA thermogram. The urchin-like PANI microspheres with uniform diameter (1.5 μm) can be observed on scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were carried out to investigate the electrochemical properties of as-prepared urchin-like PANI microspheres. It showed that the specific capacitance (SC) was 435 Fg−1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1, and also exhibited good capability and cycling stability with capacitance retentions of 93% after 1000 cycles, which is superior or close to some individual PANI nanostructures and PANI composite materials. This facile approach is feasible and easy to fabricate microstructural conducting polymer for supercapacitor electrode materials.
