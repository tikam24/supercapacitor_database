Biomass-based carbon is a novel multi-functional material but its precursors possess a complicated composition and a pore structure that is difficult to regulate, which limits its research and use in the energy storage field. We introduce a liquefaction technology in cooperation with an in situ doping strategy using different sources of silicon, and fabricate porous biomass-based carbon materials with a microporous and mesoporous structure. Here we show that the lamellar structure of biomass-based carbon composites with an ordered porous structure reveals a high specific capacitance (288.0 F/g), energy density (93.7 Wh/kg) and power density (850.0 W/kg) at a current density of 0.2 A/g in 1 M KOH electrolyte, as well as a good rate performance and stability (with a capacitance retention above 97% after 3000 cycles).
