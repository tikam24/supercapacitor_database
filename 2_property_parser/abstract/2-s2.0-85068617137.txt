We demonstrate that under laser irradiation a tiny amount of Zn infiltrated into the graphene oxide enables massive production of the multilayered graphene with high electrochemical performance. The infiltrated Zn was found to lead to significant changes in microstructures, morphology, and surface chemistry of the resulting multilayer graphene. As compared to the graphene directly produced from raw graphene oxide, the graphene produced from the Zn-infiltrated graphene oxide showed a nearly four times increase in energy density. Additional electrochemical properties promised that the resulting graphene could be widely used as electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitor.
