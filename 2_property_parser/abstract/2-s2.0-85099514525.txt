Nanoarchitectures featuring ZnWO4/ZnCo2O4 were successfully prepared via a facile hydrothermal technique, and the electrochemical performance of the resulting electrode was characterized. Electrochemical analyses revealed that the specific capacitance was 180.121 mA h g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, with an excellent capacity retention of 73.94% and cycling stability of 97.83% over 4000 cycles. This excellent performance of ZnWO4/ZnCo2O4 demonstrated that the as-synthesized composite on the Ni foam effectively supported pathways allowing rapid diffusion of electrons/ions. Hence the ZnWO4/ZnCo2O4 electrode material is a promising candidate for next-generation high-performance supercapacitors.
