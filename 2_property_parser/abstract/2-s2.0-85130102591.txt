For the purpose of low cost, high sustainability, and low greenhouse gas emissions, different fabrication methods of hierarchical porous biochar (HPB) material are always desirable for the fabrication of all-solid-state energy storage devices. Here, we report a novel, low-cost, and eco-friendly fabrication method of HPB with appropriate pore size and porosity directly from natural plant galla chinensis. The obtained HPB, which is tested in a well-sealed sustainable all-solid-state in-plane micro-supercapacitor (IMSC), exhibits a high-energy storage performance than that of widely used commercial-active carbon (The areal capacitance is 3.5 times higher and the ohmic resistance is 4 times lower). Compared to other works, its relative performance is also much higher in similar energy storage devices. Furthermore, the obtained HPB can deliver outstanding cycle life (near 90% after cycling 1000 times). Therefore, the present work will inspire the new strategy of HPB fabrication in the world from similar plants for the application of PVA electrolyte-based highly sustainable flexible energy storage devices.
