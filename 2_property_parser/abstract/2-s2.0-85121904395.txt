Although transition metal oxides (TMOs) have attracted enormous attention owing to their high performance in supercapacitors, it still remains challenging issues in terms of the poor electrical conductivity, sluggish redox kinetics and insufficient electrochemical active sites. Herein, the high-capacity CoP-Mn3P nanoclusters featuring the heterogeneous interfaces have been successfully synthesized through hydrothermal method followed by annealing. The heterojunction formed between CoP and Mn3P redistributes the charge at the interface between them, generating the built-in electric field to accelerate electron transfer, and thus the conductivity of the electrode is enhanced. Moreover, the unique morphology of nanoclusters composed of flake structures is beneficial to provide more electrochemical active sites. Consequently, the resultant CoP-Mn3P nanoclusters electrode delivers an exceptional gravimetric specific capacity (2714 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) as well as a long cycle lifespan (83.1% of capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles). An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device assembling with employing CoP/Mn3P electrode presents an ultrahigh energy density value of 46.4 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 800.0 W kg−1 and a super capacitance retention of 86.2% after 30,000 cycles. This work paves an effective way for the investigation on the charge transfer kinetics of electrode materials.
