In the present study, Polyanionic compound (SO4)-group based on Li2Ni(SO4)2 (Lithium Nickel Sulphate) composite electrodes materials were prepared by a ball-milling method and solid-state reaction route. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of a polycrystalline orthorhombic phase of composite Li2Ni(SO4)2 with an average crystallite size of about 50.16 nm. Field Emission Scanning electron microscopy investigation reveals the spherical shape particles with the particle size of around 200-500 nm. Raman and FTIR analysis confirms the structural and functional groups of the synthesized materials and also the formation of Li2Ni(SO4)2. The electrochemical measurements using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charging-discharging (GCD) techniques were carried out to study the electrochemical supercapacitive performance of the composite Li2Ni (SO4)2 electrodes. From the CV investigations, an areal capacitance of 508 mF cm-2 was obtained at 10 mV s-1. The galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) measurements exhibited the areal capacitance of 101 mF cm-2 at a constant current density of 2 mA cm-2 in 2 M KOH. These GCD profiles were linear and also symmetric in nature with the maximum columbic efficiency of about 85%. The electrochemical performance of the composite Li2Ni(SO4)2 electrode material shows excellent performance for supercapacitor applications.
