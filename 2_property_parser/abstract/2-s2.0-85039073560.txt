Standard models, Helmholtz, Gouy-Chapman, Stern and Grahame models have been validated on the electrical double layers (EDLs) formed from three different electrode surfaces, i.e., plain, semi-sphere and cylindrical pore in aqueous electrolyte. The double layer potential (Ï•) and areal capacitance (C dl ) were estimated in the three models using MATLAB Simulink. It was found that the areal capacitance of the double layer strongly influenced by the nature/ type of the electrode surface in contact with the electrolyte. The cylindrical-type pore surface exhibited the large areal capacitance. The charge-discharge and impedance characteristics of the EDLs were also analyzed.
