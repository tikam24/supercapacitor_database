Hierarchically porous carbons are obtained by a facile process of carbonizing the precursor of diblock copolymer xPS-b-polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). In the diblock copolymer, there is a carbon source of cross-linked polystyrene (xPS) and a sacrificial block of PMMA. The atom transfer radical polymerization was used to synthesize the diblock copolymer with controlled molecular weight and narrow polydispersity in dimethylformamide at 120Â°C. The obtained hierarchically porous carbons (HPCs) exhibit remarkable electrochemical properties, such as higher specific capacitance of 204Fg-1 at the current density of 0.5Ag-1 in 6molL-1 aqueous KOH electrolyte. In addition, it also presents an excellent rate performance of 64% capacitance retention as the current density increases to 10Ag-1 and a superior cycling stability of 98% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at the current density of 1Ag-1.
