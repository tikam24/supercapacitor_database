In this work MoS2 nanostructures with near commercial mass loading (30 mg cm−2) are grown over Ni foam substrates by a simple hydrothermal process conducted at different growth times. MoS2 nanorods in a brush-like arrangement grown over Ni foam obtained after 36 h exhibit excellent electrochemical performance in three electrode measurements with a maximum specific capacitance (Csp) of 766 F g-1 at 1 mVs−1. A symmetric supercapacitor based on the sample exhibits relatively high Csp (244 F g-1), a good energy density (12.2 wh kg−1) at 1 A g-1, and a competent cycling stability (92% after 9000 charge-discharge cycles at 5 A g-1).
