In this study, we report the synthesis of mixed metal sulfide NiS/Cu7S4-DT in a hydrothermal system assisted by triethanolamine (TEOA) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and found that TEOA and DMSO can not only reduce material agglomeration, but also make the particle size of the material smaller and the specific surface area larger. More importantly, when used as the positive electrode of supercapacitor, the NiS/Cu7S4-DT electrode material shows a high specific capacitance (1674 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and excellent cycle stability, with only about 10% loss over 10,000 cycles at 5 A g−1. In addition, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor NiS/Cu7S4//AC has a high specific capacitance (157 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and good cycle stability (after 20,000 cycles, the capacity can still maintain 72% of the initial value). When the power density is 374 W kg−1, the energy density can reach 50 Wh kg−1. The excellent electrochemical performance is mainly derived from the prepared mixed sulfide NiS/Cu7S4-DT unique nanostructure that can accelerate the rapid diffusion of ions and electrons, which is beneficial to the electrode/electrolyte contact area, thereby increasing the charge transfer rate. This method is expected to be extended to other related fields and play a certain guiding role.
