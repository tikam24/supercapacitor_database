The aim of the work now reported is the development of low cost electrodes in the monolithic shape without the need for a pos-production step with potential to be used in supercapacitors. The tested materials were activated carbon fibres prepared and activated carbons made from coffee endocarp. The main functional groups identified were quinone, lactone, Si-H, phenol, hydroxyl, carbonyl and ether for activated carbon samples and amine, amide, pyrone, lactone, carbonyl and hydroxyl for activated carbon fibres samples. The nanostructure of the materials is predominantly microporous but with a significant variety of porosity development with BET surface area and pore volume given by αs method range from 89 to 1050m2g-1 and 0.04 to 0.50cm3g-1, respectively. The electrochemical properties of the materials were investigated using classic cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The higher specific capacitance achieved was 176Fg-1. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
