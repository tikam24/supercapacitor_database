The present study demonstrates the bio-inspired synthesis of AuNPs/RGO nanocomposites using grape seed proanthocyanidin (GSP) towards photocatalysis and supercapacitor applications. The obtained nanocomposites were characterized using various analytical studies, which confirms the AuNPs are successfully decorated on the graphene nanosheets. The photocatalytic performance of AuNPs/RGO nanocomposites exhibit higher photocatalytic activity (97% and 88% for MB and MO) in comparison with GO and RGO after 60 min of irradiation. Furthermore, the electrochemical supercapactive performances of the AuNPs/RGO nanocomposites were studied by electrochemical techniques, which disclosed that the AuNPs/RGO nanocomposites possess a better specific capacitance (370 F g-1) compared with RGO nanosheets (67 F g-1) at a potential scan rate of 10 mV s−1. These improved performances are associated with a higher specific surface area and hindrance of photo − generated charge carrier recombination in AuNPs/RGO nanosheets.These synergistic performance may further evinced that the biogenic nanocomposites is a promising candidate for photocatalysis and supercapacitor applications.
