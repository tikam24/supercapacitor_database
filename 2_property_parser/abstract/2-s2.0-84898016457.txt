A hydrophilic surface modified carbon electrode shows a good electrolyte affinity with homogeneous dispersibility in water, resulting in low ion-transfer resistance and a uniform and dense electrode to give a high volumetric capacitor. The hydrophilic carbon electrode exhibits a superior capacitance (58 F cm-3, 99.3 mF cm-2) and is stable up to 5000 cycles. This journal is Â© the Partner Organisations 2014.
