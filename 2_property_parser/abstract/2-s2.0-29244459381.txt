Carbon nanotuhes are attractive materials as electrodes for supercapacitors due to their superb characteristics of chemical stability, large electrochemically accessible surface area, high electronic conductivity and low mass density. The recent developments of carbon nanotubes used as supercapacitor electrodes are reviewed. The specific properties and performance of both carbon nanotube electrodes and carbon nanotube composite electrodes are summarized. Prospects and further developments in supercapacitor electrode materials are also briefly discussed.
