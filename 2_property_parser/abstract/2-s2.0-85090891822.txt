Stretchable supercapacitors have received more and more attention due to their potential applications in wearable electronics and health monitoring. The stretchable supercapacitors have not only the advantages of high power density, long cycle life, safety and low cost of ordinary supercapacitor, but also good flexibility and stretchability to integrate well with wearable system. In this review, according to the structures of supercapacitors, the methods of preparing stretchable electrodes/devices reported in the literature are categorized and analyzed. We particularly highlight the key findings of creating stretchable electrodes/devices, which include elastic polymer substrates, tensile structure design and elastic polymer + tensile structure. In addition, the research progress of multi-functional stretchable supercapacitors and high elastic gel electrolytes are discussed. Finally, the challenges to the future development of the stretchable supercapacitors are analyzed and summarized. We expect to stimulate more research in creating stretchable supercapacitors for wide practical applications.
