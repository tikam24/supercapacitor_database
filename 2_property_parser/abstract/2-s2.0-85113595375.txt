Flexible supercapacitor is an important kind of energy storage devices to power the flexible electronics because of its excellent capacitive performance, fast charging/discharging ability and long-term stability. Cellulose gel has become an ideal material as electrode or separator in flexible supercapacitors due to its hydrophilicity, high porosity, large specific surface area, low density and flexibility. This review first describes the structure and property of cellulose gel, and then summarizes its fabrication methods and application in flexible supercapacitors. Finally, some research ideas for the subsequent development of cellulose gel in the field of energy storage devices are outlined.
