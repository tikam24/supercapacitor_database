Hierarchical metalâ€“organic frameworks (MOFs) have raised great concern on account of its enhanced multiplicity and control of internal sequences and structures. The controlled synthesis and multi-scale regulation of different morphologies of hierarchical MOFs is great crucial in practical applications. The research of hierarchical MOF makes outstanding contribution to the improvement of the performance of electrochemical energy storage device, and greatly improves its cyclic performance and capacitance. This review concentrates on synthesis methods, morphology and applications of zero, one, two-dimensional and other forms based hierarchical MOF and its derivative in electrochemical fields such as batteries, supercapacitors and electrocatalysis are reviewed. Based on theoretical knowledge and experimental experience, the future development of electrochemical energy storage and conversion device based on hierarchical MOF is proposed.
