Electrospinning polylactic acid-graphene-microcrystalline cellulose/polyaniline (PLA-GN-MCC/PANI) nanofiber is fabricated as superior supercapacitor electrode material, which involves flexible substrate of PLA, conductivity additive of GN, GN dispersion additive of MCC and electroactive substance of PANI. PLA-GN-MCC is optimized as a component mass ratio of 10:0.6:1 to achieve superior interface affinity properties. The ultimate tensile strength and the elongation at break of the optimized PLA-GN-MCC are 568 kPa and 93%, better than the 496 kPa and 87% of PLA, exhibiting both superior strength and flexibility. The PLA, PLA-GN-MCC and PLA-GN-MCC/PANI keep the reduced ohmic resistance from 18.73 to 9.58 to 8.00 Ω, the dwindled charge transfer resistance from 323.2 to 181.7 to 17.8 Ω, the declined electronic band gap from 4.084 to 0.557 to 0.142 eV, the reduced Frontier molecular orbitals energy gap from 3.6505 to 0.7964 to 0.7694 eV, the increased density of states from 4.7983 to 5.7842 to 8.6671 electrons eV−1. These results indicate more feasible electron transition and highly improved electronic conductivity. The hydrogen bonding interaction between PLA-GN-MCC and PANI contributes to increasing interface affinity and decreasing total surface energy, achieving superior electrochemical capacitance increased from 2.72 to 3.72 up to 221.64 mF/cm2. Experimental measurement and simulation calculation keep consistent results, demonstrating the promise of PLA-GN-MCC/PANI nanofibers for electrochemical energy storage.
