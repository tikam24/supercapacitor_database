Activated carbon electrode materials are widely used in supercapacitors, and there are many kinds of precursors used to prepare activated carbon. Among them, coal is a high-quality precursor of activated carbon, which has high carbon contents, abundant reserves and low cost. Using coal as a precursor to prepare activated carbon can broaden the application of coal, and increase the additional value of coal. Recent researches on coal-based activated carbon used in supercapacitors were reviewed, and the effect of coal-based activated carbon properties on the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors was analyzed. In addition, the future research directions and development prospects of coal-based activated carbon were also proposed.
