Three-dimensional hierarchical porous graphitic carbon (HPGC) were synthesized via one-step carbonization-activation and a catalytic strategy. The method can not only improve the graphitization degree of carbon materials, but also offer plentiful interfaces for charge accumulation and short paths for ion/electron transport. Polypyrrole, potassium hydroxide, and nickel acetate were used as the carbon precursors, activating agent, and catalyst, respectively. The retraction and dissolution of Ni caused the change of pore size in the material and led to the interconnected micro/nano holes. Nickel acetate played a significant role in enhancing the electrical conductivity, introducing pseudocapacitance, and promoting ion diffusion. In the supercapacitor, HPGC electrode exhibited a remarkable specific capacitance of 336.3 F g−1 under 0.5 A g−1 current density and showed high rate capability, even with large current densities applied (up to 50 A g−1 ). Moreover, HPGC showed optimal cycling stability with 97.4% capacitance retention followed by 3000 charge-discharge cycles. The excellent electrochemical performances coupled with a facile large-scale synthesis procedure make HPGC a promising alternative for supercapacitors.
