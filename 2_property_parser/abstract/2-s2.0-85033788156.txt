This review outlines research progress on carbon nanohorn (CNH) and polymer/CNH hybrids including structure, properties, application, and future stance. Carbon nanohorn is a type of nanocarbon existing as dahlia-like, bud-like, and seed-like structures. Most widely known form is single-walled carbon nanaohorn with diameter of ∼5 nm and tube length ∼50 nm. Polymers such as polystyrene, polyaniline, polythiophene, poly(vinylalcohol), poly(methylmethacrylate), poly(ethyleneglycol), polycaprolactone, polyimide, poly(2-aminopyridine), and nylon have been interacted with CNH using various techniques. Structural and physical properties of fine-tuned carbon nanohorn and polymer/CNH hybrids have been used for versatile applications such as dye-sensitized solar cell, supercapacitor, drug delivery, fuel cell, and sensors.
