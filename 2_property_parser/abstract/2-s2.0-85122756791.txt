Higher capacitance supercapacitors have received considerable attention, including their massive power density, high stability, and long cycle life. On the other hand, polymers have been known for their energy storage device application because of the pseudocapacitance behavior resulting from the extended conjugation over the polymer backbone. Here, we report a simple chemical bath deposition method for the synthesis of two polyoxometalates (H4[PVMo11O40] and H5[PV2Mo10O40]) impregnated polyaniline (PAni) composite (PVMo11@PAni and PV2Mo10@PAni) for electrochemical supercapacitors. Various analytical methods characterized the electrode materials, e.g., Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) method, and the morphological features of those electrodes were acquired by field emission scanning microscopy (FESEM). The exceptionally high average capacitance of 1371 F g−1 was obtained for the composite PVMo11@PAni electrode at a 3 A g−1 current density and 1 V potential window with an energy density of 137.5 W h kg−1. The PVMo11@PAni composite electrode showed almost 4.3 times the higher energy density than pure PAni and 2.3 times higher than PV2Mo10@PAni. In contrast, PV2Mo10@PAni composite showed 1.9 times more energy density than pure PAni composite electrode. Interestingly, high average capacitance, charge–discharge rates, and high energy density with high-level power delivery make them promising electrode candidates for supercapacitors.
