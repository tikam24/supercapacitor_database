In this paper, we report a facile low-cost synthesis of the chitin and chitosan-based hybrid nanocomposites for supercapacitors. The chitosan and chitin based hybrid composites functional group analysis, structural, optical and morphological properties were characterized using FTIR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. Specific capacitance values of hybrid composites were calculated using cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic charge-discharge analysis. The hybrid composites asymmetric supercapacitor performance was perceived in the range of -0.2 to 1.0 V. The specific capacitance value was achieved at 542.63 F g-1 at current density value of 0.1 A g-1 for CH-GO-ZnO/PANI hybrid composites. The prepared hybrid nanocomposites exhibit good supercapacitive performance and long-term cycle stability. These results demonstrate the potential of the CH-GO-ZnO/PANI hybrid nanocomposites as a high-performance supercapacitors.
