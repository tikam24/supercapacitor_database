To obtain a new composite electrode with good electrochemical performance in both acidic and neutral electrolytes, novel binary composite materials consisting of polyaniline (PANI) and polypyrrole (PPy) were prepared in this work. PANI nanofibers were firstly prepared using a solution of aniline as seed in solution of ammonium persulfate oxidant by rapidly-mixed polymerization. Then the PANI nanofibers were used as 'seed' to induce the polymerization of pyrrole monomers. The morphology and microstructure for the resulting composites were studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). TEM images showed that the formation of the core-shell nanostructures, in which the PANI acted as the core and PPy served as the shell. This result indicated that the formation of PPy occurred through in situ chemical oxidation polymerization of pyrrole monomers on the surface of PANI nanofibers. FT-IR spectra analysis further confirmed that the resulting composites were not the sum of the contributions of each individual polymer. It demonstrated that the resulting composite had potential application as electrode materials for supercapacitor in the acidic and neutral electrolytes due to the combination of the complementary properties of PANI and PPy.
