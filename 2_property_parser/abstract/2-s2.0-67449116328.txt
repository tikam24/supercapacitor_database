Composite electrodes for use in redox supercapacitors were prepared by electrochemical deposition of RuO2 or the co-deposition of Ru-Co mixed oxides on the surface of single-walled carbon nanotubes. Electrodes coated with the Ru-Co mixed oxide [Ru (13.13 wt%) and Co (2.89 wt%)] or RuO2, exhibited a similar specific capacitance (∼620 F g-1) at low potential scan rates (10 mV s-1). However, at higher scan rates (500 mV s-1) the mixed metal oxide electrode showed superior performance (570 F g-1) when compared to the RuO2 electrode (475 F g-1). This increase in capacitance at high scan rates is attributed to the role of the Co in providing enhanced electronic conduction. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
