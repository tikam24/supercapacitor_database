In this paper, the composite of Ti3C2Tx and poly (3,4-propylenedioxythiophene) (PProDOT) is prepared via a simple in-situ chemical oxidative polymerization. The optimum ratio of Ti3C2Tx@PProDOT composite with an outstanding capacitance of 462 C g−1 (462 F g−1) at 1 A g−1 is obtained by adjusting the mass ratio of Ti3C2Tx and ProDOT. The asymmetric flexible supercapacitor with Ti3C2Tx@PProDOT (1:10)//AC exhibits the gravimetric capacity of 238 C g−1 at 1 A g−1, and the retention of initial capacity remains at 79.6% after 10,000 cycles. Meanwhile, the asymmetrical supercapacitor displays an energy density of 48.6 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 729.6 W kg−1. The improvement of these properties stems from that the PProDOT effectively inhibits the stacking of Ti3C2Tx sheets, which is advantageous to shortening the transport path of ions and promoting electron transport as well as the rapid redox reactions. Therefore, these characteristics enhance the electrochemical performance of composites.
