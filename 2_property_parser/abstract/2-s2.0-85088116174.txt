Polyaniline (PANI) doped copper oxide (CuO) nanocomposites (PCN) was prepared by electrochemical deposition method. The Polyaniline nanocomposites were characterized by using Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). The Electrochemical performances are study by cyclic voltammetry of PCN nanocomposites. XRD result reveals that the variation of structural phase due to metal nanoparticles. The TGA and DSC results reveal an enhanced thermal stability of the PANI nanocomposites with the addition of concentration as compared to that of PANI. FESEM confirms the shape changes from grain to rod like structure due to addition of nano concentration. These obtained results were confirmed that PANI nanocomposite is suitable candidature for supercapacitor, electrode and Energy storage devices.
