The electrochemical performance of lithium ion battery (LIB) is strongly affected by the micro-structure of its electrode laminate. A comprehensive understanding of the micro-structure evolution in LIB electrode laminate fabrication process can help to further improve its property. Here, recent progress involving slurry making, coating and drying process in electrode fabrication process is reviewed. The interaction mechanism among particles of active material and conducting additive and polymer molecular in different solvent environment is discussed in detail. And ways to control and improve the electrode micro-structure are proposed. Not only LIB, this review will also provide hints and instructions to other kinds of electrochemical energy storage devices such as supercapacitor, Li-S and Li-air battery.
