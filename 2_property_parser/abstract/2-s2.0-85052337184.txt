Flower like ZnO and plate like CuO were fabricated upon rGO and Nitrogen doped rGO following a simple scalable cheapest facile hydrothermal treatment. XRD, FTIR and XPS analysis confirm the Formation of N-doping on rGO as well as all composites. FESEM analysis reveals the distribution of metal oxide upon the graphene nanosheets. Electrochemical activity in case of ZnO-CuO/N-rGO nanocomposite in 1 M aq. KOH exhibits 1075 Fg−1 specific capacitance (SC) at 1 Ag-1 current density. We also derived a superior energy density (ED) value of the fabricated nanocomposite to be 95.55Whkg−1 with power density (PD) 399.97 Wkg-1. Additionally, the electrode made up of hybrid ZnO-CuO/N-rGO nanocomposites displays excellent cyclic stability of 88% retention of specific capacitance after completion of 5000 cycles. These outcomes specify a hopeful prospective approach of the ZnO-CuO/N-rGO nanocomposite as a successful electrode substance in supercapacitors.
