Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as promising electrodes for supercapacitors are attracting increasing research interest. Herein, we report an effective strategy to improve the electrochemical performance of Ni-MOF for supercapacitor by introducing a secondary Co ion. The Co substitution of Ni in Ni-MOF can improve the intrinsic reactivity and stability. As a result, the bimetallic Co/Ni-MOF-1:15 with an optimal Co/Ni ratio delivers high specific capacitance (359 F/g at 0.5 A/g), good rate performance (81.5% retention at 5 A/g) and cycling stability (81% retention after 5000 cycles). These results demonstrate that the bimetallic synergistic strategy is an effective way to improve the pseudocapacitive performance of MOFs.
