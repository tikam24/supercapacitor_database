Using a simple microwave irradiation approach, we have produced three-dimensional flower-like manganese dioxide/nickel hydroxide/nickel foam (MnO2/Ni(OH)2/NF) composite as supercapacitor electrode. Structural and morphological characterizations are carried out by FT-IR spectrum, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical properties of MnO2/Ni(OH)2/NF electrode are studied with cyclic voltammetry(CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge analysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy(EIS). The results reveal that the MnO2/Ni(OH)2/NF electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 506 F/g at 16.7 A/g and excellent capacitance retention of 96% after 7000 cycles at an ultrahigh current density of 60 A/g, which suggest the composite has promising applications as an efficient electrode for electrochemical capacitors.
