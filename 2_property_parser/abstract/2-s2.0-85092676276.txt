There is ever increasing demand for flexible energy storage devices due to the development of wearable electronics and other small electronic devices. The electrode flexibility is best provided by a special set of nanomaterials, but the required methodology typically consists of multiple steps and are designed just for the specific materials. Here, a facile and scalable method of making flexible and mechanically robust planar supercapacitors with interdigital electrode structure made of commercial carbon nanomaterials and silver nanowires is presented. The capacitor structure is achieved with vacuum filtration through a micropatterned contact mask and finished with simple laser processing steps. A maximum specific capacitance of 4 F cm−3 was measured with cyclic voltammetry at scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The reliability and charge transfer properties of devices were further investigated with galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, respectively. Furthermore, mechanical bending tests confirmed the devices have excellent mechanical integrity, and the deformations have no adverse effects on the electrochemical charge-discharge behavior and stability.
