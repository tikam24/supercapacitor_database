Micro-supercapacitors MSCs were fabricated with extremely low cost by electrochemically depositing sac-like structured PPy nanowires (PPyNWs) onto predesigned fluorine doped tin oxide coated glass (FTO). The fabricated MSCs showed the excellent power performance and ultrahigh energy density. Interestingly enough, assisted by a piece of heat releasing tape (HRT), a technique was developed to transfer the pure PPyNW-based MSCs to any substrates. The PPyNW MSCs transferred on various substrates consistently showed outstanding performance, including both energy-storage ability and performance durability under different mechanical deformation.
