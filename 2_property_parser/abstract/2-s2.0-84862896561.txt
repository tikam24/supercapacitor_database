High surface area Co(OH) 2 nanosheets were prepared via cathodic electrodeposition and their electrochemical performance was investigated using cyclic voltammetry and charge-discharge tests. A specific capacitance as high as 1047.3 F g -1 was obtained in aqueous 1 M KOH within the potential range of -0.3 to 0.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at the scan rate of 10 mV s -1, suggesting the potential application of the prepared nanosheets in electrochemical supercapacitors. Result of this Letter showed that galvanostatic cathodic electrodeposition can be recognized as a facile method for the preparation of porous and high surface area Co(OH) 2 sheets.
