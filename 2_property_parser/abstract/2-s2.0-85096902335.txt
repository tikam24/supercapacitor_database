Nitrogen rich porous carbon balls are derived from hypercross-linked polymers (HCPs) of anthracene and subsequent carbonization with urea. The obtained materials exhibit combination of abundant microporous and minimal mesoporous property with large surface area (623.27 to 928.44 m2 g − 1). The influence of annealing temperature in nitrogen doped porous HCPs was examined the capacitive performance of the prepared electrode materials using electrochemical techniques. A symmetric device was assembled, and it shows a high specific capacitance of 206.4 F g − 1 at 0.2 A g − 1 with excellent rate capability. Also, the material exhibits excellent durability only 3.5% loss was observed after 5000 cycles (capacitance retention of 96.5%). These outcomes justify that nitrogen anchored porous carbon balls are excellent materials for high-performance symmetric supercapacitors.
