Vanadium pentoxide thin films are prepared via sol-gel spin coating method. The films coated on FTO and glass substrates are treated at different temperatures ranging from 250 °C to 400 °C. The structural, optical and electrochemical investigations are made. X-ray diffraction analysis shows the film to be composed of V2O5 in β-phase up to annealing temperature of 350 °C and at 400 °C the structural transformation to α-phase is observed. FTIR spectrum shows the formation of VO bond. The SEM images reveal the formation of nanopores. Optical absorption studies indicate a band gap of 2.2-2.4 eV. The supercapacitor behaviour is studied using cyclic voltammetery technique and electrochemical impedance analysis. The vanadium pentoxide films annealed at 300 °C for an hour exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 346 F g-1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
