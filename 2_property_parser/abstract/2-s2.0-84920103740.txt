(Graph Presented) A simple method to fabricate edge-oriented MoS2 films with sponge-like morphologies is demonstrated. They are directly fabricated through the reaction of sulfur vapor with anodically formed Mo oxide sponge-like films on flexible Mo substrates. The edge-oriented MoS2 film delivers excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity with enhanced kinetics and longterm cycling stability. The material also has superior energy-storage performance when working as a flexible, all-solidstate supercapacitor device.
