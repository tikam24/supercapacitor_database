Functional carbon materials with tuned structure and properties can be created by incorporating N atoms into the carbon matrix, which holds great promise in a number of fields and has drawn much attention around the world. This review has addressed the mechanism involved in the preparation of N-doped carbon materials, the strategies for making the N-doped carbon materials and their applications in hydrogen storage, supercapacitor, fuel cells, sensors and adsorption. The future trends are also briefly discussed.
