In this study, Graphene Oxide (GO) is produced using Hummers method. The produced GO were investigated by x-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), UV-Vis spectrum, Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). GO films on Ni foam were prepared by doctor-blading technique. The electrochemical performances of the as-synthesized GO electrode was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 6 M KOH aqueous solution. Capacitances of GO electrode was measured as 0.76 F/g.
