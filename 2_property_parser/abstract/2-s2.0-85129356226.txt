The N/O co-doped hierarchical porous graphitized carbon microspheres (N/O-PCs) are successfully prepared by condensation polymerization of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and melamine, and subsequent KOH activation strategy. The obtained carbon materials have a high specific surface area (1685.58 m2 g–1), rich micro- and mesopores, and appropriate pore volume (0.828 cm3 g–1). The degree of graphitization for N/O-PCs is improved because the ratio of IG and ID increases from 0.88 to 1.03. The layer spacing of the lattice plane (002) for the N/O-PCs is enlarged, facilitating the transmission of electrolyte ions. The high graphitization degree and enlarged layer spacing bring excellent electrical conductivity and wettability for N/O-PCs as electrode materials. Besides, owing to the higher N (3.59 at%) and O (12.67 at%) content, the N/O-PCs show excellent specific capacitances of 412 and 284 F g–1 at the current densities of 1 and 10 A g–1 in 2 m H2SO4 aqueous electrolytes, respectively. Outstanding rate performance (200 F g–1 at 50 A g–1) and ideal cycle stability (>10 000 cycles) are achieved. Moreover, the N/O-PCs-based symmetric supercapacitor exhibits an energy density of 9.6 Wh kg–1 at 100.8 W kg–1. Thus, the N/O-PCs provide the potential for high-performance supercapacitor electrodes.
