ZnFe2O4 thin film has been synthesized by a simple and low cost successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method without the use of surfactant or template. The nanoplate composed of nanoparticles with porous surface morphology has been revealed which is beneficial towards supercapacitor application. Formed ZnFe2O4 thin film has been tested as an electrode material for supercapacitor through electrochemical analysis. First attempt for SILAR synthesized ZnFe2O4 thin film exhibited a specific capacitance of 471 Fg-1 at a scan rate of 5 mVs-1 in 1 M NaOH aqueous solution. Further, ZnFe2O4 solid-state symmetric (SSS) supercapacitor device demonstrated voltage window of 1.0 V with specific capacitance of 32 Fg-1, energy density of 4.47 Whkg-1 and power density of 277 Wkg-1 at 1 Ag-1 current density. Such high performance capacitive behavior indicates ZnFe2O4 thin film is promising and low cost electrode material towards energy storage devices for various portable electronic systems.
