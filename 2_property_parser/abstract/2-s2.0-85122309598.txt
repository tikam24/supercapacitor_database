With the continuous demands for wearable electronics, the embeddable power sources have drawn attention to develop advanced electrode materials and feasible manufacture procedures. Fiber-based flexible energy storage devices have the potential to be practically integrated by utilizing the high-performance materials with precisely constructed structures. Herein, a novel approach is presented to achieve an outstanding fiber-based supercapacitor by simultaneous wet-spinning of mesoporous MXene (Ti3C2Tx) nanoflakes. The volumetric capacitance of the porous fiber is enhanced up to ≈145% when the content of mesoporous MXene reaches 15 wt%. The symmetric all-solid-state fiber supercapacitor shows an extraordinary capability of 821.5 F cm–3 at a current density of 0.5 A cm–3, which reflects an enormous improvement to that of a nonporous MXene fiber-based supercapacitor. The measured energy density is 8.9 mWh cm–3 at a power density of 401 mW cm–3, which also indicates the effective synergy of the constructed pathways for ions and electrons. This work demonstrates the feasibility of scalable production of fiber-based electrode materials with porous MXene for powering wearable applications.
