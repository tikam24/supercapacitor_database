We demonstrate a simple and efficient one-step procedure for synthesizing a solid state polypyrrole (PPy) thin film for supercapacitor applications using alternating current impedance spectroscopy. By controlling the frequency and amplitude we were able to create unique PPy nano/microstructures with a particular morphology of the loop. Our PPy micro/nanosphere shows extremely high capacitance of 568 F/g, which is close to the theoretical value of 620 F/g and 20-100% higher than that of other reported PPy electrodes. Most of all, this material presents high capacitance and significantly improved electrochemical stability without pulverization of its structure, demonstrating 77% retention of the capacitance value even after 10 000 charge/discharge cycles. These results are a consequence of the larger surface area and adequate porosity generated due to the balance between the nano/micro PPy loops. This created porous structure also allows the favored penetration of electrolyte and high ion mobility within the polymer and prevents the mechanical failure of the physical structure during volume variation associated with the insertion/deinsertion of ions upon cycling.
