Electrochemical supercapacitors are widely investigated as energy storage devices. The major part of research is dedicated to electrode materi-als development. Herein, we describe an electrochemical synthesis of 6 carbon-based materials from graphite. Influence of synthesis parameters (temperature and distance between electrodes) on resulting materials was investigated. The materials were tested to be used as electrode material in electrochemical energy storing system with phosphate buffer (pH=7) as supporting electrolyte. Resulted system showed a good stability and high operating voltage range (0-1.1 V). The higher and most stable specific capacitance of discharge was shown for a system there the material ob-tained at 80 Â°C and 3 cm of distance between electrodes was used as an electrode material (207 F g-1and 23% after 200 cycles, respectively).
