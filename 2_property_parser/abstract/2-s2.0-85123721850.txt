In this study, polypyrrole (PPy) was coated onto pineapple-polyester (PAPF) and water hyacinth-polyester blended fabrics (WHPF) via in situ chemical polymerization to fabricate a flexible and working supercapacitor electrode. The electrodes were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The electrodes were used to assemble a full cell supercapacitor to perform cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and Galvanostatic charge-discharge tests. The PPy/PAPF and PPy/WHPF composites exhibited high areal capacitance values (86.01 mF cm−2 and 104.31 mF cm−2, respectively, at 1 mA cm−2). The composites had low equivalent series, solution, and charge transfer resistance, indicating good contact and electron flow. The PPy/PAPF and PPy/WHPF composites also show good volumetric power (0.1104 Wh L−1 and 0.1362 Wh L−1, respectively, at 1 mA cm−2) and energy densities (12.72 W L−1 and 16.03 W L−1, respectively, at 1 mA cm−2). These results show that PPy textile composites exhibit promising characteristics as supercapacitor electrode materials fabricated using fabrics with natural fibers.
