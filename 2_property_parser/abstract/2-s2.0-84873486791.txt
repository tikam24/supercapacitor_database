Electrochemical studies of co-deposition show that the palladium deposited onto a copper substrate produces very high capacitance values (370 Farads/g) equal to those of supercapacitor materials. This large electrode capacitance causes a collapsing and tilting of the cyclic voltammograms that approaches Ohm's Law behavior. Results for the electrochemistry, chemistry, and calorimetry of the 0.025 M PdCl2+0.15 M NH4Cl+0.15 M NH4OH system and its deuterium analog are reported.
