Functionalized carbon nanotube (FCNT) and Manganese Oxide (MnO2) nanoflower hybrid material was synthesized using hydrothermal technique as a promising electrode material for supercapacitor applications. The morphological investigation revealed the formation of nanoflower like structure of MnO2 connected with FCNT, thus paving an easy path for the conduction of electrons during the electrochemical mechanism. A significant improvement in capacitance properties was observed in the hybrid material, in which carbon nanotube acts as a conducting cylindrical path, while the major role of MnO2 was to store the charge, acting as an electrolyte reservoir leading to an overall improved electrochemical performance. The full cell electrochemical analysis of FCNT-MnO2 hybrid using 3 M potassium hydroxide (KOH) electrolyte indicated a specific capacitance of 359.53 F g-1, specific energy of 49.93 Wh kg-1 and maximum specific power of 898.84 W kg-1 at 5 mV s-1. The results show promise for the future of supercapacitor development based on hybrid electrode materials, where high specific energy can be achieved along with high specific power and long cycle life.
