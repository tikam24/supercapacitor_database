A binder-free composite composed of two-dimensional (2D) vanadium oxysulfide nano-spindles (VoS-NS) directly grown on carbon textile (CT) substrate (VoS-NS@CT) is prepared as a novel electrode for high-performance pseudocapacitors (PCs). Benefiting from the merits of highly exposed active sites and enhanced electrical conductivity, optimized VoS-NS@CT exhibits remarkable specific capacitance of 1305 Fg−1 at 4 Ag−1 with superb retention of 97.7% after 15,000 cycles and possesses good rate capability. Furthermore, the VoS-NS@CT delivered high pseudocapacitive charge storage properties (80%, capacitive) at 15 mVs−1.
