A multi-scale porous carbon thin film is highly demanded as an electrode for next-generation compact energy storage devices. However, conventional solution coating/printing has limitations in preparing well-defined sub-micrometer-resolution pores. Here, we demonstrate a semiconductor process for fabricating multi-scale porous carbon thin films. This is achieved by carbonization of oxide-coated multi-beam interference lithography photoresist patterns. The interference lithography defines macropore patterns, and the oxide shell inhibits pyrolytic condensation to engrave mesopores in the pattern skeleton. Our hierarchically porous carbon thin film exhibits a high BET surface area of ​​539 m2/g and a high porosity of about 80%. We demonstrate these porous carbon thin films as microsupercapacitor (MSC) and lithium oxygen battery (LOB) electrodes. The electrode achieves a microsupercapacitor of high energy density (3.61 μWh/cm2) and power density (1.30 mW/cm2) and also achieves a lithium-oxygen battery with high discharge capacity (6,123 mAh/g) and reversible charge/discharge.
