A solution precipitation method at room temperature was developed for the fabrication of Bismuth sulfoiodide (BiSI). A photo-chargeable symmetric supercapacitor was fabricated using the synthesized BiSI as electrode materials and PVA-KOH as aqueous gel electrolyte. The device exhibits a photogenerated current density of 0.1 μA cm−2 without any external applied voltage. The fabricated supercapacitor exhibits 1.5 times increase in specific capacitance under illumination of 1 sun. The present work integrates photovoltaic and charge storage properties of photoactive BiSI to realize a cost-effective power source.
