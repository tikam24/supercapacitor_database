Graphene has been the subject of widespread research during the past decade because of its outstanding physical properties which make it an ideal nanoscale material to investigate fundamental properties. Such characteristics promote graphene as a functional material for the emergence of disruptive technologies. However, to impact daily life products and devices, high-quality graphene needs to be produced in large quantities using an environmentally friendly protocol. In this context, the production of graphene which preserves its outstanding electronic properties using a green chemistry approach remains a key challenge. Herein, we report the efficient production of electrode material for micro-supercapacitors obtained by functionalization of water-dispersed high-quality graphene nanosheets with polydopamine. High-frequency (terahertz) conductivity measurements of the graphene nanosheets reveal high charge carrier mobility up to 1000 cm-2 V-1 s-1. The fine water dispersibility enables versatile functionalization of graphene, as demonstrated by the pseudocapacitive polydopamine coating of graphene nanosheets. The polydopamine functionalization causes a modest, i.e., 20%, reduction of charge carrier mobility. Thin film electrodes based on such hybrid materials for micro-supercapacitors exhibit excellent electrochemical performance, namely a volumetric capacitance of 340 F cm-3 and a power density of 1000 W cm-3, thus outperforming most of the reported graphene-based micro-supercapacitors. These results highlight the potential for water-dispersed, high-quality graphene nanosheets as a platform material for energy-storage applications.
