The applications of supercapacitors which ensures safety, reliability, and efficiency of cars and road vehicles, are discussed. The importance of having a secondary power source is visualized only when the vehicle is in an accident. As vehicles become more electronic and less mechanical, supercapacitors are being tested as a back-up power source for everything from the high-energy primary battery. One application of a supercapacitor back-up supply, actuates solenoids which would release electronically-tensioned seat belts after a car comes to rest following a collision. One of the safety concerns is the emergency or hazard lighting. Implementation of a supercapacitor as a secondary power source would eliminate hazard light failure.
