As an emerging energy storage device, supercapacitor is widely investigated owing to its excellent capability, quick charge-discharge and tremendous cycle life. The operation potential window, energy density and mass loading of supercapacitor must be taken into deep consideration for its practical application. In this work, an outstanding electrode based on CFF@V2O5 nanosheets was prepared. Then a free-standing asymmetric supercapacitor with CFF@V2O5 composite as positive electrode and CFF@AC as negative electrode was assembled. Owing to the functional groups produced on CFF after the activation, V2O5 nanosheets was immobilized. The composite exhibits remarkable specific capabilities of 1465 mF cm−2 (492 F g−1). The energy density of the assembled free-standing asymmetric supercapacitor achieves 0.928 mWh cm−3 when the power density is 17.5 mW cm−3. After 6000 charging-discharging cycles as under normal, bended and anti-bended conditions for respective 2000 cycles, the device retains 89.7% of the initial capacitance, exhibiting fascinating cycle stabilization. Finally, two devices linked series can lighten a LED of 1.8 V for 2 min after charging for 2.5 min, which is inspiring for the practical application and production of self-supporting asymmetric supercapacitors.
