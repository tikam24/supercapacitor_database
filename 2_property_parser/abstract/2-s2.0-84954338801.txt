In this paper, the Ni2P/Co3V2O8 nanocomposite is synthesized by a facile chemical precipitation technique using Ni2P (with high specific capacitance and electrical conductivity) and Co3V2O8 (with good rate capability and cycle stability) as precursor. The composite combines separately the advantages of the high specific capacitance of Ni2P and the good rate capability as well as cycle stability of Co3V2O8, showing excellent pseudocapacitive properties. The specific capacitance of the Ni2P/Co3V2O8 nanocomposite achieve 1002.5 F g-1 at a current density 1 A g-1 and maintain 605 F g-1 at 20 A g-1, 95% of its initial specific capacitance is retained after 3000 cycles. Also, an asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled, where Ni2P/Co3V2O8 and activated carbon acted as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. The maximum specific capacitance of 147.5 F g-1 and the specific energy of 40.2 Wh kg-1 are demonstrated at a cell voltage between 0 to 1.7 V, suggesting that the Ni2P/Co3V2O8 nanocomposite is an ideal pseudocapacitive electrode material, which provided a new thinking for the potential application of hybrid electrode in energy-storage devices.
