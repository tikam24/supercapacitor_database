The types of cells and methods of electrochemical reduction of graphene oxide films were described. The possibility of creating ultrathin membrane–electrode assemblies of supercapacitor cells was demonstrated. The peculiarities of the electrochemical behavior of films of different thicknesses that contact with carbon and metal current collectors were shown. The limiting charge (1500–2000 C/g) for complete electrochemical reduction of graphene oxide was determined. Possible mechanisms of proton conductivity along the basal faces of graphene oxide flakes were proposed. The nature of the current collector was shown to affect the electron–hole conductivity of graphene oxide films and the observed contact potential difference.
