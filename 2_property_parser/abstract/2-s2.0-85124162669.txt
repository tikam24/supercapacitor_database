Nanocone is unique nano-architecture having conical shape. Nanocone may have different types depending upon composition including carbon nanocone, graphene nanocone, polymer nanocone, and inorganic nanocone. Nanocone has been employed as nanofiller in polymers. The matrices used are conjugated polymers (polyaniline, polypyrrole, poly(3-methylthiophene), etc.) and thermoplastic polymers (polystyrene, polyethylene, polyimide, etc.). Polymer/nanocone nanocomposites have been developed using facile approaches. Integration of nanocone in polymers have resulted in unique characteristics such as high surface area, electrical conductivity, glass transition temperature, thermal and mechanical properties, specific capacitance, and photovoltaic properties. The polymer/nanocone nanocomposites have been employed in solar cell, supercapacitor, and biomedical applications.
