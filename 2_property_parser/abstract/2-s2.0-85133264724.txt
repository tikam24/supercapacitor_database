In this study, hierarchical polyaniline (PANI) nanosheets were electrochemically deposited on indium tin oxide nanoparticles coated fluorine-doped tin oxide glass (ITONPs-FTO) substrate from an aqueous solution containing 0.5 M aniline and 1 M H2SO4. The ITONPs provide efficient support with high electroactive surface area in the electrochemical deposition of PANI and produce excellent PANI films. The developed PANI film deposited on the ITONPs-FTO electrode was characterized via field-emission scanning-electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. A hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) was fabricated using the developed PANI deposited ITONPs-FTO as a positrode and the jute sticks derived activated carbon nanosheets coated FTO (JAC-FTO) as a negatrode. Because of its high capacitive performance, unique structures of electrode materials, and optimum operating potential window, the fabricated PANI-ITONPs-FTO//JAC-FTO HSC performed excellently in 0.1 M HCl aqueous electrolyte, delivering a high areal capacitance of 318 mF/cm2 at a 1.0 mA/cm2 current density and exhibit a high energy density of 28 µWh/cm2 at a high power density of 400 µW/cm2. Moreover, the HSC exhibits excellent cyclic stability with ∼ 87% Coulombic efficiency and ∼ 91% capacitance retention after 1000 charge–discharge cycles.
