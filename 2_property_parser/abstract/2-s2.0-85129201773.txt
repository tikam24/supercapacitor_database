The indoor environment climate should be controlled by continuously maintaining the temperature and relative humidity to achieve thermal comfort. A monitoring system of both parameters is the first step to improving indoor comfort quality. This paper presents a smart wireless climate sensor node for indoor temperature and humidity monitoring with a powering strategy and design approach for autonomous operation. The data logging results are sent to the cloud using Internet of Things protocol for thermal comfort monitoring and analysis. The monitoring and analysis results are useful to monitor and control the indoor thermal comfort condition for room occupants. A sensor node was designed that includes a low-power mode and compact size features. It consists of a built-in AVR-based microcontroller, a temperature and humidity sensor, and a wireless module with a supercapacitor as the power storage. A low-power algorithm and Internet of Things system were implemented to reduce the total energy consumption as low as possible during operation while improving the thermal comfort quality. This developed sensor node has a small error for temperature, and relative humidity sensed values resulting from calibration. At the same time, it also consumes low power for one cycle of data acquisition. The device was integrated with an Internet of Things monitoring system to monitor indoor thermal comfort in the field experiment. The experiment results showed that the indoor temperature and relative humidity were measured and recorded in the range of 25–30◦ C and 30–40%, respectively. This prototype is a preliminary design to achieve an autonomous sensor node with a low-power energy consumption goal. Thus, with this feature, the developed sensor node has potential to couple with a micro energy harvester module toward a fully autonomous active node in further development.
