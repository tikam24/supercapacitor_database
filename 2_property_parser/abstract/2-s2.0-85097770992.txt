This paper investigates some issues associated with the power sharing in the Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) in the Multi Micro- Grid System (MMGS) to meet the load demands. To address this problem in isolated microgrids, which often arises in emergency situations, the present study proposes an efficient energy management system (EMS) which operates the battery and supercapacitor (SC) based on their State of Charge (SOC) level using fuzzy logic based control algorithm. The optimal amount of charging/discharging of the battery and SC is decided by the fuzzy inference system (FIS). Simulations are carried out by creating a microgrid test bench for fuzzy logic system (FLS) in MATLAB/Simulink environment. The performance of the proposed approach is validated considering different modes of operation and loading conditions and found to be satisfactory.
