Carbon materials have been used as potential electrode for supercapacitor applications and this review focused on status of maximum biomass derived carbon precursors with or without external activation in the application of supercapacitors, understanding the aspects of porous carbon materials derived from various biomass which are incorporated as electrodes for supercapacitors. This review highlights the production of activated carbon from waste biomass and also deals with their characterization techniques such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy (RAMAN), field emission scanning microscopy (FESEM), Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and their impacts on electrochemical performance of galvanostatic charge discharge analysis (GCD) and cyclic stability test in the application of supercapacitors.
