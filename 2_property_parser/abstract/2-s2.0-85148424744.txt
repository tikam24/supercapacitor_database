Energy storage devices are important components in portable electronics, electric vehicles, and the electrical distribution grid. Batteries and supercapacitors have achieved great success as the spearhead of electrochemical energy storage devices, but need to be further developed in order to meet the ever-increasing energy demands, especially attaining higher power and energy density, and longer cycling life. Rational design of electrode materials plays a critical role in developing energy storage systems with higher performance. Graphene, the well-known 2D allotrope of carbon, with a unique structure and excellent properties has been considered a “magic” material with its high energy storage capability, which can not only aid in addressing the issues of the state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors, but also be crucial in the so-called post Li-ion battery era covering different technologies, e.g., sodium ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, structural batteries, and hybrid supercapacitors. In this feature article, we provide a comprehensive overview of the strategies developed in our research to create graphene-based composite electrodes with better ionic conductivity, electron mobility, specific surface area, mechanical properties, and device performance than state-of-the-art electrodes. We summarize the strategies of structure manipulation and surface modification with specific focus on tackling the existing challenges in electrodes for batteries and supercapacitors by exploiting the unique properties of graphene-related materials.
