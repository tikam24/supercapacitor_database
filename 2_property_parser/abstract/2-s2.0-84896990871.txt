The reaction of β-Co(OH)2 hexagonal platelets with graphite oxide in an aqueous colloidal dispersion results in the formation of β-Co(OH)2 hexagonal rings anchored to graphene oxide layers. The interaction between the basic hydroxide layers and the acidic groups on graphene oxide induces chemical etching of the hexagonal platelets, forming β-Co(OH)2 hexagonal rings. On heating in air or N2, the hydroxide hybrid is morphotactically converted to porous Co 3O4/CoO hexagonal ring-graphene hybrids. Porous NiCo 2O4 hexagonal ring-graphene hybrid is also obtained through a similar process starting from β-Ni0.33Co 0.67(OH)2 platelets. As electrode materials for supercapacitors or lithium-ion batteries, these materials exhibit a large capacity, high rate capability, and excellent cycling stability. © 2014 American Chemical Society.
