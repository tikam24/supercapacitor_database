Poplar wood-based porous carbon was prepared as supercapacitor electrode material by dual mild activation method of autohydrolysis pretreatment (AP) combined with enzymatic hydrolysis (EH). The effect of EH assisted by AP on the electrochemical properties of poplar wood-based porous carbon was explored. The results showed that the simple enzymatic hydrolysis could only produce a few pores in the cavity of the pits, which limited the effect on improving the resultant electrochemical performance. When EH was assisted by AP and the mass ratio of cellulase to poplar wood was 0.05:1, the mass specific capacitance of the poplar wood-based porous carbon could reach 149.70 F/g at a current density of 0.1 A/g. The capacitance retention rate was still as high as 94.0% after 5000 cycles at a high current density of 2 A/g.
