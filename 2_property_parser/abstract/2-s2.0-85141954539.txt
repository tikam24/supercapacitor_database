Herein, a simple hydrothermal approach was employed to synthesize a homogeneous and compact ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles on the surface of ZrO2 (ZnFe2O4-ZrO2), and it was utilized as a supporting-material for Pt nanoparticles. The fabricated ZnFe2O4-ZrO2 and ZnFe2O4-ZrO2/Pt nanoarchitectures were employed as an electrode material for the supercapacitor cells, and an electrocatalyst for the methanol oxidation reaction, respectively. The Pt nanoparticles were electrochemically deposited on the ZnFe2O4-ZrO2 support. The electrochemical characterizations illustrated that ZnFe2O4-ZrO2 supported Pt was of a peak current density of 104.74 mA/cm2, which was 1.73 more than the peak current density of Pt without the use of nanocomposite support and strong cycling stability of 110 percent after 150 cycles for the methanol oxidation reaction. As a supercapacitor electrode, ZnFe2O4-ZrO2 offered a high specific capacitance of 193.76F/g at a current density of 1.0 A/g, an appropriate rate efficiency (102.4 F/g at current density of 8 A/g), and strong cycling stability of 93 % after 250 galvanostatic chargeâ€“discharge revealing the high cycle stability of the nanocomposite. The superb electrochemical behavior of the ZnFe2O4-ZrO2 electrode was ascribed to the low internal charge resistance and ion diffusion resistance. The more ion/electron pathways of diffusion and a suitable contact area with the electrolyte, and the strong synergistic interaction between the components conferred exceptional conductivity and structural durability on the electrode. The results paved the new avenues for nanoengineering of up-and-coming metal-based nanoarchitectures to be utilized in energy storage and conversion systems.
