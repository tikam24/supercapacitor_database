The supercapacitor, the relatively new passive component in the electronic field, has begun drawing attention to more and more users in terms of energy storage and delivery applications in a very short time. Researchers are trying to constantly improve and reduce a number of disadvantages for this component, such as: decrease in equivalent series resistance, increase in maximum working voltage or capacity. All these aspects can be improved only by making different variants of components, from different materials and choosing the variant with the best results. For this, the purpose of this work is to present the realization a supercapacitor, Pouch type cell, by means of the equipment already used in the manufacture of batteries. As materials, will be used for electrodes, aluminum foil on which a porous material will be deposited, and as an electrolyte we will use an ionic liquid, known for its performance regarding much higher working voltage (up to 5V) compared to aqueous electrolytes (maximum 1.2V) or organic electrolytes (maximum 2.7V). Thus, we try to obtain a supercapacitor for which the working voltage exceeds the maximum value encountered so far for a single component and also based on the fact that we have all the information about the realization process we can draw important conclusions about the component made. In this way we can bring improvements to future components, by using other materials instead of those we consider problematic.
