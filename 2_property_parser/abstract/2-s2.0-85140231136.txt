Iron oxyhydroxide (γ-FeOOH) films were prepared by nitrate reduction mechanism under cathodic potential. Phase transformation to iron oxide (α-Fe2O3) was carried out by post-deposition annealing treatment at two different temperatures, 300 and 500 °C, in Ar and air environments. The variation in super capacitive behaviour/contribution in iron oxyhydroxide and iron oxide films concerning structural change in Fe-oxidation state is studied. X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy investigations confirmed structural phase transformation from layered oxyhydroxide to rhombohedral oxide structure. Flake-like nanosheet morphology is observed from scanning electron microscope images for the films. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were carried out for electrochemical studies. An overall specific capacitance of 79.57 F/g was observed for the oxygen-deficient phase of α-Fe2O3 (corundum-type rhombohedral structure) in 0.5 M Na2SO4, pseudo-capacitive contribution is 45.1%, and electric double-layer contribution is 54.9% and enhanced specific capacitance of 161.02 F/g in 0.5 M Na2SO3.
