In this report, 3D flower-like cobalt phosphate (Co3(PO4)2, CPO) was prepared through a facile co-precipitation method towards voltammetric sensing of rutin (RU), quercetin (QCT) and also employed for supercapacitor application. The structural morphologies were analyzed by various analytical techniques. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analysis of CPO displays a specific surface area of 40.885 m2 g−1 and a mesopore volume of 0.0108 cm3 g−1, which provides more catalytic sites, and a good electron transfer pathway that leading to promote enhanced electrochemical performance for detection of RU, and QCT. The oxidation peak current demonstrated low detection limits of 0.009 μM for RU and 0.003 μM for QCT with broad linear concertation of RU and QCT were 0.02 → 121.62 μM, and 0.08 → 129.8 μM, respectively. The fabricated electrode shows a higher sensitivity of 1.352 and 3.847 μA μM−1 cm−2 for RU and QCT detection. The modified CPO/SPCE offers excellent selectivity, repeatability, reproducibility, and further monitoring for RU and QCT in spiked fruit samples showing applicable recoveries. The electrochemical supercapacitor was explored using a CPO/NF electrode that revealed high specific capacitance of 680 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1, and good stability of 89.3% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles at 6.0 A g−1.
