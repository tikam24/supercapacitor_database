An ionic liquid-modified reduced graphene oxide/polyaniline (RGO-IL/PANI) composite was synthesized successfully. The ionic liquid enlarged the interlayer distance of RGO sheets and acted as a PANI dopant to improve the orderly establishment of PANI. The supercapacitor based on RGO-IL/PANI presented outstanding energy density (24.1 W h kg−1at 501 W kg−1), good cycling stability (91.5% capacity retention after 1000 cycles) and excellent flexibility. The results demonstrated the significant potential application of the obtained RGO-IL/PANI composite as a flexible electrode for high-performance energy storage devices.
