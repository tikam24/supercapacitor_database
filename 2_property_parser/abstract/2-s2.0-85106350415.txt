Understanding sorption in porous carbon electrodes is crucial to many environmental and energy technologies, such as capacitive deionization (CDI), supercapacitor energy storage, and activated carbon filters. In each of these examples, a practical model that can describe ion electrosorption kinetics is highly desirable for accelerating material design. Here, we proposed a multiscale model to study the ion electrosorption kinetics in porous carbon electrodes by combining quantum mechanical simulations with continuum approaches. Our model integrates the Butler-Volmer (BV) equation for sorption kinetics and a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) formulation with atomistic calculations of ion hydration and ion-pore interactions based on density functional theory (DFT). We validated our model experimentally by using ion mixtures in a flow-through electrode CDI device and developed an in-line UV absorption system to provide unprecedented resolution of individual ions in the separation process. We showed that the multiscale model captures unexpected experimental phenomena that cannot be explained by the traditional ion electrosorption theory. The proposed multiscale framework provides a viable approach for modeling separation processes in systems where pore sizes and ion hydration effects strongly influence the sorption kinetics, which can be leveraged to explore possible strategies for improving carbon-based and, more broadly, pore-based technologies.
