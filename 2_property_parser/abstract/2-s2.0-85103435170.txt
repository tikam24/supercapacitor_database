In an electronic system, energy conservation and its effective utilization are considered to be an important factor. Control of supercapacitor bank using balancing circuit is one of the current research areas in the industry. The objective of the project is to identify unbalanced capacitor bank charged using detection algorithm for effective balancing. In this proposed method, we introduced a balancing technique that helps the circuit and its control using fuzzy logic. Fuzzy rules are applied before balancing to improve quality and the life span of supercapacitors. The circuit is further linked with solar panel inverter as an energy harvesting system. Further to maintain constant power, battery is also connected in parallel with the circuit. Several test charts are under process for the proposed model. That shows the significant improvement as an efficient system.
