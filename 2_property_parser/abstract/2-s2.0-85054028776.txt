With the rapid development of wearable electronics, smart devices with fast response to external stimulus are attracting our considerable attention. Among them, multifunctional integrated devices which can integrate many functions in one device and miniaturize their volume are much needed. Herein, single Janus iodine-doped rGO/rGO film(IrGO/rGO) with multi-responsive actuation and high capacitance is developed for smart integrated electronics. When served as multiple-responsive actuator materials including humidity, heat and electricity actuation, the single Janus IrGO/rGO film shows exceptionally large static deformation, fast response bending rate up to 70° per second and highly durable repeatability. While worked as electrodes, IrGO/rGO film based supercapacitors exhibit remarkable electrochemical performances with a specific areal capacitance of 12.4 mF cm−2 at a current density of 0.01 mA cm−2 and capacitance retention of 89.2% after 5000 cycles. Based on these extraordinary properties, a smart mechanical gripper and a multifunctional integrated supercapacitor device with smart stimulus-controlled reversible actuator switches were successfully built using the single IrGO/rGO film as the functional materials, demonstrating the application potential in different kinds of smart multifunctional integrated devices.
