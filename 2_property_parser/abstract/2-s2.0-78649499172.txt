Supercapacitors can store more energy than parallel-plate capacitors, and charge more rapidly than batteries, so they are potentially valuable for applications such as regenerative braking in electrified vehicles. Typical engineering materials for these devices, such as carbon aerogels, have very complicated structures and properties. Nanoporous gold formed by dealloying has a well defined pore structure and a chemically well understood surface, and is a test platform in which phenomena can be isolated and studied. By tuning device geometry, salt concentration, and monolayer structure in nanoporous gold electrodes, we can observe phenomena such as salt depletion and partitioning that affect performance. Comparison to the de Levie model for porous electrodes leads us to proposals for design improvements that account for these phenomena and may lead to performance enhancements in practical devices.
