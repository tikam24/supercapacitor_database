Highly dense porous solvated free-standing graphene films were prepared by pressing graphene hydrogels obtained by a hydrothermal approach, which entails the generation of hematite nanoparticles that act as separators and endotemplate agents to generate pores. The as-prepared solvated graphene films have characteristics that make them suitable for use in supercapacitors, that is, a free-standing nature, a thickness of around 110 μm, a high packing density (1.1 gcm–3) and a large areal mass loading (12 mgcm–2). When used as supercapacitor electrodes, the graphene films show a high cell capacitance of ≈43 Fg–1 (47 Fcm–3) at 0.1 Ag–1 in aqueous electrolyte (H2SO4) and retain 50% of their low rate capacitance even at a high current density of 40 Ag–1. Such porous yet highly dense materials could be used to fabricate lighter and more compact supercapacitor devices than those currently based on activated carbon.
