Atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) materials are excellent supercapacitor electrode candidates with intriguing physical and chemical properties. As a typical three-dimensional printing technique, direct ink writing (DIW) provides a new platform to bridge the gap between 2D materials and advanced supercapacitor electrodes. In the current review, recent progresses in DIW of 2D materials for supercapacitor applications are systematically presented, in which basic DIW processes, key scientific/technical points and corresponding strategies are highlighted. Ink fabrication and optimization based on 2D materials are discussed for supercapacitors, and recent advances in DIW of a variety of 2D material (including graphene, transition metal carbides and/or nitride (MXene), transition metal dichalcogenide and others)-based supercapacitor electrodes are offered. Furthermore, conclusions along with a brief discussion on challenges and opportunities of DIW-manufactured 2D materials are also provided for future supercapacitor applications.
