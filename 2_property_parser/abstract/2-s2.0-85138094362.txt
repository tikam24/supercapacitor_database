Since electric vehicles are emerging market in great numbers, the search for progressive storage technologies with enhanced durability, security, energy and power density and affordability is gaining importance. The ineffectiveness of standalone battery system during peak demand situations and variations in transient load conditions leads to its lower recognition. Since more power requirement is demanded by such situations, batteries in turn tend to be oversized to meet desired results which in turn leads to an increased volume, weight and rate. Depending on battery alone can lead to lower efficiency since the increased stress leads to low performance of battery and decreased life time. This paper examines the major hurdles that cause a decreased popularity of standalone battery system. Different HESS designs based on qualitative comparisons are discussed.
