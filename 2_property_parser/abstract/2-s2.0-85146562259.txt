As an industrial material for supercapacitive energy storage, commercial activated carbons (AC) could achieve a satisfactory gravimetric performances by electric double layered capacitance (EDLC) due to their rich microporosity, but the volumetric performances are usually poor resulted from the low packing density. Herein, we presented a strategy to address this tradeoff relationship and to achieve both high gravimetric and volumetric performance by filling the macro/mesoporosity with extra nitrogen doped carbon. The reconstructed activated carbon could inherit most of microporosity from the parent AC, while the macro/mesoporosity of them was greatly decreased, resulting in increase of packing density and the improvement of surface hydrophilicity. Benefited from the increase of packing density and maintenance of microporosity, the resultant activated carbon achieves greatly enhanced energy storage level including three times higher capacitance of 384 F cm−3@ 1.0 A/g (vs 128 F cm−3@ 1.0 A/g for pristine AC), high rate capability of 73.4% (vs 59.2% for pristine AC), larger energy density of 27.5 Wh L−1@ 900 W L−1 (vs 10.0 Wh L−1@747 W L−1). Importantly, the present strategy provides a facile and unique method to process activated carbon, which offers a possibility improving the energy storage level of the commercial activated carbon.
