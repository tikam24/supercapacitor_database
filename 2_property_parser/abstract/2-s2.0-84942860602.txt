Supercapacitors (SCs) impedance modeling represents one important key to get information for SCs health monitoring and simulation. As a matter of fact, SCs behavior is dependent on various parameters such as pore size distribution of electrodes, electrolyte state, temperature, aging, etc. We propose in this study to model SC taking into account physical considerations. Basing on the theory on homogenous structure impedance, we first define the single pore model using the uniform size of pores distribution. In the second step, we attempt to generalize this circuit model considering an electrode with different pores sizes or different penetrabilities of the pores. This model called multipore (MP) model (or multipenetrability model) has been developed by our laboratories. This model allows analyzing the behavior of SC by modeling each group of electrode pores as a branch of an electrical equivalent circuit. This paper is the first in the literature to give a simple and reproducible method for MP model parameters identification. The validity of the identification method will also be verified at different SC aging rates thanks to experimental aging tests.
