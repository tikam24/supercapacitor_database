Hybrid electrochemical supercapacitors based on carbon and conducting polymers as negative and positive electrodes, respectively, have been investigated. Poly-(3-fluorinatedphenyl)thiophene and poly(ethylenedioxythiophene) derivatives showing various ranges of electrochemical activity and capacitance values were evaluated as positive electrodes. It was shown that the mass and capacitance of the polymers have a significant effect on the charge/discharge characteristics and performance of such hybrid electrochemical supercapacitors. The experimental conditions that should be used to obtain specific charge/discharge curves are presented. A linear charge/discharge curve can be obtained between 0 and 3 V when the weight of conducting polymer is larger than that of the negative carbon electrode. In contrast, a battery-like charge/discharge curve is recorded when a smaller conducting polymer weight, relative to that of the carbon electrode, is used.
