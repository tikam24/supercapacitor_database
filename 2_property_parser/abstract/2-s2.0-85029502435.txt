In this work, a flexible and porous WO3/grapheme/polyester (WO3/G/PT) textile electrode was successfully prepared by in situ growing WO3 on the fiber surface inside G/PT composite fabrics. The unique electrode structure facilitates to enhance the energy storage performance because the 3D conductive network constructed by the G/PT increase the electron transportation rate, nanotructured WO3 exposed enhanced electrochemically active surface area and the hierarchically porous structure improved the electrolyte ion diffusion rate. The optimized WO3/G/PT textile electrode exhibited good electrochemical performance with a high areal capacitance of 308.2 mF cm−2 at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 and excellent cycling stability. A flexible asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device was further fabricated by using the WO3/G/PT electrode and G/PT electrode, which exhibited a good specific capacitance of 167.6 mF cm−3 and high energy density of 60 μWh cm−3 at the power density of 2320 μW cm−3.
