With the extensive application of supercapacitor as a new energy storage device, it is of great significance to establish accurately equivalent model for the supercapacitor. According to the definition of fractional calculus and based on the combination of the constant current charging curve of the fractor as well as the actual physical structure of the supercapacitor, a fractional RF series circuit model and a fractional RFR hybrid circuit model for constant current charging of supercapacitor were directly established in the time domain. In addition, the model parameter identification and the fitting error analysis method were also provided in the current work. In the process of the parameter identification and the error analysis of both the fractional RF series circuit model and the fractional RFR hybrid circuit model combined with the constant current charging data of the supercapacitor, the fitting precision of both the fractional RF series circuit model and the fractional RFR hybrid circuit model are proved to be much advanced than the first-order RC circuit model and the classical equivalent circuit model, having quite similar accuracy. Through analyzing the parameter sensitivity of the more succinct fractional RF series circuit model, the influence rules of the operation order, the eigenvalue and the resistance value of the resistor element on the constant current charging of the supercapacitor can be obtained. In the meanwhile, the proposed study also demonstrates that the classical equivalent circuit model belongs to a special case of the fractional RFR hybrid circuit model, the first-order RC circuit model is a special case of the fractional RF series circuit model, and the fractional RF series circuit model refers to a special case of the fractional RFR hybrid circuit.
