This work reports the preparation of γ-FeOOH and amorphous Ni-Mn hydroxide on carbon nanofoam paper (CNFP) by galvanostatic electrodeposition for application in hybrid FeOOH-CNFP∥Ni-Mn hydroxide-CNFP supercapacitors working in alkaline electrolytes. The γ-FeOOH on CNFP displayed a porous morphology composed of fluffy nanoflakes. It showed an enhanced redox response in the negative working potential range of -1.5-0 V vs. SCE with a storage capacity of 3.48 C cm-2 at 10 mA cm-2 and a response rate of 71% when the current densities increased from 10 mA cm-2 to 50 mA cm-2. The amorphous Ni-Mn hydroxide on CNFP displayed a porous morphology composed of fine nanoflakes. It showed an enhanced redox response in the positive working potential range of 0-0.5 V vs. SCE with a storage capacity of 1.54 C cm-2 at 10 mA cm-2 and a response rate of 73% when the current densities increased from 10 mA cm-2 to 50 mA cm-2. The hybrid FeOOH-CNFP∥Ni-Mn hydroxide-CNFP supercapacitor delivered a high energy density of 1515 mW h cm-2, at a power density of 9 mW cm-2 at a working voltage of 1.8 V and a long cycle life with a capacity retention of 95% after 10 000 charge-discharge cycles. Self-discharge studies revealed the main contribution of the FeOOH-CNFP electrode to the voltage drop of the supercapacitor cell. Activation-controlled processes governed the self-discharge of the FeOOH-CNFP electrode, while mixed activation-controlled and diffusion-controlled processes governed the self-discharge of the Ni-Mn hydroxide-CNFP electrode.
