TiO2 nanotubes for use in supercapacitors have been successfully deposited onto titanium foil by electrochemical anodization for 4 h at 60 V and their morphological and structural characteristics investigated by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and electrochemical measurements. FE-SEM revealed TiO2 nanotubes with diameter of ∼ 80 nm and length of 18 μm. XRD confirmed formation of TiO2 phase with anatase crystal structure. Electrochemical measurements revealed large specific capacitance of 33.7 F g−1, high energy density of 41.75 W h kg−1 at power density of 176 W kg−1, and long-term cycling performance with 72% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles for the TiO2 nanotubes. These results indicate that such TiO2 nanotubes have potential to become a promising electrode material for use in energy storage devices such as supercapacitors and batteries due to their high chemical, thermal, and electrochemical stability with good charge storage capability.
