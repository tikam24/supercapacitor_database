Reasonable assembly and heterogeneous growth using new energy storage materials is a popular and promising method to ameliorate the electrochemical performance of hybrid supercapacitors. Herein, a unique intercalation pseudocapacitance characteristics and battery-type electrode materials layered double hydroxides (LDHs) nanosheet arrays are obtained by a simple and environmentally pollution-free two-step electrodeposition technology. The electrode materials are composed of MoO3 and NiCo-layered double hydroxides (NiCo-LDH), which was directly grown on the three-dimensional (3D) conductive nickel foam (NF) substrate, forming a binder free two-dimensional (2D) ultra-thin cross-multilayer heterostructure (NiCo-LDH@MoO3/NF). The heterogeneous NiCo-LDH@MoO3/NF nanomaterial manifests a prominent specific capacity of 952.2 C g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1, and also delivers good cycling performance of 86.42% capacity retention at current density of 20 A g−1 after 10,000 cycles. Remarkably, the fabricated NiCo-LDH@MoO3/NF//AC HSC equipment shows an excellent energy density, whose value is 58.06 Wh kg−1 with the power density of 800 W kg−1, and the capacity retention rate and coulombic efficiency can reach 73% and 96.7% at 15 A g−1, respectively, suggesting that it has application prospects in supercapacitor electrode materials.
