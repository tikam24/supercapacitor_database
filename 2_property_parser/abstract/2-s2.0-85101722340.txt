Finding supercapacitive materials with high energy and power densities has attracted significant interest in recent years. Herein, we are reporting layered MnWO4 nanostructure for supercapacitor applications. MnWO4//AC asymmetric cell was fabricated by using hydrothermally synthesized MnWO4 nanostructure as a cathode and activated carbon as an anode. Prior to device fabrication, the structural and electrochemical properties of MnWO4 were thoroughly studied. MnWO4//AC asymmetric cell with KOH electrolyte showed specific capacitance and energy density of 90 F/g (at 1 mA/cm2) and 51 Wh/kg, respectively. Upon addition of redox-active KI into KOH, both the specific capacitance and energy density were significantly enhanced (144 F/g and 90 Wh/Kg, respectively). The enhanced electrochemical properties of MnWO4//AC asymmetric cell can be attributed to the high-speed solution-phase faradic reactions contributed by KI redox species in the KOH electrolyte.
