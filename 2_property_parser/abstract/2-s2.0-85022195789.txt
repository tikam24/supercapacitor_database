Semimetallic 1T’-MoTe2 with energy bands overlapping near the Fermi level has made a figure in electrode materials for supercapacitors. However, the chemical synthesis of 1T’-MoTe2 hybrid nanostructures still remains a challenge due to the small electronegativity difference between Mo and Te again. In our study, a novel rGO supported 1T’-MoTe2 nanosheets electrode is prepared by an in-situ colloidal synthesis. The experiment results demonstrate that 1T’-MoTe2 nanosheets are attached to rGO nanosheets uniformly and tightly. As a consequence, the obtained hybrid electrode exhibits superior supercapacitive properties such as enhanced specific capacitance (1791 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), outstanding rate performance (1242 F g−1 at 50 A g−1) and excellent cycling stability (98.6% retention after 2000 cycles at 30 A g−1). The structural integrity and interaction of different components were discussed to afford the prominent electrochemical performance.
