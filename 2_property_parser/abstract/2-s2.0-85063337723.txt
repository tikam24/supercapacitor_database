With an objective to increase an electrochemical performance, simple and effective modifications of activated carbon fiber textiles (ACT) were carried out prior to their testing as supercapacitors. The modifications included a high-temperature treatment of the textile impregnated with N- and S-containing species (i.e. dicyandiamide, urea and thiourea). This led to an improvement in an electrical conductivity and in an enhanced mechanical strength with a preserved porosity. Compared to the performance of the initial unmodified carbon textile, a urea-functionalized material showed an enhancement in the electrochemical capacitance. An increase from 177 to 209 F g −1 at a scan rate 10 mV s −1 in an alkaline electrolyte was recorded (3-cell CV measurements) and from 138 to 166 F g −1 at 0.10 A g −1 (2-cell galvanostatic charge-discharge). The results suggested that mechanically stable, flexible and conductive ACT have a potential to be used in textile-based flexible supercapacitors. Benefits coming from the applied modification routes can be also adapted for the fabrication of other types of carbon-based composite electrode materials.
