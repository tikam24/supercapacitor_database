Impressive energy storage and delivery: A simple, cost-effective, and potentially scalable technique is described for fabricating support- and additive-free NiO/Ni nanocomposite electrodes (see picture) for electrochemical supercapacitors. Maximum performances of energy storage and delivery were simultaneously achieved by developing a slow-charging and fast-discharging procedure. Copyright Â© 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
