Biomass activated carbon (AC) is a widely sought-after renewable resource and possesses excellent electrochemical properties, which can be further enhanced if heteroatoms are doped on the surface of AC. Adsorption methylene blue (MB) with activated carbon (AC) allowed N/S atoms be adsorbed on the AC outer layer to prepare the supercapacitors cathode materials with excellent electrochemical performance, long service life, and low production cost. The results showed that the substance of component N and S increment from 1.31% and 0â€“2.91% and 0.7% on surface of adsorbed AC, respectively, and its specific surface area (SSA) was 3198.04 m2/g. The greatest capacitance was 491.2 F/g and it had an increasement of 70.67% contrasted with non-adsorbed analog, after 5000 cycles of charged and discharged, and it still had a capacitance retention rate of 89.8%.
