Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to show how to obtain a supercapacitor with high specific power (P) and high specific energy (E p) simultaneously. Design/methodology/approach: The carbon aerogels are obtained by ambient pressure drying method instead of supercritical drying method and carbon aerogels/Ni(OH)2 composites are prepared by in situ polymerisation. A series of asymmetric supercapacitors based on carbon aerogels/Ni(OH)2 composites as positive electrode and activated carbon as negative electrode, respectively, are assembled. The electrochemical performances of carbon aerogels/Ni(OH)2 composites and supercapacitors are studied. Findings: The results show that the specific capacitance (CP) of carbon aerogels/Ni(OH)2 composites is 584 F/m2. The working potential of supercapacitors could be increased to 1.6V. When the mass ratio of carbon aerogels and Ni(OH)2 is 3:7, the mass ratio of positive electrode and negative electrode is 1:1, the E P and P of the supercapacitor is higher than 10.5 Wh/kg and 578 W/kg, respectively, when the current varies from 50 mA to 100 mA and the attenuation ratio of CP is only 8.3 per cent after 10,000 cycles at 100 mA. Practical implications: The supercapacitors can be used in the field of automobile engineering and can solve the problems of energy shortage and environmental pollutions. Originality/value: The supercapacitor based on carbon aerogels/Ni(OH)2 composites as positive electrode and activated carbon as negative electrode is novel and the synthetic properties of the supercapacitor are excellent Â© Emerald Group Publishing Limited.
