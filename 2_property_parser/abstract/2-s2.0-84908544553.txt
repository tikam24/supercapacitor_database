The restacking-inhibited N-doped graphene (GN) is prepared for supercapacitor material based on the sol-gel method. Meanwhile, the graphene oxide (GO) is reduced and modified by melamine-resorcinol-formaldehyde (MRF). The reduced graphene oxide (RG) is characterized with the ultraviolet visible absorption spectrum, Raman spectra and X-ray diffraction. Moreover, the morphology of GN is measured by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and nitrogen adsorption. The doped N content is confirmed by elemental analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The result shows that GO is reduced by resorcinol derivatives. With the specific surface of 518 m2 g-1and N content of 9.77 wt%, laminated GN with 2.5 wt% GO exhibits the outstanding specific capacitance (245 F g-1), low charge-transfer resistance and superior cycle stability (94.8% retention after 2000 cycles).
