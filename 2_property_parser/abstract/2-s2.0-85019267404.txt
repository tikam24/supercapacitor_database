We propose a method to fabricate a supercapacitor for smart textiles using silver (Ag) nanoparticle (NP) ink, simple spray patterning systems, and intense pulsed light (IPL) sintering systems. The Ag NP current collectors provided as high conductivity as the metal current collectors. The spray patterning technique is useful for fabricating supercapacitors because it is simple, fast, and cheap. IPL systems reduced the sintering temperature of Ag NPs and prevented thermal damage to the textiles during the Ag NP sintering process. The two-dimensional (2D) all-solid state fabric supercapacitor with an interdigitated configuration, developed here, exhibited a specific capacitance of 25.7 F/g and an energy density of 1.5 Wh/kg at a power density of 64.3 W/kg. These results support the utility of our proposed method in the development of energy textiles.
