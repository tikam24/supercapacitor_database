The rapid advancements made by science and technology in the present world are astonishing and have a way of stimulating our imagination. Modern research centres on search for unique cathode electrodes to improve energy density in hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs). A battery-type perovskite rare earth-based SmFeO3/MWCNT electrode is being investigated as cathode electrode for future-generation energy storage devices. Herein, perovskite rare earth-based metal oxides and its carbon composites (SmFeO3, SmFeO3/GC,SmFeO3/MWCNT) are flourishingly synthesized via one-step solvothermal technique as cathode materials for hybrid supercapacitors. The asymmetric solid-state supercapacitor SmFeO3/MWCNT//CNT device is constructed with an excellent 216.68 F/g specific capacitance, 67.71 Wh/kg energy and 749.97 W/kg power density at 1 A/g current density. An improved cycling performance of 79.83% capacity retention and 99.84% coulombic efficiency after 20000 long-cycles is reported. This work revealed that SmFeO3/MWCNT//CNT AHSSCs offer boundless ability as good electrode for practical energy storage applications.
