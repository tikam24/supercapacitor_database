Hybrid reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanosheet supported Mn-Ni-Co ternary oxides (MNCO) are prepared through a facile coprecipitation reaction with a subsequent calcination process as electrodes for supercapacitors. Electrochemical measurements prove that RGO can significantly improve the supercapacitive behaviors, compared with the pure MNCO electrode. A high specific capacity of 646.1 C g-1 at 1 A g-1 can be achieved and about 89.6% of the capacity can be remained at 30 A g-1 relative to that of the low-current capacity, indicating attractive rate capability of the RGO-MNCO electrode. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device is fabricated with nitrogen-enriched RGO as the negative electrode and the synthesized RGO-MNCO as the positive electrode. Electrochemical performances investigated at different potential range reveal that the ASC device presents excellent capacitive behavior and reversibility. A maximum energy density of 35.6 Wh kg-1 at power density of 699.9 W kg-1 can be delivered. Furthermore, stable cycle capability with 100% Coulombic efficiency and 77.2% the capacitance retention is also achieved after 10000 cycles. The achieved outstanding electrochemical properties indicate that the obtained RGO-MNCO electrode materials are fairly ideal for progressive supercapacitors.
