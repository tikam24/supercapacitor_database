This paper outlines a novel design of low-cost, portable, fast, and precise Current-Voltage Curve Tracer (IVCT) with automated parameter extraction for high power rated Solar Photovoltaic (SPV) modules to effectively and efficiently determine the outdoor operating status of SPV power generators. The developed IVCT is based on a Raspberry Pi microprocessor, a super-capacitive load, heat sinkable discharge resistances, and sensors with high sensitivity and resolution for measuring light irradiance, module temperature, current, and voltage. The proposed Outdoor Test Facility (OTF) consists of an Current-Voltage ( I-V ) and a Power-Voltage ( P-V ) curve tracer that uses a dynamic loading supercapacitor to safely and quickly scan the SPV module performance characteristics under real-world operating conditions. It also helps to achieve uniform sampling with better data accuracy. It uses Raspberry Pi as a central processing unit for low-cost data acquisition, data logging, and data computation. Furthermore, results from on-field testing of various small-scale SPV modules show that the I-V tracer can acquire higher-resolution characteristics curves and perform accurate model parameter recognition in real-time. Proposed IVCT can measure individual SPV modules without altering the electrical interconnection circuit, and the operating point can be shifted to 20 A and 45~V in few seconds. The proposed system recomposes the SPV module I-V characteristics based on this variance, with accuracies of 1 to 3% for the region near maximum power.
