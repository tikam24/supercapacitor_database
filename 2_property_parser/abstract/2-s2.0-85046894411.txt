Natural hollow kapok fibers (KFs) were employed to fabricate all-solid-state high-energy asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs). The KF@MoS2/rGO aerogel and KF@MnO2 composites were used as the negative and positive electrodes, respectively. The KF@MoS2/rGO aerogel displays a typical wrinkled and cross-linking structure with a uniform dispersion of tubular KF@MoS2, and its specific capacitance reached 347 F g−1. The assembled ASC delivered a maximum energy density of 63.4 Wh kg−1. The excellent performance was attributed to the synergistic effect of unique three-dimensional and hollow structure, which enhanced the specific surface area, facilitated electrolyte permeation and shortened the electron pathway in the electrode materials.
