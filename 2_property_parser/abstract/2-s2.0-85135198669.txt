The proceedings contain 36 papers. The topics discussed include: electrospinning technique for the fabrication of poly(styrene-co-methyl methacrylate) nanofibers and the effect of fiber diameter on UVâ€“visible absorption and thermal properties; surface modification of biomass for the enhancement of adsorptive removal of cationic dye from aqueous solution; degradation behavior of eluxadoline under stress conditions: structural interpretation of novel degradants using high resolution mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance; structural and electrochemical investigation on pure and aluminum doped nickel ferrite nanoparticles for supercapacitor application; design of chemical sensor based on dual core photonic crystal fiber; wet chemical synthesis of lead sulfide nanoparticles and its application as light harvester in photovoltaic cell; synthesis and characterization of thiazole based selective chemosensor for copper ions; and corn cob immobilized chlorella sorokiniana for the sequestration of chromium ions from aqueous solution.
