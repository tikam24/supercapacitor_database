this contribution deals with the fabrication of graphene based supercapacitors using an original deposition technique based on dynamic spray-gun method. The essential advantage of this technique is the very high potential to be easily implemented for large surface fabrication. We fabricated electrodes using mixture of graphene oxide (GO) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). With these composites, we want to achieve a good mesoporous distribution (pore size between 2 and 50 nm) of the electrodes using the CNTs as spacers between the graphene flakes. The results demonstrate that a composite with 90% of GO and 10% of CNTs, allows achieving supercapacitor electrodes with the highest capacitance (120F/g) and cells with the highest power density (31kW/kg). These results constitute a real breakthrough compared to usual lab based fabricated devices, considering that the supercapacitors were fabricated using graphene and exploiting a suitable industrial technique implementable on large scale.
