In this paper we have reported the synthesis of the composites of polythiophene (PTP)and carbon nano tubes (CNTs) by easy in-situ polymerization method. Structure and morphology of the PTP-CNT composites were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM).From the electrochemical studies, it was found that the electrochemical performance of pure PTP got improved due to the incorporation of CNTs into pure PTP in the composites. The CNTs incorporated binary composite electrode exhibited specific capacitance of 125F/g.
