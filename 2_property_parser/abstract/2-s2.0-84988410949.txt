Well-dispersed resorcinol-formaldehyde-based carbon spheres (RFCs) have been prepared by the polycondensation of resorcinol and formaldehyde with ammonia as catalyst and subsequent carbonization of the obtained polymer. In situ polymerization of the aniline occurred in the suspension of the RFC, and RFC was surrounded by the polyaniline (PANI) wires. The PANI and RFC hybrid network (PRFC) formed gradually. In a three-electrode mode, the specific capacitance (Csp) of PRFC reaches 315 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 in 2 M H2SO4, much higher than that of pure PANI (225 F g−1) and RFC (121.7 F g−1). Furthermore, the Csp of PRFC retains 80.0 % after 1000 charge-discharge processes at a current density of 5 Ag−1. The enhanced electrochemical performance of the PRFC came from its homogeneous three-dimensional hierarchical network structure, good electric conductivity of the PANI around the RFC, and the synergistic effect between the RFC and PANI.
