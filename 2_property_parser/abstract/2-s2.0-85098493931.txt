Due to the rapid development of portable, wearable and implantable electronics in the fields of mobile communications, biomonitoring, and aerospace or defense, there is an increasing demand for miniaturized and lightweight energy storage devices. Micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) possessing long lifetime, high power density, environment friendliness and safety, have attracted great attention recently. Since the performance of the MSCs is mainly related to the structure of the active electrode, there is a great need to explore the efficient fabricating strategies to deterministically coordinate the structure and functionality of microdevices. Considering that laser technology possesses many superior features of facility, high-precision, low-cost, high-efficiency, shape-adaptability and maneuverability, herein we summarize the development of laser technologies in MSCs manufacturing, along with their strengths and weaknesses. The current achievements and challenges are also highlighted and discussed, aiming to provide a valuable reference for the rational design and manufacture of MSCs in the future.
