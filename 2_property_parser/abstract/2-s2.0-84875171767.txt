The preparation of carbon xerogels (CXs) without supercritical drying process was achieved in the presence of the ionic liquid as template by coupling with KOH activation. As a potential electrode material for supercapacitors, these obtained CXs exhibit high specific capacitance and good stability over 12,500 cycles by virtue of their advantageous structural features.
