MoS2 has gained more interest among two-dimensional (2D) materials due to its large surface area and low electronegativity, making it an ideal electrode material for supercapacitors. The Low intrinsic conductivity and agglomeration induced by the van der Waals interaction of MoS2 continue to impair its supercapacitive performance. To address this sluggish electrochemical performance, we synthesized an n-p-type MoS2/BP heterostructure adopting a facile hydrothermal approach and examined its electrochemical performance for the first time. An all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor with MoS2/BP as the negative electrode and VS2/BP as the positive electrode was constructed to evaluate the materialâ€™s electrochemical performances. The proposed all-phosphorene-based device demonstrated exceptional capacitance retention and cyclic stability, with a capacitance of around 114 F g-1 at a current density of 4 A g-1 and an energy/power density of 34.71 Wh kg-1/4031 W kg-1
