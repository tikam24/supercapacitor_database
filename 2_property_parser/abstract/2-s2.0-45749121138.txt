The layered LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O 2 materials were prepared by wet chemical method using oxalic acid as a polymeric agent. The positive LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co 0.33O2 powders were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and magnetometry. The electrochemical features of the LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co 0.33O2 positive electrode were investigated as a function of synthesis conditions, cutoff voltage limit, and C-rate charge-discharge current. Electrochemical properties are discussed in relation with the local structure and morphology of the layered materials. copyright The Electrochemical Society.
