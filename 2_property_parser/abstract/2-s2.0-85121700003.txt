The design and development of electrode materials for energy-storage applications is an area of prime focus around the globe because of the shortage of natural resources. In this study, we developed a method for preparing a novel three-dimensional binder-free pseudocapacitive NiZn2O4 active material, which was grown directly over nickel foam (NiZn2O4@3D-NF), using a simple one-step hydrothermal process. The material was characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge– discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques were employed to evaluate the pseudocapacitive performance of the NiZn2O4 active material in a three-electrode assembly cell. The prepared NiZn2O4@3D-NF electrode exhibited an excellent specific capacitance, of 1706.25 F g−1, compared to that of the NiO@3D-NF (1050 F/g) electrode because it has the bimetallic characteristics of both zinc and nickel. The NiZn2O4@3D-NF electrode showed better cyclic stability (87.5% retention) compared to the NiO@3D-NF electrode (80% retention) after 5000 cycles at a fixed current density, which also supports the durability of the NiZn2O4@3D-NF electrode. The characteristics of NiZn2O4@3D-NF include corrosion resistance, high conductivity, an abundance of active sites for electrochemical reaction, a high surface area, and synergism between the bimetallic oxides, which make it a suitable candidate for potential application in the field of energy storage.
