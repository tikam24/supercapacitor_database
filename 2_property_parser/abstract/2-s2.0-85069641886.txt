Tin oxide (SnO2) nanoparticles undergo the volume expansion during an electrochemical cycle. This volume expansion leads to discontinuities in the form of microcracks in the electrode material. The problem of charge transportation associated with this microcracking limits the application of SnO2 in the energy storage application such as supercapacitors. The present work approached to solve this problem by incorporating the MoS2 nanosheets along with the SnO2 nanoparticles. The SnO2 nanoparticles are functionalized onto the surface of the MoS2 nanosheets by the ligand exchange process. The MoS2 nanosheets act as the support material for the SnO2 nanoparticles. The electrode material prepared using SnO2 nanoparticles and nanocomposite of SnO2 functionalized MoS2 nanosheets are tested by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements. The specific capacity of the MoS2-SnO2 nanocomposite is calculated to be 61.6 F g-1 which is 4.4 fold higher than that of bare SnO2 nanoparticles. The improvement in the electrochemical performance of SnO2 is attributed to the high surface area and the charge transportation provided by the MoS2 nanosheets.
