Carbon aerogels (CAs) with controlled micro-nano pore features have been broadly explored as advanced materials for many important applications in industry. Although graphene and carbon nanotubes aerogels have shown excellent performances, their practical applications are severely limited by their high cost, complex preparation process and low production yield. As one class of carbon-rich natural resources, polysaccharides composed of C, H, O, have been considered as one more attractive precursors for the preparation of renewable, cost-effective and eco-friendly CAs due to their universal availability, renewability and low toxicity. As a class of carbon aerogels, polysaccharide-based carbon aerogels (PS-CAs) also possess high porosity, large surface area, excellent conductivity and good mechanical properties. Therefore, PS-CAs are potential carbon materials applied in environmental remediation and the energy fields. This review highlights the fabrication of PS-CAs, including carbon aerogels, activated carbon aerogels, heteroatom-doped carbon aerogels and carbon aerogels composites, and their potential applications for environmental remediation and sustainable energy (conversion and storage). Following this, key challenges and future perspectives for polysaccharide-based carbon aerogel materials are also briefly discussed. This critical review expects to significantly promote the creation of a sustainable future by utilizing renewable and sustainable natural resources.
