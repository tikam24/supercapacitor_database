This work presents a state of the art review of energy storage systems and its applications integrating an alternative technology for the electrical energy generation known as supercapacitors and batteries. Indeed, this review focuses on supercapacitors and batteries as energy storage systems. The state of the art review contains an analysis of the evolution of electroactive materials and a classical modeling based on electric equivalent circuits. The synthesis of electrical circuits from physics-based batteries and supercapacitor models that represent conservation and diffusion interactions is the subject of this research. To create the circuits, the suggested synthesis technique employs model discretization, linearization, balanced model order reduction, and passive network synthesis. Physical models are used to create circuits with various topologies. There is no such complex investigation to the best of our knowledge, has not been reported and is expected to lead to breakthrough developments to obtain nanocomposites.
