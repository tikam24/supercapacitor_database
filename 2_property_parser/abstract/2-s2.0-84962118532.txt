To achieve high electrochemical performance in energy storage and conversion devices, transition metal hydroxides electrode materials need enhancing their intrinsic poor conductivity and fully utilizing their unexploited active sites. Accordingly, a simple and effective strategy is developed to synthesize layered NixCo2x(OH)6x nanosheets using dual three-dimensional Ni as structural and conductive support system. Owing to highly electrical conductivity, rich of interconnected ion/electron transport pathways, and robust structure stability, NixCo2x(OH)6x@Ni electrode exhibits remarkably high specific capacitance, excellent rate capability, and superior cycle stability. Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitor assembled by NixCo2x(OH)6x@Ni and activated carbon/carbon nanotube achieves a large working voltage window of 1.5 V, a high energy density (â‰ˆ44.2 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 750 W kg-1) and outstanding long-term cycle ability (remaining 100% of the initial Csp after 5000 cycles). Furthermore, the NixCo2x(OH)6x@Ni as an oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalyst shows small onset overpotential (263 mV), low Tafel slope (78 mV dec-1), large anodic current density of 30 mA cm-2 at a low overpotential of 336 mV and prominent electrochemical durability.
