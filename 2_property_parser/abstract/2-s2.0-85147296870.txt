Porous silicon is an interesting material for integrated on-chip energy storage in microdevices. But the formation of an efficient and stable porous silicon-based supercapacitor electrode is challenging owing to its poor electrical conductivity and extreme chemical reactivity. To overcome these challenges, we demonstrate the usage of highly conducting and chemically stable TiN coating for surface passivation of macroporous p-type and n-type silicon. For p-type porous silicon having uniformly distributed 9 μm long and 3–4 μm wide cylindrical pores, the sputtered TiN coating enables high areal capacitance of 8.6 mF cm−2 at a current density of 0.1 mA cm−2 along with exceptional cyclic stability. The all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor based on TiN passivated porous silicon electrodes sandwiched with Na2SO4-PVA hydrogel electrolyte exhibits a wide cell voltage of 2 V. The high energy density of 1.96 μWh cm−2 is evaluated at a power density of 200 μW cm−2 which is promising for integrated energy storage.
