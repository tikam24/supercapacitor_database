Using a controllable hydrothermal method, a Li2Co2(MoO4)3 NASICON-type material is successfully synthesized under mild conditions. The open 3D framework structure and the interconnected nanorods-nanoflakes morphology allow small-sized ions to easily intercalate/deintercalate without structure destruction and enhance the ion transport kinetics at the electrode-electrolyte interface, resulting in improved electrochemical performances. This electroactive material is promising for asymmetric supercapacitors.
