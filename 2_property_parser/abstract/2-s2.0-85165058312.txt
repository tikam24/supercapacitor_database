In the current study, Ag+ (1-11 %) doped CeO2 NPs are synthesized by versatile solution combustion synthesis using Aloe vera extract as reducing agent. To validate the effective synthesis, the synthesized samples are characterized by different techniques. PXRD analysis confirmed the formation of cubic fluorite structure with Fm-3m space group. The average crystallite size and direct energy band gap was found to decrease with increase in dopant concentration. SEM analysis confirmed the surface morphology and EDAX analysis affirmed the presence of Ce, O, and Ag elements in the synthesized samples. Photoluminescence studies confirmed that the obtained NPs exhibit characteristic emission peaks, highlighting their promising importance in display applications. Further, Electrochemical analysis confirms the highest specific capacitance of synthesized NPs at the lowest scan rates. CV, GCD and EIS suggest that Ag-doped CeO2 NPs find potential applications in energy storage devices such as supercapacitors.
