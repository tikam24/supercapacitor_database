Ruthenium oxide (RuO2) nanoparticles were supported on the outer surface of single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) using chemical reduction technique. The nanocomposite was employed as an electrode material for charge storage capacitor using ionic liquid, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate electrolyte solution. The electrochemical charge storage properties of the composite were investigated using two electrode cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge techniques. The specific capacitance and energy density of the RuO2-SWNT nanocomposite electrode material based on the fabricated coin cell supercapacitor were measured to be as high as 174 F/g and 74 Wh/kg at current density of 1 A/g.
