This chapter introduces the concept of structural power composite materials and their possible devices. Carbon fibers are used as reinforcement and electrode in polymer composites, where the polymer is ion conductive, exploiting their electrochemical and conductive capabilities in concert with their excellent mechanical properties. By this approach engineering materials with an electrical energy storing ability emerge-structural batteries and supercapacitors.First a brief overview of the state-of-the-art, highlighting achievements related to structural battery and supercapacitor devices, is presented. The research areas addressed for the two types of material devices include carbon fiber electrodes, structural separators, multifunctional matrix materials, device architectures, and material functionalization. Following this, engineering issues such as multifunctional design methods, connectivity, finishing, crashworthiness, and demonstration are discussed in detail. The chapter culminates in a detailed description of engineering challenges that call for further research.
