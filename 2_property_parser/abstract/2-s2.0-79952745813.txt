Carbon fiber materials (CFM) were electrochemically treated in cathodic, anodic or combined regimes. The influence of the treatment on morphology and chemical composition of CFM was investigated. It was shown that the electrochemical treatment does not substantially influence on the electrical capacitance of CFM. Nevertheless, it facilitates the process of electrosorption of MnO(OH)2 colloidal particles onto CFM surfaces. CFM samples modified by MnO(OH)2 have a specific capacitance of 70-80 F/g.
