Rational design and fabrication of composite electrode materials with high energy storage performance of supercapacitors is of great importance from both theoretical and practical viewpoints. Herein, a hierarchical sandwich-type NiFe layered double hydroxide/reduced graphene Oxide (NiFe-LDHs/rGO) composite electrode materials were successfully synthesized through a one-step hydrothermal method. It is found that the prepared NiFe-LDHs/rGO composite electrode can achieve a high specific capacitance of 1319F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and show good cycling performance with a retention rate of 80% over 1000 cycles. Furthermore, the asymmetric supercapacitor based on NiFe-LDHs/rGO as a positive electrode and N-doped hollow carbon sphere as a negative electrode was assembled and exhibited a high energy density of 37 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 423 W kg−1 as well as good cycling stability. The exceptional electrochemical performance of the NiFe-LDHs/rGO composite indicates its potential application in high-performance supercapacitors.
