A simple hydrothermal route is designed to decorate NiCo 2 S 4 nanoparticles on the surface of N-doped carbon nanotubes to form a coaxial composite (NiCo 2 S 4 @NCNT). Inherited the high electrical conductivity from the NCNT and high capacitive performance of NiCo 2 S 4 , the optimized NiCo 2 S 4 @NCNT composite could significantly reduce the contact resistance and effectively increase the transfer rate of ion and electron and thus benefit for its electrochemical performance enhancement. When employed as a battery-type supercapacitor electrode, the NiCo 2 S 4 @NCNT composite exhibits a high capacitance up to 783.5 C g −1 at 1 A g −1 and as well as rate performance (74.6% retention with the current density increases from 1 to 50 A g −1 ). Coupled with activated carbon (AC) negative electrode, the as-assembled hydride supercapacitor delivers a maximum energy density of 49.75 Wh kg −1 at a power density of 774.65 W kg −1 , as well as 88.9% capacitance retained after 3000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g −1 . These above results demonstrate the enormous potential of NiCo 2 S 4 @NCNT in the development of hybrid supercapacitors.
