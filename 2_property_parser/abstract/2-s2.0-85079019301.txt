Flexible all-solid-state supercapacitors (ASSSs) have caught the scientific attention to meet the explosive demand for portable and wearable electronic devices. However, it is difficult for flexible electrode materials to obtain a high areal capacitance at a high mass loading, which limits their commercial applications. In this study, vanadium oxide (V2O5) nanoparticles are introduced into Ti3C2 flakes with the aid of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). The intercalation of V2O5 particles in the interlayer of Ti3C2 establishes a hierarchical structure and facilitates the electrolyte penetration. As a result, the prepared CT-Ti3C2@V2O5 composite electrode achieves a high areal capacitance of 2065 mF cm-2 at 3 mA cm-2 and superior active mass loading (15 mg cm-2). Meanwhile, over 93% capacitance is maintained after 6000 cycles at 18 mA cm-2. The ASSS based on CT-Ti3C2@V2O5 delivers a high areal capacitance of 477 mF cm-2 at 1 mV s-1 and exhibits stable performance at different bending states, which reaches to the advanced level for the ASSSs based on MXenes.
