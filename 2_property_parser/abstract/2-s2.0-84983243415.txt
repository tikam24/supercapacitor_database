A new kind of super-capacitor has been developed which uses ionic rather than electronic currents to charge and discharge it. The super-capacitor functions by inducing charge on a reduced graphene oxide (RGO) film which spans two electrolyte reservoirs. Typically such induced charge is used to create electrokinetic effects however unlike induced charge electrokinetic geometries the work surface in this geometry has its bipolar double layer split by an ionically insulating separator. This device represents the iontronic analogue of the electronic super-capacitor.
