The synthesis of graphene-based hybrid electrode material provides a prime share in supercapacitor device material application. Here, we have synthesized a new type ternary composite GO/PANI/CoFe2O4 (Graphene Oxide/polyaniline/Cobalt Ferrite) by the oxidative-polymerization method with superior electrochemical behaviour. The analysis like X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) confirm the successful formation of material. The hybrid composite GO/PANI/CoFe2O4 gives the highest specific capacitance value of 781.27 F/g at scan rate of 1 mV/s and 346.92 F/g at current density of 1 A/g from 3E (three-electrode) and symmetric 2E (two-electrode) device system. The system exhibits a wide 1.2 V potential window. From the symmetric system, the ternary GO/PANI/CoFe2O4 had high specific energy (Esp) of 69.38 Wh/kg at 1 A/g and high specific power (Psp) of 5989.37 W/kg at 20 A/g along with 79.03 % retention of its original capacitance after 5000 cycles. The ternary material also showed a less Rct value of 8.51 Î©. The synergic effect of the individual components in the hybrid composite is the main factor for its excellent electrochemical behaviour.
