Owing to their unique nanosize effect and surface effect, pseudocapacitive quantum dots (QDs) hold considerable potential for high-efficiency supercapacitors (SCs). However, their pseudocapacitive behavior is exploited in aqueous electrolytes with narrow potential windows, thereby leading to a low energy density of the SCs. Here, a film electrode based on dual-confined FeOOH QDs (FQDs) with superior pseudocapacitive behavior in a high-voltage ionic liquid (IL) electrolyte is put forward. In such a film electrode, FQDs are steadily dual-confined in a 2D heterogeneous nanospace supported by graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and Ti-MXene (Ti3C2). Probing of potential-driven ion accumulation elucidates that strong adsorption occurs between the IL cation and the electrode surface with abundant active sites, providing sufficient redox reaction of FQDs in the film electrode. Furthermore, porous g-C3N4 and conductive Ti3C2 act as ion-accessible channels and charge-transfer pathways, respectively, endowing the FQDs-based film electrode with favorable electrochemical kinetics in the IL electrolyte. A high-voltage flexible SC (FSC) based on an ionogel electrolyte is fabricated, exhibiting a high energy density (77.12 mWh cmâˆ’3), a high power density, a remarkable rate capability, and long-term durability. Such an FSC can also be charged by harvesting sustainable energy and can effectively power various wearable and portable electronics.
