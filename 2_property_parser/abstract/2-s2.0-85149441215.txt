Nitrogen- and co-nitrogen- and sulfur-doped reduced graphene oxide (named N-rGO and N/S-rGO) was prepared by a simple hydrothermal technique using urea and thiourea as doping agents, respectively, to improve the properties of supercapacitor electrodes. Both were compared with rGO in electrochemical evaluations. The supercapacitor using N-rGO in 1 M H2SO4 provided the largest specific capacitance, 99 F g−1, while those using N/S-rGO and rGO exhibited 51 and 19 F g−1 at 0.25 A g−1, respectively. Furthermore, the supercapacitors using N-rGO and N/S-rGO electrodes showed a smaller charge transfer resistance (Rct) and a lower IR-drop than those using the rGO electrode, indicating a faster charge transfer at the interface between electrode and electrolyte and higher electronic conductivity due to N or N/S heteroatom doping in the graphene oxide structure. Furthermore, the N-rGO electrode has a higher sp2 hybridization ratio and a lower ID/IG ratio than the N/S-rGO electrode. Furthermore, the lowest contact angles of the N/S-rGO electrode were found, which was attributed to better aqueous electrolyte compatibility than the N-rGO and rGO electrodes. Therefore, the higher electrical conductivity of the N-rGO electrode reveals more relevant characteristics for high-performance supercapacitors than the good wettability of the N/S-rGO electrode.
