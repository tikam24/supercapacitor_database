NiO/NiS@CNT and NiO@CNT nanocomposites were rapidly fabricated using a one-step microwave method in 60 s. The electrochemical performances of the prepared electrodes with different mass ratios and microwave conditions for supercapacitors were investigated. NiO/NiS@CNT showed a high specific capacitance of 809.7 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and tremendous cycling stability of approximately 100% retention after 20 000 cycles at 5 A g−1, indicating better electrochemical performance than NiO@CNT. The asymmetric supercapacitor device based on NiO/NiS@CNT//activated carbon (AC) displayed high energy and power density and excellent cycling stability, demonstrating enormous potential for energy-storage applications.
