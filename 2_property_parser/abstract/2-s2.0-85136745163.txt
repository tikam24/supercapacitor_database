The biomass derived carbon/Co3O4 composites are developed widely as promising electrode material; yet, the practical applications are restrained due to the complex synthesis process. Herein the current work develops a facile and environmentally-friendly method to realize one-step synthesis of peanut shell derived porous activated carbon/Co3O4 (P-AC/Co3O4) composite by the low-temperature calcination. The results of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) show that Co3O4 particles are synthesized on the P-AC surface. The asymmetric supercapacitors of P-AC/Co3O4 composites achieve a high specific capacitance of 58.2 F/g at 1 A/g, and a superior cycle stability with the capacitance retention of 93.1% over 5000 cycles in the two-electrode system. An energy density as high as 22.7 Wh/kg is exhibited at 400 W/kg, and the energy density of 12.7 Wh/kg is still kept at 8964.7 W/kg. The simple, environmentally-friendly and one-step synthesis method provides a path for the mass production of C/Co3O4 composites as supercapacitor electrode materials.
