The controlled construction of hierarchical electrodes that overcome the single contribution of pure materials and create an interface effect between structures to enhance the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors is highly desirable. In this study, hydrothermally prepared NiMoO4 nanowires were treated via a facile vapor phase sulfurization method, forming a 1D hierarchical core-shell porous configuration that in situ wrapped an NiS2/MoS2 nanosheet shell on the NiMoO4 core, which provides more accessible sites for faradaic reactions and abundant charge transfer channels in innumerable hetero-interfaces with defects. The as-obtained NiMoO4@NiS2/MoS2 sample exhibited a high specific capacity of 437 C g-1 (970 F g-1) at a current density of 5 A g-1, excellent rate capability (a high capacity retention of 320 C g-1 at the high current density of 20 A g-1), and excellent electric conductivity. Furthermore, the NiMoO4@NiS2/MoS2 composite and activated carbon were employed to assemble an asymmetric supercapacitor, which delivered a high energy density of 26.8 W h kg-1 at a power density of 700 W kg-1.
