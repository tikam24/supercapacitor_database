Nanometer-scale particles of Mn O2 have been synthesized by microemulsion route for electrochemical supercapacitor studies. The Mn O2 has been found to be in α -cyrstallographic form with tetragonal unit cell. Particles in the spherical/hexagonal shape with about 50 nm size have been observed in scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy studies. Cyclic voltammograms have exhibited rectangular shape between 0 and 1.0 V vs saturated calomel electrode at sweep rates up to 100 mV s-1 due to nanoparticles of Mn O2. From galvanostatic charge-discharge studies, specific capacitance of 297 F g-1 has been obtained, which is greater than about 240 F g-1 usually reported for this material. The α-Mn O2 samples have been annealed at several temperatures, and nanoparticles (10-90 nm) and nanorods (5 nm diameter) of varying dimensions have been obtained. The effect of annealing at different temperatures on crystallographic nature and electrochemical properties are reported. © 2006 The Electrochemical Society.
