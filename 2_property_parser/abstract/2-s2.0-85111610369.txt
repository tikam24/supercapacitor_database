Swine manure activated carbon (SMAC) with self-co-doped metallic compounds and heteroatoms was prepared by combining KOH activation with pyrolysis. The structure, electrochemical performance and adsorption of SMACs prepared with various activation temperatures, activation times, alkali-carbon ratios and pickling steps were investigated. A hierarchical pore structure existed in all the SMACs, which showed excellent and significantly different properties, including a specific capacitance of 278 F/g, and a high SSA of 2321 m2/g (SMACHF), which retained 100% of its capacitance after 10,000 cycles at 5 A/g and a Pb2+ adsorption capacity of 211.8 mg/g at room temperature (SMACNON). The SMACs contained heteroatom functional groups and Si, Ca and Mg compounds, which did not produce pseudocapacitors but did increase the Pb2+ adsorption capacity and electrochemical cycling stability. The Pb2+ adsorption capacities of SMACNON, SMACPHF and SMACHF corresponded to the effect of the functional group content rather than the effect of the SSA. These porous carbons were derived from inexpensive swine manure, combine suitable porosity with metallic elements and heteroatom doping, and have promising uses in multifunctional applications.
