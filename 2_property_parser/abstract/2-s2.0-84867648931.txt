We employed a microwave synthesis process of cobalt phthalocyanine molecules templated by acid-functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes to create three-dimensional sponge-like graphene nanoarchitectures suited for ionic liquid-based electrochemical capacitor electrodes that operate at very high scan rates. The sequential "bottom-up" molecular synthesis and subsequent carbonization process took less than 20 min to complete. The 3D nanoarchitectures are able to deliver an energy density of 7.1 W·h kg -1 even at an extra high power density of 48 000 W kg -1. In addition, the ionic liquid supercapacitor based on this material works very well at room temperature due to its fully opened structures, which is ideal for the high-power energy application requiring more tolerance to temperature variation. Moreover, the structures are stable in both ionic liquids and 1 M H 2SO 4, retaining 90 and 98% capacitance after 10 000 cycles, respectively. © 2012 American Chemical Society.
