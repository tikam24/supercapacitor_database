MOF (Co3[Fe(CN)6]2)-derived porous nanocube-like CoS2 is coupled with GO via solution-precipitation and chemical replacement method. Due to the proper loading and structure adjusting of CoS2, the prepared nanocomposites show a maximum specific capacitance of 842 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, high-rate stability (capacity retention of 77% from 0.5 up to 10 A g−1), and long-cycle life stability (capacity retention of 95% over 2000 cycles).
