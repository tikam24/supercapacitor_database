Mn0.68Bi0.32OCl mix-crystals for supercapacitor are successfully synthesized by a thermosolid method, and are characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area measurements and thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry, respectively. The supercapacitive properties of Mn0.68Bi0.32OCl mix-crystals in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solutions are investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge technique, and the specific capacitance of Mn0.68Bi0.32OCl is about 650 F g−1 at the current density of 3 A g−1, owing to the high power density and the higher surface area, good conductivity, and high stability of Mn0.68Bi0.32OCl mix-crystals.
