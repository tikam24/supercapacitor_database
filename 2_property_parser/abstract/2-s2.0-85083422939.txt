The lifetime and charge-storage characteristics of supercapacitors (SCs) are important for the electronic devices. Herein, we report nanostructured, porous, interconnected CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs) prepared via precipitation and the hydrothermal processing. The CeO2 NPs were characterized by the XRD, Raman, EDS, FTIR, SEM, TEM, HRTEM, XPS and BET measurements. The XRD and FTIR confirmed that CeO2 NPs prepared by our synthesis method do not contain any commonly present hydroxide related impurities. The charge storage properties of CeO2-NPs supported on carbon-cloth (CeO2-NPs@CC) showed excellent electrochemical performance (Csp = 877.5 F/g@3 A/g) with excellent cycling stability of 96.52%@20 A/g (5000 cycles). Surprisingly CeO2-NPs@CC electrode exhibits outstanding 79.77% rate capability at 6-fold high current-density. The high energy storage performance of CeO2-NPs@CC electrode attributed to the rich redox chemistry and porous structure of CeO2.
