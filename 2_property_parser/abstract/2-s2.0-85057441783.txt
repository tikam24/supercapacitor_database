The paper presents detailed model of noise sources in supercapacitors. Noise phenomena observed in supercapacitors may be used as a diagnostic tool for assessment of supercapacitor quality or degradation mechanisms (e.g. corrosion of the electrodes or clogging up the pores) during ageing. Therefore, it is important to consider where noise is generated. The equivalent circuit of noise sources existing in supercapacitor is proposed. Methods of noise sources identification are also considered. Limitations of the proposed model are underlined. Final conclusions show a path of further investigations of random phenomena in supercapacitors.
