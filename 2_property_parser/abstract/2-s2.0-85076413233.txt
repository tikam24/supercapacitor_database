Different valence states of tungsten oxides show good electronic storage capacity as energy storage materials. As one of the most important indicators, the charge storage capacity is typically used to measure the performance of a supercapacitor. WO3@W18O49-CNFs was successfully prepared by doping WO3@W18O49 in carbon nanofibers (CNFs). The as-prepared WO3@W18O49-CNFs was characterized. The results indicate a strong interaction between amorphous WO3@W18O49 and CNFs during preparation, which promotes the storage and transmission of electronics. The GCD result shows a specific capacitance of 333.92 F gâˆ’1 of the as-prepared WO3@W18O49-CNFs, which confirms an increase in electrons storage ability when WO3@W18O49 was introduced. Moreover, WO3@W18O49 was uniformly doped in CNFs with the aid of high-temperature roasting, which effectively avoids the shedding and loss of particles during cyclic charging and discharging. The specific capacitance of the as-prepared WO3@W18O49-CNFs maintains 98.12% after 5000 cycles, indicating an excellent cyclic performance.
