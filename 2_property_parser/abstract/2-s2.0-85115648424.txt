With the increasing demand for wearable electronics (such as smartwatch equipment, wearable health monitoring systems, and human–robot interface units), flexible energy storage systems with eco-friendly, low-cost, multifunctional characteristics, and high electrochemical performances are imperative to be constructed. Nanocellulose with sustainable natural abundance, superb properties, and unique structures has emerged as a promising nanomaterial, which shows significant potential for fabricating functional energy storage systems. This review is intended to provide novel perspectives on the combination of nanocellulose with other electrochemical materials to design and fabricate nanocellulose-based flexible composites for advanced energy storage devices. First, the unique structural characteristics and properties of nanocellulose are briefly introduced. Second, the structure–property–application relationships of these composites are addressed to optimize their performances from the perspective of processing technologies and micro/nano-interface structure. Next, the recent specific applications of nanocellulose-based composites, ranging from flexible lithium-ion batteries and electrochemical supercapacitors to emerging electrochemical energy storage devices, such as lithium-sulfur batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and zinc-ion batteries, are comprehensively discussed. Finally, the current challenges and future developments in nanocellulose-based composites for the next generation of flexible energy storage systems are proposed.
