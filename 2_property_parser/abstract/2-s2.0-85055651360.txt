Searching for new electrode materials is one of the key tasks in developing high-performance supercapacitors. In this work, as a layered hydroxyl derivative, terephthalate-based cobalt hydroxide, Co2(OH)2(C8H4O4), is successfully prepared in situ on nickel foam through a simple hydrothermal route. The scanning electron microscopy results reveal that the products are composed of massive double-blade lath crystals grown along the a-axis. The as-obtained Ni-foam-supported Co2(OH)2(C8H4O4) is directly used as the positive electrode of supercapacitors without further treatment. The resulting Co2(OH)2(C8H4O4) electrode exhibits ultrahigh charge storage capacity with the specific capacity of 9.36 C cm−2 (1261 C g−1) at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (0.5 A g−1) and good cycling stability with the capacity retention of 82.4% over 5000 cycles at a current density of 50 mA cm−2. In combination with activated carbon as the negative electrode in 3 M KOH aqueous electrolyte, the constructed asymmetric supercapacitor delivers a high energy density of 30.62 W h kg−1 at a power density of 221 W kg−1 within a voltage window of 1.5 V. These encouraging electrochemical performances enable the developed terephthalate-based cobalt hydroxide to be a promising electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
