We have designed and implemented a hardware-in-the-loop system for the development, verification, and validation of algorithms used to construct state estimators for batteries and supercapacitors. The intent of the work is to allow algorithm developers to test their algorithms rapidly and in the context of the actual application. Promising results are shown for a carbon based electric double layer capacitor (a supercapacitor); the modeled vehicle configuration corresponds to the General Motors Saturn Vue Green Line 36V HEV, with the NiMH battery replaced by a supercapacitor pack. While the work is pragmatic in terms of addressing vehicle applications, the theoretical underpinnings and mathematical methods are relatively new, evolving, and comprise substantial complexity.
