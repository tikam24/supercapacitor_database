The optimum energy storage performance can be attained by combining the advantages of battery and capacitor into one device. This could be fulfilled by the smart design of positive (battery-like) and negative (EDL) electrode materials in a solid-state supercapattery. In this study, a cheap, yet effective, and simple strategy is utilized to synthesize binder-free, ternary metal oxide nanoparticles based on earth-abundant elements, namely Cu, Zn, and Ni. A monolithic sub-100 nm mixed oxide is prepared by anodizing German silver alloy (Cu–Zn–Ni) in an aqueous electrolyte for various time intervals (2,5, and 8 min). Upon analyzing the electrochemical performance of the films as positive electrodes in 1 M KOH, the 5 min anodized film (CZNO-5), with an elemental composition of Cu4Zn2NiOx@Cu-Zn-Ni, depicts remarkable areal and volumetric capacitances of ~27 mF/cm2 and 3150 F/cm3, respectively, at a current density of 1 mA/cm2. The assembled solid-state supercapattery device made of CZNO-5 and bioderived activated carbon (B-AC) exhibits 3.8 mF/cm2 at 1 mA/cm2 with ~35 % rate capability at 5 mA/cm2. The specific energy and specific power of the CZNO-5//B-AC device are found to be 0.97 μW h/cm2 and 0.91 mW/cm2, respectively. Most importantly, unlike many Cu-based devices, CZNO-5//B-AC shows an eminent durability with 100 and 89.6 % retention of the first cycle capacitance after 3800 and 5000 successive charge/discharge cycles.
