Conventional MnOX nanostructure/hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) composites meet two problems: non–optimized mass loading and poor rate capability. Here we present a judicious design of MnOX–modified corrugated carton–derived HPCs by depositing MnOX nanostructures in the mesopores of HPCs. Using a synergy of gas pore formation and KOH etching, mesopore–rich HPCs with a high aspect ratio suitable for the efficient loading of MnOX are synthesized. The Mn catalysis–induced graphitization process achieved by hydrothermal carbonization yields the MnOX–modified corrugated carton–derived HPCs (CBPC–2–800@MnOX) with ultrafast kinetics behaviour. Even at an extremely low loading of MnOX, the CBPC–2–800@MnOX electrodes exhibit a higher gravimetric capacitance (302 F g−1 at 0.05 A g−1), better rate performance (capacitance retention of 87.4% from 0.05 to 5 A g−1), higher energy/power density (8.4 W h kg−1 at 1000 W kg−1) and longer cycle life (98.8% capacitance retained after 5000 charge/discharge cycles at 2.5 A g−1) than those of pure HPC electrodes. The novel MnOX–modified biomass–derived HPCs with efficient mass loading and outstanding rate capability are concluded to be promising electrode materials for high–performance symmetric supercapacitors.
