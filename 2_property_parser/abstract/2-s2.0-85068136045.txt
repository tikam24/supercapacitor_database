In this work, the hybrid binder-free supercapacitor electrode material of MoS2 nanosheets - FeCo2O4 nanowires on flexible carbon cloth (CC) substrate was fabricated using two-step hydrothermal approach. Initially, FeCo2O4 nanowires were synthesized on flexible CC and subsequently, MoS2 nanosheets were deposited on FeCo2O4 nanowires - CC to form hierarchical core-shell nanostructure of hybrid binderfree MoS2 - FeCo2O4 - CC electrode for superior electrochemical performance. The fabricated electrodes were characterized by using X-ray Diffractometer (XRD) analysis, Field Emission - Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM), Raman Spectroscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. Electrochemical measurements were investigated by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. The hybrid electrode exhibited a superior electrochemical performance with the specific capacitance value of 952 F/g at the scan rate of 5 mV/s and encompass the opportunity of developing flexible energy storage devices with high power yield.
