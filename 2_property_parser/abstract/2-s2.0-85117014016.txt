Manganese molybdate (MnMoO4) has attracted extensive attention as the electrode material for supercapacitors, owing to its high theoretical specific capacity, excellent redox activity, good structural stability, abundant reserves and low cost. However, its low actual specific capacity and poor electronic conductivity limit the industrial development and practical applications. In this mini-review, the microstructure, preparation strategies, plausible reaction mechanisms, drawbacks and corresponding improvement technologies of micro/nanoscale MnMoO4 materials are systematically summarized. In addition, the challenges and prospects of MnMoO4 for supercapacitors in future applications are discussed.
