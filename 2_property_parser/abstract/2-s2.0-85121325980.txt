Due to the intermittence and randomness of the renewable energy, hybrid energy storage system is widely adopted to suppress the power fluctuation. Power distribution is crucial for the robust and efficient operation of hybrid energy system. This paper proposes an innovative framework for hybrid energy storage system power distribution combining main circuit topology, modulation method and power distribution strategy. Firstly, hybrid modulation strategy to realize power distribution in a single-phase inverter is introduced. Then, power load prediction and low frequency filter are utilized to generate references for power distribution. Finally, the simulation model is established to test the framework and the result demonstrates the superiority of the proposed framework. The mean absolute percent error of the proposed SSA-LSTM mdoel is 0.0955 and the prediciton error by 40% compared with conventional LSTM model. Additionally, the energy management framework can adjust the port power distribution ratio flexibily to significantly suppress the power fluctuation of the grid and the operation cost of the hybrid energy storage system by reducing the charge and discharge cycle of the battery.
