Reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/bamboo cellulose based carbon aerogel was prepared after gel and pyrolysis by adding GO in sodium hydroxide and urea solution system. Then, the δ-MnO2 nanosheets were deposited on this conductive substrate by hydrothermal method. The effect of MnO2 deposition content on the electrochemical properties of the composites and the energy storage mechanism of the composites were studied. The results show that the electrochemical properties of the composites are firstly improved and then decreased with increasing MnO2 deposition amount. When 0.005 mol KMnO4 is added, the specific capacitance of the composite material is 330 F/g. In addition, the asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits a high specific capacitance of 68.8 F/g at 0.5 A/g, and reveals a high energy density of 16.2 W•h/kg at a power density of 163 W/kg. It retains 94% of the initial specific capacitance after 8000 cycles at 2 A/g.
