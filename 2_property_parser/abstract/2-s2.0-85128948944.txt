The motivation of this study is to understand the usability of annealed stainless steel mesh obtained by a straightforward method for energy storage devices. The electrochemical behaviour of steel mesh with and without heat treatment has been studied in non-aqueous (ionic liquid) and aqueous (acidic, neutral and alkaline) media for probable use in power sources. The stainless steel meshes were annealed at 500 °C, 700 °C and 900 °C in a muffle furnace for 45 min to form a binder-free electrode material. Optical, structural and compositional changes of the resulting electrodes were analysed after thermal oxidation of the steel mesh by heat treatment in a simple muffle furnace. The coating on steel mesh was mainly a composite consisting of Fe3O4 and MnO2 after the application of 900 °C. The electrode was characterized using electrochemical (cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge) and non-electrochemical (XRD, XPS, SEM, EDX and FTIR) techniques. As the electrochemical behaviour of annealed stainless steel mesh electrode cycled in Na2SO4 and H2SO4 did not change significantly, these electrolytes cannot be suggested for annealed stainless steel-based electrode. The areal capacitance of 900 °C annealed steel mesh in the alkaline solution and ionic liquid was 3125 mF cm−2 and 1350 mF cm−2, respectively. The potential window of the mesh electrode in the ionic liquid was 1.2 V. This work describes a straightforward, simple and scalable thermal oxidation procedure for the formation of a metal oxides composite coating on stainless steel mesh. 900 °C annealed stainless steel mesh could be used as an electrode with KOH or Reline ionic liquid for energy storage devices.
