CuS with different morphologies (plate-like, nanoparticle-like, sphere-like, and flower-like) are successfully synthesized via a simple low-temperature solvothermal approach without any surfactant or template. CuS are used as supercapacitor electrode materials, which provide a large voltage window as high as 1.5 V and excellent capacitive performance in an aqueous electrolyte. The specific capacitance of the flower-like CuS synthesized in glycerol can reach up to 597 F g-1 (at 1 A g-1). Meanwhile, the flower-like CuS exhibits a good cycling stability. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.
