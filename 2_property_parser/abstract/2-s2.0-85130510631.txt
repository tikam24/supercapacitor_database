A supramolecular compound with the molecular formula (Hbipy)3[PMo12O40]·3H2O(bipy ​= ​4,4-bipyridyl) (1) was prepared and characterized by one-step hydrothermal method. Single-crystal structure analysis shows, a cluster consists of 4,4-Hbipy bonded to four [PMo12O40]3- anions by hydrogen bonds, which forms two distinct two-dimensional structures through supramolecular interactions, then further extended to 4,4,12-connected {427·638·8}{45·6}{46}2 three-dimensional topology by π-π stacking and hydrogen bonds. The supercapacitor performance of compound 1 under different collector conditions was studied. In the three-electrode system, capacitance of nickel foam (263.9 ​F ​g-1, 1 ​A ​g-1) is higher than that of carbon cloth (60 ​F ​g-1, 1 ​A ​g-1). The energy density (5.34 ​Wh kg-1) and power density (399.67 ​W ​kg-1) of compound 1 are better in the nickel foam symmetric double-electrode system. Moreover, the compound 1 has a good photocatalytic degradation effect on methylene blue (MB) (95.8%) and rhodamine B (RhB) (93.54%).
