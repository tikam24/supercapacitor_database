Various morphologies of copper oxide (CuO) nanostructures have been synthesized by controlling the reaction parameters in a sonochemical assisted method without using any templates or surfactants. The effect of reaction parameters including molar ratio of the reactants, reaction temperature, ultrasound exposure time, and annealing temperature on the composition and morphology of the product(s) has been investigated. The prepared samples have been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDAX), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). It has been found that Cu2(OH)3NO 3 nanoplatelets are achieved in mild conditions which can be then converted to various morphologies of CuO nanostructures by either using high concentrations of OH- (formation of nanorods), prolonging sonication irradiation (nanoparticles), or thermal treatment (nanospheres). Application of the prepared CuO nanostructures was evaluated as supercapacitive material in 1 M Na2SO4 solution using cyclic voltammetry (CV) in different potential scan rates ranging from 5 to 100 mV s-1. The specific capacitance has been calculated using CV curves. It has been found that the pseudocapacitor performance of CuO can be tuned via employing morphologically controlled samples. Accordingly, the prolonged sonicated sample (nanoparticles) showed the high specific capacitance of 158 F.g-1. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
