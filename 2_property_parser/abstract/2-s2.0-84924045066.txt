In this work, nickel–cobalt double hydroxide nanosheets with high rate capability are prepared by a facile epoxide precipitation route. The synthetic procedure includes an oxidization step using ammonium persulfate as oxidant and a precipitation step using propylene oxide as precipitation agent. As shown in the results of electrochemical characterization, high specific capacitance of 2548 F g−1 for this material can be obtained at current density of 0.9 A g−1 in aqueous solution of 3 mol L−1KOH. It is surprising to notice that the capacitance of material still remains 1587 F g−1 at high current density of 35.7 A g−1. These results demonstrate that the as-prepared nickel–cobalt double hydroxide nanosheets are promising electrode material for supercapacitor application as a primary power source.
