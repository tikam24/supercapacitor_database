The proceedings contain 14 papers. The topics discussed include: determination of the temperature in the half-voltage disconnect switches, through polynomial functions obtained from thermographic images, for the development of intelligent maintenance systems; a novel approach to low multiplicative complexity logic design; support vector machine regression based supercapacitor's dynamic characteristics model; simplified impedance design and control for low-cost high-speed channels; forecasting hourly electricity demand using a hybrid method; a novel silicon power device with high-permittivity material for better drain voltage vs. on-resistance behavior and improved performance; study of the dirty copy on write, a Linux kernel memory allocation vulnerability; an experimental study on the effects of bioethanol - gasoline blends on engine performance in a spark ignition engine; harmonic elimination for PWM inverter; emotion recognition system based on EEG signals using relative wavelet energy features and a modified radial basis function neural networks; consumer electronics may deliver more than consumer applications; and user experience on XD theatre: body gestures and postures of deaf and normal children.
