The increasing deployment of intermittent renewable energy sources (RESs) around the world has revealed concerns about the power grid stability. To solve this problem, a massive use of storage systems is needed. The main goal of this work is to develop a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) combining several storage devices with complementary performances. In this paper, lead-acid batteries and supercapacitors (SCs) are associated in order to deliver a pulsed current. An innovative cascade control with anti-windup tracking manages the power sharing between a buck and a boost converters connected to the same DC bus. Analog control circuits and power converters have been designed to evaluate the performances of the HESS in real conditions.
