Graphene and graphene-based hybrid materials have emerged as an outstanding supercapacitor electrode material primarily because of their excellent surface area, high electrical conductivity, and improved thermal, mechanical, electrochemical cycling stabilities. Graphene alone exhibits electric double layer capacitance (EDLC) with low energy density and high power density. The use of aerogels in a supercapacitor is a pragmatic approach due to its extraordinary properties like ultra-lightweight, high porosity and specific surface area. The aerogels encompass a high volume of pores which leads to easy soak by the electrolyte and fast charge-discharge process. Graphene aerogels assembled into three-dimensional (3D) architecture prevent there stacking of graphene sheets and maintain the high surface area and hence excellent cycling stability and rate capacitance. However, the energy density of graphene aerogels is limited due to EDLC type of charge storage mechanism. Consequently, 3D graphene aerogel coupled with pseudocapacitive materials such as transition metal oxides, metal hydroxides, conducting polymers, nitrides, chalcogenides show an efficient energy density and power density performance due to the presence of both types of charge storage mechanisms. This laconic review focuses on the design and development of graphene-based aerogel in the field of the supercapacitor. This review is an erudite article about methods, technology and electrochemical properties of graphene aerogel.
