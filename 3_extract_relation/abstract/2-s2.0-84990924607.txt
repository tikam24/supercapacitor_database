A facile synthesis approach was successfully developed to synthesize mesoporous NiCo2S4 in ethylene glycol. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and N2 adsorption–desorption experiment were conducted to examine the morphology and microstructure of the as-prepared NiCo2S4. Furthermore, electrochemical measurements, including cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge tests, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, were carried out in a three-electrode system to evaluate the electrochemical properties of the mesoporous NiCo2S4. The as-prepared NiCo2S4 possessed a high specific surface area of 223.6 m2 g−1 with a high specific capacity of 406 C g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. In addition, only a 6.3 % loss of specific capacity was observed at 5 A g−1 after 20,000 GCD cycles, suggesting a long life cycle.
