The redox additive KI-modified and H2SO4-protonated polyvinyl alcohol gel polymer electrolyte (KI-H2SO4-PVA GPE) is used to match well with an activated carbon paper (ACP) electrode, which is adopted for solid-state pseudocapacitor applications. Enhanced hydrogen bonding interactions are established between oxygen-containing functional groups of ACP and multi-hydroxyl groups of PVA, promoting interfacial charge transfer. An intensified electrostatic adsorption is also promoted between H2SO4-protonated PVA and free iodide anions, enhancing the ionic and electrical conductivity of GPE. The electroactive iodide anion with polyvalent states of I−, I3− and IO3− in KI-H2SO4-PVA GPE participates in reversible redox reactions at the ACP electrode interface, which mostly contributes to Faradaic capacitance. The mass ratio of redox additive KI was optimized to be 0.166, which could balance the capacitance and the cyclability of KI-H2SO4-PVA GPE. The KI-H2SO4-PVA GPE reveals lower ohm resistance, charge transfer resistance and Warburg impedance, leading to its higher electrical and ion conductivity compared to H2SO4-PVA GPE. Theoretical simulations proved that the protonation of H2SO4-PVA and electrostatic interaction between H2SO4-protonated PVA and KI could cause an effective decrease in the interfacial energy of the activated carbon paper electrode. The KI-H2SO4-PVA GPE/ACP accordingly presents higher specific capacitance (24.75 mF cm−2) and rate capability (45.5%) than H2SO4-PVA GPE/ACP (12.93 mF cm−2, 15.6%). The redox-activated KI-H2SO4-PVA GPE exhibits a lowered cycling stability (64.5%) compared to H2SO4-PVA GPE (78.3%) in ACP supercapacitor applications due to the gradually decreasing irreversibility of the redox reactions of polyvalent iodide ions. The KI-H2SO4-PVA GPE matches well with ACP electrode and accordingly is suitable for solid-state pseudocapacitor applications with high capacitance performance.
