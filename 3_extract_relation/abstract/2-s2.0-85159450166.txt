Metal-organic frameworks are a class of functional porous materials. In recent years, metal-organic frameworks have become a hot research topic in the field of electrochemistry because of their controllable morphology, abundant pores, high specific surface area, and versatility. Herein, we summarize the latest developments of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and MOF-derived materials as electrode materials for supercapacitors. The morphological and electrochemical properties of these promising MOFs and MOF-derived materials for their future development are also discussed.
