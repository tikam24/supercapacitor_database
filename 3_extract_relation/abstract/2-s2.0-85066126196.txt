In this research, we have effectively synthesized a novel NiCo2O4/NiCo2S4 powder by co-precipitation and thin films prepared using a screen-printing method on Ni mesh for supercapacitor applications. Herein, we report the effect of unique hierarchical nanostructures and the systematic effect of Ni and Co on the structural, morphological and electrical properties of the NiCo2O4/NiCo2S4 electrodes. The optimized NiCo2O4/NiCo2S4 electrode shows outstanding performance with a specific capacitance of 1966 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1. The cycling stability reports indicate the NiCo2O4/NiCo2S4 electrodes have an outstanding cyclic stability with 91% capacity retention. From the supercapacitor performance results, we confirmed that the NiCo2O4/NiCo2S4 electrode is useful for the fabrication of symmetric supercapacitors. These results reveal that the NiCo2O4/NiCo2S4 electrodes is a capable electrode material for supercapacitor applications in the future.
