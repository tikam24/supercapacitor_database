Charge transfer reactions are the most frequent processes met during the conversion of chemical energy into electrical one. Intercalation/insertion processes are the best examples of these phenomena. The type of interaction/binding between guest species and host material decides about the reversibility of the processes. The important drawback of the carbon anode in Li-ion cells is often its irreversible capacity. It correlates with the active surface area and it can be significantly diminished through pyrolytic carbon coating. In situ7Li-NMR measurement is a perfect method for monitoring the type of Li-C bonding during the insertion/deinsertion process. Supercapacitor is the second category of attractive energy storage system. The main operation of a capacitor is based on an electrostatic attraction; however, very often pseudocapacitance effects take place. Intensive research is devoted to electrochemical hydrogen storage where the type of C-hydrogen bonding is crucial for practical application of this process. The reversibility of hydrogen insertion into the carbon network is ensured by a weak chemical bonding. Carbon materials with electrosorbed hydrogen play a perfect role of negative electrode in supercapacitor. Attractive host-guest interactions take place during the performance of various supercapacitor electrode materials, e.g. nitrogen-doped carbons with modified electronic structure, layered double hydroxides, conducting polymers, etc. Â© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
