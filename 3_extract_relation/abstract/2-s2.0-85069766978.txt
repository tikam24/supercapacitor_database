Novel polycarbazole/Ag2O nanocomposite was prepared by common in situ chemical oxidative polymerization method. The aim of the work was to obtain synergistic pseudocapacitive behaviour of polycarbazole and Ag2O. During the synthesis procedure, camphor sulphonic acid and ammonium persulfate were used as a dopant and oxidizing agent respectively. The prepared materials were analysed and confirmed by various characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction studies (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and atomic force microscopic (AFM) studies. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) measurements has been used to analyse the electrochemical performance of prepared electrode material. The specific capacitance, power density and energy density of PCz-Ag2O is found to be 1243 F g-1, 121.54 kW kg-1 and 172.15 Wh kg-1 respectively.
