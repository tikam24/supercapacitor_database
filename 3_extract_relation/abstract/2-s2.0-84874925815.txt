We demonstrate the sonochemical synthesis of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and MoO3 hybrids for an application in supercapacitor (SC) electrodes. The MoO3 nanodots with the diameter of <10 nm are uniformly deposited on the surfaces of MWCNTs as characterized by TEM and STEM images. The specific capacitance of 103 F g-1 in MoO 3/MWCNT hybrids is two times higher than 42 F g-1 of the pristine MWCNTs and four times higher than 22 F g-1 of MoO 3. Moreover, hybrid electrodes show a good rate capability of >90% retention up to 2.12 A g-1 and cyclic stability of 80% retention during 1000 cycles of charge/discharge because of the mechanical stability of the MWCNTs and the good contact between the MoO3 and MWCNTs. The energy density of MoO3/MWCNT hybrids is evaluated to be 38.7 Wh kg-1 by using an organic electrolyte. Therefore, the hybridization of MWCNTs and redox-active MoO3 nanodots provides a rational design strategy to overcome the critical challenges of pseudocapacitors such as poor rate and cycle stability, while improving the low specific capacitance of electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs).
