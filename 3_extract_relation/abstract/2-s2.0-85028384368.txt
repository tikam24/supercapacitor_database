A facile hydrothermal method and subsequent electroactivation have been developed to fabricate three-dimensional (3D) CuO nanosheet arrays on the copper foil substrate, which can be used directly as a binder-free electrode for supercapacitor applications. Under optimum conditions, by using this facile method, a high capacitance of 125 mF/cm2 at a current density of 0.3 mA/cm2 is obtained. The prepared supercapacitor showed a good rate capability (46.4% capacitance retention, when the current density is increased to more than 30 times) and an excellent cyclability (more than 88% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles).
