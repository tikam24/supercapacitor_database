N-doped biomass-derived carbon with high specific surface area, suitable N atom doping ratio and superior hierarchical porous structure has been prepared by one-step carbonization activation method. Benefiting from the mesoporous structure formed by fragments of nanowires PPy anchoring to each other during the carbonization process, the product possesses large pore volume (1.53 cm3 g−1) and mesoporous volume (1.01 cm3 g−1). Owing to the synergistic effect of the superior pore structure and suitable N atom doping ratio, the product exhibits excellent performance for energy storage. Typically, the product exhibits high specific capacitance (330 F g−1) and rate capability (71.5% of capacitance retention at 20 A g−1) in three-electrode systems. A coin-type symmetric supercapacitor has been assembled based on the product, and an energy density as high as 37.5 W h kg−1 is verified in this cell. Furthermore, the product is also applied to the area of lithium-ion battery, where a high reversible capacity of 1662 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 is confirmed, indicating the superior Li+ storage capability.
