Next-generation portable flexible electronic appliances require liquid-free energy storage supercapacitor devices to eliminate leakage and to support mechanical bending that is compatible with roll-to-roll technologies. Hence, a state-of-the-art process is presented to design a solid-state, wide-potential and flexible supercapacitor through the use of nano-pebbles of cerium selenideviaa simple successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method that could allow an industry scalable route. We strongly believe that this is the first approach amongst physical and chemical routes not only for synthesizing cerium selenide in thin-film form but also using it for device-grade supercapacitor applications. The designed solid-state symmetric supercapacitor assembled from cerium selenide electrodes sandwiched by PVA-LiClO4gel electrolyte attains a wide potential window of 1.8 V with capacitance of 48.8 F g−1at 2 mV s−1and reveals excellent power density of 4.89 kW kg−1at an energy density of 11.63 W h kg−1. The formed device is capable of 87% capacitive retention even at a mechanical bending angle of 175°. Lighting up a strip of 21 parallel connected red LEDs clearly demonstrates the practical use of the designed symmetric solid-state supercapacitor, aiming towards the commercialization of the product in the future.
