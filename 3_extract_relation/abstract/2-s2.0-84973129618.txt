Synthesis of pseudocapacitive mesoporous transition metal oxides with hierarchical structures is of great interest in the development of high performance energy storage devices. Herein, we demonstrate a facile single-step, template-free chemical route for the synthesis of hierarchical mesoporous δ-MnO2 and its supercapacitive performance. The mesoporous δ-MnO2 is synthesized by the thermodynamically favourable redox reaction of MnO4- with HBr. The growth of δ-MnO2 involves the facile reduction of MnO4- to Mn2+ and the subsequent reaction of in situ generated Mn2+ with unreacted MnO4- in one pot at room temperature. Br- has dual roles of reducing MnO4- and controlling the growth of MnO2 by surface etching. The possible Ostwald ripening and self-assembling of the nanoseeds formed at the initial stage of the reaction and the ensuing surface etching of the urchin-like MnO2 by Br- produce hierarchical flower-like δ-MnO2 of 300 nm size. It has a three-dimensional mesoporous structure with a large surface area of 238 m2 g-1. It has an average pore size and pore volume of 36.14 Å and 0.567 cc g-1, respectively. The concentration of Br- controls the growth of δ-MnO2 and a large excess of Br- completely reduces MnO2 to Mn2+. The δ-MnO2 nanostructure shows excellent supercapacitive performance with a specific capacitance of 364 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1. An aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is developed by pairing the δ-MnO2-based cathode with an activated carbon anode. ASC delivers a specific capacitance of 86.5 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 with a wide potential window of 0-2 V. It retains 100% initial specific capacitance even after 3000 continuous charge-discharge cycles. The device has an energy density of 48.06 W h kg-1 at the power density of 1.0 kW kg-1 and it retains 24.44 W h kg-1 at a power density of 20 kW kg-1. The favourable access of the electrode material to the electrolyte due to the mesoporous structure enhances the overall performance of the device.
