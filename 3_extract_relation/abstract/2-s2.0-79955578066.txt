Herein, we report the electrosynthesized marygold-like structured nickel doped (5 at.%) iron hydroxide thin film from the aqueous solution of 0.1 M iron sulphate using galavanostatic mode of electrodeposition method for supercapacitor application. The compositional analysis of film was studied by AAS. Amorphous structure of nickel doped iron hydroxide film revealed from XRD analysis. The formation of elemental bands of iron hydroxide was confirmed from FTIR study. The SEM images and surface wettability showed marygold-like structure with contact angle 79° with surface of film. The supercapacitive properties of film using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge showed the highest specific capacitance 287 F g-1 in 1 M Na 2SO3 electrolyte at the scan rate of 10 mV s-1. The supercapacitive parameters such as, specific energy (S.E.), specific power (S.P.) and coulomb efficiency (η%) are 8.32 Wh kg-1, 2.5 kW kg-1 and 92%, respectively. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.
