Scale-like CoMn2O4/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) have been successfully synthesized via a facile hydrothermal and annealing process. When evaluate its potential as electrode material for supercapacitor, effective measurement method of electrochemical performance was implemented. The result shows the electrode has high specific capacitance, excellent rate capability and long cycle life.
