Herein for the first time, intertwined nanocomposite (Co3O4@Se NPs/MWCNTs) of cobalt oxide nanoparticles (Co3O4 NPs) adsorbed on selenium nanoparticles (Se NPs) (designated as Co3O4@Se NPs) and thiol (–SH) functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method to achieve excellent capacitive and microbicidal performance. The surface morphology, microstructure and functional group studies ensures that the existence of Co3O4@Se NPs onto MWCNTs. The electrochemical studies (cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD)) were performed and demonstrated the Supercapacitive performance of Co3O4@Se NPs/MWCNTs nanocomposite. Higher electrochemical capacitance (356 F/g) with better coulombic efficiency of 84% was acquired. Also, it exhibited an admirable antimicrobial study and illustrated that the pathogens were more susceptible to Co3O4@Se NPs/MWCNTs nanocomposite. The superior electrochemical and antimicrobial activity was achieved owing to the specific inherent properties of thiol (–SH) groups opt binding and stabilizing Co3O4@Se NPs against its aggregation on the surface of MWCNTs. The thiol (–SH) group influences the enrichment of Co3O4@Se NPs onto MWCNTs and facilitates in enhancement of energy storage and microbicidal performance the nanocomposite. These attained outcomes put forward the applicability of the synthesized active nanocomposite towards supercapacitor and antibacterial agents against pathogens.
