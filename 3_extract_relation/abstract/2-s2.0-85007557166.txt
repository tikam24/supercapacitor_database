In this paper, the suitability of aqueous KOH and H2SO4 electrolytes in terms of ionic size, mobility, conductivity and energy of electrolyte ions with the porosity of activated carbon electrodes are demonstrated. These parameters of ions (K+, OH-, H+, SO4 2-) are found to affect the overall performances of supercapacitor cells as observed from the results of EIS, CV and GCD studies. The cell using H2SO4 electrolyte exhibits better performance with relatively low value of charge transfer resistance (0.57 ω), overall cell resistance, 19ω (at 10mHz) and high value of specific capacitance 547F g-1 (at 1mV s-1), specific energy 10W h kg-1 (at 0.5A g-1) and specific power, 490W kg-1. These results show that aqueous acid electrolyte is more compatible with carbon electrodes which could be due to the higher ionic energies of H+ and SO4 2- ions.
