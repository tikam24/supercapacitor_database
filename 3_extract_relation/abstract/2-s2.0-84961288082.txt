Anthraquinone (AQ) molecules with electrochemically reversible redox couples (anthraquinone/anthracenol) have been selected to functionalize a graphene framework (GF) through non-covalent modification. The π-π stacking interactions between components induce a favorable molecular orientation so that the aromatic ring of AQ is parallel to the sp2 network of GF. In this case, the fast Faradaic reactions between anthraquinone and anthracenol generate additional pseudocapacitance for enhancing the supercapacitive performance of GF. In the three-electrode configuration, AQ-functionalized GF (AQ/GF) shows a high capacitance value (396 F g-1 at 1 A g-1, two times higher than bare GF), ultrahigh rate capability (64% capacitance retention at 100 A g-1) and long cycle life (97% retention after 2000 cycles). For further practical application, a novel asymmetric supercapacitor with high energy and power densities has been assembled by using AQ/GF as negative electrode and GF as positive electrode in H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. Maximum energy (13.2 Wh kg-1) and power (9175.3 W kg-1) densities have been obtained for the GF//AQ/GF device.
