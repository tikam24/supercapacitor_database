In this work, an alkaline earth metal cation doped transition metal oxide namely, calcium manganese oxide (CMO) was prepared by a cost effective co-precipitation method at two different temperatures and investigated its suitability for supercapacitor application. XRD and FT-IR spectroscopy were utilized to examine the phase and bonding properties of the as-prepared CMO materials, whereas morphological characteristics were analysed by SEM and TEM. The electrochemical performance of the CMO-B (calcinated at 800 °C), reveals a higher specific capacitance of 247 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 and 327 F g−1 at a current density of 1 Ag−1 respectively than CMO-A (calcinated at 700 °C). The fabricated symmetric supercapacitor of CMO-B delivered an energy density of 16.7 Whkg−1 with a power density of 2398 Wkg−1 at a current density of 1 Ag−1. The cyclic stability studies show initial specific capacitance of 100% over 10,000 cycles with coulombic efficiency of 101% at current density of 5 Ag−1. These results reveal that the CMO-B is a promising electrode material for supercapacitor application.
