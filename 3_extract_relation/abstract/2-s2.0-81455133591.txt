A prototype electrode was constructed to study the optimization of composition of materials used for the supercapacitors. Electrodes were prepared from a selected active carbon , a conductive carbon, binder and aluminum foil with various compositions and thicknesses with a technique developed. An elechtrochemical test cell was used for measuring impedance characteristics of electrodes. The electrode was tested for capacitance & ESR to get the optimum conductive carbon content. Results showed that capacitance increases to a maximum level of capacitance value at 7% by weight of conductive carbon and the capacitance starts to decrease as conductive carbon content increases further. The ESR didn't change significantly with carbon content. Effect of carbon layer thickness was evaluated with 7% conductive carbon composition for thicknesses varying from 50 microns to 250 microns. Results shows capacitance increases monotonically while ESR is almost independent of thickness in this range.
