Integration of high surface area nanostructures with conducting and deformable electrodes at large scale are of significant importance for flexible supercapacitors with high cyclic stability and low cost. Here, we report water assisted meter scale growth of aligned iron oxide and CNT 1D nanostructures on flexible stainless steel mesh for asymmetric supercapacitor device applications. Electron microscopic investigations revealed the uniform coverage of both iron oxide and CNT forest nanostructures over one meter length of SS mesh. Both iron oxide and CNT nanostructures were tested for supercapacitor electrode material in neutral electrolytes. Further, asymmetric solid state devices were fabricated and connected in serial fashion to demonstrate glowing of LEDs as well as rotation of 5 V micro fan. In addition, at bending angle of 90 , device showed 68% increase whereas, at 180 it showed 13% decrease in capacitance. The calculated specific capacitance for single device is found to be 14.4 mF cm-2. Corresponding energy density and power density are found to be 3 Î¼W-hr cm-2 and 0.74 mW cm-2 respectively. The device showed remarkable capacitance retention of 87% over 25 000 charge discharge cycles. The flexible nature with remarkable cyclic stability of solid state iron oxide/CNT device is suitable for low cost flexible and wearable supercapacitor applications.
