The development of energy storage devices for the growing energy demand is a prerequisite for modern society. Specific characteristics, i.e., thermal, electrochemical, and mechanical properties, of nanocomposites are essential for their application in energy storage appliances. Biobased nanocomposites are being considered environmentally friendly. Nanocellulose, lignin, and chitosan are obtained from an abundant source of natural renewable materials. Using them in developing batteries and supercapacitors has great potential for a sustainable supply of energy. Nanocellulose and the lignin-based electrode have shown excellent electrochemical properties for application in a battery. Nanocellulose, lignin, and chitosan-based electrode have also exhibited excellent electrochemical properties for their utilization in supercapacitors. In addition, their low-cost, high conductivity, and environment-friendly nature are being considered for the preparation of energy storage devices. In this chapter, the development strategy and performance of batteries and supercapacitors obtained from biobased nanocomposites have been discussed.
