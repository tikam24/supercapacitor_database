Hybrid nanomaterials offer promising properties to serve as an electrode for hybrid supercapacitors. Herein, dye (rhodamine B, RhB) encapsulated zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (RhB@ZIF-8) was synthesized at room temperature via triethylamine (TEA)-assisted method. The material was used as a precursor for synthesizing zinc oxide embedded nitrogen-doped carbon (ZnO@N-doped C) via the carbonization at different temperatures (400°C, 600°C, and 800°C). The materials were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential thermal analysis (DTA), high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray mapping (EDX), nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm, and X-ray photoelectron microscope (XPS). ZnO@N-doped C nanocrystals (15–20 nm) were used as an electrode for a hybrid supercapacitor. ZnO@N-doped C exhibited a high capacitance of 1200 F·g−1 at a current density of 1 A·g−1 without losing any capacitance (87.7% of initial capacitance) even after 1000 galvanostatic charge–discharge cycles (GCDCs). The presence of a guest molecule such as RhB improved the capacitance of the carbonized ZIF-8 two-fold compared with the carbonized materials using conventional ZIF-8.
