Producing materials with suitable features including robust, and high electrical conductivity for the realization of excellent electrochemical performance for supercapacitor devices remains a great challenge. In this regard, we optimize and used the combustion synthesis technique assisted with urea for the production of a positive electrode based on battery type lithium manganese oxide (LiMnO) and activated carbon as negative electrode materials for high voltage hybrid devices in aqueous electrolytes. The samples were analyzed with X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The structural properties of the material were studied and hybrid devices fabricated present a specific capacitance of 65 F g−1 and 78 F g−1, at 0.5 A g−1 in 1 M Li2SO4 and 1 M Na2SO4 respectively, with long-term stability after continuous cycling. These result shows that this strategy can revolutionize new ways to the synthesis of a plethora of materials for high voltage energy storage applications.
