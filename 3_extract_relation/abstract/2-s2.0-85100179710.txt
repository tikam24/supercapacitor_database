A nanostructured spinel LiMn2O4 and graphene composite fabricated by using a simple one-step method exhibits excellent electrochemical performance as the cathode for aqueous hybrid supercapacitors. The specific capacitance of commercial LiMn2O4 is enhanced five-fold with a scan rate that is also enhanced 20 times in 1 M Li2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. In addition, the use of water-in-salt electrolyte (5 M LiTFSI) greatly improves the electrochemical performance of the hybrid devices, owing to the larger working window. A high energy density of 202 Wh kg−1 at power densities of 171 W kg−1 and 20 Wh kg−1 at 2571 W kg−1 were obtained in 5 M LiTFSI. This work provides two strategies to achieve high-performance LiMn2O4-based cathodes and highly concentrated electrolyte for hybrid supercapacitors in actual applications.
