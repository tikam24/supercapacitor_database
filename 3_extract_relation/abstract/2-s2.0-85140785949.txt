Polyaniline based ternary composites have demonstrated their transcendence in the recent past. This study reports on the synthesis of polyaniline/waste coconut shell derived activated carbon/copper cobaltite based ternary composite for supercapacitor applications. The XPS results confirmed the presence of C, N, O along with Cu and Co peaks. The electrochemical characterizations revealed an excellent specific capacitance of 613.52 Fg−1 and a specific energy density of 44.16 Wh kg−1. The prepared ternary composite offered an astonishingly low charge transfer resistance of 5.6 Ω. An outstanding charge retention capacity of 90.76 % was observed over 4000 cycles. An extended investigation of frequency response analysis was also performed to study the total admittance, capacitance, impedance, and phase of Z with frequency. The promising results were obtained due to the synergy between participating species.
