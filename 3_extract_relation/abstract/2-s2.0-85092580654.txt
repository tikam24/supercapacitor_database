A naive one-pot strategy developed to prepare high-performance trinary based material as an energy storage material for supercapacitor. Herein, we have systematically studied and established an effortless and proficient synthetic method to formulate reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/polyaniline (PANI)/manganese dioxide (MnO2) (RPM) trinary material in one-step without any additional oxidizing/polymerizing agent and acidic condition. The approach of “one arrow two targets” have employed to synthesize trinary based nanocomposite. For the first time, we have synthesized this trinary material in one step. Initially, in-situ synthesized carbonic acid was consumed as a reducing agent to reduce the graphene oxide (GO) as well as it provided acidic condition for the formation of MnO2 and polymerization of aniline. Secondarily, MnO2 particles synthesized from KMnO4 precursor, which acted as an oxidizing agent to polymerize aniline in the presence of carbonic acid. The material reflected the electrical double layer capacitance as well as pseudocapacitance of RGO and PANI/MnO2. The material exhibited the maximum specific capacitance, 592 F/g at 1 A/g current density corresponds to excessive specific energy and specific power 66.6 Wh/kg, 1800 W/kg, respectively. This familiar route of direct production of graphene with the synergism of PANI-MnO2 on carbon can be useful for large-scale fabrication of nano-carbon material for diverse applications including energy storage application.
