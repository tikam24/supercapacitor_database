Nitrogen-doped hollow carbon spheres with a wrinkled surface were rationally synthesized for the first time by using graphene oxide as a morphology controlling agent through direct pyrolysis of core-shell structured GO-resol@melamine formaldehyde composites, showing excellent rate performance towards supercapacitors, due to their unique structural and surface properties.
