Acid Red 27-crosslinked PANI (ARCP) was prepared via chemical oxidative polymerization in the presence of Acid Red 27 (AR-27) as crosslinking agent and doping agent. The results showed that in comparison with the microsized bulky structure of uncrosslinked PANI, the nanofiber structure of ARCP was observed and the diameter of ARCP nanofiber decreased from 300 nm to 60 nm with the increase of feeding molar ratio of AR-27 to aniline. ARCP exhibited a large specific capacitance of 463 F·g−1 at 2 A·g−1 and a great electrochemical cycling stability with the specific capacitance retention of 85.5% after 1000 cycles when the feeding molar ratio of AR-27 to aniline was 0.04:1, which was better than uncrosslinked PANI with a specific capacitance of 280 F·g−1 and the specific capacitance retention of 70.8%.
