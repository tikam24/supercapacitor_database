A new 3-dimensional (3D) Mn-based metal organic framework (Mn-MOF) was created through hydrothermal method. This Mn-MOF has the molecular formula of C10H10Mn3N4O12 and possesses orthorhombic symmetry in the Pbcn space group. As the electrode material for supercapacitors, a small amount of Cu powder is added to modify the electrode material (Mn-MOF-Cu), which has higher specific capacitance, better cycle stability and longer cycle life than the Mn-MOF. The specific capacitance of the optimized electrode material can reach 1606 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, which is significantly higher than the original Mn-MOF electrode material (1106 F g−1). The key aspect which improves the electrochemical behavior of Mn-MOF-Cu is the introduction of Cu powder as a conductive additive, so that the advantages of the unique 3D structure of the Mn-MOF in terms of electron transport can be better displayed.
