Mesoporous carbon microspheres (MCMs), as a supercapacitor electrode material, have good gravimetric capacitance and rate performance; however, their low volumetric capacitance, which results from their low density, restricts their application as a micro power source. Herein, polyaniline was introduced into the channels of MCMs to achieve a synergistic effect and significantly increase the volumetric capacitance. MCMs with a high surface area and pore volume allowed the uniform dispersion of PANI within their channels in nanoscale dimensions. The interconnected carbon framework could provide excellent electrical conductivity and alleviate the structural collapse of PANI. Moreover, PANI could function not only as an active pseudocapacitive material that facilitated energy storage but also as a proton transport media that promoted a rapid protonation/deprotonation process during the redox reaction in the internal channels. As a result, PANI/MCM composites, even with a poor pore structure, delivered a high volumetric capacitance of 539F cm−3 at 1 A g−1 and an excellent rate performance of 83% at current densities ranging from 0.5 to 20 A g−1. In addition, PANI/MCM composites exhibited good cycling stability, retaining 84% of the capacitance after 1000 charge/discharge cycles at 1 A g−1, owing to the high mechanical strength of the MCMs. Therefore, this synthesis strategy could provide an efficient and scalable solution for the development of supercapacitor electrode materials.
