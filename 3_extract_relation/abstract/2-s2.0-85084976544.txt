Polyindole (PIn) has attracted extensive interest as promising energy storage materials owing to fairly good thermal stability, high redox activity and stability, however, it is challenging to prepare high-quality PIn in neutral solvents by electrochemical method. Herein, a simple route, based on MoS2 nanosheets as electrolytes, has been developed for the electrochemical preparation of PIn/MoS2 nanocomposite in acetonitrile solution. Due to the coordination interaction between indole and MoS2, the onset oxidation potential of indole in this medium was reduced to 0.5 V from 0.75 V determined in acetonitrile/LiClO4. The morphologies and structures of as-obtained PIn/MoS2 nanocomposite were characterized using SEM, TEM, XRD, Raman and XPS. The results of thermal analysis indicated that the PIn/MoS2 nanocomposite had an improved thermal stability relative to PIn and MoS2 nanosheets. Moreover, the specific capacitance of PIn/MoS2 nanocomposite was 8.3 times higher than that of PIn prepared acetonitrile/LiClO4. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the high-efficiency electrodeposition of PIn/MoS2 nanocomposite in MoS2-based acetonitrile solution, which will be a promising candidate as a high efficient electrode material in the application of supercapacitors.
