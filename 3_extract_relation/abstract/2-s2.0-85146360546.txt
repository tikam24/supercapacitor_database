In order to achieve a sustainable future, researchers must continue to research improved electrode materials. Considering the high electronic conductivity, versatile redox activity, and enhanced energy storage performance, nanostructures have been employed as a novel electrode material for high-performance lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and supercapacitors. Herein, carbon-coated selenium-rich trimetallic selenide (Cu2NiSnSe4@C) nanoparticles (NPs) as an efficient electrode material in energy storage devices are prepared. The prepared core-shell Cu2NiSnSe4@C NPs electrode is employed as an anode material for LIBs, which demonstrated a high reversible specific capacity of 988.46 mA h g−1 over 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1 with good rate capability. Additionally, the core-shell Cu2NiSnSe4@C NPs electrode exhibited an outstanding capacity of 202.5 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1 even after 10 000 cycles. Exploiting the synergistic characteristics, the core-shell Cu2NiSnSe4@C NPs material is also investigated as a battery-type electrode for hybrid supercapacitors. The assembled hybrid supercapacitor with Cu2NiSnSe4@C NPs and activated carbon showed excellent rate capability including high power (5597.77 W kg−1) and energy (64.26 Wh kg−1) densities. Considering the simple synthesis and enhanced energy storage properties, carbon-coated selenium-rich trimetallic selenide can be used as a durable electrode material for practical energy storage devices.
