Stretchable supercapacitors are promising energy storage devices for fabricating integrated wearable electronics. MXenes had shown great potential in electrochemical energy storage applications. However, it was still a big challenge to realize the performance of stretchable energy devices due to the mechanical stiffness of their 2D layered structures. Here, MXene based electrodes with structural stretchability were fabricated by spraying-baking Ti3C2Tx MXene flakes on tailored stainless steel mesh. With poly vinyl alcohol-sulfuric acid gel as electrolyte and separator, the performance of stretchable supercapacitor exhibited an areal capacitance of 33.3 mF cm−2 at scan rate of 10 mV s−1, and can be stretched up to 30% with 2.4% capacitance decay over 500 stretching cycles.
