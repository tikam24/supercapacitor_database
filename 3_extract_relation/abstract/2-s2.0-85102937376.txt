A rational structural design of electrodes with high electron conductivity, sufficient material interfaces/defects and a regulated charge transfer pathway can be applied in broad practical electrochemical application fields. A triple-layered PPy@NiCo LDH/FeCo2O4hybrid with a tri-metal hybrid nanowire and conductive PPy coating layer is fabricatedviaa one-step hydrothermal reaction andin situpolymerization. NiCo LDH/FeCo2O4nanowire arrays with a layered crystalline structure are synthesizedviaanin situdissolution-growth method, where the partially etched nickel foam substrate subsequently acts as the Ni source. The NiCo LDH/FeCo2O4nanowire arrays together with the ultrathin PPy coating layer can form bi-continuous conductive networks, numerous crystalline edges and structural interfaces to increase the electron transfer rate and the active/adsorption sites, which can further promote the energy storage and electrocatalytic activity. The bi-functional PPy@NiFeCo/NF-4 electrode exhibits a high areal capacitance (9.24 F cm−2at 5 mA cm−2) and excellent rate capability (90.5% retention from 5 to 30 mA cm−2) as a supercapacitor and achieves a small overpotential (244 mV at 50 mA cm−2) and Tafel slope (64.39 mV dec−1) as an electrocatalytic OER electrode.
