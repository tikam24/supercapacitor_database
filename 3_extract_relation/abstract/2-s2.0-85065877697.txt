Abstract: A method for synthesizing control laws that allow minimization of the required capacity of an autonomous power supply of an electric drive based on electric accumulators and/or ultracapacitors is proposed for electric drives that implement an designated programmed motion. The control laws allow disconnection from and connection to the power supply line of one of the sections of the driveâ€™s power supply. The reduction in the required supply of energy in the power source is achieved by more completely emptying part of its sections in traffic areas with a lower level of the requested voltage and conserving a high potential for the forthcoming traffic areas in only one section or parts of sections. A mathematical formulation of the problem is presented, and a numerical method for solving it is proposed. An example of imlementation of the proposed method is considered. It is shown that the proposed method enables a significant reduction in the required capacity and, as a consequence, in the dimensions, mass, and costs of autonomous power supplies of electric drives.
