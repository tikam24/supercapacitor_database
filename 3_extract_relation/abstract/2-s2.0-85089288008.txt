Activated carbon (AC) is one of the most promising active materials for high-performance supercapacitors (SCs) owing to its high specific surface area and theoretical specific capacity. In this study, oil palm empty fruit bunches (EFBs), which are agricultural residue, are employed as a precursor to produce AC using a series of cleaning, carbonization, and chemical activation processes. The as-produced AC has a specific surface area of 2774 m2/g, which is very high among AC produced from biomass materials. To enhance the performance of SCs, the AC is modified by nitrogen doping. The specific capacities of AC and nitrogen-doped AC are found to be 182 to 217 F/g, respectively, at a current density of 0.5 A/g in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. We demonstrate that agricultural waste can be processed into AC with a high specific surface area for SC applications.
