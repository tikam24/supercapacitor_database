In this work, we propose the fabrication of N, S co-doped carbon framework with confined CoS2 nanoparticles and rooted carbon nanotubes (NSPCF@CoS2). As LIBs anode, the NSPCF@CoS2 electrode gives an inceptive discharge capacity of 921.5 mA h g−1, with Coulombic efficiency of above 97% during the 200 cycles (except for the previous 5 cycles). As SIBs anode (the applied voltage range is 0.4–3 V), the NSPCF@CoS2 electrode performs a steady and relatively high capacity (over 448.0 mA h g−1) during the 1650 cycles, and an extremely low capacity decay rate of 0.018% per cycle is obtained. Also, the NSPCF@CoS2 electrode shows a high capacity of 545.3 mA h g−1 even at 8 A g−1 (the applied voltage range is 0.1–3 V). This NSPCF@CoS2 electrode shows a comparable or even higher rate performance than many reported transition metal chalcogenides materials, confirming its promising usage. The presence of pseudocapacitive contribution is verified, after the deep investigation on Li+/Na+ storage behavior and reaction kinetics. In addition, this rationally designed structure gives potential application in supercapacitor.
