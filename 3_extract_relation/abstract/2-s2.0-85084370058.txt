This paper describes the power management in DC microgrid system which consists of solar energy system, Wind Energy Conversion System and Composite Energy Storage System. Both the sources are operated in Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) mode to extract maximum energy from the respective sources. The intermittent nature of solar/wind power makes the output power fluctuating. To make it reliably available, a composite energy storage system is used. In the proposed scheme, off-MPPT control and dump load scheme are compared. A simulation study is carried out in MATLAB/Simulink to validate the proposed Power Management Algorithm (PMA).
