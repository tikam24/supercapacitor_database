Hexagonal tungsten oxide (WO3) holds great promise as an electrode material for pseudocapacitors due to its earth abundance, low cost, multiple oxidation states, high packing density (>7 g cm-3) and electrochemical reversibility. Here, we present the development of flexible electrodes consisting of WO3 nanoflowers supported on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) foams. The WO3/g-C3N4 electrodes were prepared via a facile solvothermal approach followed by carbonization. The resulting WO3/g-C3N4 electrodes have demonstrated excellent performance with specific capacitance of 1130 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 and good cyclic stability of 95% after 4,000 cycles in 0.5M H2SO4 electrolyte.
