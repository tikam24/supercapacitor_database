The porous graphene derived from the chemical liquid deposition (CLD) methodology using waste tire pyrolysis oil (WTPO) as carbon precursor possesses the hexagon-like microarchitecture decorated with abundant mesoporous structure, good non-stacking property and excellent amphipathic property. The developed technique provides the strong anti-stacking behavior to graphene as compared to the conventional chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The outstanding lubricating function of WTPO and strong London dispersion force between WTPO and MgO catalyst, devotes to forming the few-layered graphene with non-stacking state. As the electrode for symmetric supercapacitors, CLD-derived graphene (CLDG) not only possesses superior capacitive storage ability over those of graphene derived from CVD and commercial activated carbon under aqueous and organic electrolyte systems, but also presents excellent compatibility to gravimetric and areal capacitances even under the commercial mass loading level (10 mg cmâˆ’2). Besides, Li ion capacitor assembled with CLDG as cathode and anode delivers the satisfactory Ragone performance and ultralong cycle life. Because of the outstanding non-stacking feature and well-developed pore channels, the overall interface of CLDG electrode can be sufficiently accessed by electrolyte ions, contributing to its exceptional capacitive behavior. This work provides a feasible strategy to produce non-stacking porous graphene with high quality in terms of good monodispersion and large specific surface area via the high value-added utilization of WTPO.
