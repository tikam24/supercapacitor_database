Water hyacinth (eichhornia crassipes)has been used as the material to produce carbon and metal oxide composite for supercapacitor electrode. The study focus on the effect of electrode thickness variation: (i) 0,26 mm (ii) 0.28 mm, and (iii) 0.30 mm on the electrode density and specific capacitance of the supercapacitor cell. The composite electrode was labeled as CMWH1, CMWH2, and CMWH3. The density of CMWHs electrode are 0.65 gcm -3 , 0.66 gcm -3 , and 0.70 gcm -3 for CMWH1, CMWH2, and CMWH3 sample respectively. These results show the density is directly proportional to the thickness of the electrode. Electrochemical properties characterization of CMWH electrode was performed using cyclic voltammetry method. The specific capacitance of the CMWH electrode is obtained at 97.64 Fg -1 108.43 Fg -1 , and 96.54 Fg -1 for CMWH 1, CMWH2 and CMWH3. Specific capacitance shows the optimum condition at 0.28 mm thickness. The difference trend of specific capacitance with density influenced by pseudocapacitance material properties that exist CMWH electrode. For addition, the TG Analysis, SEM, EDX, and XRD also included in the study.
