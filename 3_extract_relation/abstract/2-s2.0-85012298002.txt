Low temperature soft chemical synthesis approach is employed towards MoS2 thin film preparation on cost effective stainless steel substrate. 3-D semispherical nano-grain composed surface texture of MoS2 film is observed through FE-SEM technique. Electrochemical supercapacitor performance of MoS2 film is tested from cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) techniques in 1 M aqueous Na2SO4 electrolyte. Specific capacitance (Cs) of 180 Fg−1 with CV cycling stability of 82 % for 1000 cycles is achieved. Equivalent series resistance (Rs) of 1.78 Ωcm−2 observed through Nyquist plot shows usefulness of MoS2 thin film for charge conduction in supercapacitor application.
