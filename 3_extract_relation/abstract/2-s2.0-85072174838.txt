Due to the unique structure of perovskite materials, their capacitance can be improved by introducing oxygen vacancy. In this paper, the LaMnO3-δ material containing oxygen vacancy was synthesized by molten salt method in KNO3[sbnd]NaNO3[sbnd]NaNO2 melt. The La–Mn–O crystal grows gradually in molten salt with the increase of temperature. It was confirmed that LaMnO3-δ with perovskite structure and incomplete oxygen content were synthesized by molten salt method and presented a three-dimensional shape. LaMnO3-δ stores energy by redox reaction and adsorption of OH− in electrolyte simultaneously. In comparison with the stoichiometric LaMnO3 prepared by the sol–gel method, LaMnO3-δ prepared by molten salt method proffered higher capacitance and better performance. The galvanostatic charge–discharge curve showed specific capacitance of 973.5 F/g under current density of 1 A/g in 6 M KOH. The capacitance of LaMnO3-δ was 82.7% under condition of 5 A/g compared with the capacitance at the current of 1A/g, and the specific capacitances of 648.0 and 310.0 F/g were obtained after 2000 and 5000 cycles of galvanostatic charging–discharging, respectively. Molten salt synthesis method is relatively simple and suitable for industrial scale, presenting a promising prospect in the synthesis of perovskite oxide materials.
