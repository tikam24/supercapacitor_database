The research interest on aqueous energy storage system has been inspired because of economical-friendliness and good security. Herein, the Ni(OH)2 nanoflake branch decorated Ni-doped SnS2 nanosheet trunk grown directly on carbon cloth (Ni/SnS2@Ni(OH)2-CC) is constructed successfully by a novel hydrothermal technique. Benefiting from the rich electro-active sites and enlarged interfacial area provided by Ni2+ doping and Ni(OH)2 layers, Ni/SnS2@Ni(OH)2-CC displays outstanding reversible specific capacitance (2090 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1). By utilizing Ni/SnS2@Ni(OH)2-CC as cathode, active carbon as anode, the constructed aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor (106.6% capacitance retention after cycling at 2 A g−1 for 10000 cycles) and all-solid-state supercapacitor (83% capacitance retention after cycling at 1 A g−1 for 500 cycles) can deliver excellent cycling performance. The aqueous rechargeable Ni-Zn battery Ni/SnS2@Ni(OH)2-CC//Zn displays a high capacity of 158.1 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and cycling durability (88.6% capacity retention after cycling at 4 A g−1 for 800 cycles). These encouraging results indicate that Ni/SnS2@Ni(OH)2-CC has great potential as electrode material for aqueous energy storage device applications.
