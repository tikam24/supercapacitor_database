Being one of the most versatile energy carriers, electricity is predicted to dominate the world economy in the later part of the twenty-first century, rivaling fossil fuels (Green and Staffell in Oxford Rev Econ Policy 32:282â€“303, 2016). However, little has been done to bring desired improvements in the effective generation and distribution of electricity. The process of implementation of renewable energy resources and subsequent production of electric energy has been overshadowed by the increased use of coal. Therefore, a radical change at the global level is critical for sustainable growth and environmental safety. Though existing technologies are capable enough to convert renewable resources into electric energy, their intermittency and lack of necessary infrastructural modifications pose major challenges that have to be taken care of. Effective distribution of electricity is as important as its generation, which is why electrical energy storage plays a pivotal role in creating flexible and reliable grid systems.
