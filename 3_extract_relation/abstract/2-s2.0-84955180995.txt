In the paper we extend the ultracapacitor modelling results onto the frequency domain and we concentrate on the ultracpacitor's parameters identification. For the completeness of presentation some basic notions in fractional order calculus are recalled. Then the issue of capacity for the ultracapacitors is shown and discussed. Further, the frequency domain identification of ultracapacitors' models is shown and finally the physical meaning of identified parameter is given.
