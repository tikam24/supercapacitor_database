In this work, transition metal phosphides (TMPs) were reinforced by a solvothermal synthesis method and in situ polymerization in dopamine with one-step phosphating and carbonizing process to form chestnut shell-like N-doped carbon coated NiCoP (NiCoP@N-C) hollow microspheres. Excellent morphologic structure is still reflected in NiCoP@N-C, which is suitable for rapid electron and electrolyte transfer. Benefiting from the excellent structure, the coating of N-doped carbon, and the synergistic effect of Ni and Co, NiCoP@N-C reveals excellent electrochemical properties (high specific capacitance of 1660 F·g−1 (830 C·g−1)at 1 A·g−1). In addition, a NiCoP@N-C//carbonization HKUST-1 (HC) achieves high specific energy of 51.8 Wh·kg−1, ultrahigh specific power of 21.63 kW·kg−1, and excellent cycling stability up to 10000 cycles (a capacitance retention of 96.7%). The results show that the NiCoP@N-C electrode material has a wide application in supercapacitors and other energy storage devices.
