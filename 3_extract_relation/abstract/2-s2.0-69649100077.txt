Self-doped polyaniline (SDPA) nanofibers were deposited on platinum (Pt) electrode by reverse pulse voltammetric (RPV) method and their electrochemical performance was evaluated in an aqueous redox supercapacitor constituted as a two electrode cell in a weak acidic medium. Scanning electron micrographs clearly revealed the formation of nanofiber structures with diameters in range of 60-90 nm under optimum experimental conditions. Different electrochemical methods including galvanostatic charge-discharge (CD) experiments, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were carried out in order to investigate the applicability of the system as a redox supercapacitor. Based on the charge-discharge results obtained, the SDPA represented high specific capacitance, specific power and specific energy values of 480 F g-1, 436 W kg-1 and 9.40 Wh kg-1, respectively, at a current density of 5 mA cm-2. The present study introduces new nanofiber materials for electrochemical redox capacitors with advantages including low cost, long cycle-life and stable at low acidic solutions of pH 3.
