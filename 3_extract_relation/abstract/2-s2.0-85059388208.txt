The extensive use of fossil fuels has resulted into depletion of this valuable resource at an alarming rate. Though the supply of fossil fuel is reducing i.e. generation is reducing but the demand of power is ever increasing. The need of finding alternative energy sources in order to bridge the gap between supply and demand is a must. Moreover the disproportionate distributions of load between peak load and off peak load period have created serious power grid stability issues. Thus a system to solve both these problems is a must. In this paper we have used the vehicle to home infrastructure to solve these problems. In vehicle-to-home (V2H) systems, electric vehicles interact with the home battery as distributed energy storage systems that offer many potential benefits as an energy interface between a vehicle and the grid, the bidirectional converter plays a crucial role in their interaction. A model of the topology is derived, its behavior is analyzed, and its converter design method is developed. In this paper, we have used a super capacitor at home end, which will help to store more energy. Simulation results are employed to verify the design and analysis using MATLAB. The desired results help to determine the suitability of the technology for V2H system.
