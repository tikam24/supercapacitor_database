The electrochemical capability for the charge and energy storage of supercapacitors can be augmented by fabricating the hybrid and binder-free electrodes. In this work, the novel graphene/Co3V2O8 micro-pencils nanohybrids were successfully developed via the one-pot solvothermal method. The interactive effect between graphene and Co3V2O8 was investigated by varying their mass ratios. Benefiting from the peculiar morphology of Co3V2O8 micro-pencils and the homogenous distribution of Co3V2O8 on the graphene sheets, G-4CVO manifested a relatively promising specific capacitance of 528.17 F·g−1 at 0.5 A·g−1 while 80% of the charge storage capability was still retained even after 5000 continuous cycles. G-4CVO also delivered a remarkable energy density of 73 Wh/kg and these advanced electrochemical performances could be explicated by the integration of graphene sheets which shortens the ions and electrons transportation pathway and at the same time acts as a scaffold to alleviate the volume variation during the inter/de-intercalation process.
