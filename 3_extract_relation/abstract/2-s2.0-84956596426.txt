A tough aerogel electrode of manganese oxide and polyaniline was prepared by in situ gelation, freeze-drying, and heat treatment on carbon cloth. The porous structure endows the final aerogel electrode with high electrochemical performance even at high current density and excellent cycling stability. The best of both: A tough aerogel electrode of manganese oxide and polyaniline (PANI) have been prepared by one-pot gelation, freeze-drying, and a final heat treatment on carbon cloth. Relative to the individual components, the electrode exhibited significantly enhanced performance and stability in applications as a supercapacitor (see figure).
