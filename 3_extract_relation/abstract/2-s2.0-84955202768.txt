Reed straw-derived active carbon@graphene (AC@GR) hybrids were prepared by one-step carbonization/activation process using a mixture of reed straw and graphene oxide (GO) as raw materials and ZnCl2 as activation agent. The as-prepared hybrids exhibit high specific surface area in a range of 1971–2497 m2 g−1, abundant porosity, as well as excellent energy storage capability. The symmetric C//C supercapacitor using the hybrid obtained at 700 °C as electrodes demonstrates superior cycling durability, ca. 90 % retention after 6000 cycles at 2 A g−1, and a high energy density of 6.12 Wh kg−1 at a power density of up to 4660 W kg−1 in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. The excellent capacitive performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of AC and GR.
