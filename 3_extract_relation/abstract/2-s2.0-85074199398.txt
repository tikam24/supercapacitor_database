In this work, we have developed a rapid and simple approach for fabrication of graphene-like materials. It consisted of shearing commercial graphite in aqueous solution with the assistance of ultrasonication. The results showed that the graphene-like materials were successfully fabricated with not only similar flake structure of graphene, but also improved conductivity. For the applications of flexible supercapacitors, the as-prepared graphene-like materials showed better specific capacitance than commercial graphite as the working electrode. In addition, the rate capability of the flexible supercapacitor device is 80% and the capacitance retention reaches 90% after 10,000 cycles. The high flexibility of the as-fabricated graphene-like materials gives rise to high flexibility of all-solid-state supercapacitors, and the specific capacitance was not affected by bending state. The as-fabricated supercapacitor further demonstrated that it can drive the resistive pressure sensor and the voltage was stable at a fixed value under different values of pressure.
