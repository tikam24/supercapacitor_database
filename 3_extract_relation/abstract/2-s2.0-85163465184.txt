Most of the applications of biochar are mainly focused on agriculture and environmental sectors. These traditional applications can be achieved by conventional technologies, and usually do not require advanced technology. However, nowadays the use of biochar is getting attention in the field of engineering as highperformance functional material.Many research studies for the development of electric power storage device have been carried out in the field related to material science. The storage of electric energy is one of the key technologies for eco-friendly society (effective use of natural energy, distributed energy system, etc.) for next generation. For the aforesaid reasons, supercapacitor has been one of the hottest topics. At a glance, natural resource such as plants might not be recognized as a suitable raw material for advanced functional industrial material. However, biochar is a suitable material as it is widely used as an electrode of supercapacitor. The biochar derived from plant-based biomass are eco-friendly and cost-effective that contain different types of pores which can be utilized in different applications of supercapacitors. In this chapter, the outline of supercapacitor is explained and recent research papers of supercapacitor prepared from biochar are classified and listed.
