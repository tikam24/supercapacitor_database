Supercapacitors (SCs) have attracted considerable attention due to their outstanding power density and cycling performance. In this work, the amino-rich surface functional groups (–NH– and –N+H-) surface modified Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets (N–Ti3C2Tx-200) are synthesized via the solvothermal method, which is accompanied by the generation of surface titanium atom defects. Moreover, kinetic analysis confirms that the surface amino-rich functional groups are in favor of the rapid hydrogen ions transmission within electrode, leading to an enhancement of capacitive capacitance. Specifically, the flexible N–Ti3C2Tx-200 electrode exhibits a volumetric capacity of 936.0 C cm−3, which is 1.49 times that of the pristine Ti3C2Tx. Further, the modified electrode even can keep a volumetric capacity of 839.7 C cm−3 at 1 V s−1, which is much higher than that of the pristine Ti3C2Tx (277.7 C cm−3). More importantly, the hybrid aqueous proton supercapacitors (HAPSs), constructed by N–Ti3C2Tx-200 anode and copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) cathode, achieve a 2 V wide voltage window and an ultrahigh volumetric energy density of 104.9 Wh L−1 at 0.38 kW L−1. This work offers a basic understanding of the amino-rich surface-modified flexible Ti3C2Tx film electrodes with high volumetric energy density and high-rate performance, providing a strategy to fabricate HAPSs with superior volumetric capacity.
