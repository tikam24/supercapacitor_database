Controllable modulation strategies between one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) structures have been rarely reported for metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Here, 1D, 1D/2D, and 2D Ni-MOFs can be facilely prepared by adjusting the ratio of Ni2+ and the pyromellitic acid linker. A low-dimensional structure can shorten the transmission distance, while MOFs with a high Ni2+ content can supply rich active sites for oxidation-reduction reactions. The 2D structure Ni-MOF with an optimized Ni2+/pyromellitic acid ratio presents a good performance of 1036 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 with a comparable rate performance of 62% at 20 A g-1. The study may offer a facile design to control the structure of MOFs for employing in electrochemical energy storage.
