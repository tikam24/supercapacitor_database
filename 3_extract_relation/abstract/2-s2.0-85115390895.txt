Recent advances in wearable bioelectronics have driven various healthcare applications, such as the monitoring, sensing, and treating of various diseases. However, unsustainable batteries and toxic power solutions hinder their use at the skin interface or in vivo. As a promising power solution, supercapacitors have attracted the attention of researchers. However, there are still several drawbacks, such as the transparency, stretchability, biocompatibility, and flexibility of these materials, when these energy reservoirs are used as power supplies for skin-interfaced electronics. In this work, a novel microfabrication approach for fabricating supercapacitors using anodic aluminum oxide templates is presented. In this work, a large capacitance value of 15.02 mF cmâˆ’2, as well as good transparency, stretchability, and biocompatibility are obtained. Thus, it is verified that the proposed supercapacitors are suitable as skin-interfaced power solutions.
