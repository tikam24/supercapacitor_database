The substantial escalation in both energy consumption and ecological crisis prompts the utilization of conventional pollution-causing energy resources towards a proficient mode of energy production and storage. The most polluting fossil fuel like coal possesses a highly ordered sp2 carbon clusters, that can be easily tailored into graphene derivatives promising for energy-related applications. However, the impact of crystallinity and quality of the precursor coke on the physicochemical characteristics of extracted carbon nanostructures need to be identified. Herein, we have prepared graphite oxide structures (GrO) from high-quality coal, coke via Improved Hummers' method eliminating the need for toxic NaNO3. The inherent defect states own by coke are also of high significance as it performs the role of various photoluminescence emission centers. The sp2 domains and different surface defects promote excitation independent and dependent luminescence substantiating the distinct multi-emission property of GrO. The extent of functionalization during the oxidation process has also significantly affected the thermal stability of the carbogenic structure. The symmetric galvanostatic charge-discharge curves and lower internal resistance present superior stability and fatser ion transport of as-synthesized GrO. A specific capacitance of 193F/g was obtained at 0.2A/g with excellent capacitance retention over 2500 cycles. The versatile attributes of the coke derived GrO validate its realizable optoelectronics and energy storage applications.
