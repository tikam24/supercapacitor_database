In supercapacitor applications, the energy storage capacitance and rate performance of graphene are severely weakened by the restacking of graphene sheets, which is a great challenge to overcome for fully exploring its supercapacitive properties. If one of the current strategies for promoting the ion diffusion of graphene is employed alone, only a limited improvement of supercapacitive performance of graphene can be achieved. Here, we combine three carbon allotropes into an all-carbon structure, and improve the ion diffusion and mitigate graphene restacking using combination of three strategies, including creating in-plane holes, self-assembling into three-dimensional (3D) structure, and adding spacers between graphene sheets. Thus a 3D hybrid-structured ternary-carbon (holey graphene/carbon nanotube/hollow carbon nano-onion, denoted as HG-CNT-HCNO) is synthesized as supercapacitor electrode material through a facile and effective one-step hydrothermal method. The synergistic effect of strategies and the different dimensional carbon allotropes endows the 3D structure with hierarchical porous structure, improved electron/ion transport, and increased energy storage sites. Consequently, the HG-CNT-HCNO exhibits high specific capacitance of 236.5 F g−1, ultrahigh rate capability (capacitance retention of 97.9% as the current density increases from 0.5 to 40 A g−1), and high electrochemical stability. Furthermore, the device with organic electrolyte shows high energy and power densities of 71.3 Wh kg−1 and 7.5 kW kg−1, respectively, demonstrating a high energy storage performance. The ternary-carbon structure may open up a new avenue for electrode performance optimization in the future energy storage systems by involving different dimensional carbon nanomaterials.
