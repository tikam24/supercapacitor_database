Bimetallic carbides have aroused wide attention for energy-storage applications recently. In this work, one-dimensional Fe2MoC/CNFs (Fe2MoC/C nanofibers) are successfully synthesized via a facile electrospinning method for the first time. To obtain the most integrated structure between the Fe2MoC nanoparticles and carbon nanofibers, we explore the optimal heating rate during the carbonization treatment. Fe2MoC/CNFs exhibits an integrated one-dimensional structure under 800 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min. As revealed in the experimental results, Fe2MoC/CNFs possesses a high specific surface area of 196.9 m2/g, a high specific capacitance of 347.8 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g, an excellent rate capability of 91% capacitance retention from 1 A/g to 40 A/g, and shows superior cycling stability with the capacitance retention of about 85.6% and Coulombic efficiency of about 100% after 5000 cycles. An asymmetric supercapacitor coin-cell device using Fe2MoC/CNFs as the positive electrode displays an energy density of 14.5 Wh/kg at a power density of 300 W/kg and an outstanding cycling life of 93% retention after 5000 cycles. The impressive electrochemical performance indicates that the Fe2MoC/CNFs composite is a promising material for efficient supercapacitors.
