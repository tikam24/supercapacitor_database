In order to overcome the contradiction between charging time and full charge for capacitor existing in traditional constant-voltage or constant-current charging strategies, a charging trajectory optimization strategy based on internal resistance compensation is proposed. By appropriately extending constant-current charging time to compensate the influence of internal resistance, the capacitor can be quickly fully charged. This paper first analyzes the principle of supercapacitor charging trajectory optimization, then uses the Matlab to simulate the charging performance of supercapacitor under different conditions, and finally further verifies the feasibility and effectiveness. The results show that this method can be adopted to effectively reduce the charging (23.5%) of ultracapacitors without increasing the charging efficiency (0.2%).
