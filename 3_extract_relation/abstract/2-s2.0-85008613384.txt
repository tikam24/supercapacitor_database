Pure LiMn2O4 samples with high crystallinity (LMO-1# and LMO-2#) were successfully synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method using δ-MnO2 nanoflowers and α-MnO2 nanowires as the precursors. The as-prepared samples were analyzed by XRD, SEM, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), and their capacitive properties were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and galvanostatic charge/discharge test. Two LiMn2O4 samples showed good capacitive behavior in aqueous hybrid supercapacitors. AC//LMO-1# and AC//LMO-2# delivered the initial specific capacitance of 45.4 and 40.7 F g−1 in 1 M Li2SO4 electrolyte at a current density of 200 mA g−1 in the potential range of 0∼1.5 V, respectively. After 1000 cycles, the capacitance retention was 97.6% for AC//LMO-1# and 93.7% for AC//LMO-2#. Obviously, LMO-1# from δ-MnO2 nanoflowers exhibited higher specific capacitance and better cycling performance than LMO-2#, so LMO-1# was more suitable as the positive electrode material in hybrid supercapacitors.
