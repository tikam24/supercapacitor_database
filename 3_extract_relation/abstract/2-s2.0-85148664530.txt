Polyaniline (PANI) is a popular material for making supercapacitor electrodes due to its long-term cycle stability, specific capacitance, conductivity, mechanical robustness, scalability, and viability. All of these characteristics may be improved by introducing new architecture and employing alternative synthetic methods. The current study covers the synthesis and electrochemical performance of the protonated emeraldine salt of a newly architected PANI, which is referred in this article as cotton candy polyaniline (cc-PANI). It was found that the direct current (DC) conductivity and specific capacitance of PANI and cc-PANI electrodes are 1.21 × 10−4 Scm−1, 3.73 × 10−4 Scm−1 and 161.66 Fg-1, 203.33 Fg-1 at a current density of 1Ag-1 in a 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte solution respectively. Further, the static contact angle (CA) was found to be 38.3o and 32.6o for PANI and cc-PANI. Here, a novel designed cc-PANI was effectively synthesised and characterised. This strategy offers new hopes in the realm of PANI with improved supercapacitance qualities.
