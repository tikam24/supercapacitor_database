Two-dimensional hierarchically porous carbon nanosheets obtain tremendous attention as advanced energy storage materials for supercapacitors applications. However, the effective synthesis of carbon materials simultaneously owning ultrathin layered nanosheets and hierarchically porous structure is a big challenge. In this work, we develop an interlayer-confined inorganic/organic coordination synthesis strategy to prepare ultrathin hierarchically porous carbon nanosheets. Iron (III) chloride hexahydrate is deliberately used as a host for intercalated coordination reaction with 2-aminophenol, where the formed inorganic/organic complex is carbonized to obtain ultrathin two-dimensional hierarchically porous carbon nanosheets. The optimized sample exhibits a thickness of 1.8 nm, high in-plane porosity, and a high capacitance of 315 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in 6.0 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. A symmetric supercapacitor based on the carbon nanosheets delivers 17.8 Wh kg−1 and 79.2 Wh kg−1 output in KOH aqueous solution and EMIMBF4 electrolytes, respectively. The outstanding supercapacitor performance of this sample is attributed to a comprehensive effect of ultrathin feature, large specific surface area, well-defined in-plane pores, and elemental N-doping. This work presents a facile strategy to obtain carbon electrode materials with new nanostructure for future energy storage applications.
