Flower-like MoS2 microspheres were successfully synthesized via a facile hydrothermal route followed by annealing treatment using biopolymer (sodium alginate, SA) as an additive. The experimental results indicated that the MoS2 products were of hexagonal phases and had a hierarchical flower-like morphology, which were constructed with MoS2 nanosheets. A probable SA-induced assembly process was presented to account for the formation of the flower-like microspheres. Additionally, as an electrode material for supercapacitor, this MoS2 microsphere delivered a high specific capacitance at a large current density with good cycle ability. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.
