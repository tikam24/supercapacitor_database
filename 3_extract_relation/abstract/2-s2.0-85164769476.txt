This paper presents an initial study of Wireless Power Transfer systems design for Industrial Mobile Robots. Prerequisite for all industrial applications is that it shall be able to perform constantly, whereas currently the Industrial Mobile Robots must stop at fixed location to charge batteries. The time that robots are unutilized therefore should be minimized, to which we propose possible solutions. The designs apply an additional, intermediate energy buffer that increases the maximum applicable current. The proposed systems are split in two categories based on location, the first is a fixed, stationary type and the second is a type of phased array system built-in the plant floor.
