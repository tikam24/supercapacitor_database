In this paper, we present the design and prototype implementation of self-powered Internet of Things (IoT) device based on energy harvesting from a small solar panel of size 63mm x 63mm and 0.36W for remote applications. These IoT devices can be deployed in remote places within the range of a gateway. A complete proof of concept IoT device based on ambient energy harvesting is designed, prototyped and tested with super capacitors and Lithium cells in star topology. Based on the measurements, the IoT device can potentially last for one year with 55 seconds transmission interval with the fully charged 120mAh coin cell battery. On the other hand, a fully charged single 5F supercapacitor lasts for 37 hours with the transmission interval of 55 seconds. The range of the node was measured to be 1.8 km with coded transmissions. The node is equipped with ultra-low power sensors for temperature, humidity and light levels, and several more sensors can easily be integrated.
