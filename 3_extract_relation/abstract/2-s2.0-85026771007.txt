S, N-co-doped porous carbon (SNPC) exhibit potential application in fuel cell, supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) because of synergistic effect of S and N atom. However, SNPC prepared by one-pot method usually features the drawback of low S-content and thereby weakens the synergistic effect both geometrically and electronically. Herein, we reported one facile synthetic approach to prepare high S-content SNPC. In this regard, the introduction of NaH2PO4 into the pyrolysis of S, N-containing precursor is beneficial to confine S atoms in carbon framework. It is found that S-content is 25.05% for SNPPC-700, 12.58% for SNPPC-800, higher than previously reported results. Structural characterizations indicate that NaH2PO4 salt plays an important role. Furthermore, LIBs test shows high S-content SNPPC-800 features the higher capacities of 977.68 mAh g−1 after 50 cycles than those of low S-content SNPC-800 at 100 mA g−1. Moreover, ORR activity measurements show a slight better performance and cycling durability than low S-content SNPC. In addition, the SNPPC-800 also reveals excellent supercapacitor performance with an specific capacitance of 227.5 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, and kept 160.29 F g−1 via the measurement of 6000 cycles at 10 A g−1.
