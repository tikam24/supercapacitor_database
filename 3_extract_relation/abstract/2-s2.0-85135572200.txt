Orthorhombic Nb2O5 (T-Nb2O5), a typical intercalation pseudocapacitor, is favorable for realizing high power and energy density for lithium-ion batteries; furthermore, the 2D layered channels perpendicular to the [001] direction facilitate fast Li+ intercalation in T-Nb2O5. Herein, N-doped T-Nb2O5 microflowers (N-Nb2O5) assembled from highly [001]-oriented nanoflakes are rationally synthesized using NH4F as the nitrogen source and capping agent. It is found that NH4+ can adsorb on the O-terminated (010) plane of T-Nb2O5via N-H⋯O hydrogen bonds, which is highly conducive to the generation of 1D nanorods and the subsequent fusion of the nanorods into highly [001]-oriented nanoflakes. The special growth orientation of the T-Nb2O5 nanoflakes endows them with abundant available Li+ intercalation channels; moreover, the bandgap of N-Nb2O5 is narrowed (∼2.91 eV) owing to the doping of N atoms, and the intrinsic electronic conductivity is improved. Accordingly, the intercalation pseudocapacitive behavior of N-Nb2O5 is notably promoted and N-Nb2O5 exhibits superior Li+ storage properties, including large discharge capacity (214.7 mA h g−1 at 1C), excellent rate capability (203.7 and 174.6 mA h g−1 at 1 and 20C), and superior cyclic stability (150.7 mA h g−1 at 10C after 1000 cycles). In addition, the LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2//N-Nb2O5 full cell delivers outstanding Li+ storage performance, especially in terms of long-term cycling (126.2 mA h g−1 at 10C after 3500 cycles).
