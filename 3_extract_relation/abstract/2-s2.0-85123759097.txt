The rational design of composite electrode and catalyst materials is critical for increasing high energy density and structural stability, electron-hole pair production in supercapacitors, and photocatalytic applications. By employing a simple hydrothermal technique, we were able to produce SnO2, CuS, SnO2@CuS, Tb doped SnO2@CuS, and Y doped SnO2@CuS samples. Various analytical techniques such as PXRD, FTIR, UV, SEM, EDS, and XPS examine the synthesized materials' structural, optical, purity, morphology, and binding energy. The fabricated asymmetric Y doped SnO2@CuS/AC device revealed the energy and power densities of 16.2 W h kg−1 and 740 W kg−1 at a current density of 1 A/g, with outstanding cycle stability of 80.9% retention capacitance after 5000 charge–discharge cycles. Furthermore, when exposed to visible light, the Y doped SnO2@CuS catalyst degrades the methylene blue dye with a maximum degradation efficiency of 97%. All of the above results suggested that the obtained Y doped SnO2@CuS material can be utilized in supercapacitor and photocatalytic applications.
