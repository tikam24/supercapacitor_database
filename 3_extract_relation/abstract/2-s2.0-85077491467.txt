A novel free-standing electrode material of NiS2@Ni–Co–S composite is fabricated on carbon cloth substrate through a facile hydrothermal method followed by electrodeposition and used for supercapacitor. The Ni–Co–S nanosheets wrap NiS2 micro-blocks well and also fill the gaps among the NiS2 micro-blocks, which is conducive not only to electron transfer, but also to provide more electroactive sites. The electrode exhibits specific capacitance of 1454 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g and maintains 1118 F/g at 10 A/g, with 76.9% capacitance retention, suggesting its good rate performance. The NiS2@Ni–Co–S electrode also shows superior cycle stability with capacitance retention of 81.7% after 5000 cycles. The outstanding electrochemical performance of NiS2@Ni–Co–S composite makes it a promising candidate high-performance for energy storage.
