Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is added to TiO2 and TiS2 to develop several hybrid electrode materials, including rGO/TiO2, rGO/TiS2, and rGO/TiO2/TiS2 to enhance the electrochemical performance. SEM/EDX, TEM, XRD, XPS, and Raman techniques are used to study the resulting hybrid electrode materials. The capacitance and cycling capacity of the synthesized rGO/TiO2, rGO/TiS2, and rGO/TiO2/TiS2 electrode materials are assessed using galvanostatic and cyclic voltammetry testing. The rGO/TiO2/TiS2 exhibits higher electrochemical performance (726 mA h/g) at 20 mV/s, among the investigated composites. The rGO/TiO2/TiS2 electrode was found to have R ct value of 20.4 Ω.cm2. These values indicate that the rGO/TiO2/TiS2 has a much lower resistance, which may be the primary cause of the outstanding electrochemical properties of the rGO/TiO2/TiS2. The retention capacity of 97.93% at 1 A/g upto10,000 cycles shows that this rGO/TiO2/TiS2 hybrid electrode also exhibits good cycling stability. The rGO/TiO2/TiS2 composites’ respective energy and power densities are determined to be 682 Wh/kg and 5073 W/kg. Due to the synergistic interaction between TiS2, rGO, and TiO2, the rGO/TiO2/TiS2 hybrid is demonstrated to be a superior anode material in supercapacitors. Therefore, the newly fabricated rGO/TiO2/TiS2 nanocomposite could be used as the potential material for energy storage applications.
