In recent years, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have gained significant attention in the field of supercapacitors due to their unique properties. Different TMDs like MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, WSe2 have been studied in the past few years. In this review we focus on different synthesis approaches and supercapacitive performance of MoS2 based electrodes. Nanocomposites of MoS2 offering various advantages like high electrical conductivity and improved electrochemical performance due to synergistic effects. This review provides the detailed information about the development of MoS2 based nanocomposites (with carbon derivatives, conducting polymers, metal sulfides and other materials) in the field of electrochemical energy storage. Future perspectives and challenges faced by MoS2 electrodes are discussed.
