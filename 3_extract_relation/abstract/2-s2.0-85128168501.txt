Aiming at the problem of economy and reliability caused by the frequent disturbance of the load power in the ship electric propulsion system, a composite energy device based on ultracapacitor and accumulator was proposed. Taking work load changes of a drag suction dredger for example, combine adaptive inertial weight particle swarm optimization and fitness dispersion sorting to perform multi-objective optimization con figuration for the capacity of composite energy. In this paper, through the MATLAB simulation, optimization of capacity is calculated and charge-discharge control strategy of composite energy is analyzed. The results showed that composite energy storage device can effectively improve economy and stability of ship electric propulsion system.
