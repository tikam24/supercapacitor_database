A modest hydrothermal approach is adopted to build NiO/rGO composite devices in this research. The NiO/rGO photo anode exhibits remarkable photo catalytic activity for color removal, demonstrating that methyl orange dye (MO) has quite greater photo catalytic degradation efficiency 50 min 99.9% and compared rGO 90 min 95% alone, respectively. Importantly, the resulting product as conductive materials offers extraordinary electrochemical behavior due to its distinctive arrangement. At a given current density of (0.2 A g−1), a specific capacitance of 192 F g−1 is achievable. Concurrently, the as-constructed NiO/rGO composite device offers superior rate capability, with a capacitance retention rate of 72.1% upon 2000 cycles. It shows that the as-prepared components could be utilized as an effective photocatalyst as well as in energy backup systems.
