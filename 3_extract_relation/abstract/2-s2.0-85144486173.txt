In this study, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) derived Cu2CoSnS4 (CCTS) ternary metal sulfides nanomaterials were successfully synthesized by two simple methods: co-precipitation and solvothermal. Due to the porous characteristics formed by the accumulation of nanosheets on its surface, the material possessed a large specific surface area and more abundant electrochemical active sites. The results manifested that the CCTS expressed a high specific capacitance of 393.5 F g−1 at 0.7 A g−1. Under the change of 0.7–5 A g−1, it exhibited a good rate performance of 79.9% and a superior specific capacitance retention rate of 88.5% after 8000 charge–discharge cycles. From the above results, it can be expected that the CCTS material is a promising electrode material in the practical application of supercapacitors.
