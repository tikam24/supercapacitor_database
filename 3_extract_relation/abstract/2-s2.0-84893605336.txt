The increasing penetration of Distributed Generation systems based on Renewable Energy Sources is introducing new challenges in the current centralized electric grid. Microgrids are one of the most useful and efficient ways to integrate the renewable energy technologies. As the stability of a microgrid is highly sensitive, an energy storage system is essential and it must satisfy two criteria: to have a high storage capacity and to be able to supply fast power variations. In order to satisfy these two constraints, this paper proposes the association of a Vanadium Redox Battery (VRB) and Supercapacitor (SC) bank in a Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS). A Three-level Neutral Point Clamped (3LNPC) Inverter is used as a unique interface between the HESS and the microgrid. The paper focuses on the dynamic modelling and validation of the HESS, the power division and the modulation strategies used with the 3LNPC to mitigate the neutral point voltage unbalance effect.
