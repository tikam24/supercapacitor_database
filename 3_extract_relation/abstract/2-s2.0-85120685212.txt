Peptide-based materials that have diverse structures and functionalities are an important type of biomaterials. In former times, peptide-based nanomaterials with excellent stability were constructed through self-assembly. Compared with individual peptides, peptide-based self-assembly nanomaterials that form well-ordered superstructures possess many advantages such as good thermo- and mechanical stability, semiconductivity, piezoelectricity and optical properties. Moreover, due to their excellent biocompatibility and biological activity, peptide-based self-assembly nanomaterials have been vastly used in different fields. In this review, we provide the advances of peptide-based self-assembly nanostructures, focusing on the driving forces that dominate peptide self-assembly and assembly mechanisms of peptides. After that, we outline the synthesis and properties of peptide-based nanomaterials, followed by the applications of functional peptide nanomaterials. Finally, we provide perspectives on the challenges and future of peptide-based nanomaterials.
