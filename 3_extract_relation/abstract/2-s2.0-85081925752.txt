Nanostructures of binary transition metal oxides are auspicious energy storage materials due to their excellent electrochemical properties and electrical conductivities. Binary MnCo2O4 with nanoparticles and nanocubes morphology were prepared by phenolphthalein assisted hydrothermal and microwave methods. The prepared MnCo2O4 materials were characterised using X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform-infrared, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. Morphology of the prepared materials was studied using scanning electron and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis. Electrochemical studies of the fabricated materials were conducted using three-electrode systems that show high specific capacitance of 1068.5 and 1053.5 F/g at 1 A/g current density for MnCo2O4 NPs and MnCo2O4 NCs, respectively. Rate capability and cycling stability of the materials show more than 50% of capacitance retention at 8 A/g and 90% of capacitance retained at 8 A/g after 2000 cycles.
