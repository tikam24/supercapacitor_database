A facile and highly efficient method for the fabrication of free-standing three-dimensional (3D) composites with different morphologies was designed by the combination of the electrospinning method and hydrothermal reaction. The controlled hierarchical nanoarrays showed excellent electrochemical performance for their potential use as supercapacitor electrodes.
