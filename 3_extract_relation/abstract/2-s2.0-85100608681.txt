A nickel-based metal-organic framework (Ni-MOF) layer was in situ grown on the surface of the sheet MoS2 to synthesize MoS2@Ni-MOF as a precursor. In order to improve the properties of the precursor material, the final MoS2/Ni(OH)2 material was obtained by alkalizing the precursor material. Supercapacitors and electrochemical sensors were prepared by MoS2/Ni(OH)2 composite material. The test indicates that alkaline treatment of Ni-MOF materials is helpful to improve electrochemical performance. MoS2/Ni(OH)2 material used as supercapacitor electrode has a high specific capacitance of 2192 F g−1 and excellent cyclic stability (the capacitance retention rate remains 85.19% after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles). The hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) was assembled with MoS2/Ni(OH)2 as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode. The MoS2/Ni(OH)2//AC HSC device shows an excellent energy density of 50.58 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 800 W·Kg−1. In addition, the MoS2/Ni(OH)2 modified GCE electrode is an excellent electrochemical sensor for the simultaneous determination of hydroquinone (HQ) and catechol (CC). The modified electrode provides wide linear ranges of 1 ∼ 500 and 2 ∼ 400 μM and low detection limits of 0.43 and 0.48 μM for HQ and CC, respectively (S/N=3). The MoS2/Ni(OH)2 material can be applied to supercapacitors and electrochemical sensors, indicating that the material has great potential application value in energy storage and biosensing.
