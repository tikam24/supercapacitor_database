In the present work all -polymer solid state supercapacitors with LiCF3SO3 doped polypyrrole electrodes and P(VDF-HFP)-PMMA based polymer gel electrolyte have been fabricated. The polypyrrole electrodes are irradiated with 160 MeV Ni12+ ions at three different fluences of 5 × 1010, 5 × 1011 and 5 × 1012 ions/cm2. A comparative study has been made between unirradiated and irradiated polypyrrole electrode based supercapacitors. An average capacitance value of about 200 F/gm is obtained for the supercapacitors. Upon successive charging and discharging, the capacitance is found to decrease for supercapacitors with unirradiated electrodes whereas the supercapacitors with SHI irradiated polypyrrole electrodes exhibit almost stable capacitance, though the capacitance value is slightly decreased as compared to that for the supercapacitors with unirradiated electrodes. The charge-discharge studies show a decrease in total charge-discharge time for the supercapacitors with irradiated electrodes. Coulombic efficiency of the order of 90% is obtained for all the supercapacitors. © 2008 IACS.
