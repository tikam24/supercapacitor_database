We have synthesized heat-treated PAN/MoO 2 /MoS 2 (PMOS) ternary structure nanofibers by facile solvothermal approach and in-situ conversion reaction. At discharge current density of 1 A/g, the synthesized hierarchical flexible fibers exhibit high specific capacitance of 439.8 F/g. A lightweight and small asymmetric supercapacitor device based on heat-treated PMOS nanofibers//active carbon (AC) delivers a ultrahigh energy density of 46 Wh/kg at power density of 2246.9 W/kg, and long-term capacity retention of about 98.9% after 2000 cycles. Remarkably, the solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor device could light up a LED belt, and no significant change in the brightness and duration when the device bends into a ring, indicating that the material has perfect flexibility and stability. These encouraging findings indicate that the heat-treated PMOS composite electrodes may have a promising potential application for advanced energy storage devices in modern electronic industries.
