Novel spruce leaf-like copper bismuth oxide (CuBi2O4) microstructured films have been deposited on stainless steel (SS) substrate by using a simple and cost-effective electrodeposition chemical route. The morphology of CuBi2O4 was studied using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) whereas X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra recorded for phase confirmation. The spruce leaf-like architecture composed of nanoparticles was evidenced for the obtained CuBi2O4 material. The supercapacitor performance for prepared CuBi2O4 electrode calcined at 200, 300, 400, 500 °C temperatures were investigated. The cyclic-voltammetry and charge-discharge studies were carried out at different scan rates and current densities respectively. The highest specific capacitance 484 F/g was noted for CuBi2O4 electrode calcined at 500 °C at 10 mV/ s scan rate via cyclic-voltammetry analysis in 1 M NaOH electrolyte. The specific capacitance of 540.9 F/g was estimated from charge-discharge analysis at 10 mA/cm2 current density. The energy density of 146.8 Wh/Kg and power density 1555.5 W/Kg for optimized CuBi2O4 electrode at 10 mA/cm2 current density. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies were also performed. The nanostructured CuBi2O4 material has exhibited supercapacitive properties for energy storage applications.
