Various ecological issues and the current energy crisis motivate the research for proficient energy resources. The majority of the present energy resources are intermittent, and consequently, there is an urgent need for proficient energy storage technologies. Supercapacitors gained tremendous scientific interest owing to their various significant advantages. Electrolyte constitutes one of the most important roles in electrochemical supercapacitors as their chemical and physical properties influence various essential factors like capacitance, power density, rate performance, and cyclic life. It provides ionic conductivity and influences the transfer and balance of charges between cathode and anode. Electrolytes are categorized into various types such as aqueous, solid-state or quasi solid-state and redox-active electrolytes. This review deals with the effect of electrolyte properties on the performance of an electrochemical supercapacitor for building highly efficient supercapacitors for the competitive market of energy storage devices for affordable and clean energy.
