Electrical Motors are best suitable for Defence application as electrical motors are maintenance free, reliable compare to hydraulic motors etc. Electrical motors are also suitable to make all electric systems. Among the various type of motor, Linear Electric Motors (LEM) are preferred choice for translational motion like accelerating an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle to make it fly or accelerating a missile for launching. Among various types of Linear Electric Motors, moving primary and static secondary Double-Sided Linear Induction Motor (DSLIM) is best suitable for few hundred-kilogram payload considering the cost, power, weight, volume, development time etc. In this paper, design verification & validation of DSLIM based Electro-Magnetic Launch System (EMLS) with Ultra-Capacitor based Pulse Power Source (UCPPS) as an input power source is presented for launching a dummy payload of 100 kg. Design optimization and verification is conducted in ANSYS MAXWELL software. Design validation is conducted by testing and trials on realized system hardware.
