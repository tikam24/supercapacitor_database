Fe2O3-C-Ni heterojunction structured composite on foam Ni was successfully prepared by simple and effective hydrothermal reaction. The obtained material had good structural stability and excellent electrical conductivity. This binder-free Fe2O3-C-Ni electrode exhibits typical pseudocapacitance. Specific capacitance of Fe2O3-C-Ni in 1.0 mol L-1 KOH reaches 844.6 F g-1, which is higher than that of Fe2O3-Ni and C-Ni electrodes. For practice application, assembled Fe2O3-C-Ni//AC capacitor exhibits a long-term cycling performance with remains 79.5% capacitance retention within 20000 cycles at 1 A g-1.
