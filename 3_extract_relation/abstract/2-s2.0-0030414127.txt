Chemical Double Layer (CDL) and pseudocapacitor are supercapacitor technologies applied to electric propulsion and electric actuation in terms of energy density, power density, availability and cost. The development of CDL capacitors was brought about by the interface between a conductor and a liquid electrolyte. The key parameters for the double layer as an energy storage media are the value of the dielectric constant with the region in which the charge is stored, the thickness of the layer and the voltage at which the layer fails.
