A novel nanocomposite of CoMnFeO4-MWCNT has been synthesized via green and simple hydrothermal method and the structure characterization has been done through FT-IR, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, EDX, and highresolution transmission electron microscopy analysis in this research. Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge methods are picked as the strategies to compare their supercapacitor behavior. The specific capacitance of about 1310 F g-1 (at 1Ag-1) in 3molL-1 KOH has been recorded for CoMnFeO4-MWCNT nanocomposite when the working voltage is 1.2 V. Moreover, this nanocomposite retains 89% of its initial capacitance after 10 000 charge-discharge cycles. Also, some initial mechanistic studies are performed to achieve a deeper insight into the electrochemical behavior of the nanocomposite implying that the oxidation-reduction process of CoMnFeO4-MWCNT nanocomposite is generally quasi-reversible and diffusion-controlled. From the view of time, coat, and environment, the hydrothermal process ismuch more reliable and beneficial regarding higher performance.
