Nowadays, water pollution and energy crises worldwide force researchers to develop multi-functional and highly efficient nanomaterials. In this scenario, the present work reports a dual-functional La2O3-C60 nanocomposite fabricated by a simple solution method. The grown nanomaterial worked as an efficient photocatalyst and proficient electrode material for supercapacitors. The physical and electrochemical properties were studied by state-of-the-art techniques. XRD, Raman spectroscopy, and FTIR spectroscopy confirmed the formation of the La2O3-C60 nanocomposite with TEM nano-graphs, and EDX mapping exhibits the loading of C60 on La2O3 particles. XPS confirmed the presence of varying oxidation states of La3+/La2+. The electrochemical capacitive properties were tested by CV, EIS, GCD, ECSA, and LSV, which indicated that the La2O3-C60 nanocomposite can be effectively used as an electrode material for durable and efficient supercapacitors. The photocatalytic test using methylene blue (MB) dye revealed the complete photodegradation of the MB dye under UV light irradiation after 30 min by a La2O3-C60 catalyst with a reusability up to 7 cycles. The lower energy bandgap, presence of deep-level emissions, and lower recombination rate of photoinduced charge carriers in the La2O3-C60 nanocomposite than those of bare La2O3 are responsible for enhanced photocatalytic activity with low-power UV irradiation. The fabrication of multi-functional and highly efficient electrode materials and photocatalysts such as La2O3-C60 nanocomposites is beneficial for the energy industry and environmental remediation applications.
