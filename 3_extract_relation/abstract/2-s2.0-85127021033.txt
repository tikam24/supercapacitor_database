Two-dimensional (2D) 1T-MoS2 with high conductivity and large layer spacing is considered as a superior electrode material for supercapacitors. However, the easy agglomeration and thermodynamical metastability characteristics of 1T-MoS2 nanosheets restrict its electrochemical performance and wide application. It is a challenge to obtain highly stable and uniformly dispersed 1T-MoS2 nanosheets by a simple method. Herein, a high-stability 1T-MoS2 induced by W doping is obtained, which uniformly grows in situ on the surface of a 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene template, by a one-pot hydrothermal synthesis. The microstrain introduced by accurately controlling W doping (29 at%) induces the phase transformation of 1T-MoS2, and the appropriate amount of Ti3C2Tx MXene provides an exact space for the uniform growth of 1T-MoS2, resulting in a well-matched 1T-Mo0.71W0.29S2/Ti3C2Tx MXene heterostructure. The components of the above heterostructure take full advantage to their properties and help each other to achieve high structural stability and outstanding electrochemical performance as electrodes in a neutral electrolyte Na2SO4. Furthermore, the symmetrical devices fabricated with the well-matched 1T-Mo0.71W0.29S2/Ti3C2Tx heterostructure not only show high power and energy density but also outstanding flexibility and cycle stability. This study provides a simple method to achieve anti-aggregation and high-stability 1T-MoS2, and moreover, a new idea of using multiple methods at once for constructing high-performance 1T-MoS2-based electrode materials.
