Uniform discrete nitrogen-doped double-shelled cage-like hollow carbon spheres (DCHCSs) with direct large mesopores on both shells were successfully synthesized for the first time by using cross-linked polystyrene spheres and silica particles as a dual template and dopamine as the source of both carbon and nitrogen. These DCHCSs exhibited high specific capacitance values of 229.3 and 160 F g−1 at 1 and 10 A g−1, respectively, with excellent rate capability and cycling stability.
