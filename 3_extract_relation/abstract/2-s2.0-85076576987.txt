In this article, a novel supercapacitor electrode of pistil-like MnCo2O4.5@PANI nanorods supported by nickel foam with enhanced specific capacitance and cycle performance is fabricated through a facile method. Benefiting from the excellent electrical conductivity of the shell material PANI and the short ion transport path and high specific surface area of the MnCo2O4.5 nanorods, the electrode made of MnCo2O4.5@PANI exhibits a large specific capacitance of 1098 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. In addition, the MnCo2O4.5@PANI electrode also displays a superior cycling stability with 83.2% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at a high charge/discharge current density of 10 A g−1 and an excellent rate performance of 61.45% at 10 A g−1. These results demonstrate that the prepared MnCo2O4.5@PANI composite electrode material has a great potential for advanced energy conversion and storage equipment.
