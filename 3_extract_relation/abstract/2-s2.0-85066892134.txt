Achieving high voltage and safety simultaneously in energy storage devices can greatly advance the development of flexible and wearable electronics. Thus, flexible aqueous asymmetric lithium-ion supercapacitors with a high voltage attract the interest of many researchers. Herein, a new flexible aqueous asymmetric lithium-ion supercapacitor with a high voltage and superior safety is fabricated using manganese oxide and iron hydroxide, which are electrodeposited on carbon cloths as electrodes and a super-concentrated gel polymer as the electrolyte. Impressively, the flexible asymmetric lithium-ion supercapacitor delivers a high voltage of 3.2 V, which is a high value in aqueous asymmetric supercapacitors. Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits a specific capacitance of 227.6 F g−1, a maximum energy density of 49.3 Wh kg−1, and a maximum power density of 11.5 kW kg−1, together with a capacitance retention of 82% after 1000 cycles at a current density of 2 A g−1. Importantly, the supercapacitor can keep good electrochemical performance under extremely harsh conditions, such as compressing, hammering, punching, and tailoring, which demonstrates superior safety.
