Based on the mixed ligand system of tetrafluoroterephthalic acid (H 2 tfbdc) and 1,4-bis((1H-imidazol-1-yl)methyl)benzene (1,4-bimb), two isostructural metal-organic frameworks viz. [Co(tfbdc)(1,4-bimb)(H 2 O) 2 ] n (1) and [Ni(tfbdc)(1,4-bimb)(H 2 O) 2 ] n (2) have been synthesized by solvothermal method and characterized. Complexes 1–2 revealed three-dimensional (3D) 3-fold interpenetrating diamond frameworks. Due to the existence of fluorine-donor sites in the network, complexes 1–2 exhibited selective adsorption towards Congo red (CR) than methyl orange (MO), methyl blue (MB), rhodamine B (RhB) and methylene blue (MLB). Moreover, complexes 1–2 can be used as the electrode material for supercapacitor, and a high rate performance was observed for 1 (it retains 71.21% of its initial capacitance up to a high current density of 10 A g −1 ).
