Ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) materials have been successfully synthesized by self-assembly. The triblock copolymer F127, resorcinol and formaldehyde were employed as structure-directing agents for self-assembly of the carbon precursors. XRD, TEM and nitrogen adsorption isotherms at low temperature (77 K) were used to characterize the structure of the OMCs. The BET specific surface area and micropore volume of the material OMC-3 were 770 m2/g and 0.65 cm3/g respectively. The OMC materials were used as electrodes to fabricate supercapacitors. The electrochemical double-layer capacitance of the OMC electrodes was investigated using the constant current cycling (CCC) method. The electrochemical measurements showed that the OMC materials exhibit high efficiency and good electrochemical behavior as electrode materials. The specific capacitance of the supercapacitor with OMC-3 electrodes was 130 F/g at a current load of 0.02 A/g, and more than 99% of the electrical capacity was retained after 100 charge-discharge cycles.
