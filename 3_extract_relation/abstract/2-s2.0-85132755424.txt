In this paper, a novel structured carbon fiber/graphene/bacterial cellulose/polyaniline composite with high capacitive performance was fabricated. Graphene and carbon fiber modified with oxygen plasma formed a two-stage conductive network in composite supplying more pathways for charge carrier, thus improving charge carrier transfer performance. Oxygen plasma improved the hydrophilicity as well as produced more active sites on the surface of carbon fiber and graphene, leading to a higher PANI loading amount. The as-prepared composite presented high PANI loading amount of 6.95 mg/cm2 and areal capacitance of 5.44F/cm2 at the current density of 5 mA/cm2.
