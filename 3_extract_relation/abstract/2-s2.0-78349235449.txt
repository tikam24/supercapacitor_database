In this paper, an innovative control strategy for hybrid power sources dedicated to automotive applications is detailed. First, an analysis of classical hybrid architectures using fuel cell (FC)/supercapacitors is presented. Then, an analysis of load requirements for automotive applications is proposed. A new control strategy of a single converter, based on a cascaded control loop with a decoupling strategy in the frequency domain, is fully explained. Finally, experimental results on a Ballard proton exchange membrane FC are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Â© 2010 IEEE.
