Micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) are recognized as potential power supply units for on-chip micro-devices because they possess not only the advantages of supercapacitors but also the simplified packaging processes and compatibility with integrated circuits. Laser direct writing technique has been demonstrated as an effective tool for the fabrication of micro-supercapacitors and electronic devices using different materials. However, the high-performance micro-supercapacitors and the integration with electronic devices even the portable or wearable self-powered systems fabricated by the laser direct writing technique or in combination with other techniques still need to be demonstrated. In this paper, we will introduce our recent studies on the following several parts: the preparation of carbon-based micro-supercapacitors by laser direct writing on polyimide films in air, the improvement of the carbon MSC by laser direct writing in Ar, the carbon/TiO2 MSC with photo-rechargeable capability, the carbon/Au MSC with high-rate charge-discharge performance, and the in-plane integrated circuits with MSCs and sensors using the laser direct writing technique combining with other methods.
