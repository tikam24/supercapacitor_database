According to the electrical network stability, this study was interested in Micro-Grid (MG) which can be operate in grid-connected mode and standalone mode. The MG is composed by wind generator and battery/Supercapacitor hybrid storage system and is related with RL load. The purpose of this work is to investigate a decentralized control based on Fuzzy Droop Control (FDC) method. The objective of this control is to improve simultaneous the grid frequency and voltage and make them in optimum margins by export on import active and reactive powers exchanged with grid assuring its stability. The robustness of the proposed FDC is validated by its effect on the grid frequency and voltage variations after regulation compared with the performance of conventional droop control. According to the simulation results, it is remarkable that the levels of the voltage and frequency of the grid are well minimized and become in optimum zones.
