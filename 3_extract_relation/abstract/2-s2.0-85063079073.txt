Abstract: In this study, porous carbon films with a high specific surface area and excellent electrical conductivity were prepared from cheap cellulose non-woven fabrics (CNWFs) for high-performance supercapacitors. CNWFs were stabilized under the optimized conditions and then carbonized at various temperatures under inert atmosphere, resulting in carbonized CNWFs (C-CNWFs) with a high specific area without any activation process and a low surface resistance. The specific surface area and electrochemical properties of the C-CNWFs were found to be strongly dependent on the carbonization temperature. In particular, the C-CNWFs prepared at 1000 °C showed superior electrochemical performance in a KOH aqueous electrolyte, including a high specific capacitance of ~ 240 F g −1 at a current density of 1 A g −1 , and a good capacitance retention of 99.7%. This excellent performance demonstrates the potential for the application of C-CNWFs as an electrode material in high-performance supercapacitors.
