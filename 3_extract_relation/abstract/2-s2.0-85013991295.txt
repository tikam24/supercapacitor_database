Autonomous hybrid power systems are attractive research questions that deliver electricity to isolated consumers without being connected to the power grid. The deployment of autonomous hybrid power systems is considered as an option to improve energy security. For this reason, the main objective is to ensure the efficient production of electricity without interruption. To achieve this goal, we have proposed an accurate simulation system in which a solar energy component serves as a primary load supply, and an energy recovery component is based on a fuel cell. A long-term energy storage component comprises a water electrolyzer which is considered a primary storage and an ultracapacitor storage component deployed as a short-term storage of energy. To achieve the correct system operation, a new schema approach for intelligent energy management based on a multi-agent system is developed and discussed. The main task is to define the architecture of the multi-agent system and to define the functions of all the agents according to the characteristics of the energy needs and the production costs. Thus, in order to prove the reliability and effectiveness of the applied control strategy and its impact on the operation of the system, the proposed system is simulated using the Matlab/Simulink environment by referring to an extracted experimental database of the Tunisian Meteorological Service.
