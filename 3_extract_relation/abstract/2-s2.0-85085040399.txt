The porous activated carbon material was prepared using hemp straw as the biomass carbon source, which was used as the substrate material to synthesize Fe2O3/porous carbon nanocomposites (Fe2O3/HAC) by simple and effective hydrothermal method. The results show that the porous activated carbon based on hemp straw is an ideal substrate for Fe2O3, which can effectively avoid the agglomeration of metal oxides, increase the contact area with electrolyte, and shorten the ion diffusion path, so as to improve the electrochemical performance of the material. In three-electrode system, the electrochemical performance of Fe2O3/HAC is much higher than that of HAC and Fe2O3 alone. At the current density of 1 A g−1, its specific capacitance is 256 F g−1, and it has the best capacity retention. The symmetrical device composed of the material has a good capacitance value and excellent cycle stability.
