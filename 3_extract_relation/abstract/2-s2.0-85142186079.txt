Flexible supercapacitors have immense promise for powering wearable electronics, but they are constrained by a lack of efficient preparation methods and low energy density. Herein, reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/Fe2O3 composite was synthesized for the active material of screen-printing functional inks via a simple hydrothermal method, which possesses a high specific capacitance of 703.91 F g−1 (527.93 C g−1) at 1 A g−1. The rGO/Fe2O3-based functional inks with excellent dispersibility and printability were formulated in ethyl cellulose (EC)-ethanol system. The fabrication of performance-controlled screen-printed electrodes was achieved by overprinting for the first time. Furthermore, the integratable and pattern-customizable all-printed flexible supercapacitors (FSCs) are fabricated by using rGO/Fe2O3-based printed electrodes with different printed layers. The as-prepared rGO/Fe2O3-based FSCs deliver remarkable areal capacitances of 27.12–119.37 mF cm−2 at 0.1 mA cm−2 and significant energy densities of 2.4–10.6 μWh cm−2 at a power density of 0.04 mW cm−2. In addition, rGO/Fe2O3-based device exhibits exceptional flexibility with no performance degradation after 200 cycles of bending. The directly screen-printed integrated rGO/Fe2O3-based printed FSC array provides a stable energy supply to the thermometer, which has promising application prospects in the field of wearable energy storage.
