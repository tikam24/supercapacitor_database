Redox-active liquid or polymer-based aqueous electrolytes are widely reported in carbon-based supercapacitors, enhancing their performance substantially due to the involvement of fast redox reaction(s) at the electrode–electrolyte interface. Here, a nonaqueous, ionic liquid (IL)-based redox-active gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) as a potential supercapacitor electrolyte is demonstrated. This electrolyte, comprising IL 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide added with redox agent NaI, immobilized in poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene), offers excellent thermal, mechanical, and electrochemical stability with high ionic conductivity of ≈3.81 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature. The redox-additive NaI not only increases the ionic conductivity of electrolyte but also introduces redox behavior at the interfaces of porous activated carbon supercapacitor resulting in high specific capacitance (≈334 F g−1) and high specific energy and power (≈26.1 and ≈18 kw kg−1, respectively). The capacitor with redox-active nonaqueous GPE offers stable performance up to 10 000 charge–discharge cycles with ≈5% initial fading only. This study opens a novel approach to prepare highly stable redox-active GPEs for high-performance supercapacitors.
