The increasing demand for energy storage devices has propelled research for developing efficient super-capacitors (SC) with long cycle life and ultrahigh energy density. Carbon-based materials are commonly used as electrode materials for SC. Herein, we report a new approach to improve the SC performance utilizing a Porous Carbon/Cerium Oxide nanoparticle (PC-CON) hybrid as electrode material synthesized via a low temperature hydrothermal method. Through this approach, charges can be stored not only via electrochemical double layer capacitance (EDLC) from PC but also through pseudo-capacitive effect from CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs). The electrode-electrolyte interaction due to the electrochemical properties of the electrolyte provides an enhanced voltage window for the SC. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) measurements were used for the characterization of this PC/CeO2 hybrid material system. The testing results have shown that a maximum of 500% higher specific capacitance could be obtained using PC/CeO2 instead of using PC only.
