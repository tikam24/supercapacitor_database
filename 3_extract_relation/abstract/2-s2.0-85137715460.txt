Supercapacitors (SCs) are widely used as energy storage devices in many practical applications of wireless power transfer. However, the modeling and analysis of a wireless power transfer system are seldom based on SC load; thus, the effects of the charging process on the wireless power transfer system cannot be analyzed clearly. In this paper, a variable-resistance-based method is proposed for the modeling and analysis of the process of constant current charging. First, how to make an SC equivalent in variable resistance is described, and the relationship between SC and variable resistance is considered. Next, the charging process, including charging current, voltage, power and transfer efficiency, is analyzed in detail. Furthermore, the effects of transmitting side voltage and frequency offset on this system are studied, and the optimal design method for an SC-load WPT system is provided on a preliminary basis. Finally, the theoretical derivation and analysis are verified by means of simulations and experiments.
