Feasibility of a two-step approach amenable to continuous synthesis of binderless electrode was demonstrated using Co-Mn composite oxide. The combined electroless-electrolytic technique produced Co-Mn oxide whose performance as catalyst for Li-Air battery yielded high initial capacity up to 2000 mA h g -1 at 5.25 A g-1 and good capacity retention during cycling. The synthesized composite oxide exhibited specific capacitance value of 460 F g-1 at 20 mVs-1 with excellent capacitance retention as supercapacitor electrode material. Â© The Electrochemical Society.
