The preparation of dual-function nanomaterial electrode can meet the requirements of supercapacitor energy storage and the hydrogen emission reaction (HER), which makes the integrated design of energy reserves and hydrogen evolution possible. In this article, a two-step hydrothermal way that was consolidated with a continuous annealing process was used to build a graded mesoporous ZnCoMo@MoS2 nanocomposite electrode on the nickel foam framework. The entire surface of uniform ZnCoMo nanorods is tightly wrapped by MoS2 nanosheet arrays to form core-shell nanostructured electrodes, exposing the entire electrode's large specific surface area. Among them, oxide ZnCoMo is metalled by zinc cobalt molybdenum hybrid for short. The core-sheath nanostructure of the composite ZnCoMo@MoS2 It has high specific capacitance. The maximum accurate capacitance of this method is 1005.3 F gâˆ’1 (current density is 10mA/cm2). Under the condition of 50 mA/cm2, after 3000 cycles of discharge tests and charge, the capacity remains at 87.9% and the cycle stability is good. In addition, ZnCoMo@MoS2 nanocomposite electrode's overpotential is 125 mV at 10 mA/cm2 for hydrogen development in alkaline electrolyte and it has good stability. Lower overpotential and the larger specific capacitance are imputed to the synergistic result of MoS2 nanocomposites and ZnCoMo mainly. The results show that ZnCoMo@MoS2 core-shell heterostructure has high energy storage density and good hydrogen evolution performance, which provides a promising multi-functional active material for energy storage and hydrogen evolution.
