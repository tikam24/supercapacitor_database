Electrochemical cyclic recharging of a binder-free flexible carbon material in respect to supercapacitor applications is reported. To provide high enough and stable pseudocapacitance, the surface of carbon nanotube cloth (CNTC) was exposed to dry oxidative functionalization by annealing in air at 460 °C. We report the effect of annealing time (0.5–3 h) on capacitance, electrical resistivity and specific surface area. CNTC annealed for 1 h demonstrated the best results: the capacitance of ca. 42 F g−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4 (slightly decreasing with a scan rate up to 1000 mV s−1) and specific resistivity of 20 µΩ m. For CNTC demonstrating these characteristics, the specific surface area was 342 m2 g−1, comprising almost from mesopores. Capacitance retention of 99.1% during 30,000 recharging cycles was observed. Finally, a flexible symmetric supercapacitor operating at 1 V was assembled from the freestanding (unsupported) CNTC electrodes to test their performance in a device prototype. Coulombic efficiency was close to 100% at high enough current densities. Our observations allow to consider air-oxidized CNTC as a promising electrode material for flexible supercapacitors.
