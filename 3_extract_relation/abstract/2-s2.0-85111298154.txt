In this endeavor, cobalt molybdate dihydrate materials were synthesized by CTAB assisted hydrothermal method and this material was utilized as electrode materials for supercapacitor application. X-ray diffraction analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic and Raman spectral analyses confirmed the formation of cobalt molybdate dihydrate materials. CTAB was used to tune the morphological features of the cobalt molybdate dihydrate materials. The nanorod arrays (COM-4 material) were formed when a high concentration of CTAB template was used during the synthesis. The supercapacitor features of the prepared materials were characterized using cyclic voltammetric (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) analysis in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The CV curves confirm the pseudocapacitive nature and provide the specific capacitance of 768 Fg−1 at a scan rate of 5 mVs−1 whereas the GCD curves offer the specific capacitance of 796 Fg−1 at a current density of 1 Ag−1. The stability test established the capacitance retention of about 95% after 2000 continuous CV cycles at a scan rate of 100 mVs−1. These findings suggested the significant usage of cobalt molybdate dihydrate materials in energy storage devices.
