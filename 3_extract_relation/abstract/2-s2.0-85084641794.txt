Here, we explore the possibility of employing proportional-integral passivity-based control (PI-PBC) to support active and reactive power in alternating current (AC) distribution networks by using a supercapacitor energy storage system. A direct power control approach is proposed by taking advantage of the Park's reference frame transform direct and quadrature currents (id and iq) into active and reactive powers (p and q). Based on the open-loop Hamiltonian model of the system, we propose a closed-loop PI-PBC controller that takes advantage of Lyapunov's stability to design a global tracking controller. Numerical simulations in MATLAB/Simulink demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed controller, especially for parametric uncertainties.
