Abstract: The synthesis of new carbonaceous electrode materials for supercapacitors and the discovery of efficient techniques for the CaC2 activation are meaningful subjects. In this study, unique alkynyl carbon materials (ACMs) were effectively synthesized through solvent-free mechanochemical reactions of CaC2 with C2Cl6 or C6Br6. Their components and structure were comprehensively characterized, and their supercapacitor performances were examined in detail. The mechanochemistry has proved to be an efficient and targeted technique for the reactive activation of CaC2. The sp-C dominated ACMs feature interconnected framework with hierarchical pores, tunable structures, and low cost of raw materials. As electrodes for supercapacitors, the ACMs exhibit high specific capacitances in the range of 48.4–132.4 F g−1 with excellent electrical conductivities and outstanding cycling stabilities. This work provides an efficient, green, and cost-effective strategy for the synthesis of ACMs from wildly available precursors, and a significant assistance for the renaissance of CaC2 chemistry.
