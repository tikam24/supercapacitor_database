In recent years, there has been much focus on how the structure and morphology of CoMn2O4 materials influence their electrochemical performance. Herein we introduce a KOH-surfactant agent to form a hexagonal like-CoMn2O4 via hydrothermal. The X-ray Rietveld refinement evidenced that spinel CoMn2O4 with the tetragonal structured I 41/amd phase. Further, the chemical environment of this phase is identified using various techniques. Surface morphology studies revealed hexagonal-like features. Owing to its features, the material delivers an excellent capacitance of 638.8 F/g. CoMn2O4 also shows attained columbic efficiency of 81% and retains a capacitance of 85% after 4000 charge-discharge cycles. The excellent cyclic stability and high performance are achieved due to the more active sites and convenient electronic transference route for the ions through an electrochemical process. The symmetrical two-electrode assembly has also been fabricated. Hence, we believed that the surfactant-KOH mediated hexagonal-like-CoMn2O4 material should enhance the supercapacitor properties.
