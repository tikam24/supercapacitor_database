In this study, pristine graphene/silver/molybdenum disulphide (G/Ag/MoS2) and reduced graphene oxide/silver/molybdenum disulphide (rGO/Ag/MoS2) composites materials were prepared via green solvothermal synthesis method and evaluated as supercapacitor electrodes. The morphology and structure of composites were examined by using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy. SEM and TEM indicate successful reduction of silver nitrate (AgNO3) to spherical Ag nanoparticles (NPs) by sodium citrate. The Ag NPs were observed to be evenly deposited on sheets of rGO and MoS2. From the XPS analysis, the spherical Ag NPs exist in zero-valent state, reflecting successful reduction. Based on cyclic voltammetry (CV) performed under 50 mV/s scan rate, G/Ag/MoS2 ternary composite exhibits the highest specific capacitance of 56.38 F/g which is 31 % and 29 % enhancement in specific capacitance of rGO/Ag/MoS2 ternary composite and Ag/MoS2 binary composite, respectively. It is believed that the presence of graphene may provide conductive pathway and a larger surface area for the distribution of Ag NPs.
