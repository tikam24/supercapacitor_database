Hybrid structured electrode materials for supercapacitors have attracted enormous interest. However, the rational design of electrode materials with high conductivity and energy density is still a challenge for energy storage devices. Herein, ZnCo2O4@Ni-Co-S composites are prepared through a simple electrochemical process. Due to the high structural stability, the products show excellent specific capacitance. Furthermore, the device delivers an energy density of 53.1 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 3375 W kg-1 and demonstrates excellent cycle stability.
