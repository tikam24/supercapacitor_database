Newly three-dimensional (3-D) graphene-like carbon nanosheet network is synthesized by a simple and efficient buried-protection KOH activation technology with a surfactant (Tween-20) as carbon source (molecular precursor). The as-synthesized material possesses favorable three-dimensional network structure and hierarchical porous structure (with a specific surface area of 2017.3 m2 g−1). As a promising supercapacitor electrode, a relatively high specific capacitance of 316.8 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 in 1 mol L−1 KOH aqueous solution, along with good cycling stability (with a 92.5% retention rate after 2000 cycles) are demonstrated for the as-prepared electrode. The 3-D graphene-like carbon nanosheet network material exhibits ideal capacitive behavior indicating a promising electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.
