Energy harvesting with its ubiquitous availability is intensively investigated to extend the wireless sensor nodes lifetime. While the harvested power is often less than 1 mW, the commercial-off-the-shelf power management circuits designed for conventional battery applications operate in much higher power. A designated power management module for sub-mW energy harvester is proposed in this article to increase the energy conversion efficiency and extend the energy storage lifetime for small input power. The proposed module consists of discrete component-based pulse-width modulation (PWM) controlled synchronous boost converter structured impedance matching circuit and supercapacitor/micro- battery hybrid energy storage. The synchronous boost converter-based power management circuit achieves 79% conversion efficiency at the input power of 0.5 mW. The power loss during the energy conversion is significantly reduced and thus allows wireless sensor nodes to be powered from a minimum of 120 Lux fluorescent light with a photovoltaic cell smaller than a credit card. The supercapacitor/micro-battery energy storage provides lifetime of more than 73 h when no external energy is available. The experimental results with 25 energy harvester-powered wireless sensor nodes demonstrate that the practical ultra-low-power design makes sub-1-mW energy harvester power management applicable.
