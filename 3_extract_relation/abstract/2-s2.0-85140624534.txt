Aqueous supercapacitors have gained recent attention as a green energy storage option thanks to their low cost and high safety. However, to date, commercial applications of aqueous supercapacitors have not been realized. To this end, we try to promote the innovation in aqueous supercapacitors with copious V2O5. Admittedly, V2O5 materials are subject to poor energy storage performance, and thus remain second-tier candidates for supercapacitors. Herein, originating from alkylamine intercalation between V2O5 interlayer, a VOx with substantial deep-implanted oxygen vacancies within molecular interlayers is synthesized. The optimization of charge storage kinetics by the oxygen vacancies ensures a desirable specific capacitance of 1301F g−1 at 1 A/g, and even the initial specific capacitance of 81 % is retained at 10 A/g. Moreover, the long-cycle durability of 60,000 cycles without obvious attenuation is further guaranteed, which, to our knowledge, is superior to that of most reports. Further, an industrialized technique was applied to encapsulate the modular pouch device. As a verification, we demonstrate a modular pouch device with an energy density of 66.1 Wh kg−1 at 100.5 W kg−1 that can effectively withstand severe external stimuli during operation, really transferring the risk for the user. The arbitrary combination also practices the feasibility of the modular pouch device as a stand-by power supply for 3C products such as tablets and smartphones. We firmly believe that this innovative strategy will provide new impetus for the revolution of aqueous pouch supercapacitors.
