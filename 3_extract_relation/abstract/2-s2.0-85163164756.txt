The global demand for fulfilling human desires requires an immense amount of energy, and the impact on energy storage equipment is significant to guarantee a consistent energy supply. This research reports on the electrochemical characterization of ZnSe/CdO nanocomposite as supercapacitor electrodes via hydrothermal technique. The material is then characterized by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analysis (BET), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and Raman spectroscopy to study the structure, morphology, surface area, functional group confirmation and composition. All the electrochemical performances were by using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The specific capacitance (Cs) of the ZnSe/CdO nanocomposite is found to be 1006.8 Fg−1 at a current density of 1 Ag−1, with an energy density of 91.45 Wh kg−1 and a retention rate of 92 % after 40 h of continuous use. These results demonstrate the potential of ZnSe/CdO nanocomposite as a high-performance supercapacitor material, highlighting the hydrothermal method's viability for its synthesis.
