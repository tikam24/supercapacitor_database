In this study, MnCo2O4 nanosheets were proposed to be utilized as an electrode material for supercapacitors. A two-step hydrothermal method with post-annealing treatment was employed in preparation of the nanostructures. MnCo2O4 electrode delivered a high specific capacitance of 2000 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, remarkable high-rate capability of 1150 F g−1 at 20 A g−1, and an excellent cycling stability of 92.3% at 5 A g−1 after 5000 cycles. It is found that a three-electrode supercapacitor based on MnCo2O4 exhibits a promising electrochemical performance, better than the other similar materials, benefited from the synergistic effects of MnCo2O4 nanosheets. In fact, the self-assembly of nanosheets structure with high specific surface area and mesoporous structure can potentially enhance the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors.
