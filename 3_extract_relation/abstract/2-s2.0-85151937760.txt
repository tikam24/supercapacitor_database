Tiny autonomous systems less than 1 mm across need small energy storage to satisfy the demand for temporary pulse power and consistent power supply. A battery or supercapacitor alone cannot meet both requirements. Integration of battery and supercapacitor is an alternative, but it introduces a device (supercapacitor) that is not frequently invoked but requires substantial space. Herein, a submillimeter (0.42 mm2) high-power supercapacitor with an additional function, namely, an on-chip integrated probe for biomolecule detection is created. The dual-function device is directly used in the liquid electrolyte, and its Swiss-roll geometry allows for operation in a minimum 12-nL electrolyte. The micro-Swiss-roll supercapacitor delivers a power density of 911 mW cm−2 and displays a 98% capacitance retention over 10 000 cycles. The biomolecule probe achieves a sensitivity of 230–262 µA mm−1 with a limit of detection of 0.4–0.5 × 10−3 m for the proof-of-concept target, the neurotransmitter dopamine. The biomolecule probe achieves a 230–262 µA mm−1 sensitivity with a limit of detection of 0.4–0.5 × 10−3 m for the proof-of-concept target, the neurotransmitter dopamine, along with selectivity in the presence of ascorbic acid. The independent dual function provides a promising route toward the full-time use of dust-sized supercapacitors integrated into submillimeter functional systems.
