Herein, we have synthesized tin sulfide nanoparticles homogenously dispersed onto graphene sheets by simple hydrothermal method. The crystal structure and morphological of the prepared materials were confirmed by X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The electrochemical performances of the prepared materials were assessed by cyclic voltametrry. Electrochemical measurements demonstrated that the composite materials exhibit pseudocapacitor nature with the maximum specific capacitance (1398.93F/g) and outanstating cyclic stability with a capacitance retention ratio of 94.37% after 1000 cycles. Interestingly, the nanocomposite material performances have been improved in comparison to the pure tin sulfide due to the synergistic effects of SnS decorated graphene sheets. Furthermore, the composite materials provide more active sites which will be beneficial for high surface area and high electron conductivity. The outstanding performances of the composites indicates that the appreciable electroactive materials for supercapacitor applications.
