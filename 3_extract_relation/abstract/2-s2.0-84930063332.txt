Polyaniline/graphene (PANI/GN) nanocomposites were synthesized by in situ high gravity chemical oxidative polymerization in a rotating packed bed (RPB). The effects of graphene dosage, ammonium persulfate/aniline mole ratio, aniline concentration and reactor type on their morphology and electrochemical performances were discussed in detail. Results indicated that this process can synthesize PANI/GN nanocomposites easily under relatively extensive conditions. Particularly, it was demonstrated that it is appropriate for higher aniline concentration condition, which is favorable for large scale production. Furthermore, RPB produced PANI/GN nanocomposites of more uniform morphology and thinner coating than those synthesized in a stirred tank reactor (STR). These advantages resulted in nanocomposites of higher specific capacitance of up to 403. F/g as compared to 255. F/g for those of STR at 0.5. A/g. This process is not only simple and efficient, but also has a good prospect for industrial application.
