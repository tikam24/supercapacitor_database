This paper presents an energy management method in an electrical hybrid source without any switching algorithm. The hybrid source consists of the electrochemical power sources: a fuel cell as the main energy source and a supercapacitor bank as the auxiliary power source. The presented method is based on the flatness theory and is well adapted to the systems exchanging energy. In this paper at first, a reduced model of the system is developed and the system is proved to flat. Then, the control strategy is explained in details and passive elements (capacitors) of the system are designed to be minimized. Finally, the system modeling and control strategy is validated by simulation and experimental results. Â© 2012 Lavoisier.
