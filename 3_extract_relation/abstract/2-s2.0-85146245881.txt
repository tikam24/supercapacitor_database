This article details the fabrication of conductive Pt@PDMA/AC nanocomposite via layer by layer electrochemical deposition process on a flexible current collector for highly effective flexible supercapacitor. The unique nanostructure and crystallinity were characterized by using scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction. These suggested electrodes make the most of their incredible electrical conductivity, mechanical strength, electrochemical stability, and adherence to a flexible current collector. They also exhibit great capacitive performance and exceptional cycle life. The Pt@ PDMA/AC electrode has contributed to a good specific capacitance of 348.48 F/g at current density 1 A/g. Further, the nanocomposite shows remarkable stability where 95 % of its capacity retained after 3000 cycles at 10 A/g. due to synergetic effects. The final nanocomposite contributes to a maximum energy density of 108.9 Whkg−1 at the power density of 2840.86 Wkg−1 at 1 A/g current density. The resulting nanocomposite is a strong contender for energy storage and flexible electronic devices due to its outstanding electrochemical characteristics and great cycle stability.
