Porous Co3O4/C nano-composite is firstly synthesized by a two-step calcination method using ZIF-67 as single source precursor.Then,Co3O4/C/polyacrylamide (Co3O4/C/PAAm) composite hydrogel is fabricated by incorporating Co3O4/C composite into PAAm network through a free radical polymerization method.Polypyrrole nanoparticles with electrochemistry activity is synthesized in the as-prepared hydrogel framework by in-situ polymerization method,hence a novel kind of Co3O4/C/PAAm-PPy hydrogel electrode material is obtained.As a state-of-art demonstration,an all-solid-state flexible supercapacitor is constructed by assembling this flexible electrode material with hydrogel electrolyte.It is shown through electrochemical tests that the prepared supercapacitor exhibits excellent supercapacitor performance by delivering a specific capacitance of 197.83 mFâ€¢cm-2 that is found through galvanostatic charge-discharge curve.The capacitance of this supercapacitor declines only 9% after 10 000 electrochemistry cycles,representing a good cycling stability.Impressively,this supercapacitor shows a high mechanical flexibility under twisting and stretching deformations,which allows it to be used in powering flexible electronic appliances.
