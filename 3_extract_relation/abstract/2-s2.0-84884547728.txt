The behavior of a supercapacitor is a complex and nonlinear function of its current rate, temperature, chemistry and history, and hence cannot easily be determined. In this study, we use a one-layer feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN), trained using the back-propagation algorithm, to model the behavior of supercapacitors used in automotive applications. Possible improvements of the neural network model using a multilevel approach are discussed. Then, on the basis of this model, a neural controller is developed in order to control the supercapacitor voltage. Simulation results confirmed the accuracy of the model compared to measurements from supercapacitor module power-cycling. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
