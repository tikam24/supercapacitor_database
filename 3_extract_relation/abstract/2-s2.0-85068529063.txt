In this work, the Ni3S2/NiO nanocomposites have been synthesized by a simple ion diffusion method and subsequent calcination. The characterization of as-prepared samples has been tested by means of XRD, FTIR, TG-DTG, BET, SEM and XPS. The obtained Ni3S2/NiO presents mixed-phase and aggregated granular morphology. The specific capacitance value of as-fabricated Ni3S2/NiO electrode is 459 F g−1 and the capacitance retention is 90.2% after 4000 cycles at 2 A g−1. The much higher capacitance and retention than pure NiO (220 F g−1 and 75.1%) suggest the Ni3S2/NiO materials should be one of the suitable materials for supercapacitor application.
