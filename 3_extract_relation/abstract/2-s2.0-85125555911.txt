With the development of science and technology, supercapacitors, as a new efficient and clean energy storage device, have the advantages of environment-friendly, high power density, safety and stability, faster charging and discharging, and excellent cycle stability, etc. To explore the supercapacitor of a higher capacitor capacitance and energy density. This paper introduce an asymmetric supercapacitor where CoS is anode and VN is cathode. This experiment combines characterization methods like SEM, DES, XRD, etc, and the electrochemical detection methods such as CV, GCD to explore the designed supercapacitors.Hope to provide a new idea for the study of supercapacitors.
