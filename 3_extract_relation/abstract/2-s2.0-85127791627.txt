A facile hydrothermal and ultrasonication method used to synthesize the MoO3 nanowires (NWs) intercalated MXene composite. MoO3/MXene nanocomposite was fabricated on carbon cloth (CC) to prepare the MoO3/MXene@CC electrode. Intercalation of MoO3 NWs in MXene layers prevented the collapse of Al etched MXene sheets and enhanced the conductive channels in ultimate nanostructures. When applied for electrochemical measurements, MoO3/MXene@CC significantly improved specific capacity. For pristine MoO3@CC, the specific capacitance was calculated as 466.7 F/g (at 5 mV/s) and 442 F/g (at 1 A/g) from cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) data, respectively. Meanwhile, MoO3/MXene@CC showed a high specific capacitance of 783.4 F/g at 5 mV/s and 775 F/g at 1 A/g under the CV and GCD measurements. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data evaluated the resistivity performance of MoO3/MXene@CC. The calculated equivalent series resistance (RES) and charge transfer resistance (RCT) values for MoO3/MXene@CC were 5.4 Ω and 31.3 Ω, respectively. Moreover, MoO3/MXene@CC showed excellent cyclic stability with 96.4% retention of its initial specific capacitance even after 6000 cycles. Results suggest that the prepared MoO3/MXene@CC hybrid can be used as an efficient electrode material for electrochemical energy storage applications.
