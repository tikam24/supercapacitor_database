Supercapacitors, electrochemical energy storage devices, play a key part in high power supply and energy storage systems, and their performance mostly depends on electrode material architecture due to having remarkable qualities, such as customizable porous architectures as well as high specific surface area. Carbon materials have attracted much attention among the advanced materials studied. However, the comparatively low specific capacitance value prevents pure carbon from being widely used on an industrial basis. One of the various procedures for improving capacitive performance is sulfur (S) doping into the carbon surface as the S atom can increase the conductivity and undergo Faradaic reactions to provide pseudocapacitance behaviors. However, for environmental reasons, a sustainable carbon-rich precursor material is necessary to produce supercapacitor electrode material. As a result, using biomass-based S-doped carbon materials in supercapacitors combines green chemistry concepts in addition to high electrochemical performance. This chapter discusses many synthetic ways for producing biomass-based S-doped carbon electrode materials from diverse sources, as well as their use and crucial principles for supercapacitor design and future prospects.
