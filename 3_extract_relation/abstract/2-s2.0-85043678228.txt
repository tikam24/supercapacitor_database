A 3D flower-like mesoporous Ni@C composite material has been synthesized by using a facile and economical one-pot hydrothermal method. This unique 3D flower-like Ni@C composite, which exhibited a high surface area (522.4 m2 g−1), consisted of highly dispersed Ni nanoparticles on mesoporous carbon flakes. The effect of calcination temperature on the electrochemical performance of the Ni@C composite was systematically investigated. The optimized material (Ni@C 700) displayed high specific capacity (1306 F g−1 at 2 A g−1) and excellent cycling performance (96.7 % retention after 5000 cycles). Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) that contained Ni@C 700 as cathode and mesoporous carbon (MC) as anode demonstrated high energy density (60.4 W h kg−1 at a power density of 750 W kg−1).
