MoO 3 -reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite is synthesized in a facile, time-saving and environmental friendly microwave assisted synthesis route. The as-prepared samples, MoO 3 and MoO 3 -reduced graphene oxide are characterized by XRD, Raman, XPS, SEM, and TEM. The characteristic studies have confirmed the formation of MoO 3 and its composite matrix with reduced graphene oxide. The electrochemical studies are carried out in three-electrode set up, and in two-electrode configuration to find the suitability of the as-prepared material for asymmetric supercapacitor applications. The galvanostatic charge/discharge profile of rGO//MoO 3 –rGO exhibits an excellent electrochemical activity with a specific capacitance of 133.68 F g −1 at 3 A g −1 with energy density and power density of 36.2 Wh Kg −1 and 535.6 W Kg −1 respectively. The asymmetric supercapacitor device attains 85% of cyclic stability even after 4000 charge/discharge cycles.
