In this study，high molecular weight lignin in the bamboo pulp black liquor was separated via colloidal precipitation by aluminum sulfate to obtain the Al-precipitated lignin（AlpL），and then AlpL@PAN-based carbon fibers with good electrochemical properties were pre⁃ pared by electrospinning，pre-oxidation and carbonization route with AlpL and polyacrylonitrile（PAN）as raw materials. When the AlpL proportion was up to 60%，AlpL@PAN-based carbon fibers showed the best capacitance performance and better cycle stability，of which the internal resistance value was 1. 138 Ω with 94. 50% of the capacitance retained after 1000 cycles.
