A facile interfacial synthesis strategy is proposed to synthesize self-assembled polypyrrole (PPy) free-standing films for electrochemical capacitors with the assistance of surfactants. The chemical structure of the obtained samples is characterized by Fourier transform infrared. The morphologies of the samples are studied by scanning electron microscope. The results show that the prepared PPy films own highly porous structures using Tween80 as a surfactant, while the synthesized PPy films have vesicular structures by adding Span80 as a surfactant. Furthermore, lowering polymerization temperature makes PPy films have smaller and more pores or vesicles. The PPy films prepared at 0Â°C with Tween80 as a surfactant possess a high specific capacitance of 261 F g-1 at 25 mV s-1 as well as retain 75% of the initial specific capacitance value after 1000 cycles. The good electrochemical properties can be attributed to the highly porous structural advantage of the PPy films caused by Tween80.
