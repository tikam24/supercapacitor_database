Conducting polymers, polythiophene (PT) and polypyrrole (PPy) were prepared by chemical oxidative polymerization (COP) method. A ternary PPy-PT/TiO2 composite involve the blending of two polymers namely polythiophene and polypyrrole and further, addition of TiO2 nanoparticles in the multipart-polymer. PPy-PT/TiO2 composite exhibits the highest specific capacitance of 271.8 F/g as compared to PT/TiO2 (109.6 F/g) and PPy/TiO2 (80.4 F/g), respectively. Multipart-conducting polymers boost the conductivity of fabricated device, which enhanced specific capacitance of TiO2 based supercapacitor network, due to their improved surface area, that offers large energy storage and additional pseudocapacitance.
