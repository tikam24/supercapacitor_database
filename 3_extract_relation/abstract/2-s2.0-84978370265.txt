A facile and scalable high-temperature molten salt method was used to synthesize a high-quality hierarchical carbon nanostructure consisting of graphene nanosheets and nanoscrolls with an interconnected network and high electrical conductivity. During the process, the intercalation of lithium and hydrogen from molten LiCl into graphite led to the formation of a coexisting graphene sheet-scroll nanostructure. An electrode using the fabricated interconnected carbon nanostructure showed a highly reversible specific capacitance of 213 F g-1 at 1 A g-1, excellent capacitance retention (84.5% of the initial specific capacitance (1 A g-1) at 50 A g-1), and good cyclability (97.9% after 10 000 cycles). Such remarkable electrochemical performance is desirable for supercapacitor/ultracapacitor applications.
