Coal-based activated carbon has been prepared with Taixi anthracite as the precursor by a facile two steps of physical-chemical activation. The columnar activated carbon is prepared from Taixi anthracite by extrusion, carbonization and physical activation with CO2. With acid pickling, part of the ash is eliminated from columnar activated carbon. Columnar activated carbon was impregnated with different concentrations of potassium hydroxide solution to optimize the amount of alkali, and then activated again to obtain activated carbons as electrode material. Activated carbons exhibit higher BET surface area and larger total pore volume than the first activated columnar activated carbon, which is beneficial for improving the electrochemical performance. The electrochemical characteristics of the as-prepared activated carbons are tested in a three-electrode cell and supercapacitors respectively. The optimized material displays a specific capacitance as high as 255.4 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g in 6 mol/L KOH electrolyte under a three-electrode cell. The optimized material demonstrates a superior cycle stability as an electrode material, and the capacitance decay is hardly observed after 5000 consecutive cycles.
