Lignin is increasingly focused on the application of hybrid supercapacitors. It is a polyphenolic polymer with abundant aromatic functional groups and oxygen-containing functional groups, and is easily transformed into graphitized carbon layer via carbonization to form local highly conductive region, which is a high-quality candidate for the preparation of supercapacitors. Hence, it is becoming a cutting-edge spot using lignin based materials in hybrid supercapacitors. This paper reviewed the recent advances of lignin-based carbon materials in the electrode materials for hybrid supercapacitors with the emphasis on the roles/functions of lignin within electrode materials. Three categories including lignin/porous carbon type (e. g., graphene, carbon nanotube), lignin/metal compound type (e. g., metal oxides, sulfides, hydroxides) and lignin/conductive polymer type (e. g., polyaniline, polypyrrole, polythiophene) were introduced, respectively. Furthermore, the application of lignin-based hybrid supercapacitors in flexible supercapacitors was also presented. Finally, the prospects and challenges of lignin-based materials for hybrid supercapacitor applications were summarized.
