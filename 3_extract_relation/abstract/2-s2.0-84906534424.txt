The present study reports the synthesis of NiO hexagons with exposed {110} facets on metallic Ni backbones. Intrinsic correlations were deduced between the surface area, crystalline anisotropy and the electrochemical performance. These metal backboned hexagons were employed as supercapacitor electrodes exhibiting specific mass capacitance value as high as 2100 Fg-1. Further, a working model button cell employing these rechargeable electrodes is also demonstrated exhibiting an energy and power density of 17 Wh kg-1and 3.5 kW kg-1, respectively.
