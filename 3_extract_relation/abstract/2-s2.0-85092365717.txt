Analytical equations for the voltammetric curve at the linear voltage sweep and for cyclic voltammograms for the system of connected in series resistance and capacitance were derived. The presence of the resistance results in an substantial distortion and curvature of the voltammogram, which distinguishes this system from the system with the parallel connection of the capacitance and resistance. The character of the voltammograms is determined by the ratio of the following parameters: resistance (R), capacitance (C), voltage sweep rate (v), and voltage (U). The system is capacitive in character at RC ≪ U/v, whereas the character of the system is resistive at RC ≫ U/v.
