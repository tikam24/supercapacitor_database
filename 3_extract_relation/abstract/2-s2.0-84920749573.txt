Single-crystals of titanium oxide ( TiO2 ) were wrapped in a graphene (G) film by chemical deposition. The morphology, composition and structure of the resulting composite were subsequently characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD and FT-IR analysis. The electrochemical properties of the composites were studied by cyclic voltammetry, which showed that the introduction of graphene enhances the electrode conductivity, thereby improving the supercapacitive behavior of TiO2 . Galvanostatic charge-discharge tests demonstrated that a supercapacitor device fabricated from TiO2 crystals wrapped in graphene (G-TiO2 ) exhibits a good cycle life, with 94% stability even after 1000 cycles.
