Electrode materials are the key to defining the overall electrochemical performance of energy storage devices and have been an essential hot topic for decades. This study synthesized MnSe-based ZnO composites with MnSe weight ratios (10 and 40%) denoted as ZK-1 and ZK-2 using a simple, cost-effective and economical wet-chemical technique. It investigated their electrochemical characteristics for high-performance hybrid supercapacitors. The comparatively lower resistance of MnSe than that of ZnO (2.40 Ω and 1.45 Ω, respectively) and ZK-2 relative to ZK-1 (1.10 Ω and 0.8 Ω, respectively) give the evident advantages of an improved capacitive energy storage performance owing to their fast faradaic redox reactions due to Mn3+/Mn4+, superior charge storage process, good reversibility and high capacitances of 470 F g−1 and 680 F g−1 at low current rates, respectively. More specifically, at 12 000 cycles, an extraordinarily steady cycling stability of 95.5% was achieved, with a superior energy and power supply of 57.8 W h kg−1 at 13 005 W kg−1 and deficient solution and charge transfer resistance of 1.3 and 6.4 when built as a ZK-2‖AC hybrid supercapacitor. The capacitance, energy and power densities, and low resistance prove the synergistic effect between the MnSe and ZnO nanostructures in a hybrid supercapacitor. Notably, a stable voltage window of 1.75 V in an aqueous solution as an electrolyte boosts the capacitance and power delivery, and thus these seem to be promising electrode materials for advanced hybrid supercapacitors.
