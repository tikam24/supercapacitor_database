Graphene flakes with tunable layer number, sheet size, defects, pores and hybridization were realized by electrochemical approches. Electrochemically exfoliated graphene can exhibit high performances in thermal management, electrocatalysis, supercapacitor and battery. Here, >30μmof large literal sheet size of 1-2 layer graphene flakes were used to fabricate robust, flexible and free-standing graphene films with high thermal diffiisivity. Small graphene microsheets of <1μmof sheet size were produced from natural microcrystalline graphite (minerals) at the scale of tons. The microsheets are highly dispersible with the concentration of ∼20 wt%. They are potentially applied for conductive additive or electrode material of lithium ion battery. Our study demonstrates that electrochemical route is very promising for the production and practical application of graphene.
