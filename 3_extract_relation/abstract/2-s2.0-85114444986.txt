Hydrocarbon based waste materials are emerging as an attractive source of generating activated carbons (ACs), having excellent potential for enormous in-field applications. In this study, it has been demonstrated that the carbon materials collected from the diesel engine exhaust could be a new source for preparing self-doped highly porous AC for high-performance supercapacitor applications. As the diesel engine exhaust carbon (DEEC) itself contains a large number of heteroatoms (O, N, S, and P), simple acid treatment (HCl) of DEEC resulted in a self-doped AC (SDAC_HCl) having contained a high level of heteroatoms as the dopant in it and consequently provided with a large specific surface area of 89 m2g-1. The pyrolytic treatment of DEEC with KOH further resulted in self-doped AC (SDAC_KOH) with an enhanced specific surface area of 549 m2g-1 due to the increase in porosity of AC. The supercapacitor performance of the AC materials is evaluated in a symmetric two-electrode cell. The ACs (SDAC_HCl and SDAC_KOH) have shown very high specific capacitance (Csp) with aqueous (sodium sulfate, Na2SO4), organic (tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate/acetonitrile, TEABF4/AN) and ionic liquid (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, [BMIM][Cl]) electrolytes. The highest Csp of 403 Fg-1 at the current density of 1 Ag-1 is obtained in SDAC_KOH with [BMIM][Cl] electrolyte. The Csp is 193 F g-1 at the high current density of 10 Ag-1, demonstrating the good compatibility of the electrolyte with the electrode material. The SDAC_KOH with [BMIM][Cl] is able to supply a high energy density of 35.8 Whkg-1 at a power density of 400 Wkg-1 which is very reasonably high compared to other reported AC materials. The SDAC_KOH has shown excellent stability in continuous galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles. The SDAC_KOH has retained 98% of its initial capacitance after 10000 cycles at a high current density of 5 Ag-1. The facile and effective strategies employed in this study in developing high-performance supercapacitor electrode materials from waste may help design and develop sustainable energy storage systems.
