The physicochemical properties of graphene, such as the bandgap and electrical conductivity, can be tuned when the carbon atoms are replaced with other heteroatoms. In addition to nitrogen, boron is a dopant that can compensate for the properties lacking in graphene; however, boron-doped graphene has not received significant attention owing to its low doping rate. In this study, we report an improvement in the doping efficiency of arc graphene by utilizing a boron precursor and graphene oxide as anode carbon fillers. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the doping level of the synthesized graphene flakes (5.7at.%) was significantly higher than that of boron-doped arc graphene reported in the literature (3at.%). Cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and constant-current charge/discharge experiments were performed to investigate the electrochemical properties of boron-doped graphene. The synthesized boron-doped graphene exhibited an areal capacitance of 66 μF cm−2, which is superior to that of other doped carbon materials. The electrochemical activity of boron-doped graphene is affected more by functionalized doping than by substitutional doping, because of the improved wettability displayed by the former. Boron-doped graphene flakes required for various applications can be easily obtained by arc discharge synthesis.
