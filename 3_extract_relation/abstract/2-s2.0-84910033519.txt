Polyaniline (PANI) nanofibers doped with perchloric acid (HClO4) were fast synthesized by electrochemical method including cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic method (GM) and potentiostatic method (PM) on carbon paper. The microstructure, doping level and conductivity of the PANI nanofibers were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and four-probe conductivity meter. The electrochemical property of PANI nanofibers was analyzed by cyclic voltammetry plot. The SEM and TEM images show that, PANI nanofibers have a diameter of 50-150 nm, length of 3 Î¼m, the aspect ratio of 60. The synthetic rate of PANI nanofibers is fastest when synthesised by GM, followed by CV and PM. Compared with the PANI nanofibers synthesized by the other two method, the PANI nanofibers synthesized by CV exhibit the more outstanding conductivity, 5.97 S/cm. FTIR results indicate that the PANI appear strong absorption peaks at 817, 1122, 1290, 1444, 1491 and 1567 cm-1, each peak corresponds with certain structural units of polyaniline, and the PANI synthesized by CV and GM have higher doping level. The CV curves indicates that the PANI nanofibers synthesized by GM exhibit the highest specific capacitance of 578 F/g, followed by PM and CV, which can be used as electrode materials of high-performance supercapacitor.
