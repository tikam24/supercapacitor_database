Carbon materials derived from zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) and composites thereof have been intensively investigated in supercapacitors. The particle size of the used ZIF-8 ranges from dozens of nanometers to several microns. However, the influence of the particle size of ZIF-8 on the capacitive performances is still not clear. A series of ZIF-8 with different particle sizes (from 25 to 296 nm) has been synthesized and carbonized for supercapacitors. Based on TEM, EDX mapping, XRD, Raman, nitrogen adsorption–desorption, XPS, and the results of electrochemical tests, the optimal particle size (≈70 nm) for superior supercapacitor performances in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes has been obtained. This important result provides a significant reference to guide future ZIF-8 related research to achieve the best electrochemical performance.
