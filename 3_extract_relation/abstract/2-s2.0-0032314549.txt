Aerogels are sol-gel derived nanostructured materials with extraordinary properties according to their high porosity. Though first prepared more than 60 years ago, silica aerogels became widely known only in the late 1980s when they were used in Cerenkov detectors and their potential was recognized as high performance thermal insulants. Nowadays, aerogel research has attracted many scientists from different fields, resulting in some 100 publications per year and the fifth aerogel symposium (ISA 5) in Montpellier/France in September 1997. This review will focus on recent developments in fast supercritical and ambient pressure drying processes. The state of the art with respect to structural characterization and measuring the material properties is reported including nondestructive techniques and alterations induced by invasive methods. A brief survey is given on modeling the aerogel structure and simulating properties. Special attention will be given to carbon aerogels and their organic precursors. Due to the high electrical conductivity of their graphitic backbone and the large specific inner surface areas, carbon aerogels can be considered ideal electrodes in supercapacitors and fuel cells.
