Transition metal oxides are promising electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage, as they exhibit higher specific capacity/capacitance and energy density due to their fast and reversible surface redox reactions. This chapter provides a comprehensive study on fabrication, structural characterizations, electrochemical properties, and supercapacitor performance of different types of transition metal oxide-based electrode materials to fully exploit the potential of them in supercapacitor applications. A comprehensive overview of supercapacitive performance of different types of transition metal oxide-based electrodes such as RuO2, MnO2, NiO, and Co3O4 has been included in this chapter to understand the recent progress in this field.
