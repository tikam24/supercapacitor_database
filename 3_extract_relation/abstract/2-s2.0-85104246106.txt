Amorphous NiSe2 was deposited on the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) networks by the pulsed laser deposition method forming the CC@CNT@NiSe2 composites. The CC@CNT@NiSe2 electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 696 F g-1 at 2 A g-1 and the specific capacitance retention of 74 % in the long life test. To evaluate the practicality of our electrode, we assembled the CC@CNTs@NiSe2//CC@CNTs asymmetric supercapacitor using CC@CNTs@NiSe2 as positive electrode and CC@CNTs as the negative electrode, which shows an energy density of 11.9 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 242 W kg-1. This work highlights the advantageous electrochemical performance of NiSe2 film on CNTs, in which the highly conductive CNTs provide plentful electronic conduction channels and the NiSe2 film exposures more active sites.
