In this work we demonstrate that biomass-derived proteins serve as an ideal precursor for synthesizing carbon materials for energy applications. The unique composition and structure of the carbons resulted in very promising electrochemical energy storage performance. We obtained a reversible lithium storage capacity of 1780 mA h g-1, which is among the highest ever reported for any carbon-based electrode. Tested as a supercapacitor, the carbons exhibited a capacitance of 390 F g-1, with an excellent cycle life (7% loss after 10000 cycles). Such exquisite properties may be attributed to a unique combination of a high specific surface area, partial graphitization and very high bulk nitrogen content. It is a major challenge to derive carbons possessing all three attributes. By templating the structure of mesoporous cellular foam with egg white-derived proteins, we were able to obtain hierarchically mesoporous (pores centered at ∼4 nm and at 20-30 nm) partially graphitized carbons with a surface area of 805.7 m2 g -1 and a bulk N-content of 10.1 wt%. When the best performing sample was heated in Ar to eliminate most of the nitrogen, the Li storage capacity and the specific capacitance dropped to 716 mA h g-1 and 80 F g -1, respectively. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
