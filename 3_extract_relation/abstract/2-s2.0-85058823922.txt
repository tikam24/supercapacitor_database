The interconnected three-dimensional Ni-Co-S nanosheets were successfully deposited on ZnO nanorods by a one-step potentiostatic electrodeposition. The Ni-Co-S nanosheets provide a large electrode/electrolyte interfacial area which has adequate electroactive sites for redox reactions. Electrochemical characterization of the ZnO@Ni-Co-S core-shell nanorods presents high specifc capacitance (1302.5F/g and 1085F/g at a current density of 1 A/g and 20 A/g), excellent rate capabilities (83.3% retention at 20A/g) and great cycling stability (65% retention after 5000 cycles at a current density of 30A/g). The outstanding electrochemical performance of the as-prepared electrode material also can be ascribed to these reasons that the special structure improved electrical conductivity and allowed the fast diffusion of electrolyte ions.
