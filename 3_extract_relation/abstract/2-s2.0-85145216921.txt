In this work, one-dimensional (1D) conductive MOFs Ni3(HHTP)2 with nanorod-like morphology on the surface of a woven fabric was synthesized by an in-situ growth method. Based on a three-electrode system, the effects of substrate concentration, scan rate and current density on electrode properties were investigated, respectively. The results showed that Ni3(HHTP)2 @ woven fabric-3 (NHWF-3) demonstrated the largest area capacitance at 5 mV s−1 and reached up to 360 μF cm−2 at 20 μA cm−2. Most importantly, the material still maintained 58.3% (210 μF cm−2) of the initially areal specific capacitance when the current density was increased 5 times to 100 μA cm−2. According to the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) curve, NHWF-3 has the smallest semicircle radius in the high-frequency region, indicating that it has the lowest internal transfer resistance and the best conductivity. Thus, this study provides a good example for the simple preparation and practical applications of conductive MOFs composites.
