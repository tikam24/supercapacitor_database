Polypyrrole (PPy) electrode was electro-polymerized by potentiostatic electrode position method on stainless steel substrate for super capacitor application. The morphology and elemental analysis of polypyrrole electrode were studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The electrochemical properties of PPy have been examined using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, cyclic stability and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements in 1 M H2SO4 electrolytes. A high specific capacitance of 531 Fg−1 was obtained within the potential range of −0.5–0.7 V in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. Additionally, PPy electrode exhibited high discharge/charge efficiency of 82%. The present study signifies the successful application of polypyrrole thin films as a supercapacitor electrode.
