An electrical effect, the supercapacitive swing adsorption (SSA) effect is reported, which allows for reversible adsorption and desorption of carbon dioxide by capacitive charge and discharge of electrically conducting porous carbon materials. The SSA effect can be observed when an electrically conducting, nanoporous carbon material is brought into contact with carbon dioxide gas and an aqueous electrolyte. Charging the supercapacitor electrodes initiates the spontaneous organization of electrolyte ions into an electric double layer at the surface of each porous electrode. The presence of this double layer leads to reversible, selective uptake and release of the CO 2 as the supercapacitor is charged and discharged. A new electrical effect, the so-called supercapacitive swing adsorption (SSA) effect, is reported for the first time. SSA enabled the reversible and selective adsorption and desorption of carbon dioxide by the capacitive charge and discharge of porous carbon materials. Â© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
