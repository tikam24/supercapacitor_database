The MnPO4·H2O thin film for supercapacitor applications was prepared by potentiodynamic electrodeposition on a platinum electrode. The morphology and microstructure were examined by scanning electron microscope coupled to an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) respectively. The electrochemical performance of the films obtained was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) methods with various electrolytes. Electrical measurements were performed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The electrochemical results indicate that the MnPO4·H2O thin film in the microsphere form has a high specific capacitance of the order of 213 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 within a potential window of 0.5 V with 3 M NaOH as electrolyte.
