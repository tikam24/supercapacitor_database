Fiber-shaped supercapacitors with excellent electrochemical performance and high flexibility have attracted particular attention to meet the ever-growing need of portable and wearable electronics. Herein, we developed an integrated fiber electrode of alginate/PEDOT:PSS@polypyrrole based on marine polysaccharide for constructing high-energy symmetrical fiber-shaped supercapacitors. The swelling of alginate insures definite growth of thin polypyrrole layer in the surface region of alginate/PEDOT:PSS, introducing additional pseudocapacitance through faradaic reaction and thus improving charge transport. The composite fiber exhibits ultrahigh volumetric and areal capacity (567.6 F cm−3 and 1002.4 mF cm−2), which is superior to most of the previous reports. Owing to ultrahigh capacity of the fiber electrodes and their sufficient contact with gel electrolyte, the as-fabricated fiber supercapacitor exhibits large specific capacitance of 246.4 mF cm−2, high energy density of 21 μW h cm−2, and excellent flexibility (97% of initial values after 180° bending). These mechanical and electrochemical properties make the fiber supercapacitor a promising energy storage device for next-generation portable and wearable electronics.
