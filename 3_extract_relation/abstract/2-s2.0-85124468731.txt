The following article presents results of measurements and parameter comparison of energy bank based on supercapacitor batteries and a typical lead-acid solution designed for PV microinstallation. For the purposes of the research, basic measurements of the charging and discharging characteristics of the energy storage consisting of 10 supercapacitors were carried out. Then this set was adopted as an energy storage system in a typical off-grid photovoltaic installation, which was launched and tested with the use of various types of loads in a static and dynamic conditions.
