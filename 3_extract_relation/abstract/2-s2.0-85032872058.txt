New composite electrodes were made from Ni-doped molybdenum disulfide (Ni-MoS2) with the help of anode electrode, through electrochemical synthesis procedure. Water Dispersible Graphene-MnO2 nanomaterials and cathode electrodes were synthesised with the help of a reflux technique. In addition to this, the prepared materials were comprehensively characterised by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, particle size analyser and Raman spectroscopy studies. The anode and cathode were prepared respectively using the prepared Ni-MoS2 and water dispersible graphene-MnO2 nanocomposites. The prepared asymmetrical electrodes were used to construct the 2023 coin cell supercapacitor with polypropylene as a separator and Na2SO4 as a gel electrolyte. The electrochemical performances of an asymmetrical supercapacitor as well as the half-cell studies of Ni-MoS2 nanocomposite were carried out at room temperature. The present study confirms that the energy and power density of the earlier mentioned supercapacitor were higher than that of commercial supercapacitors.
