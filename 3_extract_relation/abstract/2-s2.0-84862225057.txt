The nanosized Mn 3O 4 particles were prepared by microwave-assisted reflux synthesis method. The prepared sample was characterized using various techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Raman analysis, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Electrochemical properties of Mn 3O 4 nanoparticles were investigated using cyclic voltammogram (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and galvanostatic charge-discharge analysis in different electrolytes such as 1 M KCl, 1 M Na 2SO 4, 1 M NaNO 3, and 6 M KOH electrolytes. XRD pattern reveals the formation of single-phase Mn 3O 4 nanoparticles. The FT-IR and Raman analysis also assert the formation of Mn 3O 4 nanoparticles. The TEM image shows the spherical shape particles with less than 50 nm sizes. Among all the electrolytes, the Mn 3O 4 nanoparticles possess maximum specific capacitance of 94 F g -1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte calculated from CV. The order of capacitance obtained by various electrolytes is 6 M KOH > 1 M KCl > 1 M NaNO 3 > 1 M Na 2SO 4. The EIS and galvanostatic charge-discharge results further substantiate with the CV results. The cycling stability of Mn 3O 4 electrode reveals that the prepared Mn 3O 4 nanoparticles are a suitable electrode material for supercapacitor application.
