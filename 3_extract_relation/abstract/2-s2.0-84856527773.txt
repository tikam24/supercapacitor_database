In this paper a combination of the flatness based method and the Input/Output (I/O) linearization technique is presented to control a low power electrical hybrid system supplied by a fuel cell (FC) and a supercapacitor pack (SCP). This hybrid system feeds three independent loads through the DC/DC buck converters. The first method is used to manage the energy between FC, SCP and loads, while the second one is employed to control the buck converters. This leads to benefit advantages of the two methods: prediction of the system behavior even in the transient state and decoupling the control variables of the buck converters. The simulation results prove efficiency of the control strategy of the multi sources/multi loads electrical hybrid system. Â© 2011 IEEE.
