In this work, effect of coating time on the structural, compositional and morphological properties of MoO 3 -coated Al 2 O 3 plate for application as an electrode material for ultracapacitor was investigated. The 1cm Ã— 1cm aluminum plate was anodized by an electrochemical plating technique at 12V for 20 and 30min, respectively. MoO 3 film was then coated on anodized aluminum plate over a range of coating time (2-10min, in intervals of 4min) at an applied voltage of 6V with constant electric current of 1A. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were employed in the characterization of the MoO 3 /Al 2 O 3 plate obtained. The SEM results obtained indicated that the coating time significantly affected the roughness and the surface area of the samples. The EDX analysis revealed the chemical composition element of Mo, O and Al and the result from XPS confirmed the existence of MoO 3 .
