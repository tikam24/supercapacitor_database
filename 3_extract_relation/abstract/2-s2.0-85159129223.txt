Flexible supercapacitors require some important characteristics such as good structural style and high performance, but low cost and easy manufacturing should not be ignored. Herein, we design flexible supercapacitors based on ordinary carbon materials. By using acetylene black as the conductor, this new type of flexible supercapacitor was built through brushing and realized the integration of electrode, supporting diaphragm and solid electrolyte. With this new structural form, the devices show extremely high tensile strength and good folding resistance. Supercapacitors can also be loaded with different active materials and exhibit many excellent electrochemical properties. When using polyaniline coated multi-wall carbon nanotube as the active material, it shows a surface capacity of 1 Fcm−2 level and a good rate performance. In the case of using activated carbon, it shows a good response and a good capacity retention of 100 ± 1 % and high coulomb efficiency. It can stably work at a temperature range of 5–55 °C. Even if injured, it can be used consistently. Our research may provide some references for the large-scale fabrication of new flexible supercapacitors.
