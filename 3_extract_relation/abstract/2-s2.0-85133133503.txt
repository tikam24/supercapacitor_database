The electrode material in commercial supercapacitors has high electrical resistivity, intrinsic to the activated carbon powder-organic binder mixture. Consequently, electrode materials are coated on current collectors as thin films to reduce the device resistance. However, the thin-film configuration limits the volume fraction of an active electrode material (activated carbon) and holds the volumetric energy density low. Wood biochar monoliths (WBMs) have a low-tortuosity porous structure and a conductive carbon matrix, a combination desirable for binder-free electrodes with high energy density. This article reports a novel approach for fabricating high-performance, WBM-based thick electrodes. The approach combines wood pulping, mechanical compression, and thermal carbonization, transforming a common softwood-white pine into an intensified wood biochar monolith (IWBM) with high bulk density (0.617 g/cm3) and pore utilization efficiency (28 Î¼F/cm2) at the same time. Furthermore, the thick (1.2 mm) electrode made with the IWBM exhibited record-high areal capacitances (7.58-9.36 F/cm2) and a high volumetric capacitance (78.0 F/cm3) attributed to the densified, easily accessible pore network and the conductive carbon matrix in the IWBM. Moreover, the white pine WBM is readily augmented with pseudocapacitive materials (e.g., RuO2). A supercapacitor cell with two symmetric pine WBM electrodes displayed no performance attenuation after 10,000 cycles. This study provides a practical approach to increasing the volumetric energy density, demonstrating the potential of WBMs as a low-cost, high-performance alternative to advanced nanoporous carbon materials such as graphene and carbon nanotubes.
