In this work, a MOF-derived Co-Fe oxide porous nanorod is introduced into the freestanding MXene film to produce a high-performance flexible electrode with excellent deformability and editability. The as-prepared composite film electrode demonstrates several advantages: MXene layer functions as a binder and conductive additive to coat Co-Fe oxide, which can effectively facilitate charge transfer and maintain the excellent flexibility of the film electrode. In the meantime, Co-Fe oxide can work as a spacer, thereby expanding the interlayer distance, improving the ion transmission path in the electrode. As a result, the optimal Co-Fe oxide/Ti3C2TX composite paper manifests a remarkable volumetric capacitance of 2467.6 F cm−3 in 1 M LiCl electrolyte. When assembled into a flexible symmetrical supercapacitor, an outstanding specific areal capacitance of 356.4 mF cm−2 can be obtained. Meanwhile, the flexible supercapacitor demonstrates excellent cycling performance with a high capacitance retention of 88.2% after 10 000 charge/discharge cycles, as well as stable electrochemical energy storage stability after 100 cycles of mechanical bending, indicating its great application potential in future flexible and portable energy storage equipment.
