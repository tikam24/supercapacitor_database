Characterization of supercapacitor electrodes/devices primarily involves both cyclic voltammetry and constant current chargeâ€“discharge techniques. Nevertheless, considering the induction of large number of non-carbonaceous materials to fabricate supercapacitor electrodes, additional characterization tools are required that are going to be detailed in the succeeding sections. Since diverse characterization techniques are being implemented to address all the electrochemical processes involved in the supercapacitor electrode (or device) measurement (or evaluation), it is highly imperative to have at least a brief account of these processes taking place at the electrode/electrolyte interface.
