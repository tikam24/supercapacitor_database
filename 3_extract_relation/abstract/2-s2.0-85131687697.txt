For the first time, Eu2(WO4)3 nanoparticles (EWNPs) were fabricated and anchored on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) through a sonochemical procedure. The supercapacitive behavior of the product, namely EWNP/RGO was studied using galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and impedance spectroscopy (ES). Nanostructured EWNP-RGO had a specific capacitance of 462 Fg−1 in a 2.0 M H2SO4 solution at 2 mVs−1, and of 423 Fg−1 in GCD tests at 1 Ag−1, which was attributed to the synergy of the EWNPs and the RGO sheets, the considerable charge mobility, as well as the flexibility of RGO sheets. EWNP/RGO electrodes were found to have 104.2% of their initial specific capacitance after 4000 cycles. Based on the results the EWNP/RGO nanocomposites was regarded as a composite with suitable functional performance for energy storage applications.
