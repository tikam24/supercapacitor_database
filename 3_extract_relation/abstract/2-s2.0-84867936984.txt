This paper presents a supercapacitor (SC) module connected in parallel with fuel cell (FC) stack to supply a high-performance Z-Source Inverter (HP-ZSI) feeding a three phase induction motor for hybrid electric vehicles applications. The supercapacitor is connected between the input diode and the bidirectional switch of the highperformance ZSI topology. The indirect field-oriented control (IFOC) method is used to control an induction motor speed during motoring and regenerative braking operations to produce the modulation index and a dual loop controller is used to control the Z-network capacitor voltage to produce the shoot-through duty ratio. MATLAB simulation results verified the validity of the proposed control strategy during motoring and regenerative braking operations. Â© 2010 WEVA.
