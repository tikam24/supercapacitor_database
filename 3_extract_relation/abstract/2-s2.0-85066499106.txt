The wide interlayer spacing can improve charge transfer rate and release the internal strain during the discharge-charge processes. The interlayer spacing and crystal phase of Ni(OH)2 nanocrystals are generally associated with the introduction of various anions. In this study, we have prepared four kinds of Ni(OH)2 nanocrystals with a simple gas-liquid route by simply altering the Ni salts. The crystal phases of the obtained Ni(OH)2 nanostructures can be controlled by the introduction of nitrate, chlorine, acetate and sulfate anions respectively. The electrochemical test results indicate that flake-like Ni(OH)2 prepared using nickel acetate exhibits the largest charge storage capacity and capacitance value can be reached 2018 F g−1 at 10 A g−1 current density in 2 mol L−1 KOH electrolyte.
