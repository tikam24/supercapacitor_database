This work reports the high performance of NiCo-layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) self-growing nanosheet arrays decorated with graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) as a potential electrode material for supercapacitor. The composite is prepared by a convenient microwave method and its electrochemical behavior is evaluated. In three electrode system, the graphitic carbon nitride-NiCo-layered double hydroxide (CN-LDH) electrode exhibits high specific capacitance of 1936.36 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. The results show that adding a certain amount of g-C3N4 to LDH can significantly increase the specific capacitance of the electrode. In addition, the electrochemical performances of the electrode are further studied by Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and capacitance contribution fitting, which provides theoretical assistance for the elaborated electrochemical performance and reaction kinetics. Meanwhile, the possible reaction mechanisms are explained from two aspects of current density and scan rate, which revealed a reference idea for the future recombination of g-C3N4. The supercapacitor is assembled to verify the practical application of the CN-LDH electrode, CN-LDH//AC displays the maximum energy density of 50.63 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 0.80 kW kg−1, and successfully lights several LEDs. This confirms that the self-growing nanosheet arrays CN-LDH electrode possesses the potential value for supercapacitor applications.
