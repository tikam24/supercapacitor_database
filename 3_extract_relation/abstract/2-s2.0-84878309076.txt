In the paper, the problem of voltage imbalance in supercapacitor bank caused by different capacitances and leakage resistances is considered. The authors propose capacitance balancing in combination with passive resistor voltage balancing as an efficient method for decreasing the cell voltage imbalance and increasing the effective energy capacity of supercapacitor bank. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated theoretically and verified experimentally on eight supercapacitor cells.
