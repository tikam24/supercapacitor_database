Discharging industrial wastewater containing dyes and antibiotics will irreversibly damage the overall environment and human health and prosperity. In this study, magnetic Fe3O4 and MoS2 were loaded on biomass activated carbon (BAC) using co-precipitation and hydrothermal methods, respectively, to obtain MoS2 functionalized magnetic biomass activated carbon (MoS2-mBAC), which was used to remove tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) and crystal violet (CV) in wastewater. A series of characterization methods such as SEM, TEM, FT-IR, XRD, VSM and BET were used. The results showed that MoS2-mBAC has abundant oxygen-containing functional groups, high magnetic properties, large specific surface area (984.05cm2/g), and MoS2 nanoflowers with a graphene-like structure. Moreover, the whole adsorption process was endothermic, which can be well fitted by pseudo-second-order kinetic and Langmuir model. The maximum adsorption capacity for TC and CV at the optimum pH reached 286.53mg/g and 568.18mg/g. Compared to BAC and mBAC, the adsorption performance of MoS2-mBAC was greatly improved. After five cycles, the removal rate was still high. MoS2-mBAC has broad application prospects in wastewater treatment due to its unique advantages, such as wide source, simple process, good performance and high economical availability.
