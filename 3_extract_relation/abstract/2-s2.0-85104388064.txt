In this work, N-doped TiO2 hierarchical microspheres were prepared by a hydrothermal process for high performance supercapacitor. This structured microsphere can provide a large specific surface area and a suitable pore size, which is conducive to electrolyte infiltration, and the nitrogen doping can improve the electrical properties of intrinsic TiO2. Combining these two strategies, the specific capacitance of N-doped TiO2 microspheres increases from 2.26 to 11.89 mF/cm2 at current density of 1 mA/cm2 and the capacitance remains 90.5% of the original capacity after 10,000 cycles.
