Recently, three-dimensional (3D) porous foams have been studied, but further improvement in nanoscale surface area and stretchability is required for electronic and energy applications. Herein, a general strategy is reported to form a tailored wrinkling structure on strut surfaces inside a 3D polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymeric foam. Controlled wrinkles are created on the struts of 3D foam through an oxygen plasma treatment to form a bilayer surface of PDMS on uniaxially prestretched 3D PDMS foam, followed by relaxation. After plasma treatment for 1 h and prestretching of 40%, the wrinkled 3D foam greatly improves specific surface area and stretchability by over 60% and 75%, respectively, compared with the pristine 3D PDMS foam. To prove its applicability with improved performances, supercapacitors are prepared by coating a conductive material on the wrinkled 3D foam. The resulting supercapacitors exhibit an increased storage capacity (8.3 times larger), maintaining storage capacity well under stretching up to 50%.
