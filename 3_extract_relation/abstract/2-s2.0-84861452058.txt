Polyaniline (PANI) was electrochemically deposited onto aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays during 500 and 2500 sec. The electronic state of nitrogen in the composites was investigated by near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. The N K-edge spectra revealed that mainly emeraldine base was developed in the former composite, while emeraldine was highly protonated in the latter composite. Electrochemical measurements showed that the CNT/PANI composites have significantly better performance than the non-coated nanotubes. The higher specific capacity in the composite obtained during the shorter time was related with the thinner PANI layer deposited on the CNT surface. Â© 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.
