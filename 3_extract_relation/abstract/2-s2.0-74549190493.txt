The polyanionic, poly(aryleneethynylene) polymer PNES that helically wraps single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) was used in a variety of novel electrically active composites, combined with the electroactive polymer poly(3,4-propylenedioxythiophene) PProDOT, to function as supercapacitor charge storage media. PNES provides solubility and dispersion characteristics for SWNTs in water and in organic solvents like methanol (MeOH). PNES/SWNT samples were prepared by drop casting PNES/SWNT/MeOH suspensions on Pt button electrodes; high stability PProDOT/PNES/SWNT composites were then prepared by electrochemical polymerization in ionic liquid/propylene carbonate electrolyte solution. These composites enhanced key redox capacitors rubrics compared to those of PProDOT-based terminals. The PNES-wrapped SWNTs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and Vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy. PProDOT- and PProDOT/PNES/SWNT-based devices were interrogated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) to different cell voltages. Electronic transport properties of the PNES/SWNT composite samples were measured from 2K to room temperature. Â© The Electrochemical Society.
