This study reports the manufacture of supercapacitor electrodes using three materials, including activated carbon as the active material, carbon black as the conducting agent, and CMC (carboxymethylcellulose) as the binder. The binder was used to bind the mixture of the two carbons, which were stuck together into the current collector. The CMC is a popular binder for supercapacitors due to its high wettability, environmentally friendly, and cheap. However, the CMC is easy to swelling in aqueous electrolytes, which reduces the mechanical properties of the electrode. Here, we propose alternative curing agents to improve the mechanical properties of CMC. The curing agents are epoxy resin, SBR-2 (styrene-butadiene rubber copolymer), and acrylic. For manufacturing the electrodes, the activated carbon, carbon black, CMC, and the curing agents were mixed together and were put on the nickel foam. The produced electrodes were then characterized using the adhesive test, contact angle test, and cyclic voltammetry. It was found that the epoxy resin is the finest curing agent of the CMC-based binder, with adhesive strength of 99.19%. However, the specific capacitance of the electrode with CMC-epoxy resin was lower (37.3 F/g) than the pristine CMC (54.69 F/g). This is caused by the highest contact angle of 33.0±0.13°which indicated the low wettability. The result of this study implies that the CMC-epoxy resin can improve the mechanical properties of the pristine CMC binder and can be an alternative binder for aqueous electrolyte supercapacitors.
