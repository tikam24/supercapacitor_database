A three-dimensional nanoporous Ni(OH)2 thin-film was hydrothermally converted from an anodically formed porous layer of nickel fluoride/oxide. The nanoporous Ni(OH)2 thin-films can be used as additive-free electrodes for energy storage. The nanoporous layer delivers a high capacitance of 1765 F g-1 under three electrode testing. After assembly with porous activated carbon in asymmetric supercapacitor configurations, the devices deliver superior supercapacitive performances with capacitance of 192 F g-1, energy density of 68 Wh kg-1, and power density of 44 kW kg-1. The wide working potential window (up to 1.6 V in 6 M aq KOH) and stable cyclability (âˆ¼90% capacitance retention over 10000 cycles) make the thin-film ideal for practical supercapacitor devices.
