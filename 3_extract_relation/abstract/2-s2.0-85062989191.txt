This paper presents a control strategy for hybrid power source based on fuel cell (FC) as the main power source and battery/supercapacitor (SC) as auxiliary power sources for electric vehicle application. In this study, a Battery and SC are auxiliary devices associated with the FC to ensure the power reversibility in the drive train. The FC, Battery, and SC are connected to the DC bus throughout an interleaved boost converter (IBC) and two interleaved bidirectional converters (IBDC) respectively. The paper proposes the control strategy based on power frequency splitting to avoid FC starvation problem, reduce the battery stress and improve the fuel economy of FC. The detail of the control strategy is presented and an Energetic Macroscopic Representation (EMR) is used to develop the whole system. The simulation results are presented to validate the proposed method in the hybrid system.
