MnO2 doped polyaniline (PANI) grafted on 3D CNTs/graphene was fabricated using basic in situ redox deposition. The HRTEM and FESEM studies validate that MnO2 doped polyaniline (PANI) can be efficiently coated over the surface of CNTs/graphene. The incorporation of MnO2 in polyaniline well depicted by elemental mapping. The electrochemical studies showed that maximum specific capacitance of 1360 Fg−1 at 5 mV s−1 scan rate was achieved for the MnO2 doped PANI/CNTs/graphene composite, which was nearly 30% higher than 1160 Fg−1 of MnO2 doped PANI /CNTs and 50% more than the 600 Fg−1 of MnO2 doped PANI composite. Moreover, this composite provided a good cycling stability of 82% after 5000 cycles with mentionable capacitance retention. The incredible electrochemical performance is accredited mainly to the porous hierarchical architecture, which consisted of interconnected MnO2 doped PANI uniformly coated over the CNTs/graphene carbon framework.
