In this work, we use polydopamine (PDA) to modify the surface of carbon materials, and then adopt hydroquinone (HQ) as a redox additive to jointly improve the performance of supercapacitors. This non-covalent bond PDA coating produce functional groups such as amino and hydroxyl, which can interact with HQ in H2SO4 system by hydrogen bonding. The carbon materials solely coated with PDA (without any HQ) deliver favorable capacitance of 218 F g−1 and energy density of 7.59 Wh kg−1; whereas the one not only coated with PDA but also using HQ as redox additive, higher capacitance of 557 F g−1 and energy density of 19.36 Wh kg−1 are achieved, realizing the energy density increases by 2.55 times. In addition, for carbon materials not covered with PDA, HQ kinetics is diffusion controlled; for carbon materials covered with PDA, HQ kinetics is surface controlled. Obviously, this work provides a synergistic approach to collectively boosting the performance of supercapacitors.
