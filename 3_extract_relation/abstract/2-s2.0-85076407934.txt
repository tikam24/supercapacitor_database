In this paper, the bimetallic Cu-Co selenide with well-defined hollow nanostructures has been successfully prepared through a simple hydrothermal selenization process. When utilized as the electrode material, the as-synthesized nanostructures can exhibit good capacity performance of 503 C g−1 (139.7 mAh g−1) at 10 mA cm−2, and also show good capacity retention (~ 70%) within the wide testing current region. Moreover, a hybrid supercapacitor based on this well-defined Cu-Co selenide and activated carbon has been successfully assembled. Within the potential window of 1.6 V, the maximum specific capacity of 132 C g−1 and the energy density of 29.5 Wh kg−1 are also demonstrated. The electrochemical behaviors presented in three- and two-electrode systems show that this bimetallic compound mentioned here has possible usage in the field of energy storage.
