Porous carbon with heteroatom-doping/metal nanohybrids are of specific interest for many promising applications such as supercapacitors and pollutants removal, while their controllable synthesis is still a considerable challenge. Herein, we report a kind of novel polymorphic porous carbon with N-doping/Ni magnetic nanohybrids (NC@Ni), which can be fabricated via a simple self-jet vapor-phase growth assisted strategy, and the microstructure of the NC@Ni nanohybrids can be facilely controlled through adjusting the stoichiometric ratio of the precursors nickel nitrate hexahydrate and lactose monohydrate. Characterization results show that the fabricated NC@Ni nanohybrids own large specific surface area, ultrahigh nitrogen and oxygen doping content, abundant pore structure and attractive saturation magnetization. When used as supercapacitor electrode material, the typical NC@Ni-1 electrode exhibited an attractive specific capacity of 590C g−1 at 1 A g−1, remarkable rate performance (74.5%, 1–20 A g−1), and excellent cycling stability. Meanwhile, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor delivered an excellent energy density up to 75.1 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 1055 W kg−1. As an adsorbent, the typical product NC@Ni-0.75 displayed high capture capability towards MG dye (889 mg g−1) and phosphate (26.2 mg P g−1) at 25 OC.
