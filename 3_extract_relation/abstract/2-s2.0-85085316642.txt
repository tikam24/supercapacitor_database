Herein, NiCo2O4/C core-shell nanoneedles grown on Ni foam are prepared by a simple route and applied in supercapacitors. Electrochemical results show that the area specific capacitance of NiCo2O4/C reaches 2057 mF/cm2 at 1 mA/cm2, which is about 4 times than that of the pristine NiCo2O4. The electrode exhibits excellent rate capability (92 % of capacitance retention at 10 mA/cm2) and remarkable cycling stability (81 % of capacitance retention after 10000 cycles). The as-fabricated all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (NiCo2O4/C//AC(active carbon)) achieves an energy density of 2 mW h cm−3 at a power density of 37 mW cm−3 and remains 1.6 mW h cm−3 at a power density of 120 mW cm−3. Moreover, the ASC device can retain 87 % capacitance after 4000 cycles. The result reveals that it is a feasible method to achieve excellent performance in energy storage devices by the dipping method.
