This research aims to design and control the Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS). The HESS had been designed by combined the battery and supercapacitor. A lead-acid battery, supercapacitor module and DC-DC converter were used to build the parallel topology of HESS. The battery connected directly to the dc bus, while, the supercapacitor module was connect to the to the dc bus via bidirectional DC-DC converter. The Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) had been used to drive the DC-DC converter. The HESS and the proposed LQR controller simulate in MATLAB/Simulink environment. The response of the proposed controller had been analysed for different coefficients of LQR. The simulation results of LQR show a stable response of the suggested HESS over a wide load range. This hybridization will improve the reliability of HESS and increase the battery life-cycle.
