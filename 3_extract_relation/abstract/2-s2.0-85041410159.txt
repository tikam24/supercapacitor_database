The development of novel energy storage devices with high power density and energy density is highly desired. However, as a promising material, the strong π-π interaction of graphene inhibits its applications. Herein, we provide a new approach that amino-functionalized silica are used as both templates to prevent the restacking of the graphene sheets and doping agents simultaneously. The microstructures, porous properties and chemical composition of the resulted N-doped reduced graphene oxide (RGO) aerogels, characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller measurement, indicate that the amount of SiO2-NH2 has profound effects on the surface area and carbon activity of the graphene sheets. Benefiting from the large specific surface area of 481.8 m2 g−1, low series resistances and high nitrogen doping content (4.4 atom%), the as-fabricated 3D hierarchical porous N-doped RGO aerogel electrode exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance in aqueous and organic electrolyte, such as ultrahigh specific capacitances of 350 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and excellent reversibility with a cycling efficiency of 88% after 10000 cycles. In addition, the N-doped RGO aerogels possess high oil-absorbability with long recyclability.
