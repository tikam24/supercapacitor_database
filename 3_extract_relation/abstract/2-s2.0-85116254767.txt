The Wireless sensor network (WSN) devices are generally battery-powered. Energy harvesting is the most promising solution to prolong the WSN lifetime and deploy a self-powered network. In our work, we have explored thermal energy, radio frequency and light-based energy harvesting techniques. We have proposed a hybrid energy harvesting solution for an indoor environment. We have performed various lab experiments to envisage the limitation associated with harvesting sources and energy storage devices. A WSN powered with a hybrid energy harvesting scheme requires a smart power management methodology. This methodology addresses two aspects, namely, reducing the network downtime and increasing the WSN node operation time in the total blackout of all harvesting sources.
