Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was complexed with a hydrophobic ionic liquid polymer (PIL) via electrostatic interaction to fabricate a carbon precursor. Then, a novel nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) codoped micro-/mesoporous carbon (NSPc) was obtained via direct carbonization of the interpolyelectrolyte BSA@PIL complex. The newly developed NSPc materials exhibited excellent HER/OER electrocatalytic activity and stability, as well as outstanding capacitance performance. Remarkably, NSPc pyrolyzed at 1000 degrees (NSPc-1000) presented an overpotential as low as 172 mV V.S.. RHE (without iR correction) to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm -2 and a Tafel slope of 44.3 mV dec -1 in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 for HER, as well as a low overpotential of 460 mV V.S.. RHE in 0.1 M KOH for OER. Furthermore, NSPc-1000 offers a specific capacitance as high as 495 F g -1 at a current density of 0.1 A g -1 . Such excellent performance of NSPc in electrocatalytic water splitting and supercapacitors originates from the synergistic effects of its N/S-codoping and micro-/mesoporous hierarchical architecture. Our facile protocol through combining biomacromolecules and synthetic polymers offers a new strategy in the development of effective, readily scalable and metal-free heteroatom-doped carbon materials for energy-related applications.
