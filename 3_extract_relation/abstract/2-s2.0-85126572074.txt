Conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) are promising electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage, but their poor redox activity and electric conductivity limit their practical applications. Herein, CMPs obtained from the Buchwald-Hartwig coupling reaction using a spirobifluorene bromide core and p-phenylenediamine linker (SACMPs) are grafted onto the multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) via one-step in situ polymerization. The as-prepared composite (MWCNT@SACMP) exhibits a high surface area of 514 m2g-1, excellent redox activity, and reasonable conductivity. As expected, MWCNT@SACMP presents a high specific capacitance of 594 F g-1at a current density of 1.0 A g-1when the content of MWCNTs is around 10 wt %, which is improved by 252% from the 236 F g-1of SACMP. A symmetric two-electrode supercapacitor assembled with MWCNT@SACMP shows an efficient specific capacitance of 254 F g-1and an energy density of 28.53 W h kg-1at a power density of 900 W kg-1and can retain 84.38% of its initial capacitance after 6000 cycles. This work thus presents a promising CMP/MWCNT composite material for supercapacitor energy storage.
