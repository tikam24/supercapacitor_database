In this present work, microporous functional carbon is prepared by a single step pyrolysis method of dried SargassumWightiiseaweeds (SW) as crushed powder without activation and tested for supercapacitors. Although the complete study presented here on seaweeds of SargassumWightii(SW), the synthesis technique is standard and relevant to most forms of dried biomass. The morphological studies were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Raman spectroscopy (RAMAN), field emission scanning microscopy (FE-SEM) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The behaviour of the functional carbon were performed by using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge and discharge (CD) and Impedance analysis. In aqueous electrolyte (1M H2SO4), by using three-electrode system shows highest capacitance of 354 F/g. Furthermore, it was observed that the carbonized temperature has significant role in the electrochemical performance, as the carbonized sample at 700°C showed best activity compared to the samples carbonized at 800°C and 900°C without any external activation. The electrochemical act obviously shows that the carbon produced from dried SW seaweeds can be used as a favourable material for electrodes in the application of supercapacitors.
