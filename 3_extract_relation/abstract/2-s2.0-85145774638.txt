This work reports for the first time an eco-friendly green synthesis of reduced graphene oxide using bamboo shoot extract. The as-prepared bamboo shoot reduced graphene oxide (BRGO) was characterized with Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Removal of oxygen containing moieties from graphene oxide was confirmed by FTIR and XPS spectroscopy. The UV-Vis and Raman data further confirmed the formation of the reduced graphene oxide. SEM image showed the formation of ultrathin flexible sheet-like assembly with crumpled morphology of BRGO. The electrochemical properties of BRGO samples were further evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). The BRGO showed the highest specific capacitance value of 514.6 F/g at a scan rate of 10 mV/s with charge-transfer resistance of 104.1 ohm. As a result, Bamboo shoot demonstrates its ability to reduce graphene oxide and enhances the efficiency of reduced product for supercapacitor application.
