Metallic nanostructures (MNs) and metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) play a pivotal role by articulating their significance in high‐performance supercapacitors along with conducting polymers (CPs). The interaction and synergistic pseudocapacitive effect of MNs with CPs have contributed to enhance the specific capacitance and cyclic stability. Among various conjugated heterocyclic CPs, polypyrrole (PPy) (prevalently knows as “synthetic metal”) is exclusively studied because of its excellent physicochemical properties, ease of preparation, flexibility in surface modifications, and unique molecular structure–property relationships. Numerous researchers attempted to improve the low electronic conductivity of MNs and MOFs, by incorporating conducting PPy and/or used decoration strategy. This was succeeded by fine‐tuning this objective, which managed to get outstanding supercapacitive performances. This brief technical note epitomizes various PPy‐based metallic hybrid materials with different nano‐architectures, emphasizing its technical implications in fabricating high‐performance electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
