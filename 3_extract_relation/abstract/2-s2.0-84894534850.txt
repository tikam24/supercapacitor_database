High-quality graphene coating was directly grown on stainless steel meshes via chemical vapor deposition process, during which the morphology of the stainless steel was transformed rugged. When the graphene-coated stainless steel meshes were applied as current collectors of supercapacitors, the changes of the appearance and the graphene coating improved the contact between stainless steel meshes and the active materials, thus benefiting the performance of the supercapacitors. Furthermore, this simple method can be used to prepare the enhanced current collectors for other energy storage devices. Â© 2014 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
