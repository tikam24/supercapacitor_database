The rice husk-based activated carbon as the supercapacitor electrode was synthesized by activating pyrolytic char and hydrothermal char at different activation temperatures. The properties and morphology of biochar were analyzed by industrial analysis, elemental analysis and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The crystal structure and electrochemical performance of obtained activated carbons were also characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), raman spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge- discharge. The results indicate that the activated carbon obtained from biochar has excellent capacitance characteristics. The activated carbon (surface area of 3297m2/g) shows the best electrochemical properties, which was prepared via the hydrothermal method at the activation temperature of 800℃. The maximum specific capacitance is 353F/g at 0.2A/g in 6mol/L KOH electrolyte,with a high energy density (12.26W∙h/kg) and retaining highest capacity (84.1%) after 10000 cycles. The activated carbon derived from rice husk exhibited good rate performance,charge-discharge reversibility and cycle stability.
