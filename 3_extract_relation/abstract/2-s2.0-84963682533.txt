Ti3C2Tx MXene, a two-dimensional (2D) early transition metal carbide, has shown an extremely high volumetric capacitance in aqueous electrolytes, but in a narrow voltage window (less than 1.23 V). The utilization of MXene materials in ionic liquid electrolytes with a large voltage window has never been addressed. Here, we report the preparation of the Ti3C2Tx MXene ionogel film by vacuum filtration for use as supercapacitor electrodes operating in 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (EMI-TFSI) neat ionic liquid electrolyte. Due to the disordered structure of the Ti3C2Tx hydrogel film and a stable spacing after vacuum drying, achieved through ionic liquid electrolyte immersion of the Ti3C2Tx hydrogel film, the Ti3C2Tx surface became accessible to EMI+ and TFSI− ions. A capacitance of 70 F g−1 together with a large voltage window of 3 V was obtained at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 in neat EMI-TFSI electrolyte. The electrochemical signature indicates a capacitive behavior even at a high scan rate (500 mV s−1) and a high power performance. This work opens up the possibilities of using MXene materials with various ionic liquid electrolytes.
