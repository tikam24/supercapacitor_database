Ongoing advancements in the field of supercapacitors are making them a viable electric energy storage option, particularly in consumer electronics products and automotive industry. Texan company EEStor is developing an electric energy storage unit (EESU) based on ceramic supercapacitor with a barium-titanate dielectric. The company claims that its system has a specific energy of around 280Wh/kg, compared with about 120 for lithium-ion and 32 for lead gel batteries, and that it will outperform lithium ion batteries in terms of price, charge time, and safety. Lockheed Martin has signed a deal to use EEStor supercapacitors for military and homeland security applications. A team of researchers at the Cambridge University's Electronics Power and Energy Conversion (EPEC) Group has also developed nanoscale supercapacitors made from multiwalled carbon tubes. The key target for the EPEC group's supercapacitors is portable electronic devices, where they will offer much greater performance.
