Supercapacitors (SCs) offer a potential replacement for traditional lithium-based batteries in energy-storage devices thanks to the increased power density and stable charge–discharge cycles, as well as negligible environmental impact. Given this, a vast array of materials has been explored for SCs devices. Among the materials, iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) has gained significant attention in SC devices, owing to its superior specific capacitance, stability, eco-friendliness, abundance, and affordability. However, FeOOH has certain limitations that impact its energy storage capabilities and thus implicate the need for optimizing its structural, crystal, electrical, and chemical properties. This review delves into the latest advancements in FeOOH-based materials for SCs, exploring factors that impact their electrochemical performance. To address the limitations of FeOOH’s materials, several strategies have been developed, which enhance the surface area and facilitate rapid electron transfer and ion diffusion. In this review, composite materials are also examined for their synergistic effects on supercapacitive performance. It investigates binary, ternary, and quaternary Fe-based hydroxides, as well as layered double hydroxides (LDHs). Promising results have been achieved with binder-free Fe-based binary LDH composites featuring unique architectures. Furthermore, the analysis of the asymmetric cell performance of FeOOH-based materials is discussed, demonstrating their potential exploitation for high energy-density SCs that could potentially provide an effective pathway in fabricating efficient, cost-effective, and practical energy storage systems for future exploitations in devices. This review provides up-to-date progress studies of novel FeOOH’s based electrodes for SCs applications.
