The free-standing polyaniline (PANI)-based composite film electrodes were prepared with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and the aniline modified PVC (PVC-An) films as flexible substrates for supercapacitors, via facile in-situ chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline, with conventional chemical oxidative polymerization or rapid-mixing chemical oxidative polymerization technique. Owing to the grafting of PANI from the PVC-An film as substrate and the suppression of the secondary growth of the primary PANI particles in the rapid-mixing chemical oxidative polymerization, the PVC-g-PANI-2 composite film with loose surface possessed better comprehensive performance, accompanying the high specific capacitance (645.3 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g), good rate capacitance (retaining 63.2% of original value at a current density of 10 A/g and 52.0% at a scan rate of 100 mV/s), good cycle stability (retaining 83.1% after 1000 cycles) and the improved internal resistance. Besides its excellent flexibility, it could retain 61.2% of its original specific capacitance under the stress of 8.66 MPa for 1 h, demonstrating a good tensile-resistance.
