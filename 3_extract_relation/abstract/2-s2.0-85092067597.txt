The fluctuating nature of solar energy necessitates suitable energy storage systems. Compared to typical batterybanks, supercapacitors offer longer cycle life eliminating the need to replace them regularly. However, compared to a typicalmaximum power point tracking controller, where the battery bank and resistive load fed by a switch-mode DC-DC converterallows impedance matching for maximum power transfer, a supercapacitor bank's significantly large capacitive load does notpermit the typical impedance matching for maximum power transfer. This study compares the theoretical difference betweenbattery versus supercapacitor energy storage, and highlights of the supercapacitor-assisted LED converter technique inachieving high-efficiency renewable energy-based DC-microgrid systems.
