Highly uniform Co(OH)2 hexagonal nanoflakes were synthesized by using a facile room temperature solution-phase and green process. The Co(OH)2 hexagonal nanoflakes were applied as anode materials for supercapacitor. Owing to the unique structural features, the hexagonal nanoflake possessed typical pseudocapacitor and good cycling stability and rate capability.
