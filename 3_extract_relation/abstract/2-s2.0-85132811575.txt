Co3O4@NiMoO4 composite electrode material with Co3O4 nanowire as precursor has been successfully prepared by hydrothermal method and treatment of thermal annealing. The results of this work show the phase characterization, morphology characterization and electrochemical testing. At the current density of 1 mA/cm2, the specific capacitance of the Co3O4@NiMoO4 electrode material is 3940 mF/cm2 and exceptional cycling stability is 84% after 10000 cycles. Furthermore, the Co3O4@NiMoO4//AC device demonstrates an outstanding energy density of 102.52 mWh/cm3 at power density of 2703.82 mW/cm3 and outstanding long-term cycling stability of 78.2% after 12000 cycles. These remarkable results indicate that the unique Co3O4@NiMoO4 nanorod structure is a promising cathode electrode material in high-performance supercapacitors applications.
