Carbon materials have been widely used in electrochemistry filed such as supercapacitors because of the good conductivity, abundant sources and low prices. Further improving the electrochemical performance of carbon materials still attracts the interest of researchers. In this work, nitrogen-doped mesoporous hollow carbon microcages (N-MHCC) are successfully prepared by combining hard and soft template method. This hierarchically porous structure (meso- & micro-pore) of N-MHCC provides a large number of active centers, sufficient space and reaction interface, promoting the rapid diffusion of electron and electrolyte ions transport. By comparing the electrochemical performance of nitrogen-doped hollow carbon microcages (N-HCC) and N-MHCC, it can be calculated that N-MHCC shows high specific capacitance of 210.66 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 while N-HCC only shows 132.6 F g−1. The cycle retention rate of N-MHCC is as high as 96.92 % at 5 A g−1 after 4000 cycles. Furthermore, the simple preparation method and attractive performance make N-MHCC a promising candidate for high performance supercapacitors.
