Developments during the past decade, electrode materials have been tuned to the nanoscale and electrolytes have gained an active role enabling more efficient storage mechanism; hence increasing the performance of supercapacitors manifold. In porous carbon materials with sub-nanometer pores, the desolvation of the ions leads to surprisingly high capacitances. Oxide materials store charge by surface redox reactions which are the foremost to the pseudo capacitive effect. Understanding the physical mechanisms underlying charge storage in these materials is important for further development of supercapacitors. This brief overview focuses on the different types of recent developed (asymmetric, pseudo) supercapacitors, experimental strategies, fabrication procedure, and electrochemical properties based on nanomaterials which have been reported recently for their high-quality performance, the relevant quantitative modeling history and the future of supercapacitor research and development.
