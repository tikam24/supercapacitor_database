Supercapacitors possessing fast-charging characteristics and long lifespan are becoming increasingly important for powering portable and smart energy storage devices, and combining capacitive and battery-type materials into an integrated device is an effective method for increasing the overall performance of capacitors. Silicene is being designed as a cathode for the development of enhanced capacitance and ultra-cycle stable zinc-ion hybrid capacitors. Possessing a maximum areal capacity of 14 mF cm-2, a maximum power density of 9 mW cm-2, capacitance retention of 112% even after 10 000 cycles, and an unexpectedly high energy density of 23 mJ cm-2, this achievement of the zinc-ion hybrid capacitor would be superior to that of previously reported silicon-based supercapacitors. The DFT calculations further reveal that Zn ions dominate the capacitive behavior of the silicene electrode. The support association between silicene and zinc-ion hybrid capacitors so that they can take advantage of each other's strengths, which takes electrochemical energy technology to a stage, offering a straightforward proposal for integration and implementation of silicon-based materials.
