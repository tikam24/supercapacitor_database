The paper presents a model of a current source inverter for charging of energy storage elements. Simulation models of the converter have been developed. The converters for charging of energy storage elements operate in transient mode and the mode depends on the value of the voltage to which the element is charged as well as its internal resistance. When charging supercapacitor banks, the voltage changes over a wide range. This leads to considerable changes in the operating modes of the converters which makes the analysis complex. The created model allows model-based design and research of the converter operation modes in such applications.
