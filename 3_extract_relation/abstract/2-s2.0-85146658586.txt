The present work includes the synthesis and characterization of zinc ferrite (ZnFe2O4)/graphene nanosheets composite as electrodes for supercapacitor application. The structural properties were studied using x-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. The synthesized electrode was further analyzed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy for surface morphology, which confirm the particle adherences between ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles and graphene nano-sheets. The SEM images also confirmed a highly porous structure leading to excellent ion transportability, and a larger surface area for high amounts of charge storage. The device performance of the ZnFe2O4/graphene nanosheets as electrodes was tested via electrochemical analysis, cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The device exhibited excellent capacitive performance with a specific capacitance of 789.2 Fg−1 calculated at a 5-mV/s−1 scan rate.
