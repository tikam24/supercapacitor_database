This effort presents state-of-the-art review on polymer/graphene quantum dot (GQD) nanocomposite. GQD, zero-dimensional material with one to few layers of graphene (size <20 nm), is becoming multifunctional nanofiller for polymers due to optical, electronic, photoelectric, photoluminescence, and other physical properties. GQD along with molecularly imprinted polymers have found significance in fuel cells, biosensors, detectors, and metal ion recovery. Main emphasis was to see combined effect of polymer and GQD in polymeric nanocomposite expending polyaniline, polypyrrole, poly(vinyl fluoride), poly(vinyl alcohol), etc. The cutting edge applications of polymer/GQD nanocomposite exposed so far comprise supercapacitor, sensor, polymer solar cell, bioimaging, and memory devices.
