With the increasing demand for miniaturization and portable energy storage system, it is an urgent necessary that developing high volumetric energy density supercapacitors with small volumes. Herein, an integrated self-supporting CoZnNiS@CNTs/rGO composite film electrode with the thickness of about 6 μm was designed. In the unique structure, porous CNTs/rGO film is served as conductive substrate to support the CoZn-MOFs derived vertically oriented two-dimensional CoZnNiS nanoarrays. The self-supporting film endows the electrode a high volumetric mass density of 1.28 g cm−3 and superior electron-ion transport channel, which displays a maximum specific capacitance of 1349.2 F g−1 as well as high volumetric capacity of 1727.0 F cm−3 at 1 A g−1. Besides, a porous film of pure carbon materials (carbon spheres integrated graphene) was designed and used as the negative electrode in supercapacitor. When assembled a hybrid supercapacitor based on the above two self-supporting electrodes, the device delivers up an ultra-high volumetric/gravimetric energy density of 65.2 W h L−1 (60.4 W h kg−1) at a power density of 1308 W L−1 (1200 W kg−1). Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitor also displays an ultra-long lifetime with 90.6% retention after 10,000 cycles. These outstanding performances make the CoZnNiS@CNTs/rGO electrode could be a promising candidate for next-generation high volumetric/gravimetric energy density supercapacitors, especially in the limited space.
