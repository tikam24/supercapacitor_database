In order to improve the electrochemical performance of activated carbon fiber and increase its specific capacitance,PAN-based activated carbon fiber (ACF) prepared by one-step activation method is modified by means of hydrothermal method using nickel nitrate and cobalt nitrate as metal sources and urea as alkali source,which has its surface uniformly loaded with urchin-like nickel-cobalt oxide (ACF/NiCo2O4).The morphology and composition of the sample are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD),and its electrochemical performance is tested by using a three-electrode system.The results show that the mass specific capacitance of the sample reaches 469.4 F·g-1 at a current density of 1 A·g-1,and the voltage drop is only -0.004 5 V.After 5 000 cycles of charge-discharge,the capacitance retention rate is 97.87%,proving that ACF/ NiCo2O4 material has a larger specific capacitance and a good cycle stability,and can be used as a good supercapacitor electrode material.
