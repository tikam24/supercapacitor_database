In hybrid energy storage systems of electric vehicles the supercapacitors are used to absorb energy during braking and to deliver it during acceleration. Energy losses in real capacitors depend on driving dynamics. Losses in supercapacitors can be determined using the fractional order model of their impedance. The article also presents the simplified method of estimating energy losses in supercapacitors during periodic braking and acceleration cycle.
