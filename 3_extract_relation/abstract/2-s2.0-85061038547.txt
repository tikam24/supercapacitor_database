Nickel sulfides are desirable electrode materials for supercapacitors, while low electronic conductivity and poor cyclic stability restrict their wide applications. Herein, Ni 2 CoS 4 /expanded graphite (Ni 2 CoS 4 /EG) composite was prepared in mixed solvents of ethylene glycol and H 2 O via a rapid and energy-saving microwave heating method. Scanning transmission electron microscopy image shows that Ni 2 CoS 4 particles are ultrafine with an average diameter of 2 nm and uniformly distributed on expanded graphite. The specific capacitance of the Ni 2 CoS 4 /EG composite can reach up to 2056.8 F g −1 at 5 A g −1 as compared to 1574.4 F g −1 of Ni 3 S 4 , 229.1 F g −1 of CoS and 1516.6 F g −1 of Ni 2 CoS 4 ; and even at higher current density of 30 A g −1 , the specific capacitance can still demonstrates 1923.3 F g −1 , thus 92.5% of rate capability can be achieved as the current density increases from 5 to 30 A g −1 . Moreover, it exhibits an excellent stability of 94.4% after cycling at current density of 30 A g −1 for 2000 cycles. The composite delivers high initial capacitance, excellent rate capability, and fantastic stability. Furthermore, the fabricated AC//Ni 2 CoS 4 /EG asymmetric supercapacitor also exhibits a high specific capacitance of 120.3 F g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 , an superior cycle life (91% at 5 A g −1 for 5000 cycles), and an extremely high energy density of 52 Wh kg −1 at 477 W kg −1 . This work offers a new insight to synthesize ultrafine bimetallic sulfides, and the superior high performances of the Ni 2 CoS 4 /EG composite can provide practical applications in supercapacitors.
