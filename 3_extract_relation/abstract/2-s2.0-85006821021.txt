Primary intention of this paper is to provide a study of Graphene applications such as Optoelectronics, Wearable Technologies, Energy storing devices and Radio Transmission and broadcasting. For understanding the Graphene as a material, its mechanical, chemical, electrical and optical properties are discussed. Brief history about the discovery of Graphene is also included. The electronics industry has come way far in development of semiconductors, their operation. Where the horizon of Silicon semiconductors ends, Graphene comes into picture. Graphene due to its exclusive and extensive properties along with being cheap and easily accessible can be used in designing and manufacturing of several devices. There are immense opportunities to use Graphene technology in future communication, electronics, medical and other fields, as discussed in the article.
