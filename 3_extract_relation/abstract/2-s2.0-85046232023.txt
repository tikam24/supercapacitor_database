Well-developed microstructure, excellent stability, good conductivity, high specific surface area (SSA) and low cost make porous carbons be investigated most intensively among various available materials for the supercapacitor (SC) electrodes. For the reason to develop the pore network of porous carbons, chemical activation is often carried out. Among various chemical activation methods, KOH activation is widely used because of its lower activation temperature, less activation time, and higher yields. This feature article is expected to give a vivid description about the progress of KOH-activated porous carbons and their applications to SC.
