A kind of ruthenium oxide with smaller particles and higher porosity was prepared by a sol-gel process with RuCl3·xH2O and NaHCO3 solution. Several details concerning this new material, including crystal structure, particle size as functions of the temperature, and electrochemical properties were also reported. The optimal annealing temperature was 210°C and the powder annealed at this temperature had a rate capacitance of 541 F/g. In addition, the rate capacitance of the composite electrode reached 802 F/g after 10% carbon black was added, much higher than any previously reported value. High energy density supercapacitors were built with the newly discovered electrode material. Energy densities as high as 67 J/g were obtained based on the RuO2·xH2O alone. By introducing the highly porous carbon black into the electrode, energy densities great than 100 J/g could be achieved. The power density of the capacitor was enhanced significantly. © 2006 Chinese Physical Society.
