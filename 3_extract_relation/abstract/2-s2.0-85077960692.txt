Starch derived activated carbons are prepared at different carbonization temperatures of 700°C, 800 °C and 900°C. Good porous morphology of the prepared activated carbon was found in scanning electron microscopy study. Three supercapacitor cells were fabricated by using the prepared activated carbon as an electrode material and 6M KOH as an electrolyte. Electrochemical testing of the supercapacitor were made by using the well known three techniques as; cyclic voltammetry, Impedance Spectroscopy and charge-discharge. Outcomes of these studies suggested that the activated carbon prepared at 800°C exhibits much better capacitive assets than the other two. Analyzing electrochemical properties of fabricated supercapacitor cells by Impedance Spectroscopy, a lowest bulk resistance 0.231 ohm cm2 and charge transfer resistance 1.44 ohm cm2 was found for activated carbon 800°C among all of three. The experimental impedance data were fitted successfully by using theoretical electrical equivalent circuit model of the supercapacitor. For the optimized supercapacitor, the calculated specific capacitance from the cyclic voltammetry method is found 261.3 F g-1 at a voltage scan rate of 20 mV s-1. By analyzing charge-discharge data the observed specific capacitance was 230.5 F g-1 and it was correspond to the specific energy and specific power of 17.2 Wh Kg-1 and 983 W Kg-1, respectively. These outcomes represent the potentiality of the supercapacitor to be used in various microelectronic circuits.
