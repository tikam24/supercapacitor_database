Supercapacitors and batteries have been widely used in portable electronic devices and electric vehicles requiring safety and reliable devices. The improvement in the supercapacitors and battery performance can be achieved by the tuning of the electroactive material architecture used in the construction of such devices. A broad range of different kind of material has been investigated such as conducting polymers, transition metals oxides, graphene and carbon nanotubes, all of them presented in a different morphology, as nanosheets, nanorods, nanowires, nanotubes, nanoflowers, nanofibers, etc. This short review brings out the main approaches about the conducting polymers and composites nanowires for energy devices application. Methods of synthesis, combination of materials and applications are discussed in terms of supercapacitors and Lithium-ion batteries.
