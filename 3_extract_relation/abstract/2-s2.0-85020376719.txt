With the aim of improving conductivity and shortening diffusion length, the conductive polymer polyaniline shell was grown on the surface of gold nanoparticles via in-situ polymerization, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analyses. The core-shell nano-Au@PANI with an average diameter of 22.17 nm as well as the nano-Au with an average diameter of 18.52 nm was prepared. Electrochemical investigation by using CHI660E workstation exhibits that the prepared material has good electrochemical performance and the highest specific capacitance is up to 285.0 F g−1, far higher than that of the pristine PANI, 115.0 F g−1; after 4000 cycles, nano-Au@PANI displays better cycle stability compare with that of pristine PANI. Furthermore, nano-Au@PANI are combined with AC to fabricate the hybrid supercapacitor of nano-Au@PANI//AC, which shows a maximum energy density of 7.01 W h kg−1 with the power density of 260 W kg−1; and the maximum power density of 4.2 kW kg−1 and energy density of 1.74 W h kg−1.
