The article presents the results of the transients investigation of a DC-DC converter as a part of the energy storage system in the frequency-controlled electric drive which works in hard start-up and braking modes with a large number of cycles per hour. The ultracapacitor is used as an energy storage element connected with the DC link of the frequency converter through the bidirectional DC-DC converter. The block diagram of alternating current electric drive is described. The circuit diagram and the equivalent circuit of the energy storage system as well as the simulation results of the processes occurring in the system 'energy storage device - frequency converter DC link' in order to identify the specific properties of the system as a control object are shown. In conclusion, the specific properties of the DC-DC converter are formulated. The presented investigation results show the operation modes features of the DC-DC converter as the energy storage system part. This information can be used for choosing the structure and the method of controllers' synthesis for the automatic control system of the bidirectional DC-DC converter.
