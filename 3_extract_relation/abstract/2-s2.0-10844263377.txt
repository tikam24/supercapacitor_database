Carbon nanofibres have been prepared by a floating catalyst procedure at industrial scale in a metallic furnace. The nanofibres (50-500 nm diameter and 5-200 μm length) are grown from the Fe particles used as catalyst. Soot appears together with the carbon nanofibres. The sample has been chemically activated using KOH as activating agent. Scanning electron microscopy has shown a smooth surface for the as-prepared carbon nanofibres but a rough surface for the activated ones. The specific surface area increases from 13 to 212 m 2/g due to the activation. The volume of the micropores (in the 1-2 nm range) and the mesopores (2-5 nm range), as deduced by density functional theory methods, also increases after the activation. Electrochemical behaviour of the as-prepared and activated carbon nanofibres has been tested in a supercapacitor at laboratory scale using 6 M KOH aqueous solution as electrolyte. The specific capacitance, which is less than 1 F/g for the as-prepared sample, increase up to ≈60 F/g for the activated sample. Only a slight decrease in capacitance has been observed as the current density increases. Specific power of ≈100 W/kg at specific energy of 1 Wh/kg has been found in some particular cases. We have compared the electrochemical parameters of our activated carbon nanofibres with those of activated carbon nanofibres coming from a commercial sample; the latter was activated by the same way as our sample. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
