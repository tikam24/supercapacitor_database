Bamboo nanocellulose can be regarded as a promising biomass material for the preparation of sustainable energy devices due to its unique structure, excellent properties, and wide range of sources. A highly conductive electrochemical energy storage was synthesized due to the excellent electrical conductivity of graphene and the high surface area of nanocellulose and graphene, which was beneficial for producing a network structure. The symmetric capacitor assembled from the Phyllostachys pubescens nanocellulose/graphene aerogel (CGA) electrode exhibited a high specific capacitance of 125.5 F/g at 5 mV/s and extreme stability of 98.3% capacitance retention ratio after 5000 cycles at 2 A/g. This nanocellulose-graphene electrode showed potential for future high-performance supercapacitors.
