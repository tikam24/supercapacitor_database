Biomass waste carbon sources enjoy a place of pride because of their low-cost, environmentally friendly, and readily available nature. The development of an efficient approach to transform biomass wastes into functional carbon-based electrode materials is a hot topic. However, the production process of biologically-based activated carbon needs to be further improved. Here, discarded badminton shuttlecock feathers were used as precursor via activation with potassium ferrate (K2FeO4) to prepare hierarchical porous carbon. The obtained carbon material with hierarchical pore structure displays a high specific surface area (SBET) of 1279.5 m2 g−1, large total pore volume (Vtotal) of 0.73 cm3 g−1 ,and high-level hetero-atom doping (N: 3.78 at.%, O: 7.5 at.%, S: 3.85 at.%). Experimental results reveal that the as-prepared FPCB-750–1:3 exhibits an excellent specific capacitance (Cg) of up to 449 F g−1 at the current density of 0.1 A g−1. Moreover, even at 10 A g−1, the FPCB-750–1:3 electrode still presents a high capacitance of 216 F g−1. In addition, the energy density (ED) of the FPCB-750–1:3//FPCB-750–1:3 symmetric cell reaches 56 Wh kg−1 at a power density (PD) of 720 W kg−1 in an aqueous electrolyte (1 M Na2SO4), meanwhile maintaining a high-class long-term electrochemical stability (fading lower than 4% after 10,000 cycles of charging and discharging). This study provides a trustworthy method to produce promising electrode materials from waste biomass for high-performance supercapacitors. Graphical Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
