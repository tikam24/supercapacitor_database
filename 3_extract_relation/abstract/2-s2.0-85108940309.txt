As one of the most promising electrode materials for supercapacitors, MnO2 has the problems of low voltage window and poor conductivity. It has been shown that Al-doped MnO2 can effectively improve the voltage window and specific capacitance, and polyaniline loading can further bring higher specific capacitance. Polyaniline-supported Al-doped MnO2 carbon cloth-based flexible electrode material (PANI@Al-MnO2@CC) was prepared by hydrothermal reaction and in-situ polymerization. Compared with MnO2 electrode material, the working voltage window of PANI@Al-MnO2@CC is increases to 1.25 V, the area specific capacitance can be as high as 1016 mF cm−2, and still maintain 80.1% of the original value at 20 mA cm−2 after 5000 cycles. Furthermore, the voltage window of the flexible symmetrical supercapacitor made of the material can reach 0–2.4 V, and has a super large area specific capacitance of 149.75 mF cm−2 and a high energy density of 1.60 mWh cm−3 at 6 mA cm−2.
