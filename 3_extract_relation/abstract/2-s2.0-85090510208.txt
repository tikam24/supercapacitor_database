In this paper, manganese dioxide nanosheets@carbon nanospheres electrode material was prepared by liquid phase precipitation method. XRD analysis showed that the synthesized material was in the form of sodium manganese dioxide. Electrochemical measurements showed that the introduction of appropriate amount of carbon nanospheres significantly improved the electrochemical properties of the materials, and the 100 mol% carbon nanospheres composite material had the best specific volume: the specific capacity was 166.3 F • g-1 at the current density of 1 A • g-1. When the current density increased to 10 A • g-1, the specific volume remained at 135.9 F • g-1, and the capacitance retention rate was 95.1% after 2 000 cycles, which indicated that the material had excellent rate capacity and high stability. Maybe that's because the elevated conductivity increased active sites number of sodium manganese with the introduction of carbon nanospheres.
