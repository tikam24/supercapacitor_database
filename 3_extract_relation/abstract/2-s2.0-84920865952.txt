A facile one-step method of growing nickel/iron layered double hydroxide (Ni/Fe-LDH) films with nanosheet structures on Ti sheet is presented and the electrochemical performance is investigated. Cyclic voltammogram of Ni/Fe-LDH electrode shows a pair of well-defined redox peaks at -0.4âˆ¼-1.4 V, which is quite different with the previous reports on LDHs used for supercapacitors. This result implies the Ni/Fe-LDH may be an alternative for the cathode of the asymmetric supercapacitors.
