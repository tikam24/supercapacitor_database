Traditional stretchable supercapacitors, possessing a thin electrode and a 2D shape, have limited areal specific areal capacitance and are incompatible with 3D wearables. To overcome the limitations of 2D stretchable supercapacitors, it is highly desirable to develop 3D stretchable supercapacitors with higher mass loading and customizable shapes. In this work, a new 3D stretchable supercapacitor inspired by a honeycomb lantern based on an expandable honeycomb composite electrode composed of polypyrrole/black-phosphorous oxide electrodeposited on carbon nanotube film is reported. The 3D stretchable supercapacitors possessing device-thickness-independent ion-transport path and stretchability can be crafted into customizable device thickness for enhancing the specific areal energy storage and integrability with wearables. Notably, a 1.0 cm thick rectangular-shaped supercapacitor shows enhanced specific areal capacitance of 7.34 F cm−2, which is about 60 times higher than that of the original 2D supercapacitor (120 mF cm−2) at a similar discharge rate. The 3D supercapacitor can also maintain a capacitance ratio of 95% even under the reversible strain of 2000% after 10 000 stretch-and-release cycles, superior to state-of-the-art stretchable supercapacitors. The enhanced specific areal energy storage and the customizablility in shapes of the 3D stretchable supercapacitors show immense promise in a wide range of applications in stretchable and wearable electronics.
