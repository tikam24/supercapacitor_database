Controllable construction of graphene into specific architectures at macroscopic scales is crucial for practical applications of graphene. An approach of macroscopic and conductive interconnected graphene networks with controllable patterns, pore, and skeleton sizes via chemical vapor deposition is reported here. Specifically, the pore and skeleton sizes of 3D controllable graphene (3D-CG) architectures can be tuned from 10 to 50 μm and the orientation angles of building blocks can be designed as 45° and 90°. The electrical conductivity and density of 3D-CGs are measured at 60-80 S cm-1 and ≈3.6 mg cm-3, respectively. The properties of 3D-CGs as flexible conductors and supercapacitor electrodes are reported, to explore the potential application in wearable devices and energy store.
