Electrochemical capacitors or supercapacitors are the new generation of energy storage devices to store electrical charge, and possibly provide high power densities and long life cycle compared to other storage devices (e.g., Li-ion, lead acid and alkaline batteries). Graphene nanoflakes, carbon blacks, carbon nanofibers, carbon nanotubes, aerogels and metal oxides are some of the examples that have a high surface area, storage capacity, and conductivity for supercapacitor applications. This study is mainly focused on the effects of carbon inclusions on the physical properties of the polymeric separators / membranes for a higher ionic conductivity. In the present research, carbon black nanopowders were incorporated with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF) at different concentrations, and then electrospun at various spinning conditions, such as distance, electrical potential, solvent concentrations and pump speed. Electrical, thermal and surface hydrophobicity properties of the polymeric membranes were investigated in detail. Test results showed that the physical properties of the new materials were significantly enhanced in the presence of nanoscale inclusions, which may be useful for supercapacitor applications in the future.
