Over the past decades, numerous scientists have focused on designing complicated monomers, developing new synthesis protocols, and optimizing chemical structures for realizing high-performance organic or polymer electronics and energy storage devices. However, much less attention has been paid to ionic- and radical-rich porous organic films, which are essential components of aforementioned devices. In this study, an air-stable, large-area, free-standing, and viologen-linked ionic porous polymer (denoted as IPP-V) film is developed in situ through electrochemical polymerization. This film is applied to a device by sandwiching it between indium tin oxide (ITO) and Au (i.e., ITO/IPP-V/Au); the device exhibits a memristive behavior with an ON–OFF current ratio of ≈2. After the IPP-V film is subjected to thermal pyrolysis at 500 °C, the as-produced film (denoted as IPP-V-500) acts as an active material for an in-plane micro-supercapacitor and exhibits a high volumetric capacitance level of up to 4.44 F cm−3. This work not only offers a new and convenient strategy toward large-area ionic porous polymer films for memristor, but also provides a new porous polymer derived carbon film for energy storage.
