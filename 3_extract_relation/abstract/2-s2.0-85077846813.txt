Among the popular electrochemical energy storage devices, supercapacitors (SCs) have attracted much attention due to their long cycle life, fast charge and discharge, safety, and reliability. Transition metal oxides are one of the most widely used electrode materials in SCs because of the high specific capacitance. Among various transition metal oxides, Co3O4 and related composites are widely reported in SCs electrodes. In this review, we introduce the synthetic methods of Co3O4, including the hydrothermal/solvothermal method, solâ€“gel method, thermal decomposition, chemical precipitation, electrodeposition, chemical bath deposition, and the template method. The recent progress of Co3O4-containing electrode materials is summarized in detail, involving Co3O4/carbon, Co3O4/conducting polymer, and Co3O4/metal compound composites. Finally, the current challenges and outlook of Co3O4 and Co3O4-containing composites are put forward.
