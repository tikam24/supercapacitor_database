The present chapter deals with strategies for optimizing the development of smart flexible electronics presented a new type of device having a great potential for versatile applications. The widespread commercialization of flexible electronics is limited by the lack of incorporation of energy storage since conventional devices such as supercapacitors are bulky and heavy. Therefore, it is compulsory to develop new energy storage integrated on flexible substrates and used for example in the smart textile industry. The introduction of flexible devices with excellent electrochemical performances become a great challenge to provide the requirements for daily applications. Carbonaceous-based nanomaterials show versatile advantages. Therefore, they have been considered useful in different applications, especially as energy storage devices. This concept gives rise to an inspiration for comprehensive utilization of Carbonaceous-based nanomaterials with a green, and low-cost process to contribute to an affordable, reliable, and modern eco-friendly energy storage devices.
