A comparative study is made between the structure and electrochemical properties of Copper-Zinc (Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4) ferrite nanoparticles prepared by chemical co-precipitation. The obtained ferrites are characterized by FT-IR, XRD, BET, and SEM techniques. The single-phase cubic formation of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nano ferrites without any impurity peaks is confirmed by XRD analysis. FT-IR spectrum exposes the occurrence of vibrating modes analogous to the cubic-spinel ferrite structure of Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nano ferrites. The magnetic hysteresis curve displays the superparamagnetic nature of the Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nano ferrites. The electrochemical properties of obtained ferrites are studied using cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The as-synthesized Cu0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 sample acts as an excellent electrode material in a supercapacitor with a high specific capacitance energy density and a power density.
