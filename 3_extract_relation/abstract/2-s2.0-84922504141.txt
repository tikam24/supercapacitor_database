Graphite-like C3N4 hybridized Î²-Ni(OH)2 with flower-like structure is successfully synthesized via a facile hydrothermal route. Due to the introduction of g-C3N4, Ni(OH)2 nanoplates convert to flower-like morphology, which provides excellent ion diffusion and electron transport. As a result, g-C3N4/Ni(OH)2(1) exhibits a specific capacitance of 505.6 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g, higher than that of the pure Ni(OH)2 (228 F/g). The experimental results indicate that the as-prepared samples are promising materials for high-performance supercapacitor.
