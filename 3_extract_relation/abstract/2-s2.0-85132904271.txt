Electrochemical performance of electrode in structural supercapacitor is much lower than that in common supercapacitor owing to solidification confinement of ions movement. Herein, NiCo2O4/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets are firstly assembled with KOH/polyacrylic acid (PAA)/cement, LiOTf/PAA cement, KOH/polyethylene oxide (PEO) cement and LiOTf/PEO cement into four structural supercapacitors through hydration process. As the NiCo2O4 content in NiCo2O4/rGO composite exceeds 13 wt%, the areal capacitance of NiCo2O4/rGO electrode at high current densities decreases. The (13%) NiCo2O4/rGO electrode presents the best electrochemical performances with initial areal capacitance of 3.16 F cm-2 at 0.5 mA cm-2, capacitance retention rate of 61% after current density increasing by 80-fold and retention of 86.1% after 10000 cycles at 10 mA cm-2. The corresponding four structural supercapacitors show superior electrochemical performances with areal capacitances of ∼330.4 mF cm-2, coulombic efficiencies of ∼100%, power densities of ∼2.7 mW cm-2 and energy densities of ∼0.64 mWh cm-2. The electrochemical efficiencies of (13%) NiCo2O4/rGO electrodes in four structural supercapacitor devices are in the range of 0.16 ∼0.12, which are prominent in high-end structural supercapacitors. Thus NiCo2O4/rGO electrode is demonstrated to enhance the electrochemical matching with polymer cement electrolyte for structural supercapacitor.
