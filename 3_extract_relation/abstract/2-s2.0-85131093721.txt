With the increasing use of electronics in everyday life, safe and effective energy storage devices have become a necessity. Methods to implement maximum possible charge storage along with compact size, economic feasibility, faster charging and discharging rates are few goals currently being chased by the research community. Supercapacitors can be a revolutionary technology in this regard and contribute to sustainable development in the energy sector. Novel methods of electrode material synthesis and design that are economically feasible, environmentally friendly and exhibit better charge storage capabilities are needed for developing next generation supercapacitors. The journey of graphene-based supercapacitors from 2006 has been quite interesting. However, with graphene and other carbon-based materials, new developments are required to meet the high-power density requirements. This paper discusses the design of future supercapacitor electrodes based on ordered mesoporous carbon structures. The ordered nature of mesoporous network would ensure better electrode electrolyte interaction and faster charge movement resulting in better charging rates. Such supercapacitors are expected to outperform even the best contemporary supercapacitors of today
