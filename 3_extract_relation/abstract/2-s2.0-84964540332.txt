Urchin-like Î±-MnO 2 nanostructures were successfully synthesized via a simple hydrothermal process at different synthesis temperatures without using any template or surfactant. The microstructure and morphology of as-synthesized products were systematically investigated by focused ion beam, transmission electron microscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The electrochemical test of the prepared MnO 2 exhibits ideal cyclic voltammetry behavior, high specific capacitance (151.5 F g -1 at a current density of 1 A g -1 ) and excellent cycling stability (93.4% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles) which suggests its promising application as supercapacitor.
