A three-dimensional (3D) N-doped porous carbon/graphene (NPCG) network structure has been prepared via a novel three-step route. PPy/GO composites (PGO) were first synthesized by in situ polymerization of Py in GO solution. Second, PGO was treated by a hydrothermal process. Finally, NPCG was obtained by chemical activation of PGO treated with KOH. The morphology and structure of NPCG were characterized by means of XPS, SEM, and N2 adsorption/desorption measurements, and the influence of the mass ratio of GO/Py and activation temperature on electrochemical performance of NPCG were systematically investigated. NPCG prepared with mass ratios of GO/Py and PGO/ KOH is 1/15, and 1/3, respectively, at 650 â„ƒ, showed the highest specific capacitance of 398 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g. Moreover, 94% of the specific capacitance was retained after 1000 cycles at a high current density of 10 A/g.
