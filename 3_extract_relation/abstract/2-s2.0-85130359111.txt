Biomass is an attractive source to obtain carbon materials due to availability and low cost of a feedstock on one hand, and eco-friendly synthesis on the other hand. A number of advanced carbon nanomaterials, such as aerogels, quantum dots, graphene sponge, can be produced from solid wastes of woodworking, agriculture and food industry. In this chapter, synthesis, morphology and functional properties of carbon formations that are derived from cellulose, chitosan and alginates are considered, especially cellulose of plant and bacterial origin, which is most commonly used for the preparation of carbon nanomaterials, is in a focus of attention. This polysaccharide can be used for modifying ceramics for baromembrane separation: carbon nanostructures are formed directly inside the pores of ceramic support. Carbon aerogels are used as supercapacitor electrodes and liquid absorbers, quantum dots are used as luminescent materials.
