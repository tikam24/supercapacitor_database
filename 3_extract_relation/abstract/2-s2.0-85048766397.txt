Here we report the supercapacitive properties of a novel MoO3-x/TiO2 nanotube composite prepared by a facile galvanostatic deposition technique and subsequently thermal treatment in an argon atmosphere between 350 °C and 550 °C. X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirm the existence of MoO3-x. The MoO3-x/TiO2 electrode prepared at 550 °C exhibits a high specific capacitance of 23.69 mF cm-2 at a scan rate of 10 mV s-1 and good cycling stability with capacitance retention of 86.6% after 1000 cycles in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. Our study reveals a feasible method for the fabrication of TiO2 nanotubes modified with electroactive MoO3-x as high-performance electrode materials for supercapacitors.
