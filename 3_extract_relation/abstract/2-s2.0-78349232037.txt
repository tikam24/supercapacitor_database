In this paper, different modeling approaches representing the behavior of supercapacitors are presented. A hybrid modeling approach is developed to improve the characterization of classical supercapacitor models proposed in the literature. This approach uses various representations (frequency and temporal results) of the same cycling test to extract easily and with a good precision the parameters of the models. Then, it is applied for studying the ageing of this component, which mainly depends on the temperature and cycling process. Â© 2010 IEEE.
