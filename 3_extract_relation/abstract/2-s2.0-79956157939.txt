Conducting polymer with 1D nanostructure exhibits excellent electrochemical performances but a poor cyclability that limits its use in supercapacitors. In this work, a novel composite electrode made of polyaniline nanowire-titania nanotube array was synthesized via a simple and inexpensive electrochemical route by electropolymerizing aniline onto an anodized titania nanotube array. The specific capacitance was as high as 732 F g-1 at 1 A g -1, which remained at 543 F g-1 when the current density was increased by 20 times. 74% of the maximum energy density (36.6 Wh kg -1) was maintained even at a high power density of 6000 W kg -1. An excellent long cycle life of the electrode was observed with a retention of ∼86% of the initial specific capacitance after 2000 cycles. The good electrochemical performance was attributed to the unique microstructure of the electrode with disordered PANI nanowire arrays encapsulated inside the TiO2 nanotubes, providing high surface area, fast diffusion path for ions and long-term cycle stability. Such a nanocomposite electrode is attractive for supercapacitor applications. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
