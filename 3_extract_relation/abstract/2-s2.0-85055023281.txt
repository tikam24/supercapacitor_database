In an aqueous mixture of manganese acetate, ammonium acetate and pyrrole, PPy and MnO2 composite materials (PPy-MnO2) are synthesized by i-t technology at 0.9 V vs. SCE. The influences of manganese acetate to pyrrole in the electro-codeposition solution on morphologies and charge storage properties of the composite are discussed. PPy-MnO2 composite materials as the electrode material exhibit a wide charge-storage potential window of 1.2 V (between −0.3 and 0.9 V vs. SCE) and a high specific capacitance of 345.54 F g−1 at 2 mA cm−2. A symmetric flexible supercapacitor (PPy-MnO2//PPy-MnO2) is assembled by using PPy-MnO2 composite electrodes. PPy-MnO2//PPy-MnO2 model supercapacitor displays almost 100% capacitance retention on the different bending angles. The energy density of 37.63 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 830 W kg−1 and an immense cyclic charge-discharge stability, the specific capacitance is lost less than 3% after the 10,000 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles. The successful synthesis of high performance composite electrodes using electro-codeposition method could open up new opportunities for high energy density supercapacitors.
