It is essential to design stable and unique carbon nanostructures for the enhancement of supercapacitor performance, but they still have difficulty with excellent ion transportation, lasting capacitance activity and high rate capability. To pursue the target, herein, a simple co-assembly method is developed to access carbon spheres with large mesopores (MCS). By means of the strengthening force between -OH on Ludox and -NH2 in DAP, silica spheres and poly-2,6-diaminopyridine (PDAP) are assembled into a uniform spherical composite to create a large mesoporous structure for the final MCS product. Changing the pore size of large mesopores plays a key role in ion transport of supercapacitor electrodes. The obtained MCS significantly improve the all-round electrochemical performances with high capacitance, long stability and rate capability, showing its great promise for efficient energy storage.
