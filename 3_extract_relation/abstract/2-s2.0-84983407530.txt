Silver doped polyaniline/silica and polyaniline/silica nanocomposite were prepared nontoxic methodology from naturally available rice husk silica. The synthesized materials were characterized by XRD, TG-DSC, FT-IR, SEM and TEM analysis. The formation of polyaniline in salt form exist in benzenoid and quinoid forms. The thermal analysis shows that Ag doped pani/rice husk ash composite is higher thermal stability compared to bulk pani prepared in this study. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of Ag-Pan/RHA, shows two absorption bands obtained (~250-300 and ~ 400-500) is due to polymer in contact with silver nanoparticles. Ft-Raman results provide the bands at 1426 and 1519 cm-1 are due to the C=N stretching vibrations in quinonoid diimine and in polyaniline, a strong band appears at 1598 cm-1 due to the C-C stretching vibration of the benzenoid-like rings. SEM analysis shows the flaky shape morphology for polyaniline and Ag-polyaniline/silica composite forms the petals of flowers morphologies for silver doped nanocomposite. TEM images are confirming the silver nanoparticle incorporation in polymer matrix. Electrochemical activity test of the prepared materials shows the result of promising activity towards supercapacitor applications.
