Battery-type materials are favorable candidates for realizing great specific capacity for supercapacitor devices. However, their slow kinematics impedes the enhancement in the electrochemical performance. Here, we report the extraordinary power and energy density are mutually filled into the quasi-solid-state flexible hybrid supercapacitor through intercalated pseudocapacitance of tunnel associated single-crystalline orthorhombic hydrated WO3 nanorods anode (battery-like) and exfoliated reduced graphene oxide (rGO) cathode (capacitive behavior). This single-crystalline orthorhombic hydrated WO3 nanorods structure inhibits active material accumulation and preserves a 1D directional arrangement associated with well-ordered large size hexagonal tunnels of about 0.612 nm along the (0 2 0) plane. It presents a high approachable surface area and hierarchically porous nature, facilitating abundant diffusion and carriage of electrolyte ions. The WO3 nanorods electrode exhibits the maximum specific capacitance of 539 F g−1 at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 attributed to proton-accommodation into the nanotunnels of crystal structure and their defects associated enhanced redox processes. A flexible quasi-solid-state hybrid supercapacitor (HC) of WO3 nanorods//rGO has demonstrated the exceptional energy density 43.7 Wh kg−1 and outstanding power density of 8.0 kW kg−1 with better cyclic stability and the impressive robust flexibility performance, presenting a great prospective in realistic applications.
