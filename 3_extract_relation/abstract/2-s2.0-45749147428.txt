A blend of Li2RuO3 and carbon-coated LiFePO 4 is examined as a low impedance cathode for high power lithium-ion microbatteries. A lithium metal cell with a composite positive electrode of LiFePO4/C and Li2RuO3 showed a greater specific capacity and specific energy at IC discharge than at C/5. A specific capacity of 145 mAh/g was observed for the blend of 40% Li2RuO3 and 60% LiFePO4/C when discharged at C/5, whereas 160 mAh/g was observed for 1C discharge rate. Discharge rates greater than 1C showed progressively decreased specific capacities. copyright The Electrochemical Society.
