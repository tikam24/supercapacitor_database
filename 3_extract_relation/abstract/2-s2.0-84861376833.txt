A procedure for electrochemical modification of carbon materials with high specific surface was developed. The materials were modified with polymeric nickel complexes with Schiff bases. The prototype of a hybrid double-layer Faraday supercapacitor with a positive carbon electrode modified with a polymeric complex was studied. Modification of this type doubled the energy stored by the hybrid capacitor compared with the similar double-layer capacitor. Â© 2012 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.
