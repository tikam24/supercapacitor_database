Porous MoO3 films with an ultra-short relaxation time used for supercapacitors have been prepared in acid peroxo-polymolybdate solution by electrodepositing on Ni foam directly in this study. Electrochemical measurements indicate that, the films behave an ideal supercapacitor characteristic in Na2SO4 electrolyte. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results demonstrate that, the films have a very low relaxation time constant (1 ms), which reveals a potential application prospect in filtering voltage ripple.
