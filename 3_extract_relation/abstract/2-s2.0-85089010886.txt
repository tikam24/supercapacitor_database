In this work, the crystal structure of alpha-MnO2 has been obtained by the hydrothermal method. It was determined that the obtained material has a tunnel structure with average particle sizes of 12-15 nm. The electrochemical performances of α-MnO2 in an aqueous solution of 30 % KOH based electrolyte have been investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic cycling methods. At the same time, it was determined that the specific capacity of the α-MnO2/electrolyte system decreased from 90 F/g to 55 F/g with an increase of the scan rate from 2 to 10 mV/s. Thus, the maximum values of specific capacitance about 104 F/g were obtained at 0.5 mV/s. The Coulomb efficiency of the electrochemical system is constant and independent of the cycle number under the charge/discharge process. Therefore, the total capacity of the material under investigation can be divided into the capacity of the double electric layer and the diffusioncontrolled redox capacity due to the Faraday reverse redox reactions. It was determined that the contribution of pseudocapacity is 90 % of the total specific capacity. In addition, it has been determined that the α-MnO2/KOH electrochemical system is stable under long-term cycling process.
