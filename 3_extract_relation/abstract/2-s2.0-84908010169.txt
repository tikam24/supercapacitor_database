Cone-like and flower-like nickel hydroxide and sphere-like nickel bicarbonate were synthesized via a simple hydrothermal route by varying the amount of urea without using any surfactants or additives. The surface area of the obtained materials were measured to be 17.3 m2 g-1, 45.7 m2 g-1 and 39.9 m2 g-1, and correlated electrochemical performances were briefly investigated. The maximum specific capacitance was recorded to be 1429.3 F g-1 in sphere-like nickel bicarbonate nanoparticles, suggesting their potential application in supercapacitor electrode.
