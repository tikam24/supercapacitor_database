Cobalt fluoride hydroxide (Co(OH)F) crystallite structures with various cobalt concentrations (20, 40, 60, and 80 mM) were grown on nickel foam (NF) substrate using a traditional hydrothermal method and potentially applied as an electrode material for battery-type supercapacitors. Physicochemical analyses showed that the optimal Co(OH)F–60/NF electrode had orthorhombic crystalline phase and comprised of several rhombohedral, octahedral, and decahedral crystallite structures. The electrochemical double-layer capacitance and impedance spectroscopy analyses confirmed that the Co(OH)F–60/NF sample had high active sites and lower equivalent series resistance, respectively. Owing to the more electroactive sites, the Co(OH)F–60/NF electrode delivered a high specific capacity (389.9 C g−1 at 1 A g−1), and remarkable long-term stability (90.02% capacity retention after 10000 cycles) compared to the other Co(OH)F/NF electrodes assessed. A hybrid supercapacitor device (HSC) was designed using the optimized Co(OH)F–60/NF as a positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as a negative electrode, which delivered a reasonable specific capacity of 130.0 C g−1 and an outstanding stability (92.74% capacitance retention after 8000 continuous cycles). The Co(OH)F–60/NF//AC HSC device provided a maximum energy density of 28.89 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 800.0 W kg−1.
