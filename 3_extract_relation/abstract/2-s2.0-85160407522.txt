A fuzzy logic energy management strategy is proposed in this work to control the charging and discharging of a hybrid battery/super capacitor storage system implemented in a photovoltaic pumping system. This strategy takes into account the state of charge of the super capacitor (socspc) and the battery (SOCbat), and the power produced by the photovoltaic panels. The objective of this strategy is, on the one hand to ensure the continuity of operation of the photovoltaic pumping system whatever the climatic conditions, on the other hand to guarantee the operating safety of the hybrid storage system by monitoring its state of charge. Energy management efficiency and energy exchange synchronization are demonstrated by simulation tests of photovoltaic pumping systems under Matlab Simulink at different levels of sunshine.
