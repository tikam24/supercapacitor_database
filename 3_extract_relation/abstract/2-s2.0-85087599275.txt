Super-capacitors have become a practical alternative to chemical batteries as a rechargeable energy storage medium. For space use, they have the advantage of being able to support high power demanding payloads and subsystems at a much higher specific power than conventional rechargeable batteries. This low mass and high power capability makes them very attractive for use in space. They enable the operation of a high power demanding payload on a micro-satellite platform and this may lead to a breakthrough in terms of platform choice for payloads. For future on-orbit demonstration, we have developed a prototype of the key modules for a super-capacitor based power system, including a Capacitor Charge Regulator (CCR), Capacitor-Cell Monitor and Management Module (CMM) and a Capacitor-Bank Module (CBM). These components are necessary in order to achieve a complete super-capacitor based power system. This paper describes the development of the power system prototype. Â© 2011 by University of Surrey.
