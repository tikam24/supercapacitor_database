The structures containing iron and nickel can provide a unique platform for supercapacitor electrodes. In this research, the synthesis of iron and nickel nanoparticles and their hybrid with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) were performed. The samples were characterized with XRD analysis, SEM microscopy along with the EDS mapping, and TEM microscopy. The several electrochemical tests, i.e. cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed to probe the applicability of materials as the supercapacitor electrode. The obtained results showed a fairly good capability of the NiFe/rGO hybrid for supercapacitor applications with a specific capacitance of 1224 F/g and discharge time of 351 s. Moreover, the cyclic stability of the electrode composed of both NiFe and rGO was enhanced up to 7%.
