LaMn1-xNixO3 nanoparticles were synthesized through hydrothermal synthesis and calcinations. The structural and electrochemical properties were studied to evaluate the effect of Ni doping on the materials as supercapacitor electrodes. The LaMn0.5Ni0.5O3 sample presented a capacitance of 183 F ⋅ g−1(current density of 1 A ⋅ g−1) and a capacity retention of 83.5 % after 2000 charge-discharge cycles. Theoretical calculations were performed to provide more insight into the electrochemical performance.
