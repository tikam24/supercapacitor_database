An effective approach for increasing the life cycle of pure p-type conductive polymers is combining conventional conductive polymers and nanomaterials to fabricate hybrid electrodes. In this paper, Gadolinium oxide (Gd2O3) has first been synthesized using pulse electrochemical approach. Hybrid POAP/Gd2O3 films have then been fabricated by POAP electropolymerization in the presence of Gd2O3 nanoparticles as active electrodes for electrochemical supercapacitors. Surface and electrochemical analyses have been used for characterization of Gd2O3 and POAP/Gd2O3 composite films. Different electrochemical methods including galvanostatic charge discharge experiments, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy have been applied to study the system performance. Specific capacitance, specific energy and specific power of the composite film are calculated 300 F·g−1, 41.66 W h·kg−1 and 833.22 W·kg−1 respectively. This work introduces new nanocomposite materials for electrochemical redox capacitors with such advantages as the ease of synthesis, high active surface area and stability in an aqueous electrolyte.
