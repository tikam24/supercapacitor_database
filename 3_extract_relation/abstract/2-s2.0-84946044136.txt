Because of avaricious global energy consumption, and serious environmental issues, the demand for clean energy technology has grown to a significant level, and the development of emerging effective energy devices and resources has become one of the most important topics in recent decades, and has attracted passionate research [1]. Among encouraging alternative sources of energy, supercapacitors are one of the promising electrochemical energy storage devices, with high power characteristics compared to batteries, high energy density compared to conventional capacitors, and long cycling times [2-6].
