This article focuses on the performance of an ultra capacitor in a two-area reheat thermal power system for automatic load frequency control (ALFC). Initially, the power system model is designed in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment. Then, differential evolution (DE) technique based on two degree of freedom tilt integral derivative (2-DOF-TID) controller is placed as secondary controller. In order to improve the system's transient reactions, ultra capacitors (UCs) are mounted in each region, and their output is observed. Finally, the sensitivity has been analyzed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed concept.
