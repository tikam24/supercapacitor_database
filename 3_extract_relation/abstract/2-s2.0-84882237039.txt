Synthesis and characterization of three dimensional, covalently-grafted graphene-polyaniline nanocomposites have been reported. To enhance the grafting of polyaniline and prevent the aggregation and damage of the sp2 network of the graphene sheet, numerous nucleation sites are introduced by diazotization with p-aminobenzoic acid followed by amination using the Schmidt reaction. The covalent functionalization and reduction was confirmed by FT-IR, Raman, XRD, XPS and UV-vis spectroscopy. In situ oxidative polymerization of aniline was performed using enhanced amino-functionalized graphene in the presence of ammonium peroxide as an oxidizing agent. SEM results show that uniform fibrous polyaniline was grafted to the graphene layers. The resulting nanocomposites showed enhanced electrochemical performances when compared to pristine polyaniline and aminized graphene. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.
