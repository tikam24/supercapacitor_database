The utilization of energy from renewable sources depends on our ability to store the generated energy in electrochemical charge storage devices and to retrieve when needed. Thus, in recent times there is an impetus to the research on electric energy storage devices such as electrochemical supercapacitor and batteries. Thereby, this chapter highlights current issues related to electrocheical supercapacitors, ways to solve them, and future perspectives.
