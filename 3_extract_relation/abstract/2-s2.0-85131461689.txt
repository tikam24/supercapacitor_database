The epoxy is cured on the high nitrogen-containing melamine foam to construct a composite of epoxy@melamine-foam. Nitrogen doped porous carbon is synthesized by using the composite as a precursor. The atomic content of nitrogen of the resulting amorphous carbon is determined to be 3.6 at.%. The carbon has a typical microporous structure with a specific surface area of 1675 m2 g−1 and a pore volume of 0.81 cm3 g−1. In a three-electrode system in the basic aqueous electrolyte, a specific capacitance of 292.3 F g−1 is achieved from the electrode loaded with the nitrogen-doped electroactive carbon at a current density of 1 A g−1. In a symmetrical two-electrode system in the same electrolyte, a single electrode displays a specific capacitance of 265.3 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. For a simulated supercapacitor device, a specific energy of 8.5 W h kg−1 is obtained at the specific power of 103.3 W kg−1. Findings demonstrate the nitrogen doped microporous carbon can be used as a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.
