This chapter introduces fluorinated carbon materials for use as supercapacitor electrode materials. Fluorinated carbon materials have primarily been used as electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries, primary lithium batteries, fuel cells, etc.; however, their application in super capacitors is rare. Fluorination is one of the most effective methods for controlling the textural and surface properties of carbon materials. Several studies have been performed on fluorinated carbon materials, such as activated carbons, activated carbon fibers, and carbon nanotubes, for use as electrode materials in supercapacitors. This chapter discusses the physical, chemical, and electrochemical properties of fluorinated carbon materials for use as supercapacitor electrode materials.
