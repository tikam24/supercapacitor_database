In this work, Ni-Co double hydroxide composite nanosheets with network structure grown on conductive substrate of Fe foil was synthesised by a facile electrochemical deposition method. This structure is responsible for high electrochemical performance with specific capacitance of 853.7 F g-1 at the current density of 1.0 A g-1 and long-term cycling stability of 85% capacitance retention at 4 A g-1 after 1000 cycles. These results suggest that low-cost Fe foil can be used as effective collector for high performance supercapacitors.
