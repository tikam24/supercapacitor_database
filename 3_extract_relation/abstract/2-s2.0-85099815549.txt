Supercapacitors possess important prospects in power supply, owing to the characteristics of fast charging/discharging and long cycling life. As emerging materials, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are the cutting-edge electrode active materials for supercapacitors due to their good conductivity, tunable pore structure, as well as diverse composition. In this Minireview, we summarize the recent progress in MOF electrodes for supercapacitors. We focus on the synthesis of intrinsically conductive MOFs constructed from different organic linkers and adjustable metal ions, and the preparation of conductive MOF composites hybridized with conducting materials (conducting polymers and carbons). Following the discussion of both different types of conductive MOFs and their composites in supercapacitors, the challenges, and opportunities of conductive MOF electrodes for supercapacitors are further prospected at the end of this contribution, which would provide some valuable insights in facilitating the use of MOF materials in energy-storage applications.
