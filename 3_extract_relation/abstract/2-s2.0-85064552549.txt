In this work, a novel hierarchical CuCo2O4@MnO2 composite with core-shell structure grown on RGO (coated on the surface of nickel foam (NF)) was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal route, in which MnO2 nanosheets uniformly wrapped around the surface of CuCo2O4 nanorods. RGO/CuCo2O4 composite was also prepared for comparison. Benefiting from their synergistic effect, RGO/CuCo2O4@MnO2 electrode delivered high specific capacitance of 850 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in 2.0 M KOH electrolyte and an outstanding cycling stability with 94.2% retention over 3000 cycles, suggesting the great potential application of this material in advanced energy storage device.
