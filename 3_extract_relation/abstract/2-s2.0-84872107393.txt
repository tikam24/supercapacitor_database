A flexible solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor device with H-TiO 2@MnO2 core-shell NWs as the positive electrode and H-TiO2@C core-shell NWs as the negative electrode is developed. This device operates in a 1.8 V voltage window and is able to deliver a high specific capacitance of 139.6 F g-1 and maximum volumetric energy density of 0.30 mWh cm-3 with excellent cycling performance and good flexibility.
