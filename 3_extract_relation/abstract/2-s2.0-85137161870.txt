Conductive polymers have gained a significant place among electrode materials for electrochemical sensors and energy storage devices. The latest developments in the targeted modification of the polymers' properties and thin-film microstructure predispose them further to wide applications in this field. The advantages and shortcomings of compositing conducting polymers with metal nanoparticles and 2D materials (graphene and its derivatives, MXenes, MOFs) in electrochemical sensors and supercapacitors are summarized based on selected works. Some challenges for further research are also mentioned briefly.
