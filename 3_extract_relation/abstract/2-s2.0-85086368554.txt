Supercapacitors with high power density and durability have shown enormous potential for smart electronics. Herein, a novel graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) coated with oxygen vacancies-rich ZnO (OZCN) nanocomposites was prepared from zeolitic imidazolate framework precursor by direct thermal decomposition melamine in air. The as-prepared OZCN nanocomposites exhibited high capacitive performance (3,000 F g-1 at 3 A g-1) and excellent cycling stability due to the synergetic effect of g-C3N4 and oxygen vacancies-rich ZnO. Additionally, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor displayed an energy density of 100.9 Wh kg-1, while the capacitance retention remained at 86.2% even after 1,000 cycles at 7 A g-1. This study is highlighting a new way for designing metal oxide electrode possessing excellent electronic properties for durable and low-cost energy storage devices.
