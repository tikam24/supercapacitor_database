Electric double-layer capacitors - dubbed supercapacitors - achieve heretofore unattainable volumetric efficiency, or capacitance per unit volume at a given voltage. Boosting this figure of merit to 10 to 25 times that of even the most compact aluminum electrolytic capacitors, they pack 1 farad into less than a cubic inch. Coupled with low leakage, a supercapacitor's giant capacity lends itself to use as efficient, reliable, and cost-effective temporary energy-storage devices. Complementary MOS (CMOS)-based processor and memory ICs allow operation with very low power requirements. This development, coupled with the relatively short period of most power outages (on the order of several hours), has made the electric double-layer capacitor a practical alternative to batteries as standby energy sources.
