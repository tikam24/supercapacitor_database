The structure and functioning modes of active layers in an electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) with an aqueous electrolyte are simulated by means of a computer. A model of active layers prepared from activated carbon materials is proposed, percolation estimates are performed and effective ionic conductivities are calculated. The polarization of active layers includes a sequence of two charging processes: first, galvanostatic and then potentiostatic. The proposed program of calculations involves mutual matching and optimization of seven parameters characterizing the active layer and conditions of charging processes. According to calculations, galvanostatic polarization of wide pores in the EDLC biporous active layer up to the limiting potential followed by potentiostatic polarization of fine pores allows the capacity C sp = 246 F/g and the energy W sp = 107 kJ/kg to be obtained in fractions of second.
