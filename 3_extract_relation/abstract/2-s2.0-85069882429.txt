Graphene, as a promising electrode material, usually has limited power performance due to stacking of the graphene sheets. To solve this problem, we prepared a vertically oriented grid-like reduced graphene oxide (VrGO) with vertical channels by directional freezing, drying and annealing. Being used as supercapacitor electrodes, the VrGO membranes showed a specific capacitance of 131 F g11 at scan rate of 1 V s11. Due to the high electronic conductivity, especially the regular and straight ion diffusion channels, a very high voltage sweep rate of cyclic voltammetry (CV) 200 V s11 is reached in KOH electrolyte, and therefore, a supercapacitor with an ultrahigh power density of about 740 kW kg11 can be obtained. The excellent power performance would open new opportunities in the fields of electrochemical energy harvesting and storage.
