In the paper it is discussed on the performances of an electrochemical supercapacitor and battery hybrid power source for on-board applications. The system is analytically represented by means of a double time scale model, which is experimentally validated on a 80 V prototype using a pulsing load. Focusing on interrelations among battery, supercapacitor and load, power peaks, internal losses and lifecycle issues are discussed with the aim to define criteria and design directives for battery and supercapacitor integration in a compact and light system.
