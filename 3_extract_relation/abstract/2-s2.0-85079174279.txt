This investigation emphasizes on the facile, one spot in-situ microwave irradiation method used to synthesize cuprous oxide/graphene (Cu2O/G) nanocomposite without any templates. Microwave irradiation method assisted the conversion of graphene oxide to graphene in presence of Cu2+ ions in the water medium, and self-assembled Cu2O on graphene layers reveal the resultant Cu2O/G nanocomposite. X-ray diffraction pattern reflects the structure of Cu2O nanoparticles and graphene sheet. The morphology of electrode materials was studied with SEM and TEM to confirm the intercalation of Cu2O on graphene sheets. FTIR analysis confirmed the reduction of oxygen functional groups. The cyclic voltammetry and charge/discharge analysis in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte reveals the electrochemical properties. The specific capacitance of Cu2O/G nanocomposite is 611 Fg−1 compared to the graphene (290 Fg−1) and Cu2O (160 Fg−1) at a current density of 1 Ag−1. The experiment under similar conditions revealed 100% retention in capacitance after 5000 charge-discharge cycles. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of Cu2O/G nanocomposite suggests the excellent supercapacitor performance with higher ion transport ensuring enhanced electrochemical performance.
