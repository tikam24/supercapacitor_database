Supercapacitor, as a new type of energy storage device lying in-between battery and traditional capacitor, owns many advantages such as fast charge and discharge time, high power density, environmental-friendly and long cycle life. It has become one of the hot research topics in the field of energy storage. Electrode materials play a vital role in flexible supercapacitors, the common electrode materials include carbon materials, conducting polymers and transition metal oxides. In order to exploit flexible high-performance supercapacitors, new highperformance electrode materials need to be developed. Metal oxides are promising supercapacitor electrode materials due to their low cost, good chemical stability, high theoretical specific capacitance and environmental friendliness. However, cycling stability and rate performance of metal oxides based supercapacitor still canâ€™t meet the requirements of practical applications. Therefore, the research on electrode materials are not limited to single-component material, and nanocomposites can synergistically enhance the intrinsic properties of each component to exhibit more outstanding electrochemical properties. In this chapter, we discuss the electrode materials for flexible supercapacitors in detail and also describes the device preparation as well as the integration of the flexible supercapacitors in various applications.
