Abstract: Nano-sized magnetite powders with addition of iron nitrides were synthesized via pulsed laser ablation (PLA) of an iron target in atmospheric air. A series of iron oxide nanopowders with various phase compositions (ranging from magnetite to hematite) and structures (from 2D lamellas and spherical nanoparticles to continuous 3D structures) were prepared via heat treatment of the initial (as-synthesized) powder at temperatures in the range 200–500°C. The powders were introduced into the composition of carbon paste electrodes (CPEs). The capacitive characteristics of the electrodes prepared were studied in comparison to a commercial electroexplosive iron oxide powder. The capacitances of electrodes were matched to the structural characteristics of the materials and their phase compositions. With the chosen electrode-preparation method, the powder heat-treated at 500°С (sample Fe/500) showed the highest capacitance. The potential of the studied ultrafine materials based on ablative iron oxide was shown for use in electrodes for supercapacitors.
