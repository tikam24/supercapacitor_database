This work investigates the manganese (Mn)-doping effects in vanadium diselenide (VSe2) for energy storage application. The Mn doping has enhanced the energy storage performance of VSe2. When the Mn precursor reached 6%, the sample exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 250 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g in a symmetric supercapacitor configuration. An asymmetric supercapacitor has been constructed using the 6 Mn-VSe2 as positive electrode and Red phosphorus as the negative electrode. The assembled asymmetric system showed a maximum energy density of 21.3 Wh/kg and a maximum power density of 25.6 kW/kg with a capacitance retention of 95% after 5000 GCD cycles.
