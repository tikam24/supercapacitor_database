In this research, manganese and nickel transition metal layered double hydroxide nanoparticles (MnNi(OH)2) with a size of âˆ¼100 nm have been successfully prepared using a sonochemical irradiation method for supercapacitor applications. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) analyses clearly indicate the formation of MnNi(OH)2 nanoparticles. Scanning and Transmission electron microscopic images identify the layered double hydroxide structure formation. MnNi(OH)2 layered double hydroxide nanoparticles were tested as a supercapacitor material which exhibits specific capacitance of 160 F g-1 at a current density of 1 mA cm-2 at the potential range from 0.0 to 1.0 V in 1 M Na2SO4 solution.
