The graphene oxide and metal oxide–grafted graphene composites are studied on their promising electrochemical properties for high-performance supercapacitor applications. The identical decoration of metal oxide nanomaterials over the graphene structure reveals enhanced structural, thermal, and electrochemical stability to fabricate stable electrode materials. In the study, we review our recent studies on the utilization of graphene oxide and metal oxide–graphene grafted nanocomposites for energy storing applications.
