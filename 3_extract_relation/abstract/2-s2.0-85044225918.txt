Perovskite oxides are highly promising electrodes for oxygen-ion-intercalation-type supercapacitors owing to their high oxygen vacancy concentration, oxygen diffusion rate, and tap density. Based on the anion intercalation mechanism, the capacitance is contributed by surface redox reactions and oxygen ion intercalation in the bulk materials. A high concentration of oxygen vacancies is needed because it is the main charge carrier. In this study, we propose a B-site cation-ordered Ba2Bi0.1Sc0.2Co1.7O6-δ as an electrode material with an extremely high oxygen vacancy concentration and oxygen diffusion rate. A maximum capacitance of 1050 F g-1 was achieved, and a high capacitance of 780 F g-1 was maintained even after 3000 charge-discharge cycles at a current density of 1 A g-1 with an aqueous alkaline solution (6 M KOH) electrolyte, indicating an excellent cycling stability. In addition, the specific volumetric capacitance of Ba2Bi0.1Sc0.2Co1.7O6-δ reaches up to 2549.4 F cm-3 based on the dense construction and high tap density (3.2 g cm-3). In addition, an asymmetric supercapacitor was constructed using activated carbon as a negative electrode, and it displayed the highest specific energy density of 70 Wh kg-1 at the power density of 787 W kg-1 in this study.
