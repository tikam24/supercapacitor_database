Selecting suitable active materials with unique design microstructures can deliver a new generation of supercapacitors with high energy-storage performance. In this work, Zn0.76Co0.24S microspheres containing nanoflakes on its surface were successfully synthesized using a simple one-step hydrothermal method, achieving an excellent electrochemical energy storage behavior owing to its good conductivity, and unique structure that allowed effective transportation paths for ions/electrons. The as-prepared Zn0.76Co0.24S was used as an electrode material for supercapacitors, and it displayed an excellent capacitance of 2393 F g−1 (796 C g−1) at 1 A g−1. For a real application, a hybrid device was assembled using Zn0.76Co0.24S as a positive electrode and activated carbon as a negative electrode. This led to delivering high specific energy of 58.8 Wh kg−1 at a specific power of 815 W kg−1, showing excellent cycling stability of 90% capacity retention of the initial capacity after 5000 cycles.
