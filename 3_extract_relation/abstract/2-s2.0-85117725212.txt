This paper presents two methods, developed for voltage balancing in energy storage system (a battery bank) made of connected in series supercapacitor cells. The concept of charging the battery pack uses current sources. The obtained results are verified with computer simulations and experimentally on a laboratory stand. Basic equations for calculating the charging currents are given. The characteristics of the presented algorithms are compared.
