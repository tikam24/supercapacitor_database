A novel electrode material of α-NiS, β-NiS and Ni3S4 particles co-decorated rGO is obtained by co-reduction of Ni2+ and GO with thiourea. The multiple nickel sulfide phases and rGO synergistically improve the electrochemical performance of the supercapacitor electrode, which shows high specific capacity of 609.4C g−1 at current density of 1 A g−1. The electrode can keep a good stability with coulombic efficiency of as high as 99.5% after 1000 cycles. The small solution and charge transfer resistances of 0.42 and 0.24 Ω indicate the positive synergistic effects of the multiple phases of NiS and graphene on the electrochemical performance.
