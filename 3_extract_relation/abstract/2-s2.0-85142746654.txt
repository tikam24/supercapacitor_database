Lanthanum (La) doped titania (TiO2)/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanocomposites with varying amounts of lanthanum have been synthesized as promising electrode materials for supercapacitors. TiO2/RGO, 0.5 wt% La doped TiO2/RGO, 1 wt% La doped TiO2/RGO, and 2 wt% La doped TiO2/RGO nanocomposites are synthesized using the facile hydrothermal method. The prepared nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive spectroscopy. The effect of the increasing amount of lanthanum as a dopant on the electrochemical performance of nanocomposites has been studied. The 2 wt% La doped TiO2/RGO composite exhibits the highest specific capacitance of 117.6F/g at 10 mV sâˆ’1 and also shows better supercapacitive behavior in terms of cyclic stability (91.42 % after 10,000 cycles), energy density, and power density as compared to other nanocomposites.
