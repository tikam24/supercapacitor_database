Energy storage in secondary batteries and supercapacitors using various materials is of utmost importance from a technological point of view. However, the performance of secondary batteries and supercapacitors is insufficient for practical use and is limited by the efficiency of the electrode material. Secondary batteries and supercapacitors using carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as a novel type of active electrode material are introduced as candidates for large-capacitance and high-power electrochemical energy storage devices. We have investigated the relationship of the preparation conditions for CNT electrodes with the equivalent series resistance, specific capacitance, energy density, and power density and other nanocomposites with conducting polymers.
