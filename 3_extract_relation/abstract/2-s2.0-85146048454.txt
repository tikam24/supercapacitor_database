Zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZIHCs) show great potential as advanced energy storage devices. Herein, we present vanadium (V)-doped manganese oxide aerogel structured (V-Mn-O) cathode material with expended interlayer space for ZIHCs. The V-doping expands the interlayer distance of MnO2 and creates more active sites with open channels for fast ionic diffusion, and offers good structural stability. The as-fabricated ZIHC (V-Mn-O//Zn) demonstrates a maximum specific capacitance of 333.35 F/g at 1 A/g with capacitance retention of 95.63 % after 10,000 cycles with âˆ¼98 % Coulombic efficiency. The V-Mn-O//Zn exhibits highly capacitive charge storage characteristics. Furthermore, the V-Mn-O//Zn delivers a maximum energy density of 150.12 Wh/kg at a power density of 900.72 W/kg and is superior to most of the previously reported values at similar conditions. This work presents an innovative approach for developing high-rate next-generation zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitors.
