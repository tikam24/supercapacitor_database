This paper presents a proposed fuzzy energy management strategy developed for a battery−super capacitor electric vehicle. In addition to providing different driving modes, the proposed strategy delivers the suitable type and amount of power to the vehicle. Furthermore, the proposed strategy takes into account possible failures in vehicle power sources. The speed and torque of the HEV traction machine are simultaneously controlled using a genetic algorithm that provides simultaneous tuning via the use of newly proposed cost functions that give the designer the ability to tradeoff and prioritize between the design variables to be minimized. The simulation results show that the intelligent speed and torque control and the fuzzy power management strategy improved the vehicle’s performance in terms of ripple minimization. The real-time simulation is conducted using the RT LAB simulator, and the results obtained correspond to those obtained in the numerical simulation using MATLAB/Simulink.
