This paper, for the first time, reports a thin-film supercapacitor as an energy storage component for smart contact lens applications. By using previously developed 3D packaging technology, the proposed supercapacitor with 130\ \mu \mathrm{m} thickness can be packaged into a standard hydrogel contact lens with smooth wrinkle-free surface. Based on experiments, the proposed thin-film supercapacitor can work in saline solution and shows the future vision and eye disease related applications. Note that the previous developed radio frequency identification (RFID) based smart contact lens can now be changed from passive system to semi-passive system with the aid of proposed supercapacitor.
