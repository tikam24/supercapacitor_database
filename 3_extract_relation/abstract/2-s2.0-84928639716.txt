Conducting polymer polyaniline (PANI) was in-situ polymerized on the surface of graphene oxide (GO) to form PANI encapsulating GO nanocomposites. The morphology and microstructure were examined by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and N2 absorption/desorption analysis. Electrochemical properties were tested by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Experimental results showed that ethanol assisted the dispersion of GO in water and facilitated the diffusion of polymer monomers on GO. GO as a support material can provide sufficient reaction sites for the deposition of aniline to form the film-like GO/PANI composites. Capacitive performance illustrated that the in-situ polymerization of PANI on GO was effective in improving the specific capacitance and cycling stability.
