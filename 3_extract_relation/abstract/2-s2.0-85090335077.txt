Thanks to their high electrical conductivity, electrochemical stability and activity, transition metal sulfides have been widely designed and developed for supercapacitors with excellent electrochemical performances. Herein, we report the NiS2/MoS2 mixed phases with abundant exposed active edge sites decorated on graphene nanosheets (named as (Ni,Mo)S2/G) through a facile two-step hydrothermal approach. Benefitting from its unique chemical property and structure, the as-prepared (Ni,Mo)S2/G composite possesses impressive electrochemical performances as electrodes of battery-type supercapacitors in 2 M KOH, such as high specific capacity of 951 C g−1 (2379 F g−1) at 1 A g−1 with superb rate capability (60.7% at 100 A g−1). Additionally, the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device assembled based on the active edge site-enriched (Ni,Mo)S2/G as positive electrode and nitrogen-doped porous graphene as negative electrode displays an ultrahigh energy density of 84.5 Wh kg−1, superior to those of the Ni- and Mo-based ASCs in aqueous electrolytes reported so far. Such novel strategy may hold great promise for exploring other polymetallic sulfides with abundant exposed active edge sites for energy storage and conversion.
