We pursue unique direct writing approaches with femtosecond fiber laser and relevant photonic manufacturing in developing various micro-nano-devices for microelectronics, energy and sensing applications. In this paper, we will present our research progresses on four directions: direct writing of microball lenses for super-wide angle imaging, developing innovative Au/reduce graphene oxide(Au/rGO) super-capacitors with high rates and fast response, multilayer super-capacitors directly written on polyimide and interdigitated capacitance sensors.
