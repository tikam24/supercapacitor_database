Nanostructures and compositions are the most crucial aspects in the design of electrode materials with excellent properties for hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs). In this study, bimetallic CoM-zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (CoM-ZIF-67, M = Mn, Cu, and Zn) derived nanosheet-constructed hollow carbon-incorporated NiCoM layered double hydroxide nanocages (NiCoM-LDH/C) are successfully synthesized via the thermal annealing and subsequent etching/ion-exchange reaction. As a consequence, the NiCoM-LDH/C materials exhibit significantly improved electrochemical performance. Specifically, the optimized NiCoMn-LDH/C electrode possesses an excellent capacity performance of 888.3 C g−1 at 1 A g−1. Moreover, the HSC device assembled by NiCoMn-LDH/C and active carbon delivers a remarkable energy density of 46.5 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 792.5 W kg−1 and possesses superior cyclic stability with about 92.05% capacity retention after 5000 cycles. This work may offer a feasible and effective approach for the synthesis of carbon-incorporated ternary layered double hydroxide nanocage materials for high-performance HSC applications.
