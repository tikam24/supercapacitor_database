In this work, using the first‚Äêprinciple density functional theory (DFT) method, we study the properties of a new material based on pillared graphene and the icosahedral clusters of boron B12 as a supercapacitor electrode material. The new composite material demonstrates a high specific quantum capacitance, specific charge density, and a negative value of heat of formation, which indicates its efficiency. It is shown that the density of electronic states increases during the addition of clusters, which predictably leads to an increase in the electrode conductivity. We predict that the use of a composite based on pillared graphene and boron will increase the efficiency of existing supercapacitors.
