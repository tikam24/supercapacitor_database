A binder-free electrode for flexible supercapacitor applications was fabricated using carbon fiber papers (CFPs) via a facile paper making method. CV curves and galvanostatic charge/discharge profiles exhibited ideal capacitive behavior and linear voltage–time function with small IR drop. O2 activation process greatly affected the porosity and surface structures. The CFP electrodes activated at 325 °C for 45 min by O2 oxidizing gas showed highest specific capacitance of 156.9 F g−1 and excellent cycle stability (∼90.2%) after 5000 cycles at 1.0 A g−1 in 1.0 M H2SO4, which presented the possibilities as flexible electrodes with excellent electrochemical performances for EDLCs.
