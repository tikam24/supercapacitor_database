Conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) networks are an emerging class of porous organic material composed of pre-designed functional structures and tailored components. CMP have shown promising perspectives in energy harnessing, conversion and storage, which make them more conducive to the design of high-performance supercapacitors. In this study, a -NH-bonded 2D-conjugated microporous polymer (CC-DAQ-CMP) was prepared by the condensation of 2,6-diaminanthraquinone (DAQ) with nitrogen-rich cyanuric chloride (CC). The microporous organic polymer materialsCC-DAQ-CMPwere characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy, XPS, XRD, SEM and N2adsorption-desorption methods. The results show thatCC-DAQ-CMPhas good stability, large specific surface area and abundant pore structure. As the electrode material of supercapacitors, it has a high specific capacitance (184.25 F gâˆ’1). The results demonstrated that the structure and electrochemical properties of conjugated microporous polymer materials can be improved effectively by changing the monomers, which provides a new way for the application of conjugated microporous polymer materials in high-performance supercapacitors.
