Polyaniline functionalized reduced graphene oxide (PORGO) is prepared by interfacial polymerization and then vertically oriented polyaniline-graphene (PANI-PORGO) nanocomposites based on PORGO are developed successfully by in situ polymerization. The morphology and structure are characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR), Raman spectra and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The electrochemical tests indicate that the specific capacitance of PORGO and PANI-PORGO is as high as 291 and 369 F/g, respectively, at the current density of 1 A/g. PANI—PORGO nanocomposite exhibits high electrochemical activity and enhanced cycle stability with a capacitance retention of 81.2% after 500 cycles at 10 A/g. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl.
