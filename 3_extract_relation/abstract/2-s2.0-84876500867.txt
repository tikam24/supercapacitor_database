High specific capacitance and low cost are the critical requirements for a practical supercapacitor. In this paper, a new activated carbon with high specific capacitance and low cost was prepared, employing cotton stalk as the raw material, by using the phosphoric acid (H3PO4) chemical activation method. The optimized conditions were as follows: the cotton stalk and activating agent with a mass ratio of 1:4 at an activation temperature of 800 C for 2 h. The samples were characterized by nitrogen adsorption isotherms at 77 K. The specific surface area and pore volume of activated carbon were calculated by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and t-plot methods. With these experimental conditions, an activated carbon with a BET surface area of 1,481 cm2 g-1 and micropore volume of 0.0377 cm3 g-1 was obtained. The capacitance of the prepared activated carbon was as high as 114 F g-1.The results indicate that cotton stalk can produce activated carbon electrode materials with low cost and high performance for electric double-layer capacitor.
