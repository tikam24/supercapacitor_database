There has been an increasing interest in concept of hybrid architecture which is penetrating the heavy industry machines, in recent years, including for hydraulic mining shovels (HMSs). Achieving increased machine efficiency, productivity, and performance, reduced emissions, and prolonged lifetime are the main goals in developing hybrid shovel structures. This paper presents the energy management concept for an electric HMS, which uses high power density energy storage systems to supplement the diesel-powered generators. A 2.25-MW ultracapacitor system is applied to improve the sluggish dynamic response of the diesel engines during sudden load changes and to reduce the engine power requirements by maintaining an optimal engine speed. In addition to the engine dynamic improvement, the ultracapacitor system supports the engine during peak power demand allowing for a smaller engine size, which results in higher fuel savings and less exhaust emissions. Detailed control schemes for the converters and system are described. Results of simulations, off-board testing, and on-board testing for an implemented 8000 hp mining shovel are provided and discussed. The machine operates smoothly at varying load conditions. The initial assessments indicate a 30% increase in machine productivity and 26% increase in fuel efficiency compared with a 120-Ton conventional hydraulic machine.
