The filling of carbon nanotubes with Fe-Mn oxide via wet chemistry was presented. IR, XRD and TEM were used to characterize the structural features and the morphology. Cyclic voltammetry was used to investigate the electrochemical behavior of the samples. Results shows that the Fe 2O 3 and MnO 2 were filled the tube inner cavity successfully and the nanocomposites were valuable for supercapacitor materials.
