To achieve higher energy density and power density, we have designed and fabricated a symmetric redox supercapacitor based on microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technologies. The supercapacitor consists of a three-dimensional (3D) microstructure on silicon substrate micromachined by high-aspect-ratio deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) method, two sputtered Ti current collectors and two electrochemical polymerized polypyrrole (PPy) films as electrodes. Electrochemical tests, including cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatical charge/discharge methods have been carried out on the single PPy electrodes and the symmetric supercapacitor in different electrolytes. The specific capacitance (capacitance per unit footprint area) and specific power (power per unit footprint area) of the PPy electrodes and symmetric supercapacitor can be calculated from the electrochemical test data. It is found that NaCl solution is a good electrolyte for the polymerized PPy electrodes. In NaCl electrolyte, single PPy electrodes exhibit 0.128 F cm-2 specific capacitance and 1.28 mW cm-2 specific power at 20 mV s-1 scan rate. The symmetric supercapacitor presents 0.056 F cm-2 specific capacitance and 0.56 mW cm-2 specific power at 20 mV s-1 scan rate. Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
