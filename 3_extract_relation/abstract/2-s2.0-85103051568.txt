In this work, a facile and low-cost method for preparation of the chitosan@ CoFe2O3-Graphene oxide hybrid nanocomposites using biopolymer Chitin, Cobalt chloride and Ferrous chloride in presence of sodium hydroxide solution. FTIR and UV-vis spectra are confirmed by functional groups. XRD patterns revealed the mixture of hexagonal and tetragonal phase polycrystalline of CoFe2O3/Graphene oxidenanocomposites exhibited with predominant lattice plane. The average crystalline size of CoFe2O3/Graphene oxidenanocomposites was estimated at ~15.2 nm by Debye-Scherrer’s formula. The surface morphology was demonstrated by FESEM. The shape and size of the grains were discovered by TEM analysis. The elemental composition ratio of CoFe2O3/Graphene oxide nanocomposites was studied by EDX analysis. The fabricated sensor investigated shows a maximum current response at pH 7.0. The L-dopa sensor exhibited wide sensing linear range from 1 ×10-7to 3×10-5M and the lower detection limit of 0.5×10-7M. Conductivity and super capacitance was measured by Impendence Spectroscopy (IS) and Galvanostatic charge/discharging process.
