After the invention of supercapacitors, so many modifications in their fabrication process has been incorporated keeping in mind for commercialization toward practical application. Not only the design but also more emphasis has been given on the development of active electrode materials to achieve better charge storage performances. Therefore, the background of supercapacitor and their current status has been discussed in this chapter.
