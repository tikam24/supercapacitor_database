A nanocomposite of CoNi2S4 and chemically reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets was prepared through a facile one-pot tertbutanol assisted solvothermal route without any template. The structural and morphological properties of CoNi2S4/RGO nanocomposite were characterized through X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectra, scanning electron microscopy and thermo-gravimetric analysis. The electrochemical behavior of CoNi2S4/RGO nanocomposite has been investigated using cyclic voltammograms, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in 6 M KOH electrolyte. CoNi2S4/RGO obtains a novel structure containing both nanoflake and nanorod and fulfills a maximum specific capacitance of 1709 F g-1 at a current rate of 0.5 A g-1 with good cycle stability.
