Manganese dioxide nanorods were synthesized by a facile method through simply refluxing the reaction mixture of KMnO4 and MnCl2 solution in the presence of K2Cr2O7. The products were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. α-MnO2 nanorods with diameters of 50-100 nm and lengths of 0.5-2 μm were formed depending on the amount of K 2Cr2O7 together with the reflux time. The formation mechanism of the α-MnO2 nanorods was discussed in detail. The electrode performance of manganese dioxide for use as capacitor was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge. The α-MnO2 nanorods which were prepared with a mass ratio of K 2Cr2O7 to KMnO4 of 1:10 exhibited good electrochemical performance, and a specific capacitance as high as 245 F g-1 was measured at a current density of 1 A g-1. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.
