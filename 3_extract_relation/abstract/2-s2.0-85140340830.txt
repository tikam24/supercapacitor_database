In order to ascertain the role and effect of various electrolytes on the electrochemical performances, comprehensive electrochemical study using large varieties of organic and inorganic acids, alkalis and salts as electrolytes were carried out by employing aminated graphenes as electrode materials. The aminated graphenes have been synthesised through chemical functionalization of graphene oxide using long chain amines [octylamine (OA) and octadecylamine (ODA)] covalently bonded to graphene oxide and subsequent in-situ reduction produced more stable reduced aminated graphene oxides. The octylamine modified reduced graphene oxide (rGO–OA) produces promising galvanic charge discharge supercapacitance value of 678.7 F/g with energy density 455.99 Wh/kg and power density 107.99 W/kg in zinc chloride (ZnCl2) electrolyte. On the other hand, rGO–OA in oxalic acid electrolyte shows the charge discharge supercapacitance value of 336.08 F/g at 0.05 A/g current density and also produce energy density of 241.98 Wh/kg and moderate power density of 221.85 W/kg. Similar trends can be observed with octadecyl amine modified reduced graphene oxide (rGO–ODA) also. Thus, best capacitance values of 248 F/g and 110 F/g in ZnCl2 and oxalic acid electrolytes respectively were recorded for rGO–ODA. The alkali electrolytes do not produce significant results and are thus omitted from the main text. The EIS measurement using Nyquist and Bode plots were also divulging the better capacitive and charge transfer behaviour of rGO–OA in ZnCl2 and Oxalic acid electrolytes.
