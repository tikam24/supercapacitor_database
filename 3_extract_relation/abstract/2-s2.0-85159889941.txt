The 2D materials have seen recent significant development in terms of material features with superior electrochemical capability. This urges for extensive research as potential aspirants for energystorage applications. Herein, the synthesis of MoS2 nanostructures with molar ratio 1:30 (nanosheets) and 1:15 (nanoflower) of ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate and thiourea single-steps hydrothermal methods through different reaction times and observed enhanced interlayer spacing is reported. Field emission scanning electron microscopy analysis reveals that synthesized MoS2 nanostructure has 3D flower-like and ultrathin 2D sheet-like morphologies. The enhanced interlayer spacing in nanoflower over nanosheet is confirmed through high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The X-ray diffraction and Raman studies reveal the hexagonal crystalline phase of MoS2 (2H-MoS2). Surface functional groups present are studied by Fourier transform infrared. Through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the chemical composition with its binding energy of prepared MoS2 is observed. Specific surface area and pore-size distribution of both 2H-MoS2 nanosheets and nanoflower are examined by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda analysis. Owing to these excellent physicochemical properties, nanoflower also exhibits energy-storage device capability. MoS2 nanoflower demonstrates high specific capacitance and cyclic stability in three-electrode systems. A practical approach is investigated to test the practical application of enhanced interlayer spacing by studying the time of charge and discharge of light-emitting diode.
