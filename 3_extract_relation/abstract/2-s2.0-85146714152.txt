Although proliferation of photovoltaic systems in power systems have caused some problems such as decreasing overall inertia, intermittency and etc., they have shown to have the potential to help improve power systems operation. For instance, photovoltaic systems have been proposed to provide frequency response. Previous research studies focusing on this subject have assumed photovoltaic systems with being subjected to shading conditions which is wrong. To fill this gap, this paper intends to investigate the effect of partial shading on the photovoltaic systems and propose a novel approach to enable photovoltaic systems to provide frequency response even under partial shading conditions. The simulation results prove the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach, being capable of enabling the photovoltaic systems to provide frequency response under normal (not shading) and partial shading conditions.
