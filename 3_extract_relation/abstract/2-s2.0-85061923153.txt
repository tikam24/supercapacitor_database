Manganese (Mn) based oxide materials are regarded as one of the favorable electrode materials, exhibiting a high energy density, low-cost and environmental benignity. In this work, we focus on synthesizing hollandite Na−Mn−O composites as potential supercapacitor electrode materials by a facile molten salt technique. The structure and the morphology of the Na−Mn−O system were significantly influenced by the synthesis temperature. The Na−Mn−O composite synthesized at 550 °C (Na−Mn−O 550) demonstrates a distinct structure and a mixed morphology of nanorods and nanoparticles. The Na−Mn−O 550 composite exhibits the best electrochemical performance with 306.0 F/g at 0.5 A/g and maintains 80.7 % capacity after 3000 charge-discharge times at 5 A/g. The largest specific capacitance of 64.0 F/g (0.3 A/g) and high energy density of 20.0 Wh/kg (226.1 W/kg) were achieved in the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor device based on the Na−Mn−O 550 and active carbon. Moreover, a long-cycling lifetime with 92.9 % retention after 10000 cycles was performed, which holds broad prospect for practical application in high performance energy storage devices.
