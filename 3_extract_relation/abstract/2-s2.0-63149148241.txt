This work describes that vanadium oxide can be anodically deposited at potentials much more negative to oxygen evolution from aqueous VOSO4 solutions by adding H2O2. Vanadium oxide deposit with a 3D nanonetwork architecture has been successfully deposited from VOSO4 with the addition of H2O2. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analyses reveal that this oxide deposit, mainly consisting of V5+ with minor amount V4+, shows a hydrous nature (denoted as VOx.wH2O). The VOx.wH2O deposit exhibits ideal pseudocapacitive performances in 3 M KC1. Â© The Electrochemical Society.
