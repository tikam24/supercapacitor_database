This paper presents the electrochemical characteristics of electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) based on two different non-aqueous electrolytes - 1 M LiPF6 and 1 M LiCF3SO3 in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate (1:1) mixture. The behavior of vanadium carbide derived carbon VC-CDC(800) and titanium carbide derived carbon TiC-CDC(950) in these electrolytes was studied using cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy. A wide region of ideal polarizability U ≤ 3.2 V, short characteristic time constant, limiting capacitance up to 129 F g-1, and high energy and power densities were obtained for systems with LiPF 6 electrolyte, indicating that this electrolyte can be used in supercapacitors with high specific performance. In case of LiCF 3SO3 electrolyte a lower voltage region of ideal polarizability was obtained and the highest discharge capacitance values were about 75 F g-1, explained by the electroreduction of CF 3SO3- anions and partial contamination of electrode surfaces under study. ©The Electrochemical Society.
