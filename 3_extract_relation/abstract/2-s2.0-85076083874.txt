Solar photovoltaic systems are renewable energy sources that are used around the world. However, one of the causes of reducing the efficiency of solar systems is the temperature increasing in solar panels. To prevent this phenomenon, a cooling fan can be installed on the back side of the solar panel. The solar system efficiency also decreases due to weather conditions and unexpected situations. To overcome this problem, an IoT (Internet of Things) system was used to monitor the state of the solar system and control the cooling fan. The core microprocessor used in IoT systems was Arduino. Using Arduino, an IoT system can be implemented simply and economically. Also by following the paradigm of using ESS(Energy Storage System) smartly, we can use long-lived supercapacitor to operate the fans. The entire system was designed and tested and the efficiency increased by approximately 4.7%. Although it is a small 30W capacity photovoltaic system, its efficiency is expected to be increased by applying it to a photovoltaic system of more than 1kW in the near future.
