Herein, we have developed a novel hybrid material based on NiCo2S4 (NCS), halloysite nanotubes (HNTs), and carbon as promising electrodes for supercapacitors (SCs). Firstly, mesoporous NCS nanoflakes were prepared by co-precipitation method followed by physically mixing with HNTs and carbon, and screen printed on nickel foam. After ultrasonication, a uniform distribution of the Carbon/HNTs complex was observed, which was confirmed by surface morphological analysis. When used as electrode material, the NCS/HNTs/C hybrid displayed a maximum specific capacity of 544 mAh g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. Later, a solid-state hybrid SCs was fabricated using activated carbon (AC) as the negative and NCS/HNTs/C as the positive electrode (NCS/HNTs/C//AC). The device delivers a high energy density of 42.66 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 8.36 kW kg−1. In addition, the device demonstrates long-term cycling stability. Furthermore, the optimized NCS, NCS/HNTs, and NCS/HNTs/C nanocomposites also presented superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance of 201, 169, and 116 mV in the acidic bath at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, respectively. Thus, the synthesis of NCS/HNTs/C nanocomposite as positive electrodes for hybrid SCs opens new opportunities for the development of next-generation high energy density SCs.
