Energy shortages and climate change call for the development of clean and sustainable energy. The development of green materials for clean energy storage and conversion is conducive to promoting the widespread use of clean energy. Conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) have been synthesized with various structures and properties, which offer designability for the molecular structures and nanopores of conjugated skeletons. The research of CMPs in clean energy technologies is significant for the improvement of CMP-based materials and their application in energy and environmental engineering. CMPs have shown great potential for challenging energy and environmental issues such as gas adsorption, photocatalysis, solar energy conversion, and electrical energy storage and conversion. This review aims to summarize the advances of synthesis and design on CMPs, computer simulations on CMPs, and the applications of CMPs in the clean energy technologies including hydrogen evolution and storage, the adsorption and conversion of carbon dioxide, rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors, fuel cells, and photovoltaic cells. We also propose the challenges and potential chances of the synthesis and the clean energy applications of CMPs.
