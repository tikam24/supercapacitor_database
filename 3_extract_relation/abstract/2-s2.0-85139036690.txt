This paper reviews proton-conducting polymer electrolytes comprising different pol-ymers, salts, and acids. The ionic conductivity of plasticized polymer electrolytes has been found to increase with the addition of plasticizers due to the dissociation of ion aggregates or undissoci-ated salt/acid present in the electrolytes, i.e., σ (plasticized polymer electrolytes) > σ (unplasti-cized polymer electrolytes). Proton-conducting nonaqueous nanocomposite plasticized polymer electrolytes containing poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVdF-HFP), polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), polyethylene oxide (PEO) polymers; different ammonium salts and acids as proton conductors; ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), dime-thylformamide (DMF), dimethylacetamide (DMA), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), diethyl carbonate (DEC) as plasticizers; fumed silica and alumina as nano-fillers have been discussed in de-tails. Conductivity studies (effect of salt/acid, effect of plasticizers, effect of nano-fillers, and effect of temperature), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and differential scanning calorimetry/thermal gravimetric analysis (DSC/TGA) studies for these electrolytes have been discussed and reported in the paper. Nanocomposite plasticized polymer electrolytes showed high ionic conductivity (in the order of 10-1 to 10-2 S/cm) at room temperature along with good thermal and mechanical stability due to the simultaneous addition of both plasticizers and nano-fillers. These nanocomposite polymer electrolytes are the best candidates for use in various electrochemical devices like solid-state batteries, fuel cells, supercapacitors, sensors, separators, and other electrochromic devices.
