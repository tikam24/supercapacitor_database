Here in we report a facile method of self-phosphorous doped porous carbon by a simple carbonization route (without using any activation process) under argon gas atmosphere. The as-prepared material with high surface area of 756 m2 g−1 shown high H2 storage capacity of ∼1.75 wt% at 298 K and 100 bars. Also, it exhibited a high specific capacitance of 253 Fg−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1. Further, it also showed the capacitive retention of ∼95% at the current density of 5 A g−1 for 10,000 cycles. Interestingly, a carbon material with porous structure is predominantly inspiring as they are cost-effective and ease to synthesis for industrial applications. Biomass derived self-phosphorous doped porous carbon is considered as a superior material for supercapacitor and hydrogen storage applications. It is shown high performance for both the applications, due to its exceptional chemical stability, conductivity, micro-meso porosity, high specific surface area, cost-effectiveness and sustainability.
