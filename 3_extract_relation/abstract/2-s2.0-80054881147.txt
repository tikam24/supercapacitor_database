This paper deals with the parameter identification of supercapacitors used in industrial applications and in particular in hoisting systems. On the basis of a simple numeric procedure, it is possible to have a good estimation of the equivalent capacitance and resistance of supercapacitor modules. Experimental tests on a prototype crane validate the theoretical procedure. The results are compared with those obtained by a more accurate model, showing that the suggested procedure is reasonably accurate but allows a very simple and straightforward estimation of superapacitor parameters.
