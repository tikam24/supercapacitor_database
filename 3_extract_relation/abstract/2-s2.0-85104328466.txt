Supercapacitors are high power density energy storage systems with a fast charge, low-rate discharge, and excellent cycle stability. Herein, optimized method was reported to produce liquefied bio-carbon nanofibers (L-BCNF-x). This technique is based on the heating of combined mangosteen peels (MP) with monohydroxybenzene (C6H6O) in an oil bath, followed by electrospinning and carbonization under 700 Â°C for 1 h. After characterization, results showed that well-structured micro/mesoporous structures make the prepared L-BCNF-x with well-defined amorphous shapes. However, following the mingling of liquefied bio-carbon (LC) and (polyacrylonitrile) PAN at various mass ratios, the prepared L-BCNF-4 (6:4 mass ratio) holds an excellent electrochemical performance for supercapacitors with a specific capacitance of 365.5 F/g at 0.5 A/g and retention rate of 97.7% after 10,000 cycles. More significantly, the device exhibits a high energy density of 18 Wh/kg at a power density of 348.9 W/kg at 1 A/g current density. The performance of L-BCNF-4 was assigned to its large surface area (508.73 m2/g) which shortens the ion diffusion paths and rapid migration of electrons. Our experimental ensues prove that due to the simplicity and cost-effectiveness through the less use of PAN of the optimized introduced method, L-BCNF-x reveals promising future green energy production applications.
