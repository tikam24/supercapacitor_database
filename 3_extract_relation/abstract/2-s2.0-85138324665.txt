The indiscriminate use of conventional energy sources has induced a rapid global imbalance. Hence the solution, which could pacify the great burden imposed on the nonrenewable energy sources for the vast energy requirements, is shifting our attention toward sustainable energy sources. Organic molecules and polymers have proved themselves as excellent candidates for sustainable development. Batteries and supercapacitor devices run at the forefront of energy storage and reduce the stress on fossil fuels and petroleum products. Incorporating small organic molecules and polymers in electrode systems for energy storage applications has amalgamated benefits including excellent flexibility, highly processable, and structural diversity in terms of organic backbone, environmentally nonperilous, cost effective, and sustainably degraded products. In this chapter, we aim to discuss about the significance of organic electrodes, the recent developments that have been incorporated into them and their probable applications. We have also thrown some light on the classification of organic electrodes based on the electrochemical reactions which occur within the system. We have tried to incorporate polymers with different backbones and skeletal structures including polymers containing conjugated double bonds, hetero atoms, and reactive radical containing functional groups and functionalized polymers with electron donating/electron withdrawing groups. The shortcomings associated with the organic electrodes have been discussed. The excellent electrochemical properties coupled with intensive flexibility and long-term stability enable the organic electrodes to be a prospective candidate in the field of smart, wearable, and sustainable energy devices.
