β-Co(OH)2/CNTs nanocomposite was prepared through a facile electrodeposition method onto stainless steel grid, and its charge storage capacity in supercapacitor applications was studied. The co-deposition of cobalt hydroxide/CNTs was carried out, for the first time, from a CNTs–COOH dispersed aqueous electrolyte containing 0.005M CoCl2. The simple deposition parameters were used, which included direct current mode (10 mA cm−2) at RT conditions. The characterization techniques of XRD, IR, FE-SEM, BET and TEM proved the deposition of crystalline β-Co(OH)2 hexagonal nanoplates grown onto electrophoretically deposited CNTs on the cathode surface. BET test indicated that the high surface area of 144.8 m2 g−1 with micro-porous surface for the fabricated composite. The GCD tests showed excellent charge storage behavior with delivering specific capacitances as high as 1287 F g−1 (0.5 A g−1), 1124 F g−1 (1 A g−1), 956 F g−1 (2 A g−1), 834 F g−1 (3 A g−1), 712 F g−1 (5 A g−1) and 573 F g−1 (10 A g−1) and capacity decay of 10.6% during 5000 cycles.
