Electrical energy storage (EES) devices are at the core of the environmental technologies that are highly influential in advancing our life in a future society. Among different EES technologies, electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) are considered as promising devices due to their high-power, safe and long-lived characteristics. One of the approaches to further enhance the cell voltage and energy density of EDLCs while maintaining their high power is to replace the activated carbon with ultrafast lithium ion battery materials. Increasing their cell voltage and energy density contribute to decrease a number of serial cell connection and a volumetric package, respectively. In this article, we introduce examples of the synthesis of several nanomaterials using our original ultracentrifugation process, allowing the in-situ growth of active materials onto carbon surface enables ultrafast electrochemical response for 2nd and 3rd generation supercapacitors.
