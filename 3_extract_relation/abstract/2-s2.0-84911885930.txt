Fiber electronic devices are commonly built on fibrous substrates with the advantages for the direct use as weavable and embedded device units or integrated textile modules. In this work, Mn2O3 cube-arrays/carbon wire electrodes were designed for a new kind of fiber supercapacitors. To realize micro-devices with well-optimized performance, different electrode structures were designed and fabricated including the straight, bent, and coiled fiber supercapacitors (S-FSC, B-FSC, and C-FSC), among which the C-FSC showed the optimized and best performance. Our work confirmed that the performance of micro-devices can be well tuned by simply tailoring the device architectures.
