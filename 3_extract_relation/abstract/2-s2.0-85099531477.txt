This paper gives an overview of recently demonstrated sensors based on the nanomaterials synthesized on different flexible and disposable substrates. The sensors to be presented are for wide range of applications, e.g. detection of toxic heavy metals, diagnostic applications etc. During the talk, the suitable different nanomaterials synthesis methods are to be also presented. The advantages and superiority of the emerging sensors using sustainable materials will also be discussed.
