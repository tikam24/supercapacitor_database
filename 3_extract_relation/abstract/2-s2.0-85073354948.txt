Wearable electronic devices need ceaseless improvement in performance and flexibility. However, few studies were focused on high mass loading electrodes. Herein, a 3D printing method was demonstrated to fabricate the high-performance supercapacitor on flexible carbon cloth using polypyrrole (PPy) nanotubes as electrode materials. The mass loading could achieve 336.56 mg cm−2 through direct ink printing (DIW) technology. In addition, the 3D printed supercapacitor exhibits excellent mechanical stability, the capacitance of the printed device remains 93% at the bending angle of 120°. Its promising performance and outstanding electrochemical stability will provide an ideal method to fabricate wearable storage devices.
