Electrical storage components such as ultracapacitors (UC) attract enlarged regard in different industry sectors from electric vehicles up to renewable power plants. Among existing storage technologies stand out asymmetric Li-ion hybrid and symmetric double-layer UC. Both devices able to provide prominent charge/discharge current together with extremely prolonged service life. However, Li-ion UC have twofold higher energy density and service life compared to that of conventional double-layer UC. Whereas a double-layer capacitor (DLUC) ensure four-six times lower internal resistance and more stable capacitance which isn't dependent on UC voltage. This guarantee more stable functionality and higher charge-discharge current.The developer of storage facilities to provide an optimal design should know mentioned above electrical properties of UC.Considering relative novelty of these storage technologies (Li-ion UC is manufactured 6-7 years only, DLUC âˆ¼15 years) two major parameters (internal resistance and capacitance) and their comparison aren't yet determined for a full range of their applicability.Considering this fact, the current article represents preliminary results of UC dynamic properties. In fact, they are internal resistance and capacitance testing of UC CPQ2300S (2300F, 2.2-3.8V, JSR Co.) and of BCAP3400 (3400F, 2.85V, Maxwell Technologies Co.). As these parameters are significantly changing with current, voltage and capacitor temperature following ranges were chosen: current 20-100A, and a voltage-due to the permissible range.
