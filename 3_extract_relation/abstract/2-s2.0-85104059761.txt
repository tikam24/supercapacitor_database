Simultaneously improving the flexibility and electrochemical performance of electrode materials is a key issue to develop high-performance flexible all-solid-state supercapacitors. Herein, carbon cloth (CC) was applied as a flexible substrate and coated by MoS2 nanosheets through a hydrothermal method. Polypyrrole (PPy) was then deposited on MoS2 nanosheets by electrochemical deposition. Therefore, a novel PPy/MoS2/CC composite was prepared, in which PPy improves not only the capacitive performance, but also the rate capability and cycling stability significantly. The areal capacitance of PPy/MoS2/CC reaches 1150.4 mF cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2 and the specific capacitance retention can still maintain 87.2% after 5000 cycles (at 5 mA cm−2). It is worth mentioning that PPy/MoS2/CC was applied as working electrode to assemble a flexible all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor. The device has a specific capacitance of 1016.4 mF cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2 and an energy density of 1.412 mWh cm−3 at the power density of 10 mW cm−3, which has outstanding application value for the development of flexible wearable devices.
