Development of supercapacitors have been experienced a fast growth to respond to the energy storage demand and to address the energy and environmental concerns. The selection of electrode materials has great importance to enhance the electrochemical properties of supercapacitor devices such as specific capacitance, energy and power density, cyclic stability, etc. Two-dimensional (2D) materials show a considerable potential to become a promising candidate for electrode material in supercapacitor devices. 2D nanomaterial and their composites have attracted increasing attraction due to their unique properties. In the current review, novel two-dimensional materials such as MXene, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs), metal nitrides (MNs), black phosphorus (BP), and perovskite are presented. Furthermore, their recent application as electrode material in supercapacitor devices is comprehensively discussed. Incorporation of 2D materials as supercapacitor electrodes have exhibited improved electrochemical properties such as high specific capacitance, larger energy and power density, excellent capacitive properties, and long charging-discharging rate, etc.
