Planar on-chip micro-supercapacitors (POMSs) with interdigital configuration were produced by photolithography and self-assembly of liquid-air interface. It is notable that the electrochemical performance of the POMS was significantly enhanced by reducing the electrode width from 300 μm to 180 μm, which highlight the importance of adjusting the width of electrode when creating high-performance POMS. It produced an area capacitance of 0.26 μF cm−2. In addition, POMS provide a power density of 0.825W cm−3, much higher than the power density of the electrolytic capacitor, and capacitor retention rate after 2000 cycles stabilized at 82.5%.
