Hierarchical materials supported on metal substrates present promising applications in flexible energy storage and conversion devices. Compared to Au, Ag, Cu, Ni, Ti, W and their alloys, Al, the most abundant metal in the crust has been less used in supercapacitors due to its high activity which makes it unstable in acid and base electrolytes. In this paper, we explore a novel Al/C/MnO2 sandwich structured material for the first time for supercapacitor. Owing to the highly porous and open surface structure and the highly conductive Al/C double core current collector on nanoscale, the Al/C/MnO2 sandwich nanowall arrays supported on Al foil show excellent capacitance performance with a maximum area specific capacitance of 1008.3 mF cm-2 and a high energy density of 35.2 Î¼Wh cm-2 at 2 mA cm-2. Moreover, a supercapacitor device with 4 supercapacitors connected in series can power a LED lamp. The present study demonstrates a novel electrode architecture based on Al foil with remarkably high area specific capacitance and stability for promising supercapacitor applications. Our strategy provides a new approach to the fabrication of hierarchical electrode materials from Al metal (could also be extend to other metal substrates) for supercapacitors and other energy storage and conversion devices.
