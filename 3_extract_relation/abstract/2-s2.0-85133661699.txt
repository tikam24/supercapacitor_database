Lignin (L) has a large storage capacity and high carbon content in nature; obtaining the required electrochemical properties by direct carbonization of L is difficult. N and S co-doped L-based carbon material was successfully prepared by one-step microwave method. The structure, surface elements, and chemical states of the materials were tested by FTIR, SEM, TEM, XPS, and BET. The capacitance of modified lignin reached 232.4 F g−1 (1 A g−1). When circulating after 100,000 times under 10 A g−1, the retention rate was 86.59% of the initial value. A supercapacitor was assembled with the prepared material as positive electrode and AC as negative electrode. It offered the energy density of 12.603 W h kg−1, and its power density could achieve 749.99 W kg−1. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
