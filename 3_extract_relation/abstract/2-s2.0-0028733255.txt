The development of electric and hybrid vehicles is currently dependent on the improvement in the performance of electrochemical storage, which presently lacks the energy density, recharge power density, cycle life and storage efficiency needed in order that electric vehicles can match conventional vehicles in range and performance. A supercapacitor energy storage system is described, which could be used to enhance the performance of batteries, or, in the case of hybrid vehicles, replace batteries altogether. The ability of a capacitor to store energy is well known, showing high power density, cycle life and storage efficiency. While capacitors presently lack the energy density needed to meet the requirements of electric vehicles, supercapacitors are now being developed which may well meet the requirement of hybrid vehicles. Current progress in supercapacitor development is reviewed and an energy storage system suitable for hybrid vehicles described, comprising a capacitor bank and DC-DC converter. Its performance is predicted by computer simulation.
