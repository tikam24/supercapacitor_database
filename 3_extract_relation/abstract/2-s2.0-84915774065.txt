Amorphous carbon electrodes were deposited using atmospheric pressure plasma torch from the mixture of argon and acetylene gases on the stainless steel substrates. The ratio of Ar/C2H2 was in the range of 15-55. The deposited coatings were immersed in low pressure oxygen plasma for 1 min. Scanning electron microscopy images show that when Ar/C2H2 ratio increases from 15 to 55, the electrodes surface roughness decreases. The Raman scattering spectroscopy results indicated that the ID/IG ratio decreases from 2.04 to 1.35. It was observed that with the increase of Ar/C2H2 ratio from 15 to 55, the capacity of supercapacitor increases from 16 mF to 36 mF. The electric capacity of capacitors has increased up to 7 times after their exposure in oxygen plasma.
