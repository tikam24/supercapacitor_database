Making full use of the high water-holding capability of bacterial cellulose, a highly N/S dual-doped carbon fibers (NSCF) with interconnected three dimensional structure is prepared by an absorption-swelling strategy. Supercapacitor electrode fabricated from this material delivers a high specific capacitance of 202 F g− 1, which is two times higher than that of the pristine un-doped one at current density of 1.0 A g− 1. This dual-doped NSCF shows good wettability, fast ion-transportation and desirable electrical conductivity, which are indispensable characters of an electrode material in building the supercapacitor with desired high power performances.
