Carbon nanofiber paper was prepared by electrospinning from thermosetting phenolic resin, followed by activation via KOH-containing molten salt at high temperature. By adding a small dosage of KOH in the molten salt the porous volume and specific surface area could be greatly improved. The obtained porous carbon nanofibers had a specific surface area of 1007 m2 g−1, total pore volume of 0.363 cm3 g−1, micropore volume of 0.247 cm3 g−1. The electrochemical measurements in 6 M KOH aqueous solution showed that the porous carbon nanofibers possessed high specific capacitance and considerable rate performance. The maximal specific capacitance of 288 F g−1 was achieved at 0.2 A g−1 and the specific capacitance could still remain 204 F g− 1 at 20 A g−1 with the retention of 71%. In the molten salt system, the reaction between activating agent and carbon could be more efficient, hence, such molten salt-assisted activation method was considered as a general activation method for the high-specific-surface-areaed carbons.
