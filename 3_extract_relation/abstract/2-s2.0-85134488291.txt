Mixed-phase 1T/2H MoS2 has been receiving immense attention as an electrode material for supercapacitors due to the synergistic effects of both the phases. Herein, we synthesized mixed-phase 1T/2H MoS2 via two different techniques: conventional hydrothermal (HT) and microwave-assisted hydrothermal (MHT) technique. The formation of MoS2 is confirmed through X-ray diffraction pattern, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Raman-spectra, and X-ray photoelectron spectra. The electrochemical performance of the two samples is investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), Gravimetric charging-discharging (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). MoS2 synthesized via MHT method (MS-MW) and HT method (MS-HT) deliver capacitances of 421 F g−1 and 742 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1, respectively. The energy density of MS-HT (57 Wh kg−1) is almost double than that of MS-MW (30 Wh kg−1). MS-HT also exhibited remarkable capacitance retention of 91% over 1200 cycles, compared with MS-MW. The results demonstrate that MoS2 synthesized by the hydrothermal method delivers superior electrochemical performance.
