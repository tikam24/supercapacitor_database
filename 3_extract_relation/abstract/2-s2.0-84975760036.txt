A promising electrode material barium manganate (BaMnO3) for electrochemical supercapacitor was prepared by solution combusted manganese tartrate complex process. Several analytical tools such as X-ray diffractometry, FT-IR spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance spectra, TG/DTA, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have been used to characterize the BaMnO3 nanomaterial. Electrochemical properties of the synthesized composites were elucidated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements. This material showed excellent cycling capability, even at the high current and excellent capacity retention with the best combination of coulombic efficiency of 93.9% and specific capacitance of 141.6 F g-1 after 500 cycles. These results clearly indicate the high rate discharge performances of BaMnO3 and it can be recognized as high-performance electrode material.
