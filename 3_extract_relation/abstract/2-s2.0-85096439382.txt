Biomass-based activated carbon has been synthesized from angsana leaves (Pterocarpus indicus) for high capacitive properties of supercapacitor electrodes. To establish the high specific capacitance, the synthesis process of activated carbon from biomass-based chemical activation is established in this study. This study focuses on the chemical activation process using ZnCl2. Single-step carbonization and physical activation processes are chosen as pyrolysis process. ZnCl2 activator agent exhibit excellent capacitive as high as 202 F g-1. This excellent capacitive supported by porosity and chemical content analysis which present high specific surface area as high as 477.513 m2g-1 and high carbon content of 95.75%. The microcrystalline dimension and surface morphology also characterized for support data.
