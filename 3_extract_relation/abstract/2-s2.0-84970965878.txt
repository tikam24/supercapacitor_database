High-aspect-ratio, three dimensional (3D) microstructures have been constructed by a direct-write method via self-aligned near-field electrospinning process. Using papers as the collectors, the process enables both design and fabrication of a variety of 3D structures, such as walls, grids and other configurations based on layer-by-layer deposition of electrospun micro/nano fibers. Afterwards, these fabricated polymeric structures can be mechanically separated from the paper substrate for various applications. In this work, we have successfully fabricated 20-layer, ca. 100 μm in thickness, 2 × 2 cm2 3D grid-structures made of PVDF (Polyvinylidene fluoride) electrospun fibers. After a coating process using the dip-and-dry process in the CNT (carbon nanotube) ink, conductive and flexible electrodes made of CNT coated polymer grid-structures have been demonstrated and assembled as a micro-supercapacitor.
