A key challenge in the development of electrochemical energy storage (EES) is the design and engineering of electrode materials for electrochemical reactions. Transition metal oxalates (TMOxs) have been widely used in various EES applications due to their low cost, simple synthesis, and excellent electrochemical performance. In this review, the recent advances in the design and engineering of transition metal oxalate-based micro- and nanomaterials for EES are summarized. Specifically, the survey will focus on three types of micro- and nano-scale TMOxs (monometallic, bimetallic, and trimetallic TMOxs), their composites (TMOx-metal oxide, TMOx-hydroxide, TMOx-GO, and TMOx-MOFs composites), and derivatives, including transition metal oxides (TiO2, V2O5, MnxOy, Co3O4, NiO, CuO, and Nb2O5), multi-transition metal oxides (MCo2O4 (M = Ni, Cu, and Zn), NiMn2O4, and NxOy-MxOy), transition metal sulfide (NiS2), and carbon materials (ordinary carbon, GO and their composites), within the context of their intrinsic structure and corresponding electrochemical performance. A range of experimental variables will be carefully analyzed, such as sample synthesis, crystal structure, and electrochemical reaction mechanism. The applications of these materials as EES electrodes are then featured for supercapacitors (SCs) and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). We conclude the review with a perspective of future research prospects and challenges.
