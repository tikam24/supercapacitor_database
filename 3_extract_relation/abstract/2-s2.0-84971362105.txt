We discuss the nonlinear effects and efficiency of charge storage in supercapacitors with nanoporous electrodes and ionic liquids, and demonstrate that to maximize the stored energy, it may be beneficial to create 'obstacles' or 'difficulties' in charging. This can be achieved by making thermodynamically unfavourable conditions for ions inside nanopores, or more favourable outside. We show by means of Monte Carlo simulations that such 'ionophobic' pores store energy more efficiently and can provide equivalent or even better energy capacity. Since the recent analysis predicts much faster charging of ionophobic nanopores, we conclude that such pores offer a better option for simultaneous energy/power optimization.
