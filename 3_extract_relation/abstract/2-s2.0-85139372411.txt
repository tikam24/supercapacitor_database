Recently, biomass-derived nitrogen self-doped porous activated carbon has gained more interest in the area of low-cost energy storage systems. In this work, nitrogen self-doped porous activated carbons (NPACs) derived from raw leather trimming waste has been prepared by carbonization followed by chemical activation using KOH as an activating agent at different temperature (600, 700, & 800 °C). The prepared NPAC-700 had a very high specific surface area of 1364 ± 18 m2 g−1, the pore volume was 0.7 ± 0.06 cm3 g-1, and the pore size of ~2–5 nm. The specific capacitance value of 251 ± 7 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and capacity retention of 91 % even after 10,000 cycles at 10 A g−1 is noteworthy. NPAC-700 produced a maximum energy density of 6.95 Wh kg−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and a high-power density of 9972 W kg−1 at 20 A g−1. Also, we fabricated a pouch type supercapacitor (5 × 5 cm2) exhibiting a superior high specific capacitance of 108 ± 5 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. Thus, an efficient value added product has been developed from industrial waste.
