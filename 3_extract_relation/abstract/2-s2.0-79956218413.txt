The paper deals with a new energy management strategy for pure electric vehicles (PEV) with dual energy storage systems (battery and ultracapacitor). The proposed strategy is able to split the power demand between battery and ultracapacitor maximizing the driving range and the performances of the vehicle and increasing the life cycle of the battery. To accomplish load sharing an energetic model of the PEV is formulated and an optimal control problem with inequality constraints is resolved using the particle swarm optimization technique (PSO) to search the global near-optimum at each sample interval. Different types of batteries (Lead-acid, NiMH and Li-ion) have been considered alternatively togheter with the supercapacitor. The results show that the proposed strategy guarantees energy saving and assures failsafe operations for the battery unaffecting the drivability of the vehicle.
