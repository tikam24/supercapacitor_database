Cerium oxide nanoparticles and cerium oxide nanoparticle-decorated graphene oxide (GO) are synthesized via a facile chemical coprecipitation method in the presence of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Nanostructure studies and electrochemical performances of the as-prepared samples were systematically investigated. The crystalline structure and morphology of the nanocomposites were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transition electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectrum, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Electrochemical properties of the CeO2 electrode, the GO electrode, and the nanocomposites electrodes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The CeO2 nanoparticle-decorated GO (at the mole ratio of CeO2/GO = 1:4) electrode exhibited excellent supercapacitive behavior with a high specific capacitance of 382.94 F/g at the current density of 3.0 A/g. These superior electrochemical features demonstrate that the CeO2 nanoparticle-decorated GO is a promising material for next-generation supercapacitor systems.
