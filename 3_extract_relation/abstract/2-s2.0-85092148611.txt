In recent years, supercapacitors (SCs) have attracted considerable attention in the field of energy storage, and the design and engineering of effective electrode materials represent a critical part of research efforts. Consequently, vanadium(v)-based nanocomposites are of particular interest, primarily because V possesses a variety of valence states (i.e., V2+, V3+, V4+, and V5+) and is cost efficient. In this review article, vanadium oxides, vanadium nitrides, vanadium sulfides, and mixed metal vanadates are primarily studied as V-based materials. Further, these compounds exhibit unique properties. In addition, recent advances in the preparation and electrochemical activity of V-based nanocomposites for SC applications are summarized with regard to synthesis methods, nanocomposite morphologies, and electrochemical performances. This review is concluded with a perspective, where promises and challenges of functional nanocomposites for SC applications are highlighted.
