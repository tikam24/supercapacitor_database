Herein, we fabricated ternary nanocomposites (NCs) of reduced graphene oxide (rGO), ruthenium oxide (RuO2) and polyaniline nanofiber (Pani-NFs) as a flexible electrode for supercapacitor application. NCs and their individual components were characterized using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The ternary NCs displayed areal capacitance as high as 1.5 F.cmâˆ’2 and thereby, indicated its potential as a supercapacitor electrode material.
