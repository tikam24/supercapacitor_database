In this work, novel electrodeposited palladium oxide-polypyrrole (PdP) and its ternary composite with reduced graphene oxide (PdPGO) draped over the surface of PdP were synthesised to achieve the excellent electrochemical properties and high stability. An exhaustive study has been carried out to correlate the crystalline structure, chemical bonding, morphological behaviour, redox reactions at the electroactive species, and its promising influences on the electrochemical performance. The electrodeposited PdPGO composite on stainless steel bestows superior electrochemical properties and a specific capacitance of 595 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in 1 M H2SO4. The incorporation of rGO with the PdP matrix prevents the aggregation of rGO layers and is responsible for the enhanced electrostatic interactions at the electrode-electrolyte interface in PdPGO. Outstanding supercapacitance retention of 88% even after 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1 was accomplished for the ternary composite of Pd. These profound electrochemical characteristics are due to the synergistic effect of the individual components involved, manifest a great potential for Pd based composites toward novel electrode materials for supercapacitors of high efficiency. This method facilitates blueprints for synthesizing a series of advanced electrode materials for enhancing high storage capability. The high electrochemical performance of the PdPGO reveals how synergy plays a very important role to work on the blueprint to create active electrode materials for energy storage solutions.
