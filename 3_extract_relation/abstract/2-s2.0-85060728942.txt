The faster growth of the microelectronics industry and consumer's demand for tiny, portable electronic devices increases the necessity of micro-scale energy storage units. Micro-supercapacitors have potential to support tiny micro-electronic devices by replacing or complimenting batteries and electrolytic capacitors. Nanoporous gold (NPG)–Nitrogen doped carbon nano-onions (NCNO) based micro-supercapacitor is an attempt to develop an energy storage unit that is compatible with microelectronic devices. A simple two-step process of thermal evaporation followed by dealloying and electrophoretic deposition were used for NPG growth and NPG–NCNO electrode preparation. The process is economical and easily scalable Nanoporous gold (NPG) is an attractive material for current collector due to its three-dimensional interconnected pores with high electrical conductivity and high surface area for NCNO loading. NPG–NCNO micro-supercapacitor device shows an areal capacitance 1.16 mF cm−2. The maximum energy density and power density obtained from NPG–NCNO micro-supercapacitor were 0.16 μWh cm−2 and 24.87 μW cm−2 at the scan rate of 10 mVs−1 and 200 mVs−1 respectively.
