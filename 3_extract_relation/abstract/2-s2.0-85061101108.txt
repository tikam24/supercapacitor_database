In this paper, we propose a control and fuzzy logic Power Management Supervisor (PMS) for a grid-connected wind power system associated with Hybrid Energy Storage (HES) made up of Batteries (BT) and Supercapacitor (SC). Batteries are used to meet the energy requirements of a long-term, while SC is used to meet the demand for instant power. The SC can act as a buffer against large magnitudes and rapid fluctuations of power. The PMS is developed to manage the energy flows between the storage devices, by maintaining their State Of Charge (SOC) into acceptable levels, and to establish the priority order between them. The main objective of this work is the combination of two storage technologies with fuzzy logic supervision. It aims to meet the expectations of various production scenarios for a wind generator, to keep stable the DC bus voltage, and to participate in ancillary services such as: respecting a production program, supporting the grid and optimizing storage elements lifespan. Simulation results prove the efficiency of proposed power control and supervision strategy.
