The delicate design of nanostructures consisting of multiple components is important for dual-function electrode materials for energy storage. In this work, cobalt-doped nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (Fe-Ni3Co2 LDH) assembled from one-dimensional (1D) nanoneedle subunits and FeSe2/C is synthesized via a facile, one-pot self-template method. FeNi3Co2 LDH exhibits remarkable activity for catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction with a low onset overpotential of 224 mV and a low Tafel slope of 73 mV dec-1, much better than those of FeNi LDH. Significantly, the Fe-Ni3Co2 LDH//FeSe2/C asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) delivers an ultra-high energy density (22.3 Î¼W h cm-2), high power density (2.07 mW cm-2), and outstanding cycling stability (84.8% capacitance retention after 5000 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles at 0.3 mA). The density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that the high electrochemical activity of Fe-NiCo LDHs is mainly attributed to cobalt doping which can modify the electronic structure and narrow the bandgap, thereby bringing enhanced conductivity, facile electron transfer, and abundant active sites. Our work could provide new insight into the synthesis of novel multifunctional nanomaterials. This journal is
