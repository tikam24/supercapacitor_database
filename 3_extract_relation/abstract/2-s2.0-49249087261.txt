Fuel cell (FC) is hybridized with supercapacitor (supercap) with two DC-DC converters to let FC operate smoothly in the environments where power fluctuation is severe. The proposed structure is thought to beneficial for lengthening the life time of FC, since it releases FC from a possible bad current cycling and sever load changes. An integrated control method is pursued which utilizes inverter information in the calculation of the converter switching duty. Experimental results supporting the proposed scheme are presented.
