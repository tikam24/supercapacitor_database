The objective of this project was to obtain high dielectric constant polymeric composites to be used as supercapacitors. The composites were formed by a polymeric matrix, polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) and perovskite particles of high dielectric constant (Na1/3Ca1/3Bi1/3Cu3Ti4O12). The perovskite was synthetized by solid-state reaction and added to the polymeric matrix by casting, followed by a melting mixing and injection molded processes. The masterbatches produced by casting were melted together with the matrix in a torque rheometer HaakeTM by RheomixTM ; subsequently each sample was molded in a Ray-RanTM Test Sample Injection Molding Press. After that, the potential application as supercapacitors was evaluated by measuring the dielectric properties in AC by impedance spectroscopy. The morphology of these composites was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The evaluation showed particle agglomeration and an improvement in the PVDF dielectric permittivity. The Maxwell Garnett equation (MG) and a new model (NM) were compared with the experimental data, showing that their predictions was far below the obtained ones.
