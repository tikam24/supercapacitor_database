Recently, sustainable development and serious energy crisis called for appropriate managements for the large number of municipal and industrial waste plastics as well as the development of low-cost, advanced materials for energy storage. However, the complexity of waste plastics significantly hampers the application of ever used methods, and little attention is paid to the utilization of waste plastics-derived carbon in energy storage. Herein, porous carbon nanosheets (PCNSs) was produced by catalytic carbonization of “real-world” mixed waste plastics on organically-modified montmorillonite (OMMT) and the subsequent KOH activation. PCNSs was featured on hierarchically micro-/mesoporous structures with the pore size distribution centered on 0.57, 1.42 and 3.63 nm and partially exfoliated graphitic layers, and showed a high specific surface area of 2198 m 2 g −1 and a large pore volume of 3.026 cm 3 g −1 . Benefiting from these extraordinary properties, PCNSs displayed a superior performance for supercapacitors with high specific capacitances approaching 207 and 120 F g −1 at a current density of 0.2 A g −1 in aqueous and organic electrolytes, respectively. Importantly, when the current density increased to 10 A g −1 , the specific capacitances remained at 150 F g −1 (72.5%) and 95 F g −1 (79.2%) in aqueous and organic electrolytes, respectively. The outstanding rate capability of PCNSs was in sharp contrast to the performance of traditional activated carbons. This work not only provides a potential way to recycle mixed waste plastics, but also puts forward a facile sustainable approach for the large-scale production of PCNSs as a promising candidate for supercapacitors.
