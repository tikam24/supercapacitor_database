Mesoporous ternary oxides (NiCo2O4, CuCo2O4, MnCo2O4) and quaternary mixed oxides (CuNiCo2O4, CuMnCo2O4, MnNiCo2O4) are synthesized through a urea and surfactant- aided co-precipitation method, followed by a post-thermal treatment at 500 ºC. All materials are characterized by means of XRD, TEM-SAED, N2 -sorptiometry and FTIR spectrometry. All samples have a mesoporous structure. The CuCo2O4 sample consists of CuO (monoclinic) and CuCo2O4 spinel structure and MnCo2O4 consisted of α-MnO2 and MnCo2O4 spinels structure. The supercapacitor performances of quaternary nano-oxides are examined in comparison with their corresponding ternary oxides by cyclic voltammetry (CV), charge-discharge (CD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. Both CuCo2O4 and MnCo2O4 electrodes exhibit excellent supercapacitor performances that show a high specific capacitance of 915 F g-1 and 690 F g-1 at 56 mA g-1, respectively. The quaternary mixed oxides have low performance. The CuCo2O4 and MnCo2O4 electrodes show capacitance retention of 99 and 98.8%, respectively which explain their superior cycle stability.
