It is urgent to develop transparent electrochemical energy storage devices such as transparent supercapacitors for wearable and portable electronic devices. The carbonized leaf vein is composed of a continuous carbon fiber network, which has the advantages of very good transparency, good conductivity and light weight. In this paper, we used carbonized leaf vein network as current collector to directly grow Ni/Co-based metal organic frameworks (MOFs) by using a solvothermal method. The continuous carbon fiber network of carbonized leaf vein can provide pathways for continuous electron and ion transportation. The mixed metal centers in Ni/Co-MOF are beneficial to provide more electrochemical sites for charge storage. The prepared transparent carbonized leaf vein network@Ni/Co-MOF electrode exhibited a high areal capacity of 1.15F/cm2 at a current density of 1mA/cm2. In addition, its capacity retention rate after 1000 cycles was 105.4%, indicating a good cycle stability. The transparent asymmetric transparent supercapacitor was assembled by carbonized leaf vein@Ni/Co MOFs and carbonized leaf vein@activated carbon, which achieved an areal capacitance of 0.47F/cm2 and an areal energy density of 0.61WÂ·h/cm2 in a wide potential range of 0-1.6V and at a current density of 1mA/cm2. Moreover, the supercapacitor exhibited a good cycling stability with an areal capacitance retention rate of 93.6% after 300 cycles. The method presented here provides a new way for the preparation of transparent functional devices such as sensors, optoelectronic devices, solar cells and lithium-ion batteries.
