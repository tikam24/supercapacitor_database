Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) like Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) are confessed as an effective energy storage materials due to their 2D structure analogues to graphene. Robust 3D architectures of graphene oxide-polypyrrole (GO-PPy) and molybdenum disulfide-polypyrrole (MoS2-PPy) were fabricated by facile, one pot chronoamperometry method to achieve scalable, conductive additive free and binder free supercapacitor electrodes. The electrodeposited GO-PPy and MoS2-PPy electrodes exhibit the specific capacitance of 271 F g−1 and 130 F g−1 respectively at a current density of 1 A g−1. The introduction of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) in PPy matrix offered high capacitance, whereas graphene analogue MoS2 improved the structural stability. Pronounced cycling stability (>2000 cycles) and note-worthy capacitive retentions were also displayed by these composites. MoS2-PPy and GO-PPy retain 82 and 64% of its initial capacitance respectively. These findings are backed up by the correlation of structure and electrochemical performance of GO-PPy and MoS2-PPy.
