Considering the demand of distributed power trading, a user-side power routing device topology is designed. The operation scenario of the device is divided into eight operation states, and the operation control strategy of the device system oriented to power trading is proposed for the eight operation states. In the process of power trading, grid-connected converters adopt Direct Power Control (DPC) to realize constant power trading. Super Capacitor (SC) adopt constant voltage control, Lithium battery adopt droop control, the Super Capacitor and the Lithium battery work together as the system bus voltage control unit. A simulation model is built on PSCAD/EMTDC platform, and two typical scenarios of power trading mode and non-trading mode are compared and analyzed. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.
