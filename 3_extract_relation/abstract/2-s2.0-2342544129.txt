Recent developments in the field of supercapacitors make very promising the use of these equipments in a large range of applications. In particular, it is useful to introduce supercapacitors in all the drive applications, in which an energy recovery it is possible. In this paper, a predictive control of the supercapacitor storage system is proposed and tested in the field of the automatic warehouse. Experimental results show the increased performances of the systems thanks to supercapacitors energy recovery capability.
