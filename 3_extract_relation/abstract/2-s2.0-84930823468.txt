Abstract Scrolled graphene are designed by a simple microexplosion technique using a mild ionic catalyst-Fe<sup>3+</sup>, and assembled into the scroll-sheet conjoined nanomaterials (SSCNs) with unscrolled parts for supercapacitor. The morphology and structure of SSCNs are characterized by transmission electron microscope, N<inf>2</inf> adsorption/desorption, Raman spectra and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The results demonstrate that graphene (GS) are partly scrolled on the edge, with the scroll and sheet conjoined together. SSCN has a high specific capacitance of 224 F g<sup>-1</sup> at 1.0 A g<sup>-1</sup>, and still displays a specific capacitance of 181 F g<sup>-1</sup> at 30.0 A g<sup>-1</sup>, while the value is only 95 F g<sup>-1</sup> for GS and 84 F g<sup>-1</sup> for the composites of GS and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (GS/MWCNTs), suggesting that the introduction of scroll-sheet conjoined structure significantly enhances the capacitive performance of GS.
