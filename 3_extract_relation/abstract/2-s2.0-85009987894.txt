We demonstrated that a new type of electrochemical capacitor using redox reactions of iodide ions in single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) work very nicely. It was found by charge-discharge experiments that SWCNT cathode shows almost constant value corresponding to the I-/I2 redox potential regardless of the accumulated charge. The 2I- â†’ I2 + 2e- redox reaction was confirmed by electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance measurements. It was also found by in situ Raman measurements that the majority of the iodine molecules produced by the redox reaction tend to remain in SWCNTs. Since the cycle and rate performances of the test cell were quite good, the fast redox reactions of iodide ions occur inside SWCNTs very effectively.
