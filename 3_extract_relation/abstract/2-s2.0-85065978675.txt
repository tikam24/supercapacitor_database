The paper proposes the supercapacitor which solves the high current starting problem of three phase induction machine when it is subjected to load condition.Super capacitor is a energy storage device,it will stores the energy in it at the time of normal condition,and at the time of load condition it will supplies the energy which is stored in it to the three phase induction machine.The three phase induction machine and DC motor are coupled by using a mechanical shaft.Super capacitor is place across the DC motor and a controller also used in this system. A circuit is designed like this by using MATLAB software to observe the problem of starting high currents in three phase induction machines.
