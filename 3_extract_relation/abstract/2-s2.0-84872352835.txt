Three-dimensional manganese dioxide (MnO2)-functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) electrodes have been produced by a simple and scalable thermal decomposition process. The electrodes are prepared by treating planar MWCNT sheets with manganese(II) nitrate (Mn(NO3) 2) solution and annealing at low temperature (200-300 C) and ambient pressure. The morphology, chemical composition, and structure of the resulting matrices have been investigated with scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. Supercapacitors assembled with three-dimensional electrodes exhibit a 14-fold increase in specific capacitance (C sp) in comparison to those containing pristine, two-dimensional MWCNT electrodes. C sp varies linearly with Mn(NO3)2 thermal decomposition temperature (from 100 to 61 F/g at 0.2 A/g), a trend that is discussed in the context of nitrate reaction chemistry and MWCNT structure. This efficient and promising approach allows for simultaneous enhancement of electrode-electrolyte contact area and incorporation of redox-based charge storage within electrochemical capacitors.
