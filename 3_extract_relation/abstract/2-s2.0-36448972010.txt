Nanostructured Mn O2 was synthesized at ambient condition by reduction of potassium permanganate with aniline. Powder X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis (thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area, and infrared spectroscopy studies were carried out for physical and chemical characterization. The as-prepared Mn O2 was amorphous and contained particles of 5-10 nm diameter. Upon annealing at temperatures >400°C, the amorphous Mn O2 attained crystalline α -phase with a concomitant change in morphology. A gradual conversion of nanoparticles to nanorods is evident from scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies. High-resolution TEM images suggested that nanoparticles and nanorods grow in different crystallographic planes. Capacitance behavior was studied by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling in a potential range from -0.2 to 1.0 V vs SCE in 0.1 M sodium sulfate solution. Specific capacitance of about 250 F g-1 was obtained at a current density of 0.5 mA cm-2 (0.8 A g-1). © 2007 The Electrochemical Society.
