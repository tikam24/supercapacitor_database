With the recent environmental issues, the adoption of EVs and HEVs has expanded. Because of the increased demand, manufacturers are investing in new technologies. The goal is to address environmental issues by reducing transportation emissions and developing powertrains that recover energy during different driving cycles. Furthermore, manufacturers can ensure an easy and simplified driving experience by combining intelligent and secure devices. One of the issues impacting transportation electrification is energy production, conversion, storage, and recovery. For example, the kinetic energy is converted and dissipated as heat when using conventional brakes. It demonstrates the importance of recycling energy to improve efficiency and safety in complex situations. In addition, one of the main problems to be solved is autonomy, which will increase through energy regeneration during various driving cycles and modes. This article is divided into four sections. The first section will describe the latest technological aspects, the second section will explain the hybrid energy storage system characteristics with the main configurations, and the third section will present the studied model and results from the interpretation. Finally, we will conclude with the importance of combining two energy storage devices in system performance.
