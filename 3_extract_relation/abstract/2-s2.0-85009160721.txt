The porous nanostructures have drawn considerable attention because of their abundant pore volume and unique properties that provide outstanding performance in catalysis and energy storage applications. This study proposes the growth mechanism of porous NiCo 2 S 4 composited with halloysite (HL) via a self-assembly method using halloysite as a template and component. Electrochemical tests showed that the NiCo 2 S 4 -HL exhibited an ultrahigh specific capacitance (Csp) (589C g −1 at 1A g −1 ) and good cycle stability (Csp retention of 86% after 1000 cycles). The desirable capacitive performance of the NiCo 2 S 4 -HL can be attributed to the large specific surface area and short diffusion path for electrons and ions in the hierarchical porous structure. The superior electrochemical performances with the energy density of 35.48 W h kg −1 at a power density of 199.9 W kg −1 were achieved in an assembled aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device using NiCo 2 S 4 -HL as a positive electrode and N-doped graphene (NG) as a negative electrode. Moreover, the NiCo 2 S 4 -HL//NG asymmetric supercapacitor achieved outstanding cycle stability (also retained 83.2% after 1700 cycles). The high-performance of the ASC device will undoubtedly make the porous NiCo 2 S 4 -HL as potential electrode materials attractive in energy storage systems.
