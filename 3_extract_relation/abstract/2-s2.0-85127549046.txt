Sodium and potassium ions energy storage systems with low cost and high energy/power densities have recently drawn increasing interest as promising candidates for grid-level applications, while the lack of suitable anode materials with fast ion diffusion kinetics highly hinders their development. Herein, we develop a nanoscale confined in situ oxidation polymerization process followed by a conventional carbonization treatment to generate phosphorus and nitrogen dual-doped hollow carbon spheres (PNHCS), which can realize superior sodium and potassium ion storage performance. Importantly, the density functional theory calculation and combined characterizations, e.g., in situ Raman spectroscopy and ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, decipher that the P/N doping can enhance the electronic transfer dynamics and ion adsorption capability, which are responsible for enhanced electrochemical performance. Inspiringly, the practicability of the PNHCS anode is demonstrated by assembling the potassium ion hybrid capacitors (KIHCs), where the prominent energy density is 178.80 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 197.65 W kg-1, with excellent cycling stability, can be achieved. This work not only promotes the development of efficient anode material for sodium/potassium ion storage devices but also deciphers the embedded ion storage mechanism.
