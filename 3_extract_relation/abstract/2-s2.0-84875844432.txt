PbO2 is electrodeposited onto a graphite substrate, and coupled with activated carbon (AC) to construct a hybrid PbO2/AC supercapacitor. The PbO2/AC supercapacitor can be operated from 1.88 to 0.65 V, and delivers a specific capacitance of 63.2 F g-1 (based on the mass of two active materials) at a discharge current of 150 mA g -1 (5 C rate) when the mass ratio of AC to PbO2 is set at 2:1. The hybrid system exhibits attractive energy and power performance. The specific energy reaches 27 Wh kg-1 at a specific power of 152 W kg-1, and at a power of 691 W kg-1, the energy remains at 18 Wh kg-1. The use of a graphite current collector also ensures stability of the electrode in an H2SO4 environment. After 3000 deep cycles under 10 C, the capacity only fades 20% from its initial value.
