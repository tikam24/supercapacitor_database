The DC/DC converter control presents non-minimum phase behaviour in boost mode as its control plant has a Right Hand Plane (RHP) zero. The RHP zero restricts the achievement of high dynamic performance and make the control design a challenging task. This paper investigates the use of classic PI controller and Model Predictive Control (MPC) to regulate the converter output voltage to achieve high dynamic performance. The DC/DC converter under study is a non-isolated bidirectional DC/DC converter interfacing supercapacitors energy storage device to a DC Micro Grid(DCMG). The MPC control problem is formulated as a current regulation problem, which enables using a short prediction horizon and hence less computational power. The controllers design are compared and performance are verified using MATLAB software.
