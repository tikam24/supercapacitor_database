Supercapacitors are an important developing technology for renewable energy, hybrid and electric vehicles, and personal electronics. One material of interest for supercapacitor electrodes is Mn2O3, which is low cost, nontoxic, and easily fabricated. While traditional electrode fabrication involves mixing active materials with binders and conductive agents, electrospinning Mn2O3 fibers directly onto charge-collecting substrates simplifies processing and reduces overall mass. Herein, the effects of electrospinning solution composition, electrospinning duration, and calcination time on the electrochemical storage capacity of Mn2O3 web electrodes are studied. Electrode morphologies are examined, and the relationships between processing, morphology, and storage capacity are discussed. A numerical model fit to the data assesses a relative significance of the four fabrication parameters.
