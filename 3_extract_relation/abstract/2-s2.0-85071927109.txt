We use a desktop-size vinyl cutter as the fabrication platform for stretchable micro- supercapacitor patches with interdigital patterns. Compared with similar works, our method can greatly reduce the cost (by ∼70%) and time (by ∼70%) in fabrication process, because no photolithography -based procedures were required. Instead, electrode patterns, interconnects and patch outlines were defined by automated cutting blades at sufficient resolution (smallest feature ∼100μm). This fabrication method is compatible with both spray- and electro-deposited active materials, and yields comparable capacitor performances to previously reported devices. Our stretchable micro-supercapacitor patches can sustain considerable mechanical deformation with no performance degradation, and be applied as convenient power-supply modules for temperature sensors and commercial LEDs.
