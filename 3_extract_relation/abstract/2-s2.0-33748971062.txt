The structure-property relationships of hydrous ruthenium oxides, fabricated by electro deposition on Ti foil, were investigated with different annealing conditions. The annealing temperature was found to play an important role in affecting the electrochemical performance of the annealed hydrous ruthenium oxides. The results indicate that annealing hydrous ruthenium oxide at its crystallization threshold temperature, ∼200 °C, may help to create suitable nanostructure in the oxide that supports the establishment of interpenetrating percolation paths for balanced electron and proton conduction, thereby improving the capacitive response of the oxide dramatically. This finding is useful for fabrication of electrodes with enhanced electrochemical performance for application in microsupercapacitor. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
