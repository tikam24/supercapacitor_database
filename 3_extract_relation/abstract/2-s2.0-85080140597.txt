The cation exchange process is an effective method for improving the electrochemical performance of electrodes in supercapacitors. In this study, the cation (Cu) and co-cation (Cu–Fe) exchanges were achieved in the form of a cobalt oxide crystallite using a chemical bath deposition method, followed by high-temperature calcination. Interestingly, the nanoneedle structure of the as-formed Cu–Fe–Co ternary oxide remained unchanged after calcination, with the crystal phase preserved in the cation exchange process. The novel trimetallic oxide delivered a high specific capacity of 737 C g−1 at 1 A g−1. The Cu–Fe–Co ternary oxide electrode exhibited a low fading rate of only 0.000238% per cycle over 4200 charge-discharge cycles. A fabricated hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) delivered a high-energy density of 48 W h kg−1 and a high-power density of 4800 W kg−1. Integration of the HSC device with solar cells successfully illuminated 52 red LEDs, demonstrating the viability of the prepared electrodes for practical and commercial use.
