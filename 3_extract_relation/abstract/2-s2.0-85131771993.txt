Well-defined π-conjugated thiophene donor-acceptor molecules play an important role in different fields ranging from synthetic chemistry to materials science. Their chemical structure provides specific electronic and physicochemical properties, which can be further tuned by the introduction of functional groups. Herein, we design and synthesize two novel thiophene-based π-conjugated donor-acceptor molecules TDA-1 and TDA-2 through Aldol and Knoevenagel condensations. In our proof-of-concept study we report for the first time on the use of small organic molecules employed in aqueous zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitors (Zn-HSCs),which exhibit capacitance as high as 206.7 and 235.2 F g−1 for TDA-1, and TDA-2, respectively.
