Sonochemically prepared nanoparticles of terbium tungstate (TWNPs) were evaluated through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), UV–Vis spectroscopy, and the optimal products were further characterized in terms of their electrochemical properties using conventional and continuous cyclic voltammetry (CV, and CCV), galvanostatic charge/discharge technique, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The CV studies indicated the TWNPs to have specific capacitance (SC) values of 336 and 205 F g−1 at 1 and 200 mV s−1, and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests revealed the SC of the TWNP-based electrodes to be 300 F g−1 at 1 Ag−1. Also continuous cyclic voltammetry evaluations proved the sample as having a capacitance retention value of 95.3% after applying 4000 potential cycles. In the light of the results TWNPs were concluded as favorable electrode materials for use in hybrid vehicle systems.
