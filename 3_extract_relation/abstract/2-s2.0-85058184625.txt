One-dimensional supercapacitors (SCs) are of great interest for future wearable electronics, but improvement in both high capacitance and high flexibility is still a challenge. Herein, we fabricate a high performance yarn asymmetric SC (ASC) using in situ prepared CuCo2O4 nanowires and polypyrrole (PPy) nanoparticles on the surface of a two-ply carbon nanotube (CNT) yarn. The parallel-shaped yarn ASC not only shows outstanding redox pseudocapacitance, including a high areal capacitance (59.55 mF cm-2), specific energy density (20 Î¼W h cm-2) and power density (5.115 mW cm-2), but also exhibits good flexibility because of its well maintained capacitance during repeated dynamic bending states. The capacitance retention still remains 80.1% under 8000 cycles, suggesting relatively good reversibility and stability.
