Aiming at the different power response characteristics between the battery and supercapacitor for the hybrid energy storage system in the distributed generation system, this paper puts forward a power response characteristics equivalent model for the hybrid energy storage system. In the model, the transfer function is used to describe the power response characteristics for the battery, supercapacitor and power converter system. Then, control strategies of the hybrid energy storage system are used to analysis the model in simulation. The results show that the equivalent model can accurately reflect the power response characteristics of the hybrid energy storage system.
