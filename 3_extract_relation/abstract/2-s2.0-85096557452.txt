The present work describes the electrochemical energy storage performance of CuFeS2 (Chalcopyrite), which is well known for its high electrical conductivity, natural abundance, and low cost. The laboratory synthesis method for CuFeS2 nanoflakes by facile one step solvothermal method is successfully accomplished. The as-synthesized CuFeS2 nanoflakes are subjected to both Physical and chemical characterization, as well as electrochemical characterization. CuFeS2 sample has been coated over carbon cloth substrate for the fabrication of flexible electrode for supercapacitor. The Cu1+ and Fe3+ ions offer a synergistic contribution in the redox mechanism and substantiate an eminent electrochemical performance for supercapacitor. Galvanometric Charge Discharge (GCD) profile of CuFeS2 electrode in three electrode system manifests a high specific capacitance of 219 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in an aqueous medium of 2 M KOH electrolyte with the potential range of -0.5 to 0.5 V. Further in two electrode system, the symmetric supercapacitor based on CuFeS2 electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 120 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 in aqueous 2 M KOH electrolyte. The symmetric supercapacitor based on CuFeS2 electrode delivers a maximum specific energy of 16 Wh Kg−1 at a specific power of 1146 W kg−1with a capacitive retention of 94% over 6000 cycles. These factors inclusively promote CuFeS2 as a promising electrode material for supercapacitor application.
