We have demonstrated a facile in situ wet chemical method to synthesize nanostructured nitrogen doped ZnO/Graphene (N-ZnO/GR) nanocomposites for the first time. Nitrogen doped ZnO over graphene (N-ZnO/GR) was studied using various concentrations of graphene. During the synthesis of N-ZnO/GR nanocomposites, in situ formation of graphene via GO reduction and formation of 4-9 nm N-ZnO have been demonstrated. The composite N-ZnO/GR absorbs in the visible region and this property is used for the photocatalytic reaction to transform hazardous H<inf>2</inf>S waste into eco-friendly hydrogen using solar light. The N-ZnO/GR nanocomposite with 0.3% graphene exhibits an enhanced photocatalytic stable hydrogen production rate i.e. ∼5072 μmol h<sup>-1</sup> under visible light irradiation. It is noteworthy that the N-ZnO/GR electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 555 F g<sup>-1</sup> and excellent cyclic performance with nearly 96.20% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g<sup>-1</sup>. These results indicate great potential applications of N-ZnO/GR in developing high hydrogen production and supercapacitors with high energy and power densities.
