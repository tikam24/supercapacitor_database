Abstract: This paper demonstrates the fabrication of silver nanowires (AgNWs)/graphene oxide stacking structure for enhanced electrochemical performance. In this sandwich-type structure, the stratum of Ag nanowires acts as a highway bridge between the two layers of graphene oxide, where electrons can be transferred easily through this stacked network. The GO-AgNWs showed a specific capacitance of 251 Fg−1 at 10 mV s−1 and an energy density of 34.05 Wh kg−1 at 0.1 mA, indicating the positive synergistic effect of AgNW and GO. The obtained electrochemical characteristics are encouraging and found to be mainly attributed to an effective combination of graphene oxide and AgNWs.
