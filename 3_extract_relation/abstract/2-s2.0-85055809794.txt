The paper presents the analysis of utilization and implementation of energy-efficient technologies in transport. It contains the review of environmentally-friendly buses and an electrobus using an ultracapacitor module as an energy storage unit. Comparative analysis of using different types of one-class buses - diesel, hybrid and electrobus - for one of the urban lines was made. The operating cost for these types of buses was calculated. It was proved that electrobuses have a substantial advantage over the other buses by the criteria of the operating cost. A schematic diagram of an ultracapacitor electrobus for urban transportation was offered. Calculation of the use of energy by an ultracapacitor electrobus was made. It showed that 1.425 MJ is necessary for the electrobus to accelerate, and 0.6 MJ is generated when the bus is braking.
