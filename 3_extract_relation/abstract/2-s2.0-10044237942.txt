Two types of supercapacitor were fabricated: redox type (symmetric type), based on two LiPF6-doped polyaniline (Pani-LiPF6) electrodes, and hybrid type (asymmetric type), based on Pani-LiPF6 and active carbon electrodes. Electrochemical measurements were also performed to evaluate their properties as electrode materials for supercapacitors. The hybrid type of supercapacitor was shown to have better electrochemical performance than did that of redox type in both 0-1 and 0-3 V ranges. The specific capacitance of the hybrid type was also larger than that of the redox type in both ranges. The active carbon electrode functions to increase the voltage of the supercapacitor, and the polymer electrode maintains the redox reaction for a relatively long time. Â© 2004 Elsevier B.V.
