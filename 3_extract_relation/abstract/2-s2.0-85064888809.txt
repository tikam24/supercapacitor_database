Ionic and molecular electronics relate to the field of science and technology, which deals with the theory and development of electrochemical converters. The possibility in principle to develop discrete-action solid electrolyte integrators whose functional, technical, and operating characteristics meet the basic requirements to the operation in the charge setting-read mode. The possibility of creating an analog integrator (with continuous charge reading) of the basis of a solid electrolyte with a linear voltage-current characteristic in the range 0+100 mV was evaluated.
