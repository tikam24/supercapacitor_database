Herein, the nickel–cobalt layered double hydroxide/carbon nanotubes (NiCo-LDH/CNTs) composites with 3-dimentional (3D) hollow nanocages structure were fabricated. By controlling the reaction conditions, the influence of nickel source dosage on capacitance performance was evaluated. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of highly conductive CNTs and NiCo-LDH hollow nanocages which can provide rich active sites, the NiCo-LDH-120/CNTs composite displayed a high specific capacitance (1505.4 F·g−1 at 1 A·g−1), decent rate characteristic (82.4% retention at 10 A·g−1) and superior electrochemical stabilization (72.4% retention after 2000 cycles at 10 A·g−1). The appealing electrochemical performance indicates its huge application potential in supercapacitors.
