Carbide derived carbon is a new kind of porous skeleton carbon materials with nanostructure. Carbide derived carbon is produced by selective extraction of metal atoms from a carbide crystal lattice by halogens, supercritical water, oxygen at a low partial pressure, or other etchants in vacuum and temperature at 150-1 65Â°C. Its nanostructure can be controlled at atom level with the advantages of low cost, high specific surface area, narrower pore-size distribution and fine-tuning of the pore structure. This paper summarizes the preparation technology and porosity, specific surface area, pore size distribution of carbide derived carbon from different carbides and introduces its application in gas-storage, supercapacitor and carbon coating in tribology.
