Amorphous NiHPO4•3 H2O is successfully synthesized by a conventional chemical precipitation method at room temperature. It is delivered at a high specific capacity of about 2191 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. The cycle performance is illustrated by the asymmetric capacitor. It is also delivered the good cycling stability and the specific capacitance maintained 101% of the initial capacitance (731 F g−1) after 500 cycles. And its energy density and power density of NiHPO4•3 H2O are as high as 112 Wh kg−1 and 501 W kg−1, respectively. A lot of nano-scale microspheres, and mesoporous contributed to its high specific capacitance. On account of amorphous structure, produces acquires the excellent cycle performance which may efficiently enhance the electron transfer, ease volume expansion and achieve the performance improvement. It is indicated that amorphous nickel phosphate has a great potential application as electrode materials for energy storage.
