For the first time, WO2.72 nanowires were in-situ grown on carbon cloth by a simple solvothermal reaction. The nanowire WO2.72/carbon cloth (NW WO2.72/CC) electrode showed good electrochemical performance with specific capacitance (Cs) reaching up to 398 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1. The capacitance of 240 F g−1 was retained at a high current density of 16 A g−1. To further evaluate the energy storage performance, flexible asymmetric supercapacitors (FASCs) were fabricated using the activated carbon/carbon cloth (AC/CC) as negative electrode and NW WO2.72/CC as positive electrode, respectively. The FASCs delivered a high energy density of 28 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 745 W kg−1 and 13 Wh kg−1 even at a high power density of 22.5 kW kg−1. More impressively, 81% of the specific capacitance of the FASCs was retained after 10,000 cycles, indicating excellent cycle stability. This work indicates the NW WO2.72/CC holds a great potential for application in energy storage devices.
