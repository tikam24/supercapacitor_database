The specific capacitance of redox additive based electrolytes in supercapacitors is becoming increasingly important. The reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO)-Dy2WO6-ZnO, obtained by a simple hydrothermal route was analyzed by high resolution-transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscope (SEM), BET analysis, and cyclic voltagram (CV), to understand its structural morphology, chemical constitution and electrochemical efficiency of the nanocomposite. SEM images depict porous nanosheet like the structure of rGO-Dy2WO6-ZnO having a wave-type pattern. This research examines the capacitive performance of rGO-Dy2WO6-ZnO using redox additive electrolyte 0.2 M of K4[Fe(CN)6] in 3 M of KOH. The composite electrode with redox additive based electrolyte gives synergistic effects and enhances the capacitance performance up to 752 Fg−1 at the current density of 1 Ag−1. The energy storage of rGO-Dy2WO6-ZnO electrode material in 0.2 M of K4[Fe(CN)6] in 3 M of KOH is greater than that in the bare aqueous electrolyte of 3 M of KOH. Moreover, the rGO-Dy2WO6-ZnO nanosheet electrode material exhibits excellent cycling stability of 89.6% up to 2000 cycles.
