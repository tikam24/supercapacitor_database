Polyaniline (PANI)/cellulose acetate (CA) composite films electrode with asymmetric porous structure were successfully prepared by in situ electropolymerization. The inner layer (in contact with the electrode) of the free-standing composite film is deep green while the outer layer is white. The morphology and the chemical component of the composite film were characterized by AFM, SEM and FTIR. The electrochemical properties of supercapacitor were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charging-discharging and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results showed that PANI/CA composite films with porous structure have good capacitance performance of 410F/g. It exhibited lower internal resistance and good cycle stability. After 300 charge-discharge cycles, its specific capacitance was about 342F/g and capacitance retention was 83.4%.
