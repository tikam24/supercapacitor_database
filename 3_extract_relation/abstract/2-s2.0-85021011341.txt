Impact loads have a seriously effect on the drilling DC micro-grid power quality, because drilling DC micro-grid is limited by the power dynamic adjustment slowly. The power balance technology is realized by hybrid energy storage that is an effective way to solve the transient impact power supply and demand imbalance of DC micro-grid. Based on the complementary characteristics of the super capacitor and battery energy storage, on the basis of traditional hybrid control strategy, it proposes a hybrid energy storage control strategies based on reference current constraints of battery and current dynamic allocation. It realized the optimal allocation of impact power in the hybrid energy storage unit, under the premise that the current limit value of battery is not exceeded. It extended life cycle of battery and improved dynamic response of instantaneous power compensation by hybrid energy storage system. Finally, it solved the problem of drilling a DC micro-grid voltage fluctuations. Simulation and experimental verify the correctness and feasibility of the proposed ideas.
