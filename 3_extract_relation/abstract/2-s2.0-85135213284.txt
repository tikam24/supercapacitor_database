For practical applications in the fields of aerospace and robotic engineering, flexible energy storage devices must be stable under environmental temperatures and different deformed situations. In this work, a mechanically stable supercapacitor (SC) at harsh ambient temperatures is synthesized by in situ polymerization of polyaniline(PANI) onto a double network hydrogel electrolyte from cross-linked polyvinyl alcohol(PVA) and polyacrylamide/acrylic acid (PAM/AA) networks. The highly integrated structure endows the supercapacitor with unprecedented mechanical performance. The devices can endure 608% tensile strain and be stretched up to 50% without noticeable hysteresis, demonstrating fatigue and fracture resistance under thousands of cyclic loads. Benefiting from an all-flexible configuration through seamless integration of the PANI electrode, the supercapacitor presents a high specific capacitance of 95.8 mF cm–2. It can also work as an all-flexible device and maintain its stable output under complex deformations, even physical damages. Furthermore, the device delivers excellent environmental adaptability by steady electrochemical performance after operating at extreme temperatures from −60 to 100 °C. Such a versatile supercapacitor presents a potential application in integrated flexible electronic systems by powering functional devices in harsh environments.
