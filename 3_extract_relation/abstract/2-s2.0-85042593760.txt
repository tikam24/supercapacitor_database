Hierarchical spinel NiCo2O4 nanowires were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method followed by an annealing treatment. The prepared NiCo2O4 nanowires presented a hierarchical mesoporous structure. Moreover, the effects of precipitant and solvent on morphologies of NiCo2O4 were researched. The results reveal that the hierarchical mesoporous structured NiCo2O4 exhibited corking supercapacitor performance with a high specific capacitance of 2876 FÂ·g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1, even increased to 10.0 A g-1, the specific capacitance could still remain 1290 F g-1, what's more, the capacitance retention reached 84.7% after 500 cycles, which indicates an excellent electrochemical performance. The results demonstrate hierarchical mesoporous NiCo2O4 potential to be a promising supercapacitor electrode materials and inspire furthered research on binary metal oxides as charge storage materials and offer a new route for the large-scale production of high-performance supercapacitor electrode materials.
