Supercapacitors store charge by ion adsorption or fast redox reactions on the surface of porous materials. One of the bottlenecks in this field is the development of biocompatible and high-rate supercapacitor devices by scalable fabrication processes. Herein, a Ti-rich anatase TiO2 material that addresses the above-mentioned challenges is reported. Tubular nanolettuces were fabricated by a cost-effective and fast anodization process of Ti foil. They attained a large potential window of 2.5 V in a neutral electrolyte owing to the high activation energy for water splitting of the (1 0 1) facet. Aqueous and all-solid-state devices showed diffusion time constants of 46 and 1700 ms, as well as high maximum energy (power) densities of 0.844 (0.858) and 0.338 μWh cm−2 (0.925 mW cm−2), respectively. The all-solid-state device showed ultrahigh stability of 96 % in capacitance retention after 20 000 galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles. These results open an avenue to fabricate biochemically inert supercapacitor devices.
