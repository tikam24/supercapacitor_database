A novel polyoxovanadate-based MOFs microsphere, [Ni(phen)V2O7]Â·H2O (phen = 1,10-phenanthroline), constructed from 3-D discrete nano-sheets has been prepared and characterized by XRD, FT-IR, SEM and TEM. Electrochemical properties as supercapacitor of the as-prepared sample, such as CV, EIS, GCD and the cycle life test have also been studied. The as-prepared MOF (V, Ni) showed a high specific capacitance of 178.09 Fg-1 at 1 Ag-1 as well as good cycling stability and coulombic efficiency. This work proved that the novel MOFs based on polyoxovanadate hybrid material may serve as a promising electrode material for high-performance supercapacitor.
