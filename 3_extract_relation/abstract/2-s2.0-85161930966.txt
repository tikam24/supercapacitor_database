Nanotechnologies offer the possibilities to upgrade energy productivity and storage over all the fields of industry. The economically controled sustainable power source production through new technological arrangements and advanced production techniques are the current need. For the past few decades, all industries and every individual are consuming more amount of electrical energy. The demand on electrical energy is rapidly increasing every year. The storage of electrical energy is a challenging issue in energy sector. Current utilized batteries are not that much reliable for long time storage. Implementing nanotechnology to the energy storage is the current interest of research. Supercapacitors, Li-ion batteries, and hydrogen storage are the most recent technologies in the energy sector. There are several ways to fabricate the electrodes for the energy storage devices. Nano-based components like light-emitting diode provide efficient usage of electrical energy. This chapter is proposed to review the past, current and future role of different nanomaterials in the energy sector.
