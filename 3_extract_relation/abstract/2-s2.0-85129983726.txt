Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been given more significant consideration in energy storage systems due to their high specific surface areas, mesoporous structures, and numerous reaction sites. To introduce additional conductive pathways and facilitate fast charge transfer, MOFs can be integrated with suitable conducting agents. In this study, we report the preparation of a novel Graphene@ZIF-67/polyaniline nanotube (PANI-NT) composite by using an easy stirring and sonication approach at room temperature. ZIF-67 rhombic dodecahedron structures are interconnected through PANI-NTs and deposited on the graphene flakes. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis have confirmed such individual morphology. This composite by the high surface area of 961.53 m2 g−1 exhibits a high specific capacitance of 20416.70 mF g−1 at a current density of 0.05 mA cm−2. This is due to a quick permeation of ions, easy forwarding of electrons, and excellent cooperation between the ingredients of the composite that result in reversible redox interactions. Moreover, the electrode material possesses 75% specific capacitance retention after 3000 cycles indicate good reversibility and cyclic stableness. The prepared Graphene@ZIF-67/PANI-NT composite can render outstanding electrochemical performance and is properly candidate for supercapacitors application.
