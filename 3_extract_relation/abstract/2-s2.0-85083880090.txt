Carbon cloth (CC) is proved to be a very promising supercapacitor substrate due to its flexibility and excellent mechanical properties. In this paper, a simple and environmentally friendly hydrothermal reaction was used to construct petal-shaped Ni-doped MnO2 nano-array electrode material based on a flexible CC with strong adhesion, and PVA/Na2SO4 gel electrolyte was coordinated to assemble flexible quasi-solid-state supercapacitor. Electrochemical tests manifested that the voltage window of Ni-doped MnO2 nano-array@CC electrode materials could reach 1.2 V, especially the area specific capacitance was up to 1398.8 mF cm−2 As an assembled device,the voltage window could reach 2.2 V, the volumetric capacitance was as high as 1022.08 mF cm−3, the energy density could reach 0.6871 mWh·cm−3, and the power density could be achieved as 31.43 mW cm−3, demonstrating good prospect in applications for flexible energy storage device.
