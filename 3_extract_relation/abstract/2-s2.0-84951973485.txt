We report a successful growth of groove-like NiMoO 4 hollow nanorods (NiMoO 4 -GHRs) via a facile and efficient one-pot hydrothermal approach, and test them as positive electrode materials for pseudocapacitors. We demonstrate that such hollow nanorods with a high aspect ratio (nearly âˆ¼104) show a large specific surface area and electroactive surface area, giving rise to good electrochemical performance. Especially, the NiMoO 4 -GHRs electrode shows a high specific capacitance of 1102.2 F g -1 at a current density of 1 A g -1 , a good rate capability by having 64.5% retention at a high current density of 20 A g -1 , and an excellent cycling stability by retaining 90% of its original state even after 1000 cycles. The NiMoO 4 -GHRs with unique structures and enhanced electrochemical functionalities should be a promising electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.
