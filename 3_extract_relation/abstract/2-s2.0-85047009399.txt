Herein, a flexible micro-supercapacitor as a power component developed by compatible standard clean room micro-fabrication processes and then microelectrode decorated with nanomaterial by forming the thin layer. These nanostructures based NiCo2O4@polypyrrole//MEMS micro-supercapacitor (MSc) achieves an areal capacitance of 2.12 mF cm-2 at a scan rate of 2 mV s-1. The fabricated single MSc device can deliver the highest energy and power density of 0.14 mWh cm-2 and 120 mW cm-2, respectively. Furthermore, the power performance tests of the fabricated flexible MSc in series and parallel connections exhibit a good understanding of the commercial capacitor. Finally, the fabricated MSc has demonstrated its practical application with different bendable angles.
