Herein, the N doped layered porous carbons (NLPCs) were synthesized from biomass waste. The NLPCs present high compaction density, layered structures and moderate content of N, O elements. Owing to the synergistic effect of merits, the NLPC presents excellent volumetric performance when used as electrode for supercapacitor (SC), e.g. high volumetric capacitance of 317.3 F cm−3 at 0.1 A g−1, and high energy density of 10.9 Wh L-1. Moreover, the capacitance retention of NLPC4-based supercapacitor is 105.2% after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles. The results show the excellent application prospects of NLPC in high volumetric performance supercapacitors. This study also provides a universal method for the preparation of NLPC for SCs.
