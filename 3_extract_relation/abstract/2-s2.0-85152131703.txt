A novel nanocomposite of zirconium oxide supported copper ferrite (ZCFO) at diverse concentrations was synthesized via the co-precipitation technique. X-Ray diffraction (XRD technique reveals the grain size of the sample as 60–70 nm. Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM) analysis confirms the ferromagnetic behavior of the NCs with multi-domain nature. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis reveals that the synthesized sample exhibits the maximum specific capacitance of 790.87 F/g at the scan rate of 10 mV/s for ZCFO-1. Galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) analysis reveals the faradic behavior with prolonged discharge time even at higher current density and the cyclic stability analysis reveals the capacitive retention of ZCFO-1 exhibits 90.4% for 2000 charge–discharge cycles.
