Nitrogen-doped graphene aerogel nanomesh (N-GANM) has been hydrothermally prepared from graphene oxide and ammonium hydroxide using iron nitrate as the etching agent. The results showed that N-GANM with an interesting nanomesh structure on the graphene sheets maintained the 3D architecture of graphene aerogel (GA). Furthermore, it exhibited excellent electrochemical capacitive behavior and the specific capacitance value (290.0 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 ) remained approximately 90.3% after 2000 cycles in the three-electrode system. In addition, N-GANM displayed an energy density of 30.9 Wh kg −1 at the power density of 450.3 W kg −1 and excellent cycling stability retention (98%) after 10,000 cycles in the two-electrode symmetric device. The resulting N-GANM was expected to be a much favorable supercapacitor electrode material due to the heteroatom-doping and its unique porous structure.
