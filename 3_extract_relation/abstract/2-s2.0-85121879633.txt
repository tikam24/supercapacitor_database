Naturally, a combination of metal oxides and carbon materials enhances the electrochemical performance of supercapacitor (SC) electrodes. We report on two different materials with highly conductive carbon dots (CDs) and a Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4/SiO2/TiO2nanocomposite with a high power density, a high specific surface area, and a nanoporous structure to improve power and energy density in energy storage devices. A simple and low-cost process for synthesizing the hybrid SC electrode material Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4/SiO2/TiO2/CDs, known as CDs-nanocomposite, was performedviaa layer-by-layer method; then, the CDs-nanocomposite was loaded on a nickel foam substrate for SC electrochemical measurements. A comparative study of the surface and morphology of CDs, the Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4/SiO2/TiO2nanocomposite and CDs-nanocomposite was carried out using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), BET surface area, and Raman spectroscopy. The synthesized CDs-nanocomposite electrode material displayed enhanced electrochemical performance, having a high specific capacitance of 913.7 F g−1at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1and capacitance retention of 72.2%, as well as remarkable long-life cyclic stability over 3000 cycles in the three-electrode setup and 1 M KOH electrolyte. It also demonstrated a superior energy density of 130.7 W h kg−1. The improved electrochemical behavior of the CDs-nanocomposite for SC electrodes, together with its fast and simple synthesis method, provides a suitable point of reference. Other kinds of metal oxide nanocomposites can be synthesized for use in energy storage devices.
