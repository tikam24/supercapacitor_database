A hybrid energy storage system (HESS), that comprises of a battery and a supercapacitor, is utilized to absorb the power and energy oscillations for a wave energy conversion system so as to inject a smooth power to the grid. Continuous variation in the wave profile presents a formidable challenge in terms of the power and energy allocation among the battery and supercapacitor. In this paper, an adaptive control strategy is proposed, wherein the power and energy sharing between the battery and super-capacitor are dynamically decided based on an optimization algorithm. The proposed algorithm is aimed at optimizing the total losses in the hybrid energy storage system while simultaneously maximizing the battery lifetime. Circuit simulation and experimental results from a hardware prototype are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.
