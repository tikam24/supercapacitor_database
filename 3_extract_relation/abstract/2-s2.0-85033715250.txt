Ni(OH)2/RGO composite are synthesized though a facile two-step method, in which the Ni(OH)2 deposition and GO reduction processes take place separately. The present methods promote the deposition of more Ni(OH)2 and full utilization of RGO, owing to the high reactivity, good solubility, and dispersity of GO. Moreover, the utilization of additives is avoided. The Ni(OH)2/RGO synthesized by using the two-step method shows a uniform porous lamellar structure with a high specific surface area. When employed as a supercapacitor electrode material, the Ni(OH)2/RGO composite exhibits a high specific capacitance of 2877 F g−1, long cycle life with capacitance retention of 86.5 % after 4000 cycles, and high energy density of 120.9 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 0.14 kW kg−1. The Ni(OH)2/RGO composite prepared by using the two-step method in this work shows 11.8–85.1 % higher specific capacitances than composites fabricated by using the other method. The excellent performances and the facile synthesis method highlight the promising potential of the present Ni(OH)2/RGO composite in supercapacitor applications.
