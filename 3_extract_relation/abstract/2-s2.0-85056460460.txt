A new type of sandwiched nanosheets 3D MoS2/C@RGO is synthesized by supramolecular self-assembly methods, as a novel and excellence electrode material. The surface characterization techniques show that the sandwiched 3D MoS2/C@RGO possesses rich porosity and large specific area, which is convenient for electrolyte ion transportation and beneficial for the improved electrical conductivity. An outstanding specific capacitance of the prepared MoS2/C@RGO of 340.0 F/g at 1 A gâˆ’1 is achieved with an excellent cycle stability of 90% after 1000 cycles at the scanning rate of 40 mV/s. The sandwiched 3D MoS2/C@RGO is suggested to be an ideal candidate for supercapacitors.
