Here, we report the synthesis of TiO2/BiFeO3 nanoheterostructure (NH) arrays by anchoring BiFeO3 (BFO) nanoparticles on TiO2 nanotube surface and investigate their pseudocapacitive and photoelectrochemical properties considering their applications in green energy fields. The unique TiO2/BFO NHs have been demonstrated both as energy conversion and storage materials. The capacitive behavior of the NHs has been found to be significantly higher than that of the pristine TiO2 NTs, which is mainly due to the anchoring of redox active BFO nanoparticles. A specific capacitance of about 440 F g-1 has been achieved for this NHs at a current density of 1.1 A g-1 with âˆ¼80% capacity retention at a current density of 2.5 A g-1. The NHs also exhibit high energy and power performance (energy density of 46.5 Wh kg-1 and power density of 1.2 kW kg-1 at a current density of 2.5 A g-1) with moderate cycling stability (92% capacity retention after 1200 cycles). Photoelectrochemical investigation reveals that the photocurrent density of the NHs is almost 480% higher than the corresponding dark current and it shows significantly improved photoswitching performance as compared to pure TiO2 nanotubes, which has been demonstrated based the interfacial type-II band alignment between TiO2 and BFO.
