The present research deals in preparing Mn0.3Co0.2Zn0.5Fe2O4 (spinel ferrite) by solâ€“gel procedure, polyaniline (PANI) by chemical oxidative method, and Mn0.3Co0.2Zn0.5Fe2O4-PANI nanocomposite by physical blending method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) study affirms the formation of Mn0.3Co0.2Zn0.5Fe2O4-PANI nanocomposite owing to the appearance of two different types of peaks: sharp Mn0.3Co0.2Zn0.5Fe2O4 peaks, and broader PANI peaks. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of Mn0.3Co0.2Zn0.5Fe2O4-PANI nanocomposite shows all characteristic vibrational bands, which are observed in the Mn0.3Co0.2Zn0.5Fe2O4 and PANI spectra. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) micrographs have been employed for measuring the average particle size by using ImageJ software. The encapsulation of the synthesized ferrite nanoparticle with the PANI matrix is exhibited by the FESEM micrograph of Mn0.3Co0.2Zn0.5Fe2O4-PANI nanocomposite. The electrochemical activity of the novel Mn0.3Co0.2Zn0.5Fe2O4-PANI nanocomposite is manifested to be higher as compared to their counterparts on account of synergistic impact, continual movement of electrons toward the electrode, and multiple redox reactions.
