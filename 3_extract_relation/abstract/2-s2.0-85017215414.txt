This paper proposes a grid connected hybrid microgrid system with dual voltage source inverter (DVSI) using modified instantaneous symmetrical component theory (MICST) for power sharing among inverters. In this paper a reduced DC link voltage has been achieved, efficient, simple power management algorithm (PMA) is proposed and new method is introduced for DVSI control parameter extraction which reduces control complexity and overall system cost. The Proposed topology consists of a three phase dual voltage source inverter (DVSI) which transfers the active power between grid and microgrid based on renewable power availability and state of charge (SOC) limits of hybrid energy storage system (HESS). Besides, offering ancillary services such as harmonic mitigation, reactive power support and unity power factor at the point of common coupling (PCC). The proposed system is tested and validated using MATLAB based Simulink environment.
