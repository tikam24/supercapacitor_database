A novel and facile strategy was developed to prepare nitrogen-doped carbon/NiMoO4 (NDC/NiMoO4)nanospheres using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide–polyvinyl pyrrolidone–cyclohexane–water–ethanol microemulsion aggregation as a soft template. The prepared NDC/NiMoO4 exhibited a marvelous specific capacitance of 1045 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. After 10,000 cycles the specific capacity is 60% of the initial performance. The energy density reached 107.3 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 799.9 W kg−1. The excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to the unique morphology of NDC/NiMoO4 and the abundant doped N and C elements. This study enables their application in high-performance supercapacitors.
