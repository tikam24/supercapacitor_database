Layered two-dimensional titanium carbide (Ti3 C2 Tx), as an outstanding MXene member, has captured increasing attention in supercapacitor applications due to its excellent chemical and physical properties. However, the low gravimetric capacitance of Ti3 C2 Tx restricts its rapid development in such applications. Herein, this work demonstrates an effective and facile hydrothermal approach to synthesize nitrogen doped intercalation TiO2 /TiN/Ti3 C2 Tx with greatly improved gravimetric capacitance and excellent cycling stability. The hexamethylenetetramine (C6 H12 N4) in hydrothermal environment acted as the nitrogen source and intercalants, while the Ti3 C2 Tx itself was the titanium source of TiO2 and TiN. We tested the optimized nitrogen doped intercalation TiO2/TiN/Ti3 C2 Tx electrodes in H2 SO4, Li2 SO4, Na2 SO4, LiOH and KOH electrolytes, respectively. The electrode in H2 SO4 electrolyte delivered the best electrochemical performance with high gravimetric capacitance of 361 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and excellent cycling stability of 85.8% after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles. A systematic study of material characterization combined with the electrochemical performances disclosed that TiO2 /TiN nanoparticles, the introduction of nitrogen and the NH4 + intercalation efficaciously increased the specific surface areas, which is beneficial for facilitating electrolyte ions transportation. Given the excellent performance, nitrogen doped intercalation TiO2 /TiN/Ti3 C2 Tx bodes well as a promising pseudocapacitor electrode for energy storage applications.
