In this study, a novel mesoporous MnO2/ITO NWs nanocomposite is successfully fabricated by using a chemical vapor deposition on a titanium substrate, followed by electrodeposition through a lyotropic liquid crystalline with hexagonal phase and calcination in air. The heterostructure is characterized by low-angle XRD, wide-angle XRD, Raman spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Electrochemical measurements are carried out by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronopotentiometry in a 0.5M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. The nanocomposite exhibits a significantly enhanced electrochemical performance and higher capacitance retention ratio, as compared to mesoporous manganese oxide (MnO2) film. From charge-discharge measurements, a specific capacitance of 821Fg-1 for the nanocomposite is achieved at a discharge current density of 1Ag-1 in potential ranges from -0.1 to 0.8V. These characteristics allow the newly fabricated hybrid electrode to be widely used for various applications. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
