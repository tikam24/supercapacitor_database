Simultaneous electrochemical generation and functionalization of nano-sized graphite from graphite had been carried out in a non-fluoroanion-based ionic liquid, namely, triethylmethylammonium methylsulfate (TEMAMS) containing water and acetonitrile (AN) in different weight ratios. The oxygen-based functional groups attached with the exfoliated material had been identified using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and morphological changes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A symmetrical supercapacitor was fabricated using the exfoliated nano-sized graphite, and the influence of surface functionalities on its performance was investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and galvanostatic charge–discharge cycles (CC). The highest specific capacitance (Csp) value of 140 F g−1 at 0.25 A g−1 was obtained in 1.0 M H2SO4, followed by aqueous TEMAMS (125 F g−1), TEMAMS/acetonitrile (115 F g−1), and TEMAMS (106 F g−1) at 0.10 A g−1.
