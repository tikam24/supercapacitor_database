Constructing a Zinc ion hybrid supercapacitor (ZHMSC) configuration with excellent electrochemical performance for progressive energy storage is worldwide attractive but yet still a considerable challenge. In this study, a universal and effective strategy has been proposed and developed for 3D-writing additive-free V2CTx MXene architected ZHMSC to realize the excellent electrochemical performance. With proper designs of printable electrochemical materials and direct ink writing architectures, 3D printed ZHMSC devices with high areal capacitance and excellent areal energy density have been achieved in a limited footprint area. Benefitting from the excellent ion diffusion and highly conductive networks, the 3D printed ZHMSCs device achieves the ultrahigh specific capacitance of 3.82 F cm−2, large energy density of 1.36 mW h cm−2 and remarkable cyclic performance with the capacitance retention of 97.8 % after 12,000 cycles at 20 mA cm−2. This work not only provides new insights on direct ink writing for high-performance Zn-Ion hybrid capacitor, but also offers a facile and efficient method to construct large-scale energy storage devices with high electrochemical performance for future energy storage.
