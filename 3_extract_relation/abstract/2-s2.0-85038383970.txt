A series of mesoporous carbon sample was synthesized using silica template, SBA-15 with two different pore sizes. Impregnation method was applied using glucose as a precursor for converting it into carbon. An appropriate carbonization and silica removal process were carried out to produce a series of mesoporous carbon with different pore sizes and surface areas. Mesoporous carbon sample was then assembled as electrode and its performance was tested using cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy to study the effect of ion transportation into several pore sizes on electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) system. 6M KOH was used as electrolyte at various scan rates of 10, 20, 30 and 50 mVs-1. The results showed that the pore size of carbon increased as the pore size of template increased and the specific capacitance improved as the increasing of the pore size of carbon.
