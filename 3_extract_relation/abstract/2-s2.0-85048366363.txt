Three-dimensional vanadium nitride porous nanoribbons/graphene composite with hierarchical porosity was prepared and investigated as the electrode material for supercapacitors. Morphology characterization of vanadium nitride porous nanoribbons/graphene composite indicates that vanadium nitride porous nanoribbons incorporate with graphene nanosheets to from a stable three-dimensional architecture with hierarchical porosity. This unique three-dimensional architecture and the combining effect of vanadium nitride porous nanoribbons and graphene nanosheets network make vanadium nitride porous nanoribbons/graphene composite a high-performance electrode material for supercapacitors. At a current density of 0.3 A g−1, vanadium nitride porous nanoribbons/graphene electrode displays a specific capacitance of 164.4 F g−1, which is much higher than that of pure vanadium nitride electrode. In addition, vanadium nitride porous nanoribbons/graphene composite shows high capacitance retention rate (82% capacitance retention at the current density up to 10 A g−1) and good long-term cycling stability (97.5% capacitance retention over 2500 cycles).
