A facile one-step hydrothermal route at low temperature (95 °C) is employed to synthesize the core-branched FeOOH-CNTs composites. The core-branched structure of nanoscaled FeOOH directly grown on CNTs can not only act as a supporting role to disperse FeOOH, but also serve as a conductive network to improve the electronic conductivity of FeOOH-CNTs composites. As a result, the optimized FeOOH-CNTs (70 wt% FeOOH) delivers high specific capacitance (1550 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and superior rate capability (1450 F g−1 at 10 A g−1).
