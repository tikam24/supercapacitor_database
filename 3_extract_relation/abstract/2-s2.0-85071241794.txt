The development of rechargeable energy storage devices has received much attention recently, especially for smart energy storage devices. This paper reviews the applications and latest developments in recent years of a class of intelligent energy storage devices. These energy storage devices are made from self-healing materials, and therefore, they have their own self-healing function. They can not only undergo repeated folding deformations during use but also automatically repair their damaged parts to extend their service life. We focus on the repair mechanisms and performances of energy storage devices prepared from self-healing materials with a focus on electrodes and electrolytes. Since the research on these self-healing materials is still in its infancy, it has developed rapidly but still suffers from many limitations. Therefore, we discuss the challenges this research is currently facing and the opportunities for future development.
