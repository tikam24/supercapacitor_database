Hybrid energy storage system (HESS) has been recognized as one of the most promising solutions to overcome the drawbacks of the expensive and short life lithium-ion battery with low power density, by introducing a proper number of supercapcitors. However, the hybridization introduces complicated sizing and energy management problems. This papers aims to investigate the sizing and real-time energy management of a devised HESS for electric vehicles with an electric race car as a case study. In particular, a proposed multi-objective Bi-level optimal sizing and control framework is implemented to find the optimal parameters of the energy management algorithm, the optimal number of the lithiumion battery cells and the supercapacitor banks. The simulation results have validated the effectiveness of the investigated methodology in minimizing the total mass of the HESS and maximizing the cycle life of the lithium-ion battery.
