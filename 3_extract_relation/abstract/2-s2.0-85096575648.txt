The drop-away current of 1500V low-voltage direct-current circuit breaker used in metro DC traction power supply system needs to be checked regularly. The instantaneous power is very high when the detection device is working, and the field power supply is often difficult to meet the requirements. Therefore, an energy storage unit is needed to supply power to the detector. In this paper, a design scheme of high-power DC power supply with supercapacitor and battery as energy storage is proposed, and the energy management and discharge control strategies are studied in theory and simulation, which verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the scheme.
