Flexible supercapacitors assembled with two-dimensional materials have become a research hotspot in recent years. Here, we have prepared two-dimensional nanomaterial MoS2and SWCNT, CNF aerogel composite electrode, and its flexible all-solid-state supercapacitor. SWCNT can inhibit the accumulation of MoS2nanosheets and enhance the conductivity of the composite electrode. CNF can improve the dispersion uniformity of MoS2and SWCNT, and endow the composite electrode with a high specific surface area (328.86 m2g-1) and excellent flexibility. MoS2-SWCNT/CNF supercapacitor has a good rectangular CV curve and symmetrical triangular GCD curve. The CV curve of the MoSCF3 supercapacitor with the highest MoS2-SWCNT content remains rectangular even at the scanning rate of 2000 mV s-1. Its voltage window can reach 1.5 V. MoS2-SWCNT/CNF supercapacitor has a specific capacity of 605.32 mF cm-2(scanning rate of 2 mV s-1) and 30.34 F g-1(0.01 A g-1), an area specific energy of 35.61 mWh cm-2(area specific power of 0.03 mW cm-2), and extremely high cycle stability (91.01% specific capacity retention rate after 10 000 cycles) and good flexibility. The fine nanocomposite structure gives MoS2-SWCNT/CNF supercapacitor impressive electrochemical performance and excellent flexibility, which can be used in the field of portable electronic devices and flexible devices.
