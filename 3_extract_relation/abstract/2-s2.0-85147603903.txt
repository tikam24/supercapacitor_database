In the paper, we prepared a hydrogenated nanocrystalline diamond (NCD-H) film by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. A variable degree of NCD-H surface destruction and surface graphitization was achieved by Ar ion bombardment using monoatomic beam (Ar+) and cluster ion beam (ArCIB). Bombardment with ArCIB manifests itself by the formation of a very thin altered layer on the surface of NCD-H accompanied by no Ar atoms embedded in the surface region. In contrast, bombardment with Ar+ beam leads to the creation of thicker, homogeneous altered layer characterized by dominating C sp2 hybridization, by the embedded Ar atoms, and by the reduced dimensions of diamond grains located near the surface of the samples. A combination of multiple microscopy and spectroscopy methods enabled us to evaluate the contribution of the C-Hx bonds to the asymmetry of the C 1s core level line shape and to measure the H concentration on the surface. The limitation of Auger spectroscopy (D-parameter) analysis for the sp2/sp3 phase concentration measurement on rough, NCD-H surface is demonstrated. The controllable amorphization or graphitization of diamond surface can further extend its functionality in detectors, electrochemical sensing or supercapacitor uses.
