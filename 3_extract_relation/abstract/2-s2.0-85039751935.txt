The application of nanohybrids based on polyoxomolybdates, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and/or metal nanoparticles (NPs) high-performance electrode materials in electrocatalysis and energy storage devices is promising but still limited due to the complexity and the cost of the synthesis. Here we introduce a simple polyoxomolybdate, [MoV4O8(OH)2(H2O)2(C4O4)2]2− (MoS), as reducing and stabilizing agent for the facile and one-pot syntheses of large quantity of highly stable MoS/rGO and MoS/Au NPs nanohybrids in aqueous solution without any catalyst or toxic co-solvent. They were characterized by various physical techniques and electrochemistry which confirm strong interaction between MoS and rGO sheets. We also used DFT calculations to investigate the affinity between MoS or its neutral form with graphene. The adsorption energy for the most stable configuration is −1.97 eV, indicating a strong adsorption process of MoS, which can also be confirmed by the distance (3.04 Å) and the charge transfer (0.86 e) between MoS and graphene. These observations are also consistent with the electrochemical results which underscore the excellent redox properties and high stability of MoS/rGO. Importantly, the MoS/rGO nanohybrids are excellent noble metal-free electrocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide reduction with high sensitivity, large detection range and low detection limit. Finally, the preliminary tests reveal that the electrode materials based on MoS/rGO and a low-cost carbon cloth (CC) composite MoS/rGO/CC may have a potential for an application in energy storage as performant and flexible supercapacitor, showing specific capacitance as high as 870 F g−1 at 10 mV s−1 and excellent stability after 5000 cycles.
