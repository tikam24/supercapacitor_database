This work describes the electrochemical investigation of two ionic liquids (ILs), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate (EMIM Ac) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (BMIM Cl), as electrolytes in supercapacitors (SC). A comprehensive study on high temperature (HT) endurance that is required for system integration in microelectronics has also been carried out. It has been found that EMIM Ac containing SC performs better than a BMIM Cl containing SC, and HT treatment improves the capacitive performance.
