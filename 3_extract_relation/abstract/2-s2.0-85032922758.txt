Supercapacitor is perspective solution for electrical energy storage whereby its big advantage is that this energy is available to be utilized in a very short time. Disadvantage of such device is its low operating voltage (several Volts) and its high sensitivity against maximum temperature limit. Therefore for purposes of development of physical sample of supercapacitor it is suitable to develop also simulation model, which will be capable to exactly interpret physical behavior of considered supercapacitor in various conditions (electrical, thermal, environmental). For these purposes COMSOL Multiphysics 3.5a has been used. In this article we would like to describe development process of the thermal model of wound capacitor which is EDLC type (Electrochemical double layer capacitor), whereby main target is to reach very close proximity of simulation results comparing to measurements in various conditions. Targeting high degree of modelâ€™s accuracy, three alternatives of model complexity will be shown. Instead of accuracy the proper model for next steps of development has to fulfill also requirements on the computation time. In the final stage, we will describe how important is design of the computational mesh, whereby EDLC thermal model has to meet strict requirements on high degree of accordance with experimental measurements.
