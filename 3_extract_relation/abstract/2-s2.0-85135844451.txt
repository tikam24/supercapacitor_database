Developing a reasonable conductive structure is an effective way to construct supercapacitor electrode materials with high properties. Inspired by the way branches and stems accumulate and transfer nutrients, we fabricated hierarchical dendritic electrodes through a facile hydrothermal process to make high-capacity supercapacitors. Specifically, a self-supporting hierarchical ZnO/NiCo-LDH structure was created on carbon cloth substrates via simple processes. The hierarchical dendritic structure facilitated efficient charge transfer and active site exposure as well as the synergetic effect of providing the stacking of layered LDH nanosheets. This hierarchical ZnO/NiCo-LDH electrode possessed excellent capacitance (22808.9 mF路cm-2 at 2 mA路cm-2) and good retention rate (85.7 % capacity retention at 15 mA路cm-2), while the capacitance of CC@NiCo-LDH was only 1620.9 mF路cm-2. This structure design provides a good prospect for high-efficiency electrochemical supercapacitors.
