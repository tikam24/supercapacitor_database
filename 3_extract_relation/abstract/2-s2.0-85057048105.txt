A new and simple strategy for the fabrication of an ultra-lightweight and flexible current collector based on freestanding carbon nanotube (CNT) sheets for lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) with excellent electrochemical performance is reported. A novel lightweight current collector is fabricated using CNT sheets (≈0.05 mg cm−2) which are prepared by a direct spinning method. LICs are assembled using prelithiated graphite/CNT sheets as anodes, and activated carbon/CNT sheets as cathodes. The electrochemical performances of anode and cathode are investigated through coin-type half-cell tests, demonstrating the high discharge capacities of about 350 and 40 mAh g−1, respectively. These discharge capacities based on the total mass of electrode exhibit about 73% and 75% of capacities based on the mass of active materials. However, in the case of fabricating metallic current collector electrode, discharge capacities are reduced to about 6.5% and 20%, respectively. LICs demonstrate the maximum energy density of ≈26.4 Wh kg−1 and the maximum power density of ≈672 W kg−1, showing comparable energy and power densities when values are evaluated on the basis of the total mass of electrode. These features make the collector a potential candidate for the energy storage systems, which require large-scale and lightweight power sources.
