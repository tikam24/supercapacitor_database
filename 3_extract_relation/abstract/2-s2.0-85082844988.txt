In this paper, a new configuration of ultracapacitor (UC)-based energy storage system is proposed aiming applications at higher power level. The configuration can provide active and reactive power support together. The UC is chosen due to its longer life cycle and fast transient response. The UCs are integrated at the DC link of a modular multilevel converter (MMC) through distributed DC-DC converters. This configuration possesses better features in terms of power quality, modularity, redundancy, and efficiency compared with conventional two-/three-level topologies. The integration of ultracapacitors with the MMC and associated control related issues is discussed in this paper. An algorithm to balance the state of charge among the distributed energy storage modules is also proposed. The performance of the proposed system and the associated control methods are verified for a wind energy generation system using PSCAD/EMTDC simulation and the results show satisfactory performance.
