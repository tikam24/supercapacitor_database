In this paper, we report on nanodisc-shaped MgCo2 O4 wrapped with ZnS, achieved using the sol–gel-assisted hydrothermal method. This enhances the electrochemical performance, with the electrode delivering superior supercapacitive performance compared to MgCo2 O4. Moreover, the nanodisc provides more active sites and allows smooth charge transfer during faradaic reactions. The nanodisc-shaped MgCo2 O4 with ZnS delivers a capacitance of approximately 910 F/g at 1 A/g. The fabricated asymmetric capacitor is composed of MgCo2 O4 @ZnS and activated carbon (AC). The nanodisc-shaped MgCo2 O4 @ZnS provides more active sites and allows the smooth transport of electrons during long-term cycling. In addition, the electrode side reactions and electrolyte decomposition are significantly reduced due to the ZnS coating on the surface of the MgCo2 O4, allowing this asymmetric capacitor to deliver an energy density of 43 Wh·kg−1 at 1454 W·kg−1. The performance of the asymmetric capacitor exhibits enhanced supercapacitive performance and opens a new way to investigate asymmetric supercapacitor devices.
