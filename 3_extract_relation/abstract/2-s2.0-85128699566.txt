By using different morpholine derivatives with different N sites and numbers, we have synthesized seven compounds by a hydrothermal method, namely [AgI2(HL1)][Cr(OH)6Mo6O18]·H2O (1), [AgI(H2L)][Cr(OH)6Mo6O18]·4H2O (2), [CoII(HL1)2(H2O)][Cr(OH)6Mo6O18]2·2H2O (3), [NiII(HL2)(H2O)][Cr(OH)6Mo6O18]·4.5H2O (4), [CoII(HL2)(H2O)][Cr(OH)6Mo6O18]·4.5H2O (5), [AgI(HL1)][(δ-Mo8O26)0.5]·2H2O (6) and [CoII(HL3)2(H2O)2](β-Mo8O26) (7) (L = 4-(2-aminoethyl)-morpholine, L1 = 4-[2-(5-pyridin-4-yl-[1,2,4]triazol-1-yl)-ethyl]-morpholine, L2 = 4-[2-(5-pyridin-2-yl-[1,2,4]triazol-1-yl)-ethyl]-morpholine, L3 = 4-[2-(5-pyrazin-2-yl-[1,2,4]triazol-1-yl)-ethyl]-morpholine, L = 4-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]morpholine). These compounds were characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction, FT-IR and PXRD. Compound 1 exhibits a 3D framework constructed by 1D chains. Compounds 2 and 4-6 all show 2D structures, in which the 2D layer of 2 is only built by POM and transition metals (TMs). But in 4-6 both the POM and metal-organic subunits construct the layer structures. Compounds 3 and 6 are 1D structures, containing a POM-linked chain in 3 and only a metal-organic chain in 6. Compounds 1-7 can be used as bifunctional electrochemical sensors. They can detect not only NO2− anions, but also Cr(vi) and Fe(iii) cations. For example, the response time of 1-CPE for Cr(vi) was 2.16 s and the detection limit was 4.3 × 10−3 M. Compound 4 also has certain capacitance performance. In addition, compounds 1-7 can be used as catalysts for the photodegradation of organic dyes and the reduction of Cr(vi).
