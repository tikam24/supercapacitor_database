Micro-Supercapacitors (MSCs) are serving as potential candidates in the field of energy storage devices and applications. They have high capacitance and relatively small size and can be used as power storage for devices. The MSCs have many compartments and in recent years various forms of electrode materials are utilized in the MSCs. Graphene and its derivatives tagged with its unique properties are regarded as future flexible electronic and are widely explored electrode materials in many applications. Graphene can be used with other materials and forms hybrid structures to increase the capacitance of the devices. In this article, we briefly reviewed graphene and graphene derivatives used in the fabrication process of the MSC devices. The fabrication methods for the electrodes and the MSC devices are also evaluated. The various graphene-based MSCs and their capacitances are extensively summarized and compared in this review.
