We explore the effect of sulfur doping in Co3V2O8 on the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors in terms of enhanced lattice spacing, electrochemical surface area (ECSA), electronic conductivity, and density of states. The sulfur-doped Co3V2O8 (S-Co3V2O8) nanosheets were grown in situ as a binder-free synthesis on nickel foam by the hydrothermal method. The electrochemical performance was analyzed in an aqueous alkaline electrolyte where the S-Co3V2O8 electrode exhibited a specific capacity of 410 mAh/g at 2 A/g with enhanced rate capability and capacity retention of 94.2% at 5 A/g specific currents after 4000 cycles, whereas the undoped Co3V2O8 electrode exhibited a specific capacity of 337.8 mAh/g at 2 A/g. The high capacity of S-Co3V2O8 is attributed to the enhanced ECSA (by ∼45%) and improved electrical conductivity (by ∼22%) upon doping with sulfur. Furthermore, these results corroborated with density functional theory results. The calculations suggest an increase in lattice parameters and the introduction of additional density of states near the valence-band edge due to the doping of sulfur, resulting in a decrease in charge-transfer resistance. An asymmetric supercapacitor was fabricated, using S-Co3V2O8 nanosheets as the cathode and activated carbon as the anode, which shows a high specific capacity (or capacitance) value of 485 mAh/g, an energy density of 36.4 W h/kg, and a power density of 740 W/kg at 2 A/g with 98.4% specific capacity retention after 4000 consecutive charge-discharge cycles. Furthermore, the analysis was extended in a nonaqueous medium for Li-ion storage where S-Co3V2O8 exhibits a specific capacity of 994 mA h/g and a specific energy density of 828 W h/kg at 1 A/g making it a promising candidate for future high-energy storage systems. The concept of doping is extended to other chalcogenide (e.g., selenium) doping (Se-Co3V2O8), which also shows improved device performance and makes this a versatile approach for high-performance devices.
