Increasing energy crisis across the globe requires immediate solutions. Two-dimensional (2D) materials are of great significance because of their application in energy storage and conversion devices but the production process significantly impacts the environment thereby posing a severe problem in the field of pollution control. The green synthesis method provides an eminent way of reduction in pollutants. This article reviews the importance of green synthesis in the energy application sector. The focus of 2D materials like graphene, MoS2, VS2 in energy storage and conversion devices is emphasized based on supporting recent reports. The emerging Li-ion batteries are widely reviewed along with their promising alternatives like Zn, Na, Mg batteries and are featured in detail. The impact of green methods in the energy application field is outlined. Moreover, future outlook in the energy sector is envisioned by proposing an increase in 2D elemental materials research.
