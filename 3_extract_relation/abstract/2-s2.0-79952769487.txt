This paper presents work carried out within a European Union project which led to the development of 3.7 V and 340 F pre-series electrochemical double-layer capacitor cell featuring an asymmetric configuration with positive and negative carbon electrodes of different weight and solvent-free ionic liquid electrolyte. Such supercapacitor design with nonvolatile and safe electrolyte provides a successful response to the requirement for power assist application in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs).
