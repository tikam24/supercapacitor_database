This paper presents the results of the modeling of the HEV with an electric power splitter (EPS) and simulation of the fuel efficiency of this type of vehicle. The new innovative technological approach is presented by using the special type of synchronous machine that splits the mechanical power on two separate power transmission pats and therefore it is called electric power splitter. EPS is based on a double rotor synchronous permanent magnet generator. It is consisted of two rotating parts, a classic permanent magnet rotor and a rotating stator. The rotor is firmly coupled to the drive shaft of the internal combustion engine of the vehicle (ICE). The rotating stator, which structurally is typical AC machine stator, is firmly coupled to the transmission of the vehicle that leads to the car wheels. This technical solution enables the ICE to operate on the most optimal revolutions during the entire driving schedule. Two distinguish approaches has bean realized in order this new innovative technological solution to be confirmed as eligible. First approach is creation the mathematical model of the entire system, taking into account all the necessary preconditions, environment influences, machine and component characteristics. The results have been obtained by using this precisely determined mathematical model and by simulating the characteristics of all essential values for the entire drive, which gives clear view of the capabilities and potentials of this new HEV system. The second approach is based on experimental verification. In order to be performed the laboratory tests on this HEV concept, an experimental working stand was se up in the laboratory. ICE and the traction load are simulated with controlled AC induction motors. The entire working stand presents complex machine, measure and control system for realization of this task.
