A series of N, O, and S heteroatomic doped porous carbon were developed by fabricating bio-based benzoxazine resin precursors from cysteine and phenols. The bio-based benzoxazines were successfully prepared with their structure confirmed by NMR, FTIR, and Mass spectra. The ring-opening curing mechanism was explored by DSC and FTIR spectroscopy with a low onset temperature of 188 °C. The polybenzoxazine, poly(Ph-cysme), exhibited 5% weight loss temperature as high as 350 °C. The as-synthesized carbon materials after pyrolysis possessed rich heteroatom content (up to 17.89%) and high specific surface area (1810 m2 g−1), which led to a high CO2 adsorption capacity of 6.78 mmol/g at 800 mmHg, 273 K and excellent stability. Furthermore, the prepared carbon material exhibited a superior electrochemical performance as anode for supercapacitors with a specific capacitance of 310 and 221 F g−1 in 6 M KOH at a current density of 0.1 and 1 A g−1, respectively. This work provides a new strategy for the further development of carbon material precursors in the future.
