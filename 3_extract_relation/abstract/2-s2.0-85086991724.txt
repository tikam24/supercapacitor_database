Hydrolytic lignin (HL) has been used in manufacturing of graphitized carbon via HL one-step physical activation. It was found that the layered carbon products of pyrolysis of hydrolytic lignin (AHL) at different temperatures may be used as cathode materials in primary current sources. The galvanostatic discharge of lithium battery at a current density of 100 μA/cm2 between 3.0 and 0.5 V shows that the specific capacity of thermally activated derivative is equal to 845 mA·h/g, while the untreated lignin yields only 190 mA·h/g. The fluorination of both the lignin and its thermally activated form results in higher operating voltage of lithium battery, as seems, due to the involvement of fluorine bound to carbon in electrochemical process. Some fluorinated AHL samples show the promise of their use as supercapacitor electrodes.
