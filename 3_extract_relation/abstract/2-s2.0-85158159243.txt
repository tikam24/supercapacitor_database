Porous nanostructured nitrogen and S-doped carbon derived from biomass have been extensively studied as electrode materials for supercapacitor applications. Supercapacitors are high-surface-area electrode-based electrochemical energy storage technologies that may be dominant in applications requiring high power supply or absorption. In high-performance supercapacitors, several electrodes, including biomass-derived carbonaceous electrodes, have subsequently shown significant potential due to their ubiquitous availability, renewable behavior, and cheap power storage. However, it is possible to design and optimize biomass with or without the presence of nitrogen in order to produce porous nanostructured nitrogen doped carbon by a variety of processes, including pyrolysis, hydrothermal carbonization, and several other routes. The N doped carbon increases ion absorption sites, electronic conductivity, carbonâ€“sulfur bonding, and electrochemical catalysis. This chapter discusses the synthesis routes of natural biomass-derived porous nanostructured N and S doped carbon, as well as heteroatomic doping of biomass-derived carbon and its end-use applicability in the field of supercapacitors.
