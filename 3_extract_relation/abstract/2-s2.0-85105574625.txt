A flexible MnO2/Ti3C2Tx hybrid film was prepared and used directly as pseudo-capacitive electrode for supercapacitors, composed of alternately arranged porous Ti3C2Tx nanosheets and MnO2 nanoshells. The unique porous structure of the film facilitated the ion transport both in the vertical and in-plane directions by the nanopores in the intra-layer and inter-layer of Ti3C2Tx nanosheets. And the specific surface area, specific capacitance and cycle stability of the hybrid film were dramatically improved compared with those of MnO2 nanoshells and porous Ti3C2Tx nanosheets.
