The preparation of graphene is a major topic of interest in graphene research. We report a rapid reduction of graphene oxide (GO) by microwave radiation, and a mild solvothermal method for controllable reduction. These methods are useful for producing reduced GO for supercapacitor electrode materials. Moreover, we also demonstrate the single layer graphene growth in an atmosphere CVD system on a Cu substrate using a liquid carbon precursor. Â©The Electrochemical Society.
