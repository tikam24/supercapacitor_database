Scanning positive column of atmospheric-pressure glow discharge (AGD) plasma is proposed as an eco-friendly and cost-effective strategy toward the instantaneous (∼2 s) reduction of graphene oxide (GO) paper, further leading to a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) paper with unimpeded liquid permeation for high performance supercapacitors. Unlike previous finding that AGD plasma has no effect on GO, a well-designed AGD plasma containing scanning positive column region is demonstrated to be capable of converting GO paper to rGO paper. With the synergy of energetic electrons (electron density 1.03 × 1016 cm-3) and surface touch heating (translational temperature ∼800 K), restoration of graphene's excellent electrical properties is realized, evidenced by a substantially (5 orders of magnitude) improved electrical conductivity. Moreover, the ultrafast reduction of oxygen functionalities results in the creation of exposed open channels and the expansion of graphene layers, leading to a rGO paper supercapacitor electrode with unimpeded liquid permeation. Taking the above advantages, the as-obtained rGO paper exhibits obviously better capacitive and rate performance than the parent GO and chemically reduced rGO counterparts in terms of higher specific capacitance, better charge/discharge rate response, and faster ion diffusion, holding a great promise for energy storage applications.
