A cocoon-like α-Fe2O3 nanocomposite with a novel carbon-coated structure was synthesized via a simple one-step hydrothermal self-assembly method and employed as supercapacitor electrode material. It was observed from electrochemical measurements that the obtained α-Fe2O3@C electrode showed a good specific capacitance (406.9 Fg1 at 0.5 Ag1) and excellent cycling stability, with 90.7% specific capacitance retained after 2000 cycles at high current density of 10 Ag1. These impressive results, presented here, demonstrated that α-Fe2O3@C could be a promising alternative material for application in high energy density storage. α-Fe2O3; carbon coating; supercapacitors.
