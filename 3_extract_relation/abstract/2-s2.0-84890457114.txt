We investigated the importance of the specific effective surface area through a detailed study on the relationship between electrical conductivity of single-walled carbon nanohorns (SWCNHs) and accessibility of the electrolyte ions in the SWCNH-based supercapacitor. After heat treatment of the SWCNHs, the ratio of sp2/sp3 carbons dramatically increased, suggesting an enhanced electrical conductivity of the SWCNHs. Even though the specific surface area (SSA) slightly decreased by 16% as a result of heat treatment, the specific capacitance per SSA of the SWCNH electrode remarkably increased from 22 to 47 μF cm-2. Such a result indicates an explicit increase in accessible effective surface area by electrolyte ions. Our result clearly showed that a higher degree of utilization for the interstitial pore of SWCNHs by solvated ions is a key factor in achieving a high volumetric capacitance of SWCNH-based supercapacitors. © 2013 American Chemical Society.
