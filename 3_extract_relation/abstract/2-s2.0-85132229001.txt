Polypyrrole (PPy)/bacterial cellulose (BC) composite membranes are a promising kind of lightweight and flexible electrodes for supercapacitors. Herein, we explored a facile and efficient electrostatic self-assembly approach to uniformly depositing anion-doped PPy onto positively charged SnCl2-modifed BC (SBC). The obtained PPy@SBC electrode exhibited a high areal capacitance of 5718 mF cm−2 at a current density of 0.5 mA cm−2, a desirable capacitance retention of 83.1% at 5.0 mA cm−2 and excellent cycling stability (a capacitance retention of 86.8% after 10,000 cycles at 10 mA cm−2). A symmetric flexible supercapacitor was further assembled with the PPy@SBC electrodes, which delivered outstanding mechanical flexibility with negligible capacitance decay under different bent states. This study shows impressive potential in fabricating high-performance electrodes for flexible supercapacitors.
