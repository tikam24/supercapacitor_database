In this paper a resonant DC-DC converter used for active voltage balancing is studied. This converter is a part of energy storage system ESS and it is based on the single ended resonant converter. The output of this converter is synchronous rectifier. The advantage of the proposed circuit is that semiconductor switches work in ZVS and/or ZCS mode. Simulation research of working of two voltage equalizing converters has been done. A practical experiment for charging two supercapacitor cells has been done.
