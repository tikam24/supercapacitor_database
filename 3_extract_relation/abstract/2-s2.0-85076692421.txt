It is of great interest to explore suitable methods to prepare micro/nano-structured electrode materials that possess specific morphologies. Herein, free-standing Ni3S2 nanowires on Ni foam are successfully prepared through a simple two-step approach, which involves in-situ growth of coordination supramolecular nanowires (Ni-CSN) followed by subsequent sulfidation. The as-prepared Ni3S2 nanowires are chosen as binder-free electrodes for supercapacitor with good electrochemical capacitive performance, which displays a high capacitance of 5.8F/cm2 at 5 mA/cm2, and still possesses 2.9F/cm2 at a much higher current density of 30 mA/cm2. The Ni3S2 nanowires electrode also shows long-term cycling with capacitance retention of 83.7% after 5000 cycles. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor by employing the Ni3S2 nanowires as cathode, activated carbon (AC) as anode is fabricated, which delivers a high energy density of 2.15 mWh/cm3 at a power density of 1.05 W/cm3. The results demonstrate the coordination supramolecular derived Ni3S2 nanowires have a huge potential application in the field of supercapacitors.
