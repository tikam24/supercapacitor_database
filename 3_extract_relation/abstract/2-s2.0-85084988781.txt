An overview of recent progress in the development of 2D manganese oxide nanosheet-based pseudocapacitors is provided, with emphasis on underlying methods and strategies. 2D manganese oxide nanosheets are sheet-like monocrystallites of ≈0.5 nm thickness and lateral dimensions of 50–5000 nm. MnO2 nanosheets are synthesized in the form of colloids, which can be readily utilized in wet-chemical processes like ink-jet printing. The synthetic strategies to make 2D δ-MnO2 nanosheets by bottom-up and top-down approaches are discussed, and the relationship between the ionic defect structure of δ-MnO2 nanosheets and their pseudocapacitance is explained. The basic principles and experimental challenges of ink-jet printing of 2D materials at high resolution, and the development of 2D nanosheet-based inks are discussed, with emphasis on δ-MnO2, graphene, and graphene oxide. The fabrication and performance of δ-MnO2 nanosheet derived pseudocapacitors, including ink-jet printed flexible microsupercapacitors, is described. The relationship between the electrode thickness and layer architecture and the specific capacitance is explained.
