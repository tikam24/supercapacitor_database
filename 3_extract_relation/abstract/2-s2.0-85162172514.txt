Various forms of energy used in our daily lives prevail in contemporary society. Application requirements have expanded from high power density to sustainable long term energy density for energy storage devices. The present study signifies effect of carbonization temperature role (700 °C, 800 °C, 900 °C) on electrochemical studies of MoO3 as electrode in supercapacitor devices. The prepared electrodes were characterized by electrochemical studies such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and basic characterizations like X-ray diffraction, Raman, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Different carbonization temperatures with the addition of carbon precursors produced MoO2/MWCNT and α-Mo2C/MWCNT. The areal capacitance of MoO2–700 °C, MoO2–800 °C, α-Mo2C-900 °C electrode were found to be delivered as 0.45 F/cm2, 0.54 F/cm2, 0.96 F/cm2 at 0.003 A/cm2. The substantial increase in specific capacitance for α-Mo2C-900 °C was attributed to improve charge transport, faradic redox development occurring at electrode surface, and high electrical conductivity of carbon nanotubes.
