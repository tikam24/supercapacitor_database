Fe3O4/CS carbon aerogel electrode material with a high specific capacitance was prepared via in-situ growth with chitosan (CS) and FeCl3•6H2O as raw materials. The crystal structure and structural defects of the samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, and the composition and morphology were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy, and their electrochemical properties were tested in a three-electrode system. The results show that Fe3O4 can be loaded on the CS carbon aerogel with their effective bonding. The amino groups on the chitosan molecules achieve self-doping of N atoms during the carbonization process, and the N content of the composite is as high as 7.21% (mole fraction). In addition, the composite carbon aerogel exhibits a high specific capacitance of 315.5 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g when introducing 0.4 g FeCl3•6H2O into 1.0 g CS. The specific capacitance of the composite carbon aerogel is approximately 3 times greater than that of original chitosan carbon aerogel.
