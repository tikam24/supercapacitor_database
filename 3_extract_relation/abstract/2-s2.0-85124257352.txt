A polyaniline (PANi)-carbon quantum dots (CQDs) nanocomposite material with CQDs made from a PEG (polyethylene glycol and NaOH) source was synthesized. This unique synthesis technique was developed to overcome the setbacks of the PEG method by using UG (urea and glycine). PANi was synthesized by chemical oxidation in the presence of CQDs, which were prepared according to the two above-mentioned methods. The sample was further characterized by morphological, optical, and electrochemical experiments. FE-SEM showed ridge-like morphology and UV-Vis studies revealed the presence of PANi and CQDs. HRTEM images gave details on the uniformly distributed polyaniline, which showed lengthy rod-like rough surfaces with interconnected tiny CQDs. The electrochemical results from CV and GCD studies indicated an enhancement of the specific capacitance for sample PCQ-2 (CQDs synthesized via the UG method as a source) compared to only PANi and PCQ-1 (CQDs prepared by the PEG method). The cyclic stability established was 84.5% retention from initial capacitance values over 3000 cycles. A two-electrode prototype device was also developed with the PCQ-2 sample and it achieved a reasonable capacitance of 161.3 mF/cm2 and demonstrated good retention stability over 5000 cycles. These results may be due to a variety of factors related to compositing CQDs (with urea and glycine as a source) with PANi.
