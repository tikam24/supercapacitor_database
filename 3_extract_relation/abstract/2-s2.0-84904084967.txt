Energy crisis is a world-wide issue threatening the sustainability and development of human society; however, it is still challenging to harvest renewable energy resources, such as the solar, mechanical, and thermal means, in a competitive low-cost and efficient manner. In this regard, due to the excellent optical, electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties, one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials have been well explored to enhance the energy harvesting and storage efficiency. This chapter reviews the fundamentals and the most recent developments in the preparation methods, basic property characterizations as well as the applications of 1D nanostructured materials in the energy transformation into electricity by solar cells, piezoelectric generators, thermal conversion devices, and energy storage in fuel cells, Li-ion batteries, and supercapacitors. These materials engineered with fascinating properties hold the promise of enabling low-cost, high-efficiency, smart renewable and clean energy harvesting as well as the storage, which would contribute greatly to the postfossil energy era.
