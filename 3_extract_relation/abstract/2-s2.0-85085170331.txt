Cerium-doped cobalt spinel ferrite {CexCo2Fe2-xO4 (x = 0, 0.3, 0.5)} electrode nanomaterials have been synthesized for the first time. The role of Ce doping for the enhancement of the performance of the supercapacitor has been discussed briefly. SEM analysis showed the almost spherical grain nanoparticles in the range of 40-220 nm with non-uniform cluster and large agglomeration. EDX analysis represented the chemical composition of pure and cerium-doped spinel cobalt ferrite nanomaterials. In PL studies the predominant UV/visible, violet, and blue emission have been observed which are crucial for LEDs. The electrochemical studies of CexCoFe2-xO4 (x = 0, 0.3, 0.5) electrodes were investigated by using CV, GCD and EIS in 1 M KOH electrolyte solution. The highest specific capacitance (937.50 Fgâˆ’1) have been obtained with long cycling life 82.3% retention after 4000th cycles. Hence, the fabricated Ce0.5CoFe1.5O4 electrode is a favorable candidate for super-capacitor applications.
