Supercapacitor electrodes fabricated from single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are shown to be capable of durable operation at 4 V, exceeding the operating voltage limit of activated carbon electrodes (AC, 3 V), while delivering significantly higher energy and power (see figure). Dual exploitation of SWNTs as combined electrodes and current collectors is also explored. Â© 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.
