In the present work, we have synthesized sheet-like reduced graphene oxide using different solution concentrations on the carbon cloth substrate via the hydrothermal method. The influence of different solution concentrations on the physical as well as electrochemical characteristics of the electrode material has been investigated. Moreover, the electrochemical properties of RGO prepared using 10 mg/ml solution concentration give the highest specific capacitance of 480.38F/g at 5 mV/s scan rate in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. RGO exhibits a good long-term cycle stability of 2000 cycles. The supercapacitive performance of the optimized RGO electrode was studied in different aqueous electrolytes. The promising physicochemical properties of RGO, makes it superior electrode material for the next generation wearable energy storage applications.
