Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with intrinsically porous structures are promising candidates for energy storage, however, their low electrical conductivity limits their electrochemical energy storage applications. Herein, the hybrid architecture of intrinsically conductive Cu-MOF nanowire arrays on self-supported polypyrrole (PPy) membrane is reported for integrated flexible supercapacitor (SC) electrodes without any inactive additives, binders, or substrates involved. The conductive Cu-MOFs nanowire arrays afford high conductivity and a sufficiently active surface area for the accessibility of electrolyte, whereas the PPy membrane provides decent mechanical flexibility, efficient charge transfer skeleton, and extra capacitance. The all-solid-state flexible SC using integrated hybrid electrode demonstrates an exceptional areal capacitance of 252.1 mF cm−2, an energy density of 22.4 µWh cm−2, and a power density of 1.1 mW cm−2, accompanied by an excellent cycle capability and mechanical flexibility over a wide range of working temperatures. This work not only presents a robust and flexible electrode for wide temperature range operating SC but also offers valuable concepts with regards to designing MOF-based hybrid materials for energy storage and conversion systems.
