Designing supercapacitors with excellent cyclic performances is promising for energy storage applications. Herein, a GO/NiO-polystyrene-block-polyisoprene-block-polystyrene triblock copolymer nanocomposite (GO/NiO-pSIS) electrode was designed for supercapacitor application. Evaluation of the electrode performance by cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy showed that the GO/NiO-pSIS composite demonstrates high specific capacitance and retains long-time cycling stability with more than 81% capacitance retention.
