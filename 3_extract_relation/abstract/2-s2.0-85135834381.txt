To accelerate the performance of supercapacitors, it is necessary to discover a new class of material with high energy density and redox stability. In this article, we have reported the electrochemical charge storage behavior of binary cobalt manganese sulfides Mn-Co-S (MCS) based binder-free electrodes, which were synthesized thru a facile one-step electrodeposition technique for supercapacitors. We have analyzed the structure and electrochemical properties by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Galvanostatic Charge Discharge (GCD), and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). The charge storage nature of the MCS electrodes were scrutinized by applying Power law and Dunn's model to the experimental data. Extracted b-values and dominated diffusive contribution in total specific capacity reveal that MCS has battery-grade nature with high redox reactions stability and capacity. The outcomes suggested that MCS-based electrodes are an appropriate candidate for enhancing the energy density along with the redox reaction stability of asymmetric supercapacitors.
