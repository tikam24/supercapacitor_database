In the present study we show the electrochemical performances of three series of fluorinated graphites CFx-MFn-T used as cathode materials in primary lithium batteries. Li/1 M LiClO4 or LiBF 4 PC /CFx were cells were discharged at different rates up to IC The electrochemical properties are correlated to physico-chemical characterizations. When the fluorine content increases, the capacity increases up to 900 Ah.kg-1. With increased covalency of the C-F bonding, the average discharge potential decreases from 3.15 to 2.31 V. The specific energy peaked at 2277 Wh.kg-1. Thermal storage was performed on cells and capacity losses upon ageing were found satisfactory. copyright The Electrochemical Society.
