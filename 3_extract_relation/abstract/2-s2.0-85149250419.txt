The batteries in electric vehicles (EV) have the potential to serve as a power source in the microgrid. EV batteries can be charged through the grid during the grid to the vehicle mode (G2V) of operation. Further, they can support the grid during peak load demand when EV is in standstill condition i.e. vehicle to grid mode (V2G) of operation. The proposed EV charging station topology integrates solar Photovoltaic (PV), supercapacitor, and grid for fast charging and achieving energy management in microgrids. Supercapacitor+Battery combination acts as a backup for EV charging under peak load conditions which has the ability to charge and discharge at a higher rate. This paper presents the design of a DC fast charging station with grid supply and Solar PV as sources. The system can operate either in grid-supportive mode or DC fast charging mode, depending on available power at various sources. The proposed system overcomes the issues in existing EV charging stations of limited charging rates and unidirectional power flow. The detailed modelling and analysis of the proposed system with their respective controller design are provided in this paper.
