The stability key factor of supercapacitors makes it useful to underneath high voltage, high temperature, and long-lived robustness. It is needed to recognize the ageing behaviour of the supercapacitor to enhance its constancy. This review article confined the ageing studies of supercapacitor (SC) under different factors such as temperature, voltage, and current. Here, we present the exploratory procedure of ageing tests and the result of characterization. The ageing behaviour is measured by the intermittent investigation of their electrical and electrochemical properties through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), galvanostatic chargeâ€“discharge (GCD), and cyclic voltammetry (CV). Furthermore, different SC models have been discussed and analysed. Finally, the effect of voltage, temperature, and current on SC performance is emphasized and quantified.
