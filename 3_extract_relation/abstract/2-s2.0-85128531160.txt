Recently, wire-shaped supercapacitors (WSCs) with the benefits of being flexible, lightweight, and wearable, have attracted great attention as portable and wearable power sources, though still, they face critical challenges of inadequate energy density and electrochemical stability under mechanical deformations. Therefore, we report the fabrication of the asymmetric WSC constituting surface-modified Ni wire as current collectors, PVA-KOH electrolyte, and hydrothermally grown Mn3O4 nanoflakes and dip-coated PEDOT: PSS-MWCNT nanocomposites as positive and negative electrode active materials, respectively. Owing to surface modification of Ni wire and active materials with approximate mass matching, mesoporous nanostructured surface morphology, and improved surface areas, the twisted asymmetric WSC exhibits excellent volumetric capacitance of 7.55 F/cm3, 2.69 mWh/cm3 energy density, and 95 mW/cm3 power density at 25 Î¼A with a 1.6 V voltage window. In addition, considering the recent trend of developing multi-functional self-powered systems integrating energy harvesters, storage entities, and functional components, ultraviolet photodetector (UV PD) in metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) configuration was fabricated by hydrothermal growth of Cu-doped ZnO nanorods onto interdigitated electrode printed glass substrate, and hence for the first time a self-powered UV-light detection system with a fast response and high on/off ratio were successfully demonstrated by connecting solar-charged parallel asymmetric WSCs and UV PD.
