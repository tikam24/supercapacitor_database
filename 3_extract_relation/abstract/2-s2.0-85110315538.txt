In this reported work, Ag nanoparticles (NPs) decorated CuS sub-micron flowers are synthesized using a facile, solvothermal reaction coupled with a silver mirror reaction. The experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that decorating the CuS with Ag NPs increases its intrinsic electrical conductivity and generates an electric field at the interface between Ag and CuS. These effects promote the efficient utilization of active materials and accelerate the interface charge transfer and electrochemical reaction kinetics. Consequently, the maximum specific capacity of the prepared CuS@Ag electrodes is found to be as high as 702 C g−1 at 2 A g−1, which is about 5 times greater than the pure CuS electrode. In addition, the capacity value is 400 C g−1 at 20 A g−1 and it exhibits 93% retention of the initial capacity after 5000 cycles at 10 A g−1. Moreover, a hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) device is assembled employing the CuS@Ag electrode as the positive electrode, which delivers an energy density of 51.1 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 798 W kg−1. These results demonstrate the promising potential of the fabricated CuS@Ag composites for further application in HSCs.
