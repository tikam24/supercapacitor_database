Hydrothermally synthesized electrodes of Co3O4@MnO2@NiO/GO were produced for use in supercapacitors. Graphene oxide (GO) was incorporated into the nanocomposites used for electrode synthesis due to its great surface area and electrical conductivity. The synergistic alliance among these composites and GO enhances electrode performance, life span, and stability. The structural properties obtained from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) results suggest that nanocomposites are crystalline in nature. The synergistic alliance among these composites and GO enhances electrode performance, life span, and stability. Performance assessment of these electrodes indicates that their characteristic performance was enhanced by C2+ radiation, with the uttermost performance witnessed for electrodes radiated with 5.0 Ã— 1015 ions/cm2.
