A series of porous carbon based supercapacitor electrode materials (GCO600) were synthesized via simple oxidative carbonization (GCO) with K2CO3 activation using grapefruit peel as a resource. The optimized product GCO600-14 has massive network pores and a specific surface area of 661. 7m2/g. In the three-electrode system, the specific capacitance of GCO600-14 is 413F/g at1A/g, and the specific capacitance can still reach 289 F/g when the current density increases to 30 times, which is 70% of the initial value. The cycling stability has a capacitance retention of 96% after 5000 cycles. For GCO600-14//GCO600-14 symmetric supercapacitor, the energy density is 26(W•h)/kgat a power density of 720W/kg and 20.2(W•h)/kg at a power density of 20800W/kg, respectively. It is indicated that GCO600-14 could have potential application prospects in environmentally friendly energy storage materials.
