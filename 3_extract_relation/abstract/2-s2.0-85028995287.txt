Multiwalled carbon nanotubes have been synthesized by floating reactant method in a vertical tubular reactor. An internal short approach process was developed to achieve the pre-lithiated multiwalled carbon nanotube MWCNTs/graphite composite anodes. Lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) were composed of a pre-lithiated multiwalled carbon nanotubes/graphite composite anode and an activated carbon (AC) cathode. The electrochemical performance of LICs with different MWCNTs content was investigated through galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance. The results show that the charge–discharge performance of LICs was greatly improved with the addition of MWCNTs in anodes. LIC25 (25 wt% MWCNTs) was found to achieve the optimal electrochemical performance. The LIC25 hold a specific capacitance of 58.2 F/g at the current density of 100 mA/g. The maximum energy density and power density were up to 96 Wh/kg and 10.1 kW/kg, respectively, in the current range of 100~8000 mA/g. The continuous galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling tests revealed that the LIC25 maintained excellent capacity retention of 86% after 3000 cycles.
