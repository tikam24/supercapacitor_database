The intermittent and stochastic of renewable energy has brought great challenges to power system. Its fluctuation can be stabilized effectively by the microgrid including energy storage devices. In this paper, an energy management strategy for microgrid integrated with hybrid energy storage which contains lithium battery and super capacitor is proposed. Basing on the real-time running status of renewable energy and energy storage devices, the operation of the hybrid energy storage system is adjusted. In this way, the output of the renewable energy and the exchanging power between microgrid and the main grid can be stabilized. Furthermore, the cycle life of the hybrid energy storage devices will be longer and the operating costs of renewable energy (or microgrid) can be saved. Experimental results show that the proposed microgrid energy management strategy is feasible.
