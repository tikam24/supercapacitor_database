The development of economical and energy-efficient electrocatalysts is essential for the wide-scale application of secondary zinc-air batteries (ZABs). Herein, we prepared Co9S8 and FeS2 nanoparticles inlaid on N-doped carbon nanofibers (Co9S8-FeS2@N-CNFs), which were derived from the in situ growth of Fe-doped ZIF-67 nanosheet arrays on electrospun nanofibers and a subsequent sulfidation process. The Co9S8-FeS2@N-CNFs display excellent electrocatalytic performances for OER (Ej=10, 330 mV) and ORR (E1/2, 0.80 V) as well as a smaller charge and discharge gap (Î”E, 0.76 V) in KOH electrolyte, allowing it to be employed as an attractive air cathode bifunctional catalyst for secondary ZABs. The electrocatalytic performance of the composite materials (Co9S8-FeS2@N-CNFs) is obviously better than that of the single-component materials (FeS2@N-CNFs and Co9S8@N-CNFs). The improved catalytic performance is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of the two transition-metal sulfides and the optimization of the structure. Furthermore, the peak power density of the assembled aqueous/solid-state ZABs based on Co9S8-FeS2@N-CNFs can reach 214 and 91 mW cm-2 with excellent stability, respectively, which outperforms the ones based on commercial precious-metal-based catalysts. We anticipate that our work will provide new inspiration for the design of MOF-derived sulfides as multifunctional catalysts.
