Conversion and energy storage through electrochemical devices such as batteries and supercapacitors are crucial in the establishment of sustainable energy. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a promising material to be used in these devices due to their high specific surface areas as well as tunable structures, morphology, and channel sizes. This review examines the application of MOFs in supercapacitors, Li-ion batteries, metal-S batteries, metal-O2 batteries, and flexible electrochemical devices for energy storage with a focus on highlighting the role played by MOFs in enhancing the performance of such devices. A summary of several synthetical approaches to nanostructured MOFs is also included.
