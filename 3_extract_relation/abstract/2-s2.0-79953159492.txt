A Fuel Cell-Supercapacitor Electric Vehicle (FC-SCEV) with only one power converter generally uses the FC as an average power unit and the SC as a peak power unit. This array requires operating the power converter linked to the FC in operation regions rather than single operation point; as a result traditional averaged modeling and control methods are no longer valid. In this paper, a hybrid control technique is proposed to control the power converter, which is cable to work in operation regions and it can use any inductor current in the converter as a feedback; meanwhile it achieves an excellent output voltage control under disturbances either from supply voltage, load voltage or other perturbations. Experimental results are given for a 1kW Nexa® power module and interleaved boost converter taken as a benchmark. © Copyright 2011 IEEE - All Rights Reserved.
