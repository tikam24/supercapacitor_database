Phosphorus-doped three-dimensional hierarchical porous carbons (P-3DHPCs) have been synthesized by direct pyrolysis of mixture containing glucose, manganese nitrate and sodium hypophosphite without any hard templates. Glucose and sodium hypophosphite are used as carbon and phosphorus source in the facile template-free strategy, respectively. The P-3DHPCs not only possess favorable hierarchical pore structure which is beneficial to ion adsorption and transportation, but also acquire effective heteroatoms doping, further improving the capacitive performance. More importantly, the amount of sodium hypophosphite plays a critical role in textural properties and phosphorus content of P-3DHPCs. The results demonstrate that P-3DHPC-0.2 shows the best electrochemical performance compared to the other samples. High specific capacitance (367 F g−1 at 0.3 A g−1) is obtained in 6 M KOH, and the capacitance still maintains 319 F g−1 when tested at 20 A g−1 (ca.88% capacitance retention). Moreover, the P-3DHPC-0.2 also possesses good cycling stability with only a loss of 3.5% after 10000 cycles at 3 A g−1. The facile preparation method and good electrochemical performance render P-3DHPCs to be a promising candidate for supercapacitor application.
