The restacking issue between graphene sheets seriously affects the ionic accessibility into the graphene electrodes, resulting in the low energy storage capacity of graphene-based microsupercapacitors. However, improving electrolyte accessibility by constructing porous structure to suppress graphene restacking generally decreases its electrical conductivity. Therefore, taking into account both electron transport and electrolyte ion diffusion in the process of constructing porous structures to solve the restacking issue is the key to improve the electrochemical performance of graphene based micro-supercapacitors. Herein, a facile and efficient self-sacrificing template route is proposed to construct structure-tailored graphene electrodes with balanced electrolyte ions and electron transportation for all-solid-state flexible MSCs. In this route, ethyl cellulose helps graphene evenly dispersed in terpineol to form printable ink, and also acts as self-sacrificing template to rationally tune porous structure during post-processing of the printed electrode. Because of the increasing accessibility of electrolyte ions as well as the enhanced electrical conductivity in the fabricated porous graphene electrode, the MSCs deliver high areal energy density of 2.68 μWh cm−2 and high capacitance retention of 89 % when the current density increased from 0.05 to 0.4 mA cm−2. The devices also exhibit outstanding cycle stability and good mechanical stability. This work demonstrates a simple strategy to construct graphene electrodes for MSCs with high areal energy density.
