Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are one of the most promising materials to be used in the structural composite electrolyte bearing high mechanical properties without sacrificing the ionic conductivity simultaneously. In this study, the SPEs using the epoxy and ionic liquid electrolyte (IL) have successfully been fabricated with an aim to serve in a multifunctional solid polymer electrolyte. SPEs were induced phase separation following two phase. One is epoxy resin, their hardener and catalyst, act as a scaffold of SPEs. Another is IL phase which lithium salt (Li TFSI) was dissolved to serve the ion conduction. We also introduced the nano filler to promote the properties of SPEs. As a result, Young's modulus was reached 1 GPa without decrease of ionic conductivity (2.9 x 10-4 S/cm).
