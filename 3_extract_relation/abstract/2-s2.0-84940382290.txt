Single electrode materials capable of both electric double-layer and Faradic redox-based pseudo capacitance can be used for fabrication of high performance supercapacitors in an easy way and thus are highly desirable in the energy storage field. This contribution reports a new kind of such materials based on alkylated graphene materials (C<inf>n</inf>rGO, n is the carbon number of their alkyl side chains) having different alkyl side chains (n = 4, 8, and 16). These materials were prepared via esterification of KOH-treated GO with the corresponding alkyl bromides in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst. More importantly, water was used as the reaction medium, and thus endowing the preparation method an eco-friend feature. The so-prepared graphene materials displayed chain length-dependent specific surface area and the population of residue C-O functionalities, and thus affording vast differences in their supercapacitor behaviors. C<inf>4</inf>rGO, the product having butyl side chains, showed the best supercapacitor performance with a capacitance up to 242.2 F g<sup>-1</sup> at a scan rate of 100 mV s<sup>-1</sup> and a good cycling stability.
