In the wake of recent developments, supercapacitors are actively being employed as a superior energy storage material and are being regarded as a viable alternative to traditional battery technology. Its high-power density and quick charging and discharging capabilities have increased their allure. Transition metal oxides have gained much interest as electrode materials for flexible supercapacitors; due to their high specific capacitance, as a result, multifunctional cobalt oxide is one of the most versatile and crucial materials for advances in energy storage. This work suggested utilising a facilitated hydrothermal approach to create cobalt oxide nanoparticles at various molarities. The physicochemical properties of the synthesised products were explored using X-ray diffraction, FT-IR, UV-Visible, SEM, and a charge storage potential was significantly investigated. The formation of single-phased cobalt oxide nanoparticles is revealed by functional investigation, with the estimated crystallite size increasing proportionally to the concentration of cobalt ions. Significantly, the crystalline parameters of cobalt oxide are greatly influenced by the molar ratio changes. Morphological studies strikingly demonstrated the porous-like morphology of particle dispersion over the samples. The electrochemical study found an intrinsic pseudo capacitance with a maximum specific capacitance of 378.61 Fg-1. During investigations, the cobalt oxide demonstrates an efficient charge storage ability, implying that the cost-effective synthesised cobalt oxide's considerable capacitance capability complies with and supports the energy storage demands.
