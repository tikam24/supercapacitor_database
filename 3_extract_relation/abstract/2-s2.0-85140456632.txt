This paper analyzes the fluctuation characteristics of the output power of a photoelectric field based on the frequency domain. It also proposes a photoelectric power distribution method based on moving average algorithm frequency division. This method provides reasonable distribution of low- and high-frequency energy among the different energy storage elements. By combining the energy storage characteristics of supercapacitors and lithium batteries, a coordinated control strategy of SC-Li batteries is designed to effectively suppress the impact of photovoltaic power fluctuations on the grid. Compared with the original power of photovoltaics, the method proposed herein greatly reduces the fluctuation of photovoltaic power, which leads to stable and safe development of power grids and energy storage components. Finally, a simulation of the measured data of a certain photoelectric field verifies the effectiveness of the method.
