In this paper, we present a comparative study of a cost-effective method for the mass fabrication of electrodes to be used in thin-film flexible supercapacitors. This technique is based on the laser-synthesis of graphene-based nanomaterials, specifically, laser-induced graphene and reduced graphene oxide. The synthesis of these materials was performed using two different lasers: a CO2 laser with an infrared wavelength of λ = 10.6 μm and a UV laser (λ = 405 nm). After the optimization of the parameters of both lasers for this purpose, the performance of these materials as bare electrodes for flexible supercapacitors was studied in a comparative way. The experiments showed that the electrodes synthetized with the low-cost UV laser compete well in terms of specific capacitance with those obtained with the CO2 laser, while the best performance is provided by the rGO electrodes fabricated with the CO2 laser. It has also been demonstrated that the degree of reduction achieved with the UV laser for the rGO patterns was not enough to provide a good interaction electrode-electrolyte. Finally, we proved that the specific capacitance achieved with the presented supercapacitors can be improved by modifying the in-planar structure, without compromising their performance, which, together with their compatibility with doping-techniques and surface treatments processes, shows the potential of this technology for the fabrication of future high-performance and inexpensive flexible supercapacitors.
