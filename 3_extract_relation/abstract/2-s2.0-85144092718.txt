The accumulation of solid polymer wastes stifles society's sustainable growth. Herein, N-, S-codoped polystyrene (thermocol) waste-derived carbon is synthesized using a simple approach and utilized as an electrode for a lithium–sulfur battery and supercapacitor applications. The aqueous symmetric supercapacitor delivers a high specific energy of 60 and 27 Wh kg−1 at a specific power of 75 and 3780 W kg−1, respectively and 150 Wh kg−1 at a specific power of 520 W kg−1 in nonaqueous sodium-ion capacitors with high cycling stability. Deconvolution by Dunn's and Trasatti's approaches reveals an enhanced capacitive-charge storage rather than diffusive-charge storage due to heteroatom doping and mesopores of the generated carbon. The lithium–sulfur battery delivers a stable capacity of 1079 mAh g−1 at 0.1C rate with excellent cycling stability over 500 cycles, suggesting improved mitigation of polysulfide dissolution imparted by the mesoporous carbon with thiophene moiety which effectively traps Li2Sn.
