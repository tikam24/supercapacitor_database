Hollow core, mesoporous shell carbon nanospheres (HCMSs) with large bimodal mesopores (6.4 and 3.1 nm) and high surface area (1704 m2 g -1) have been synthesized by a triconstituent surface co-assembly of monodisperse silica nanospheres method. The resulted HCMS show a high specific capacity of 251 F g-1 at 50 mV s-1 in 2 M H 2SO4 and long cyclic life. Â© 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
