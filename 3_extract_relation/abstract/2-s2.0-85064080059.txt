In this study, birnessite manganese oxide nanosheets (δ-MnO 2 ) are growth on hollow carbon sphere (HCS) by a facile hydrothermal reaction to prepare a novel multifunctional nanocomposite (δ-MnO 2 /HCS). The obtained δ-MnO 2 /HCS nanocomposite possesses a unique hollow structure, which exhibited excellent adsorption of electrolyte ions and macromolecules. When used as electrode for supercapacitors (SCs), it exhibits excellent electrochemical ability. The specific capacitance is 370 F/g at 5 mV/s, and 93.3% of the initial capacitance is retained after 5000 cycles. Additionally, when δ-MnO 2 /HCS acted as a catalyst for the degradation of bisphenol A (BPA), the removal rate is 95% within 10 min and BPA is almost entirely decomposed in 30 min. This multifunctional δ-MnO 2 /HCS composite may find novel applications in future environmentally friendly energy technologies.
