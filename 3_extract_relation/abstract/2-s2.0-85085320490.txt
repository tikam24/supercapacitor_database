Carbon materials are the most important anode materials used in supercapacitors. However, there are still great challenges in improving their low specific capacitance and energy density. In this study, a fast molten salt method was developed for the preparation of a super-high capacity activated carbon cloth anode. The nitrogen-activated carbon cloth electrode (NCC) showed better electrochemical performance than most of the carbon-based materials reported on previously. The maximum areal capacitance of the nitrogen-activated carbon cloth electrode was 6.72 F cm−2 at the current density of 2 mA cm−2. By employing the first-principle calculations method, it was derived that the adsorption energy of the K atoms on the graphite increased with the increase in nitrogen doping, especially on the pyridinic nitrogen (N-6). In addition, when the NCC and Ni-Co-S@CC electrodes were assembled into an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC), the ASC demonstrated an operation in a large potential window of 1.8 V, and it achieved a high volumetric energy density of 23.51 mWh cm−3 at a power density of 1808 mW cm−3. This work showed the super high capacity of activated carbon cloth as a new anode material for high-performance supercapacitors prepared using a simple molten salt method.
