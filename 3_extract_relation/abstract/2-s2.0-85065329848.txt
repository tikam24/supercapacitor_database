Supercapacitor has received extensive research and attention in the field of energy storage because of its unique performance characteristics. As a key component of supercapacitor, the performance of the separator directly affects the specific power, specific energy and cycle life of the supercapacitor. This paper summarized the role of separator in supercapacitor and its influence mechanisms on the electrical performance of supercapacitor. The preparation, advantages and disadvantages of current separator products were presented, and the development trend of the separators was also discussed.
