In this paper, hierarchical three-dimensional porous flower of ZnCohydrotalcite non-planar nanosheets were prepared on the surface of Ni foam by in-situ hydrothermal method. Within this material, the foam Ni acted as structural support and nickel sources providing additional active components. This ZnCohydrotalcite demonstrated to have an high specific capacitance reaching 5437.6 mF cm-2 at 10 mA cm-2 when the ratio of Zn:Co was 2:8 in precursors. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor with obtained ZnCohydrotalcite as anode while activated carbon as cathode exhibited high electrochemical property (30.1 F g-1) and 84.3 % capacitance retention after 20000 cycles at 1 A g-1.
