The performance of a dual energy storage electric vehicle system mainly depends on the quality of its power and energy managements. A real-time management strategy supported by a model predictive control (MPC) using the nonuniform sampling time concept is developed and fully addressed in this paper. First, the overall multiple energy storage powertrain model including its inner control layer is represented with the energetic macroscopic representation and used to introduce the energy strategy level. The model of the system with its inner control layer is translated into the state-space domain in order to develop an MPC approach. The management algorithm based on mixed short- and long-term predictions is compared to rule-based and constant sampling time MPC strategies in order to assess its performance and its ability to be used in a real vehicle. The real-time simulation results indicate that, compared to other strategies, the proposed MPC strategy can balance the power and the energy of the dual energy storage system more effectively, and reduce the stress on batteries. Moreover, battery and supercapacitor key variables are kept within safety limits, increasing the lifetime of the overall system.
