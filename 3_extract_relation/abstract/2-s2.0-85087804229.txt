Hybrid drive wind power generation system, equipped with the speed regulating differential mechanism (SRDM), is able to be friendly connected to power grid without the need of partly- or fully-rated converters. The novel transmission schemes can promote not only the output power quality but also the low voltage ride through (LVRT) capability of the existing wind turbines (WTs). For the purpose of further improving the grid-connected operating performances of SRDM-based WT, this paper aims to develop a hybrid power production unit, in which the hydrogen storage system (HSS), comprising an electrolyzer, a hydrogen fuel cell and a supercapacitor, is integrated into SRDM-based WT. The basic architecture and numerical modelling methods of key subsystems in SRDM-based WT as well as in HSS are analyzed. After determining the eight different operating modes, a power supervision approach is synthesized for the proposed SRDM-based WT with HSS, by which the power flow management between energy sources and storage elements can be realized. Case studies are carried out in the presence of different randomly varying wind speeds and grid voltage faults. The satisfactory operating performances of the proposed wind-hydrogen hybrid system in terms of maximizing wind energy utilization, suppressing output power fluctuation and improving system continuous operating stability are verified.
