Carbon aerogels of an inter-connected three-dimensional (3D) structure are a potential carbon material for supercapacitors. We report a new oxidation modification method to prepare a series of modified carbon aerogels (OM-CA) by Hummers oxidation method. Oxidation-modified carbon aerogels (OM-CA) are obtained from carbon aerogel powders oxidized by Hummers method. Sulfuric acid stoichiometry is studied in order to investigate the effect of the surface oxygen group on surface area and electrochemical performance. Additionally, heteroatoms are doped into carbon aerogels in the oxidation process. The effect of heteroatom doping on electrochemical performance as a supercapacitor electrode material is investigated. When the amount of sulfuric acid is 40 wt%, the dopping manganese content is 0.9 mol%, the specific surface area of OM-CA is 450 m2/g, and its specific capacitance is 151 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, which is achieved by heteroatom doping and texture properties. In addition, OM-CA composite supercapacitors exhibit a stable cycle life at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and retain 98.0% of initial capacitance over 500 cycles, and OM-CA-40% still presents a higher capacity, up to 148 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. The high specific surface area and specific capacitance suggest the porous carbon material has potential applications in supercapacitors.
