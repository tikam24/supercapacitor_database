Supercapacitors are new types of electrical energy storage components with an electric double layer. Ageing characteristics, lifetime and reliability evaluation are of great significance for quality evaluation and rational use. This paper focused on the pseudo-failure calendar lifetime distribution and reliability evaluation of supercapacitors. High-temperature accelerated calendar ageing test of supercapacitors is carried out, and equivalent series resistance and capacitance were tested. Pseudo-lifetime is calculated and distribution is fitted. Fitting results showed that the pseudo-lifetime of supercapacitors is more in line with Weibull distribution. Finally, the reliability curve and its bounds with 95% confidence are made, as a result of the reliability evaluation of supercapacitors.
