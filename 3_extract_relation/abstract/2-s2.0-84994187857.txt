Cloth-like electronic devices are of great interest for the rapid development of wearable electronics. Herein we report a flexible and high-performance supercapacitor constructed on conductive cloth. In order to improve the electrochemical capacity, nickel nanocone arrays were electrodeposited onto a piece of conductive cloth (nickel plated polyester plain cloth) for the nickel current collector (NCC). The NCC@MnO2 and NCC@polypyrrole were prepared as binder-free electrodes via a facile electro-deposition process for both cathode and anode. The NCC contributes to enhance electron transport/collection and makes it easy to release stress generated in the charge-discharge cycles of the active materials. Due to the design of highly ordered array electrode architecture, our NCC electrodes display excellent capacitive performance with high gravimetric and areal capacitances, excellent rate capability and outstanding cycling stability. Furthermore, the as-obtained pseudo-supercapacitor shows unique mechanical property of flexibility due to the presence of conductive cloth. The present study provides an alternative strategy for the development of cost effective, flexible, and high-performance energy storage devices.
