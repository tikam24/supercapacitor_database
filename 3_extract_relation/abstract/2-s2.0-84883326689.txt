A smart supercapacitor was fabricated by loading a thermosensitive polymer P(NIPAM-co-SPMA) onto the surface of NiAl-layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanowalls, which displays temperature-triggered on–off ion channels for controlling the electrochemical behavior. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
