Micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) are becoming one of the research frontiers in the field of chip storage devices. Here ultrahigh scanning rate, narrowing, planar interdigital graphene-based MSCs were fabricated by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and photolithographic micro-fabrication. The energy density was up to 34.48 mWh cm−3 because of the interdigital architecture and monolayer graphene electrode. In addition, capacitance retention rates remained over 93.80% after 2500 charge/discharge cycles, which showed graphene-based MSCs good stability. More importantly, the MSCs can be operated well at an ultrahigh scan rate of up to 5000 V s−1. This paper provides an important reference for chip storage devices.
