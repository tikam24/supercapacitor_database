This paper presents a comparative study of two types energy storage comprises of super-capacitor and battery for reduction of the harmonic in the inverter output. This paper also deals with design and simulation of a three phase inverter in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment. The proposed system designed using MATLAB/SIMULINK consists of a supercapacitor and battery as energy storage, Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) and filtering scheme. The controller based on synchronous d-q reference frame technique was applied to the inverter and the Phase Lock Loop (PLL) is used for synchronization between grid connected voltage and inverter voltage. The design of low pass filter is used at the inverter output to remove the high frequency ripple is also discussed. The various performances of simulation results between super-capacitor and battery have been investigated. The Total Harmonic Distortion (THDv) of the inverter output voltage is measured where two types of energy storages (battery and super capacitor) are applied to the inverter input. It can be observed that the THD voltage and current at load for the super capacitor is considerably lower than the battery. Â© 2013 IEEE.
