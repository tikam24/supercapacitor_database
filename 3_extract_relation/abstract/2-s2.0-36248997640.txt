MnO2 was prepared by mechanochemical method, the influence of mole ratio KMnO4: Mn (CH3COO)2 on the performance of MnO2 was studied. The structure and morphology were investigated by XRD, SEM, IR and BET. The charge/discharge capability of supercapacitor assembled were investigated in 6 mol/L KOH. The results showed that the more Mn(CH3COO)2 contained in raw materials, the better the crystallite formed; the size of products was in the grade of micro-meter, but the discharge capacitance was decreased. From 504 F/g to 388 F/g. When the mole ratios of KMnO4: Mn(CH3COO)2 were 2: 2 and 2: 3, the product had better capability. The maximum of discharge capacitance was as high as 504 F/g and 516 F/g respectively, within 0-1 V, 200 mA/g.
