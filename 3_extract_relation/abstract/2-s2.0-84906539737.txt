Shape-selective TiO2 nanomaterials with different morphology, namely wire-like, flake-like and flower-like, have been synthesized by utilizing a simple wet chemical route by the reaction of titanium isopropoxide with ethanol and water mixture in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. The shape of the particles can be easily tuned by altering the concentration of surfactant relative to the metal salt and changing the other reaction parameters. The formation mechanism of different shapes has been elaborated in detail. The shape-selective TiO2 nanomaterials have been utilized for electrochemical supercapacitor and DSSC applications. It was observed that TiO2 nanomaterials with various shapes showed different specific capacitance (Cs) values, and the order of Cs values is as follows: wire-like > flower-like > flake-like. The highest Cs of 3.16 F g-1 and better cycling stability was observed for TiO 2 nanomaterials having wire-like shapes. At a high scan rate 150 mV s-1, the capacitance retention of wire-like TiO2 electrode remains at about 90% after 5000 cycles. DSSC study results show that all the differently shaped TiO2 nanomaterials can be used as potential anode materials, and, among the different shapes, the flower-like morphology shows better photo-conversion efficiency. The presented synthesis process is fast, cost-effective and environmentally friendly and could be utilized for other applications like gas sensors, photo-catalysts or elimination of pollutants from contaminated soils.
