Stretchable electronics are emerging as a new technological advancement, since they can be reversibly stretched while maintaining functionality. To power stretchable electronics, rechargeable and stretchable energy storage devices become a necessity. Here, we demonstrate a facile and scalable fabrication of full stretchable supercapacitor, using buckled single-walled carbon nanotube macrofilms as the electrodes, an electrospun membrane of elastomeric polyurethane as the separator, and an organic electrolyte. We examine the electrochemical performance of the fully stretchable supercapacitors under dynamic stretching/releasing modes in different stretching strain rates, which reveal the true performance of the stretchable cells, compared to the conventional method of testing the cells under a statically stretched state. In addition, the self-discharge of the supercapacitor and the electrochemical behavior under bending mode are also examined. The stretchable supercapacitors show excellent cyclic stability under electrochemical charge/discharge during in situ dynamic stretching/releasing. Â© 2012 American Chemical Society.
