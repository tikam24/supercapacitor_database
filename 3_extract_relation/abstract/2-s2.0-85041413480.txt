The drastic advancements in wearable electronics have ultimately stimulated the urgent development of stretchable microscale power sources with high voltage output and unprecedented integration. However, the creation of such energy storage devices remains elusive. Here we demonstrated the fabrication of stretchable tandem planar micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) with high voltage output, outstanding flexibility, robust cyclability, and sturdy integration, based on the interdigital electrode patterns of acid-treated, tightly intertwined graphene/carbon nanotube/cross-linked PH1000 film (GCP), in which PH1000 wrapped carbon nanotubes act as the stretchable backbone and capacitance contributor, and graphene nanosheets serve as high-conductive enhancer. The stretchable GCP patterns were directly manufactured by mask-assisted filtration of GCP ink, and transferred onto a pre-strain rubber substrate, showing high electrical conductivity (610 S cm-1), and impressive stretchablitiy. The resultant GCP-MSCs delivered high areal capacitance of 107.5 mF cm-2, and presented notable performance uniformity without obvious capacitance degradation after being stretched up to 200%, and stable cyclability with capacitance retention of 93.2% after 8000 cycles under repeatedly stretch-and-release strain. Moreover, our fabrication strategy is highly scalable for the generation of stretchable tandem MSCs without requirement of additional metal-based interconnects. As demonstrated, our stretchable tandem device of three serially-interconnected GCP-MSCs showed fully stretchable with strain rate up to 200%, and extended voltage output to 2.4 V in comparison with single cell (0.8 V), demonstrative of the great potential for wearable electronics.
