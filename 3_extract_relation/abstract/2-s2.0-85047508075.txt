Iron oxide is promising for use in aqueous energy storage devices due to the high capacity, but one of the most challenging problems is cycling instability within the large potential window that results from the complete quasi-conversion reaction. Herein, a conformal surface coating strategy toward iron oxide via atomic layer deposition (ALD) is presented and an Fe3O4@TiO2 core–shell nanorod array anode is reported that exhibits remarkable cycling performance exceeding 30 000 times within a wide potential window in neutral lithium salt electrolyte. ALD offers a uniform and precisely controllable TiO2 shell that not only buffers the inner volume expansion of Fe3O4, but also contributes extra capacity through Li+ intercalation/de-intercalation and helps to alleviate the water electrolysis. Furthermore, by pairing with a pseduocapacitive cathode of V2O3@carbon and using a hydrogel electrolyte of PVA-LiCl, a unique flexible quasi-solid-state hybrid supercapacitor can be assembled. With a high voltage of 2.0 V, the device delivers high volumetric energy and power densities (2.23 mWh cm−3, 1090 mW cm−3), surpassing many recently reported flexible supercapacitors. This work highlights the importance of ALD conformal multifunctional shell to instable nanoarray electrodes in aqueous electrolytes and brings new opportunities to design advanced aqueous hybrid energy storage devices.
