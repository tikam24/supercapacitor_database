Construction of functionalized porous carbon materials (f-PCMs) from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has received considerable attention in energy storage devices. Here, we summarized the recent progress in the functionalization process of MOF-derived PCMs and their electrochemical investigations for the supercapacitors. As the results of high electronic conductivity, improved wettability, and pseudocapacitance contribution, the f-PCMs have shown an excellent feature in the supercapacitor devices. We also discussed the existing problems and possible solutions to construct f-PCMs with a highly porous nature. This chapter will promote the development of f-PCMs with controlled porous structure and pore size for future high-performance supercapacitor devices.
