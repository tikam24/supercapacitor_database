Nanostructured NiCo2O4 spinel is the most appealing candidate to be used as the electrode for supercapacitors due to its significant merits such as eco-friendliness, low cost and easy availability. Introduction of a secondary metal cation into the host NiCo2O4 could provide more electroactive sites with rich redox chemistry. Herein we report the influence of cation (Zn/Mn) doping on the physicochemical and electrochemical properties of easily synthesized NiCo2O4 spinel. After being doped with Zn/Mn the morphology of NiCo2O4 was notably changed and specific capacitance of NiCo2O4 was greatly enhanced. Mn doped NiCo2O4 nanorod bundles store more internal surface charge than Zn doped NiCo2O4 flowers. A maximum specific capacitance of 1494 F/g was delivered by Mn doped NiCo2O4 nanorod bundles with a good rate capability (capacity retention of 64 % from 1 to 20 A/g) and excellent cycling stability (88.6% of initial value after the completion of 5000 cycles). An asymmetric device fabricated using Mn substituted NiCo2O4 as the positive electrode achieved an energy density of 12 Wh/kg at a power density of 427 W/kg and could efficiently light up a light emitting diode.
