The 3D laser direct writing of a carbon microelectrode from a carbon black aqueous dispersion was developed and the carbon electrode was applied to an m-plane micro-supercapacitor (MSC). The thickness of the electrode was increased by repeating the cycle of immersion of a glass sub- strate into an aqueous dispersion, liftuig up the substrate from the dispersion, and galvano-scanning of CO; laser beam on the substrate covered with the carbon black aqueous dispersion. A carbon- manganese oxide (MnxOy) hybrid electrode from a carbon black-manganese (II) acetate tetrahydrate aqueous dispersion was also prepared by the 3D laser direct wilting. The characteristics of m-plane MSCs composed of carbon and carboii-MnsOy hybrid electrodes were studied. A carbon-MnxOy hybrid electrode showed the characteristics of a pseudo MSC and larger capacitance than a pure car- bon electrode.
