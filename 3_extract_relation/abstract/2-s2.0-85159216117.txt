As technology progresses, electrochromic supercapacitors realize the need for active chromophores to reduce energy consumption and manufacture power-efficient devices. A simultaneous effect of chromic modulation and energy storage has been achieved in a bi-layer stacked film of two different metal oxides (NiO@Co3O4). Staking of the film changes their suppressed resultant energy levels thereby obtaining less charge transfer resistance in an electrochemical cell. The electrochemistry of the fabricated electrodes in an alkaline medium displays its dominant capacitive behavior and therefore leads to the formation of an electric double layer at the electrode/electrolyte interface. While charging, the intercalation/de-intercalation of ions changes the oxidation state of metals at the electrode surface and responds to a finite chromic modulation. A well-defined interplay between the chromic modulation (Î·CE = 27.5 cm2/C) and its capacitive performance (158 F/g) has been identified. At last, with a good reversible redox activity, the electrode was also checked as a counter electrode to exhibit better electrochromic performance with small organic viologen material.
