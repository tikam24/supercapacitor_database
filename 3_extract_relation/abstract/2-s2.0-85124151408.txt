Construction of hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) is a new energy storage system with electrical performance complementary to that of batteries. They can harvest higher power than batteries but contain lower energy density. In order to improve the performance of this kind of energy storage device. Compared with the traditional method of changing electrode materials, this new alternative measurement method is more feasible and has better effect. In the traditional method of modifying the electrode, the energy of its supercapacitor is limited, usually between (40-100)Wh kg(−1), while the energy density can often reach more than 100Wh kg(−1) by using the new strategy mentioned in this paper. Therefore, the achievements of these new strategies cannot be ignored. This review summarizes progress in the field of improving the performance for hybrid supercapacitors as well as outlines key perspectives for future research. This paper focuses on the advantages and disadvantages of the three alternative strategies. The mechanism of these approaches and some critical related issues are reviewed in detail. Then, the challenges and perspectives in this rising field are also discussed. This review will provide fundamental insight into hybrid supercapacitors and offer important rationales for future design and construction of advanced hybrid supercapacitors for practical applications.
