Synthesis of three dimensional nanostructures with high specific surface area is very much essential to enhance the capacitance of supercapacitors. In this work, we have made an attempt to prepare 3D flower like TiO2 nanoparticles via green approach. The detailed microstructural, morphological and optical properties are examined thoroughly using various characterization techniques. More attention is paid to investigate the electrochemical performance of TiO2 nanoparticles by different methods such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronopotentiometry (CP) and impedance spectroscopy in aqueous electrolyte at different reaction times. The result establishes that the TiO2 nanoparticles prepared through 10 h reaction time in 1M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte demonstrated better electrochemical performance due to its delightful structural morphology.
