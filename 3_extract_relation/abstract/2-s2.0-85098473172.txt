A novel energy storage gadget with instantaneous energy/power density is significant in current scenario due to the rapid utilization of renewable energy sources. Also, the electrochemical property of the chosen electrodes have chiefly dependent on the structure of the electrode materials. Keeping these aspects in mind, we have devised to fabricate a hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) composed of a battery-type Faradic electrode (for energy source) and non-Faradic electrode (for power source). The composite electrode material (CoS2/multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)) prepared in the present study having unique nanostructure (composed of nanosheets and nanotubes) provides plenty of channels for ion mobilization and results in excellent electrochemical performance. Moreover, the fabricated HSC (CoS2/MWCNT//polypropylene & KOH//MWCNT) could capable of delivering an ultra-high specific energy of 8.16 W h kg−1 with a specific power of 696 W kg−1 at a specific current of 5 A g−1. These positive features enriched with the prepared nanocomposite (CoS2/MWCNT) may be explored as promising electrode material in next generation supercapacitors.
