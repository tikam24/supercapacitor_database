Lignin, an abundant natural polymer but presently under-utilized, has received much attention for its green/sustainable advantages. Herein, we report a facile method to fabricate lignosulfonate (LS) ionic hydrogels by simple crosslinking with poly (ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether (PEGDGE). The as-obtained LS-PEGDGE hydrogels were comprehensively characterized by mechanical measurements, FT-IR, and SEM. The rich sulfonic and phenolic hydroxyl groups in LS hydrogels play key roles in imparting multifunctional smart properties, such as adhesiveness, conducting, sensing and dye adsorption, as well as superconductive behavior when increasing the moisture content. The hydrogels have a high adsorption capacity for cationic dyes, using methylene blue as a model, reaching 211 mg·g−1. As a moist-induced power generator, the maximum output voltage is 181 mV. The LS-PEGDGE hydrogel-based flexible strain sensors exhibit high sensitivity when detecting human movements. As the hydrogel electrolyte, the assembled supercapacitor shows high specific capacitance of 236.9 F·g−1, with the maximum energy density of 20.61 Wh·kg−1, power density of 2306.4 W·kg−1, and capacitance retention of 92.9% after 10,000 consecutive charge-discharge cycles. Therefore, this multifunctional LS hydrogels may have promising applications in various fields, providing a new platform for the value-added utilization of lignin from industrial waste.
