Crystalline NiMoO4 nanosheets grown on reduced graphene oxide sheets (NiMoO4 NS/rGO) composite was synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. The “sheet on sheet” nanostructures are interconnected each other to form a 3D network structure in the composite, which can provide large surface area and abundant mesopores for the rapid electrons and ions transportation while the composite is used as supercapacitor electrode material. Electrochemical measurements show that NiMoO4 NS/rGO composite exhibits a great value of 1888 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, and still remains as high as 1271 F g−1 at 10 A g−1. Moreover, the capacitance loss of the composite after the electro-activation process is only 5.1% during the rest 2300 discharge cycles.
