In the present work, uniform nanorods-like MoO3 and C/MoO3 nanocomposite were successfully synthesized through a facile hydrothermal method for high-performance electrochemical capacitors. The crystal structure and morphology of the products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The electrochemical properties of the sample were tested by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The C/MoO3 nanocomposite displayed good electrochemical performance as a supercapacitor electrode material. The specific capacitance reached 115 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A g-1 in 6 M KOH solution. The specific capacitance of pure MoO3 electrode only has 59 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A g-1. These results represent that the C/MoO3 nanocomposite is a promising electrode material in Supercapacitors.
