Fe2O3is considered to be a promising negative material for aqueous supercapacitors due to its advantages of low cost, non-toxicity, rich sources and environmental friendliness. However, it also suffers from the disadvantages of low conductivity, unsatisfactory cycling and rate performance. In this paper, N, S codoped-Fe2O3was prepared on carbon fiber paper (CFP) by a hydrothermal method followed calcination process in the presence of thiourea under ambient atmosphere. The results demonstrated that calcination in thiourea didn't change the phase of Fe2O3, but changed its morphology from interconnected structure composed of nanowires to a dense film with porous structure. Due to the improved conductivity and the increased reaction active sites, N, S-Fe2O3not only showed high specific capacitance (473.2 mF/cm2, 2mA/cm2), superior rate performance (85.5%, 2-20 mA/cm2) and good cycling stability (96%, 15 mA/cm2, 10 000 cycles), but also exhibited higher electrochemical reaction reversibility and coulomb efficiency. Finally, asymmetric supercapacitors were assembled employing N, S-Fe2O3and commercial activated carbon as negative and positive electrode, respectively, and the volume specific capacitance was 2.1 F/cm3(lmA/cm2). By connecting two assembled supercapacitors in series, a series of LED lights (rated voltage of 3 V) could be successfully lit up, demonstrating its practical applications.
