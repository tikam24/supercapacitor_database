The ternary MnCoNi layered double hydroxides (MnCoNi-LDH) used in supercapacitors frequently encounters issues in low electronic conductivity and big volume expansion throughout charge–discharge, which compromise cycling stability. Herein, MnCoNi-LDH is effectively produced via the straightforward one-pot hydrothermal method with ZIF-67 as the template, which delivers an ultrahigh specific capacitance performance of 2254 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A/g. More importantly, the capacitance lost is only 8.47 % after 5000 cycles at 10 A/g. The fabricated MnCoNi-LDH consists of the hollow polyhedral nanostructure with interior nanoporous channels and nanosheet on the surface, which supply high specific areas and a huge quantity of redox active sites. It is found the exceptional performance of ternary MnCoNi-LDH is related to its distinctive nanostructure, the synergy effect among metal ions and the enhanced ion transmission speed and the conductivity. Additionally, when the ternary MnCoNi-LDH is employed in a flexible solid-state hybrid supercapacitor, the device has an excellent specific capacitance of 303.08 mF cm−2 at a current density of 1 mA cm−2, a high energy density of 47.42 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 404.1 W kg−1 and retains 96.3 % of capacitance after 5000 cycles.
