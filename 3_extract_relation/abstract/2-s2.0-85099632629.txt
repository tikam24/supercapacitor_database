Micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) are promising miniaturized and compact electrochemical energy storage devices for autonomous smart microelectronics. Unfortunately, it is still a challenge to produce high specific capacitance electrode materials with a technique compatible with micro-fabrication process. Here, on-chip MSCs based on sputtered TiN thin films are reported. Significantly, the surface chemistry and porosity of TiN films are systematically fine-tuned at the nanoscale to achieve high specific capacitances. Solid-state MSCs based on optimized TiN electrodes are fabricated using PVA/KOH as an electrolyte. Superior specific energy and power densities of 36.8 mWh cm−3 and 20.6 W cm−3 are obtained. Furthermore, the capacitance exhibits an outstanding cycling stability over 10,000 cycles. These superior performances together with compatible micro-fabrication process demonstrate TiN films to be suitable electrodes for MSC application. These general findings suggest great promise for improving the electrochemical properties in other material systems and represent a major advance to promote the large-scale development of miniaturized energy storage systems.
