The installation of super capacitor in urban rail transit power supply system can recycle train braking energy and stabilize DC network voltage. Firstly in this paper, the simulation platform of urban rail transit power supply system was established which includes trains and super capacitor energy storage systems. Then the objective function of energy management and capacity configuration optimization of energy storage systems was put forward with consideration of many factors including electricity savings, investment cost and electricity price to calculate the economic efficiency of supercapacitor energy storage system. A novel optimization method that combines simulation platform of urban rail transit power supply system and genetic algorithm was proposed, to realize simultaneous optimization of energy management control parameters and capacity configuration schemes of energy storage systems. Finally, a case study of a metro line was conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed optimization method through simulation comparison, to maximize the economic efficiency of the supercapacitor energy storage system.
