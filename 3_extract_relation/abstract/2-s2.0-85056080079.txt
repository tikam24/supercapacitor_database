In this work, we have synthesized graphene aerogels using natural-drying method and fabricated a compressible all-solid-state supercapacitor, which offers outstanding energy density of 23.08 Wh kg -1 at 240 W kg -1 . We further demonstrate that the device is deformable in squeezed cases with a residual stress effect. Taking advantage of the compressibility and excellent electrochemical performance of the graphene aerogel, we offer a new type of stress sensor called elastic-electrochemical stress sensor. Served as the elastic-electrochemical stress device, the cell demonstrates steady response current toward the external mechanical force by transforming mechanical energy to electrochemical energy. The high-sensitive stress sensor will help us comprehend the interaction principle between electrochemistry and external stress well.
