MXenes are promising supercapacitor electrodes due to their two-dimensional structure and electrochemically active surface. As a member of MXenes, Ti3CNTx is a transition metal carbonitride with a similar structure to Ti3C2Tx, and it is considered to have excellent electrochemical performance. However, the electrochemical performance of Ti3CNTx is usually limited by nanosheet agglomeration and surface terminations the same as that of Ti3C2Tx. In this work, we demonstrated that intercalating K+ and removing surface terminations (-OH, -F) significantly improved the gravimetric capacitance of Ti3CNTx up to 464 F g−1. Furthermore, the introduction of Ag nanowires between Ti3CNTx layers can further enhance the charge transport through Ti3CNTx films, and it revealed a very high gravimetric capacitance of 245 F g−1 even at 2000 mV s−1. The as-assembled all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitors showed an energy density of 6.9 mW h g−1, indicating their promising potential for flexible electronic devices. These results proved that intercalation and surface modification can significantly enhance the electrochemical performance of Ti3CNTx films, promoting the development of Ti3CNTx-based electrodes, which have broad application prospects in flexible supercapacitors, wearable electric devices, and other fields.
