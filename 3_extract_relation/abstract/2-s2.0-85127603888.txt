The compactly stacked layers and the use of binders are detrimental to the rate performance and long cycle stability for V4C3Tx MXene. To solve this problem and add a new member to flexible electrodes, the multi-layered V4C3Tx MXene is delaminated into nanoflakes (d-V4C3Tx) with tetra-n-butylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH) and self-assembled into the flexible film without binder. The d-V4C3Tx film as a negative electrode delivers a high specific capacitance of 292.0 F g-1 (622.4 F cm-3) at 2 mV s-1, remarkable rate performance (86.0% at 200 mV s-1, 78.4% at 500 mV s-1), and the splendid cycle stability (93.1% for 40 000 cycles, 82.9% for 60 000 cycles at 10 A g-1). The excellent electrochemical performance for the d-V4C3Tx film is attributed to the outstanding electrical conductivity (16 465.3 S m-1), and the large interlayer spacing (2.1 nm), as well as the surface capacitive control mechanism. The asymmetric supercapacitor composed of d-V4C3Tx film and activated carbon (AC) also shows high energy and power densities of 22.2 Wh L-1 at 285.3 W L-1. This work provides a novel flexible and more stable film (d-V4C3Tx) electrode with long cycle life for supercapacitors, and further promotes the development for flexible supercapacitors.
