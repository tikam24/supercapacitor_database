Given the negative environment impact of the traditional transportation technologies, a switching to electric vehicles has become a necessity to promote energy efficiency and generate less emissions, noise, and CO2. In fact, due to technological advances in battery technology, several electric mobility solutions were presented by vehicle manufacturers and automobile market. Despite this development, the performance of battery based EVs are still incapable to match ICE vehicles. At present, many promising researches have shown and proven that the integration of hybrid energy storage system (HESS), such as batteries/Ultracapacitor, Batteries/Fuel cells or Fuel cells/Batteries/Supercapacitors, can improve energy efficiency, reliability, aging and degradation of batteries. Therefore, the energy management strategy is an indispensable key to ensure the normal operation of the system and achieve the performance of the HESS and the vehicle. The aim of this paper is to model a multi-level architecture of intelligent energy management strategy for battery/Supercapacitor electric vehicle and simulate two levels of our architecture using MATLAB Simulink.
