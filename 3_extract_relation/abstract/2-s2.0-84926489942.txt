This chapter discusses the mechanisms of charge storage by electrostatic processes and ion transport in the porous texture. The roles of the carbon structures, such as basal/edge planes, pore size, surface area, pore tortuosity, pore regularity, and the surface wettability of pores, are discussed. This chapter covers the fundamental issues why hierarchical carbon materials are needed.
