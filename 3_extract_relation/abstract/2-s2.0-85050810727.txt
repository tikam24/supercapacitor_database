This paper presents an electrode with a core/shell geometry and a unique four-layered porous wrinkled surface for pseudocapacitive supercapacitor applications. To design the electrode, Ni foam was used as a substrate, where the harmonious features of four constituents, ZnO (Z), NiS (N), PEDOT:PSS (P), and MnO2 (M) improved the supercapacitor electrochemical performance by mitigating the drawbacks of each other component. Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge discharge measurements confirmed that the ZNPM hybrid electrode exhibited excellent capacitive properties in 2 M KOH compared to the ZNP, ZN, and solely Z electrodes. The ZNPM electrode showed superior electrochemical capacitive performance and improved electrical conductivity with a high specific capacitance of 2072.52 F g−1 at 5 mA, and a high energy density of 31 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 107 W kg−1. Overall, ZNPM is a promising combination electrode material that can be used in supercapacitors and other electrochemical energy conversion/storage devices.
