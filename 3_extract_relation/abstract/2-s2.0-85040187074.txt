The design of 3-dimensional (3-D) nanostructured materials on the novel current collectors has recently considered as a promising strategy for developing high-performance supercapacitors. Herein, in the first step, a novel 3-D nickel nanocone arrays (NCAs) are synthesized on the surface of nickel plate (NP) by a one-step electrodeposition method without using any template (NCAs-NP). Then, a simple and efficient method is developed for fabricating ternary metal sulfides electrodes based on the electrodeposition of nickel cobalt iron sulfide (Ni-Co-Fe-S) ultrathin nanosheets on the surface of NCAs-NP. Taking advantages of the unique flower like structure of Ni-Co-Fe-S ultrathin nanosheets and cluster structure of the three-dimensional NCAs, the ternary metal sulfide electrode (Ni-Co-Fe-S@NCAs-NP) exhibits high specific capacitances (2159.7 F/g at 7 A/g and 1461 F/g at 35 A/g) with excellent rate capabilities. An asymmetric supercapacitor is fabricated by applying the Ni-Co-Fe-S@NCAs-NP as the positive electrode and reduced graphene oxide coated on the nickel foam (rGO-NF) as the negative electrode, renders an excellent electrochemical performance for practical applications. Our asymmetric Ni-Co-Fe-S@NCAs-NP//rGO-NF supercapacitor showed a high energy density of 35.9 Wh kg− 1 at a power density of 375 W kg− 1 and even at power density of 7500, the energy density is still as high as 6.90 Wh kg− 1.
