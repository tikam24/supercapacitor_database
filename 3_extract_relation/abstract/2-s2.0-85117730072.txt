Supercapacitors (SCs) are easy to use energy storage devices and are in many aspects comparable to batteries. They can be charged by any current limited power source and drive any electrical applications. SCs require, like any other energy storage system, a certain infrastructure in order to store and deliver their energy. In the course of this document, it shall be discussed how the capacitor can be utilized as a simple energy storage device and show how charging as well as operating times can be calculated.
