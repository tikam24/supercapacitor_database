MXene is a novel two-dimensional transition metal carbides or carbonitrides with similar structure to graphene. It can be produced by etching the active metal element from the precursor MAX phase using the hydrochloric acid solution of fluoride salt or hydrofluoric acid solution. The general chemical formula of MXene is Mn+1XnT(n=1, 2, 3â€¦) and T represents the groups(-H, -F or -OH) adhering on the surface. Thanks to the surface groups, MXene has relatively broad application in energy storage. The electrochemical applications of MXene can be optimized by means of surface modification, ion intercalation, increasing MXene crystalline space and improving the ion transport rate. This paper focus on the representative of MXenes, Ti3C2, and reviews its preparation method, theoretical study, and the applications research progress in lithium ion battery, lithium sulfur battery and supercapacitor. The electrochemistry development direction and application of MXene are also prospected.
