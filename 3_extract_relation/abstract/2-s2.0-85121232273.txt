In this work, ZnCo2S4 nanowires (ZnCo2S4 NWs) were synthesized by an easy hydrothermal route. The fabrication procedure approach involved a hydrothermal route fabrication of Zn-Co precursor in isopropanol and glycerol and then sulfidation to gain nanowires-like ZnCo2S4 architecture. The sulfidation content of ZnCo2S4 in Ni foam construction strongly affects the morphological structures and surface chemical behavior of the material, and could significantly enhance electrochemical properties. The ZnCo2S4 NWs exhibited superior a specific capacity of 324 mA h g−1 at 2.0 A g−1 and extraordinary longer-basic cycle stability capabilities (around 9.5% less-loss after continuous cycles of 4000). This literature not only illustrates ZnCo2S4 NWs utilizes as a favoring applicant for SCs but also gives a simplistic and lesser-cost approach for constructing and fabricating other higher performances well-architecture metal-sulfides-basic for electrochemical energy storage.
