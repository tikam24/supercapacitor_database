With the development of graphene research, the three-dimensional graphene monolith (3DGM), which can be prepared by the chemical vapour deposition method (CVD-3DGM) and the self-assembly of reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (RGO-3DGM), has drawn increasing attention because of its properties and application prospects that are better than those of two-dimensional graphene nanosheets. By utilising its excellent electrical property, large BET area and favourable mechanical strength, some research findings on the 3DGM-assisted thermal interface materials, conductive polymers and films, dye-sensitised solar cells and supercapacitors have been reported. In this perspective, we review recent progress in the synthesis and application of 3DGM-based composites and devices. In particular, the advantages of the CVD-3DGM are highlighted after comparing the reports, and the specific reasons are analysed and discussed. Finally, the probable directions of development, research focus and corresponding challenges for the preparation and application of the CVD-3DGM in the future are proposed.
