Initial studies on the fabrication of a new double-layer capacitor based on hydrated ruthenium oxide (RuO2.xH2O) are presented. The electrochemical capacitor cell is based on three designs approaches: active surface enhancement via corrugations, the use of an ultra-thin "self assembled" dielectric implemented with hydrated Ruthenium oxide and activated carbon powders in combination with sulfuric acid and the fusion of both processes. We address the key components of the electrochemical cell (i) packaging,; (ii) the methodology of incorporating sulfuric acid and the various powders, and (iii) the deposition technique for the powder. The powder composition was varied to establish its effect on the overall capacitance. Mixing RuO2.xH2O and AC yielded devices with the greatest capacitance value, whereas devices containing only one of the two components had capacitance values lower by a factor of 10-50. The devices have capacitance values as large as 50 mF/cm2 per plate pair. copyright The Elect rochemical Society.
