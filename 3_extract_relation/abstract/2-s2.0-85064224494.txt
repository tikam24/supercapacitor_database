Great attention has been drawn to flexible and portable electronic devices, so it is important to develop flexible energy-storage devices. In this study, the porous Ni-Co-N nanosheets on flexible graphene paper (GP) are prepared by surface nitridation of NiCo 2 O 4 nanosheets. Compared with NiCo 2 O 4 /GP, Ni 3 N/GP and CoN/GP, Ni-Co-N/GP shows superior performance in terms of specific capacitance of 960 F/g (48.1 mF/cm 2 ) at 4 A/g, rate performance (86% capacitance retention) and cycle life (the capacitance retention reaches 95% over 5000 cycles). The paper-based all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitors (SCs) are manufactured based on Ni-Co-N/GP and chemical oxidized GP (graphene oxide paper, GOP), which exhibits excellent bendability, flexibility, editability. The flexible energy device shows an outstanding specific energy of 4.78 mWh/cm 3 and excellent cycle life (89% capacitance retention after 8000 cycles).
