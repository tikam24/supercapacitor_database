NiCo2O4/CuO-x composite electrode materials were prepared through a simple sol-gel method by using Ni(NO3)2•6H2O, CoCl2•6H2O, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), propylene oxide and CuO as raw materials, and its structures and electrochemical behaviors were investigated by x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) method, respectively. By studying the pseudocapacitance behavior of NiCo2O4/CuO-x prepared with different CuO content, the optimal CuO content was optimized. It is found that NiCo2O4/CuO-20 composite prepared with 20 wt% CuO content exhibit superior electrochemical properties to those prepared at other CuO content. The NiCo2O4/CuO-20 composite presents a high specific capacitance of 1670 F g-1 at 1 A g-1, and over 98.1% of original capacitance is maintained at 4 A g-1 after 1000 cycles, which reveal superior electrochemical performance and excellent cycle stability of NiCo2O4/CuO-20 composite electrode materials, indicating its high potentials for high-performance supercapacitor applications.
