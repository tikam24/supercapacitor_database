Polypyrrole (PPy) based MXene nanocomposite electrode was prepared by intercalating PPy into the layered Ti3C2Tx by a harmonious electrodeposition technique. The enhanced energy storage performance of Ti3C2-PPy is studied both experimentally and by using the first-principles method. The nanotubular flower-like morphology effectively prevents Ti3C2 stacking, resulting in enhanced interlamellar spacings and for fast and precise electrons/ions pathways. Ti3C2-PPy delivers excellent specific capacitance of 474 F g−1 in 1 M H2SO4 at a current density of 1 A g−1. The fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor establishes a gravimetric capacitance of 243 F g−1 with a remarkable rate performance of 98 % across 10000 cycles. To realize better energy storage and safety standards for commercial applications, the quasi-solid-state supercapacitors were fabricated with gel polymer electrolyte. They demonstrated the key performance parameters of high energy density (54.4 Wh Kg−1) and power density (181.5 W kg−1) at an enhanced operating potential window (∼2V). This is the widest potential window reported to date for MXene-based polymeric supercapacitors. The calculated quantum capacitance value follows the experimental trend with a high value of 2104 µFcm−2 at 1.7 V. This asymmetric supercapacitor can power LEDs and establishes its potential to encounter practical applications in energy storage solutions.
