Electrode materials design is the most significant aspect in constructing a supercapacitor device. The evolution of metal nitrides/oxynitrides as supercapacitor electrode is strikingly noticeable today besides prevailing carbon or 2D materials, metal oxides/hydroxides and conducting polymers electrode materials. The theoretically estimated specific capacitance of a nitride-based supercapacitor is 1,560 F g-1. These nanostructures exhibit an excellent capacitive behavior with a specific capacitance of 15–951.3 mF cm-2 or 82–990 F g-1, high energy density (16.5-162 Wh Kg-1) and power density (7.3-54,000 W Kg-1). On this account, supercapacitor performance of metal nitrides/oxynitrides is reviewed exclusively. The major focus of the present review is directed towards state-of-art progress in supercapacitor performance of nitrides/oxynitrides, underlying charge-storage mechanism, important outcomes and their limitations. Finally, we conclude with challenges and prospects of metal nitrides/oxynitrides for supercapacitor electrodes.
