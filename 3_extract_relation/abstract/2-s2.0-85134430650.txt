In this work, a nitrogen-doped lignin-derived hierarchical porous carbon material (LDMCN-700–2) was synthesized by a facile and green strategy using alkali lignin as carbon source, melamine as nitrogen source, and KCl as salt template. The as-prepared LDMCN-700–2 possessed unique structural properties such as a large surface area of 1012.5 m2·g−1, high nitrogen content of 4.5 at%, and hierarchical porous structure with micropores, mesopores and macropores, which endow it with superior electrochemical performance. The electrochemical measurements demonstrated that LDMCN-700 as an electrode material exhibited a high specific capacitance of 245 F·g−1 at 0.5 A·g−1, as well as excellent cycling stability with 95.7 % capacitance retention after 5000th cyclic voltammetry cycles, indicating its great potential for supercapacitors.
