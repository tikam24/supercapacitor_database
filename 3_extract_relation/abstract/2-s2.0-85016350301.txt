Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are proposed as promising building blocks in the construction of advanced energy storage devices. However, the aggregation of CNTs during preparation has largely limited their practical applications. To this end, aligned CNT materials in formats of arrays, sheets, and fibers provide efficient solutions to overcome the property sacrifice, and they have been widely investigated to fabricate high-performance supercapacitors. In this chapter, the synthesis and properties of aligned CNT arrays, sheets, and fibers as well as their hybrids as electrode materials in supercapacitors are carefully described. Planar supercapacitors based on aligned CNT arrays and sheets have been firstly demonstrated. The main efforts are then made to review the recently, widely explored fiber-shaped supercapacitors. Finally, the remaining challenges and future directions of the supercapacitors based on aligned CNT materials are summarized, and the development of such flexible supercapacitors for promising wearable applications is emphasized.
