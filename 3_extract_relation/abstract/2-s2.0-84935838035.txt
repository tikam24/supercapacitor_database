In this study, we present a simple but efficient template carbonization method to prepare nitrogen-doped nanoporous carbon material, in which phenidone acts as carbon/nitrogen sources and Mg(OH)2 as hard template. The results indicate that the carbon-1:1 sample is highly disordered with large BET surface area of 1513 m2g1, high pore volume of 2.2 cm3 g1 and nitrogen content of 3.78%. As a result, it exhibits decent electrochemical behaviors, whose specific capacitance reaches up to 202.0 Fg1 when measured at 1 Ag1 in a three-electrode system. Moreover, azodicarbonamide has been introduced in the process of carbonization to further tailor the porosity of nanoporous carbon, named as the carbon-1:1:1 sample. In consequence, its BET surface area has decreased to be 1261 m2 g1 but the pore volume increased up to 2.8 cm3 g1, together with the large enhancement of nitrogen content up to 7.05%. Besides, it thus delivers a higher specific capacitance of 281.0 Fg1 at 1 Ag1, mostly due to the incremental content of nitrogen species. The proposed Mg(OH)2-assisted template carbonization method has provided an intriguing synthesis approach for N-doped nanoporous carbons, especially the nitrogen improvement simply by the addition of azodicarbonamide.
