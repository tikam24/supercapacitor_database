Rational constructing carbon electrode materials with heteroatoms (eg. N, S, B, F) and high surface area is essencial to the appealing performance of supercapacitor (SC). Here we present a novel fabrication strategy for sandwich-like N, S co-doped three-dimensional (3D) porous graphene aerogels (NSGAs) via one-pot hydrothermal method for high performance SCs materials. The unique advantage of the proposed synthesis strategy is the applications of 2, 5-Dimercapto-1, 3, 4-thiadiazole (DMTD) as bifunctional pillared agents and efficient dopant precursors. The planar DMTD molecules have shown strong supramolecular π-π and H-bonding interactions with graphene oxide (GO), thus avoiding the restacking of graphene sheets and enhancing the doping efficiency and amount of S atoms, which are beneficial to the SC performance of NSGA. The synthesized NSGA samples exhibit the atomic content of S up to 2.39 at.% with surface area at 366.0 m2 g−1, and display a maximum energy density of 10.52 W h kg−1 for assembled symmetric supercapacitor. The relatively high tandem device performance with a remarkable current response, even at 2000 mV s−1, reaches the top level for graphene-based SC system. The proposed simple fabrication strategy and attracting performance of NSGA material shed light on the potential practical applications of graphene-based material as SCs, and the observed structure-function relations also provides physical-chemical insight into the function principle of heteroatom doped graphene in SCs.
