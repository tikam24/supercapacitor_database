Electrochemical capacitors have achieved prodigious attention among energy storage devices due to their simple and efficient storage mechanism, moderate specific energy and power densities which bridge the gap between Li-ion batteries and conventional capacitors. The active material plays a foremost role in the energy storage mechanism of such storage devices. Here, we have developed a porous Nickel oxide (NiO) nest-like particle with a large surface area and used as cathode material for supercapacitor application. The porous NiO electrode exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance with a specific capacity of 422 C g−1 at 1 A g−1 specific current. Moreover, the NiO//AC asymmetric device exhibited higher specific energy of 25 Wh kg−1 at a specific power of 1280 W kg−1 and could maintain more than 50% of specific energy at an extra-high specific power of 19.2 kW kg−1. Surprisingly, the device exhibits an ultra-fast power delivery performance with a considerably lower response time (13 ms). The porous NiO nanonetwork-based electrode manifests a great potential to be an ultra-fast efficient next-generation electrode candidate for electrochemical energy storage devices.
