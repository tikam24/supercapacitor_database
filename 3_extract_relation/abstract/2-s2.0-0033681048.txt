The advancing technology of thin, lightweight, and high power ultracapacitor has been one of the most exciting and important developments in electronic components. The technology provides a new dimension for engineers and designers to manage the power and energy used in electronic products. The batteries will not have to be oversized to accommodate a peak power demand. A combination of battery and ultracapacitor (hybrid power system) can improve the battery capability for power peak and also extend battery lifetime. In this paper, author will present an ultra-thin hydra-amorphous ruthenium oxide ultracapacitor. The unique electrochemical characteristics of ultracapacitor are able to provide a much higher pulse current capability over the battery system. The ultracapacitor with 0.1cm thick, 14cm2 size, and 2.6g weight has the capability to deliver over 30W pulse peak. By combination of ultraeapacitor and battery, the pulse performance of traditional alkaline primary battery can be significantly improved.
