The search for novel nanostructures towards multifunctional applications is the main objective of numerous researches in progress. This review article mainly centres the recent research updates in the synthesis, properties, advantages and applications of polyaniline (PANI) nanofibers (NFs) based on electrospinning technique. Among various nano structured conducting polymers (CPs) based NF architecture, PANI is in spotlight drawing too much attention among the scientific communities owing to the exceptional and enhanced characteristic features. This PANI based NFs were attained from the precursor polymer solution by engaging electrospinning technique has been notorious as a direct and facile route via the utilization of strong electrostatic field. Owing to its excellent physicochemical and electrochemical properties, E-spinning NFs based on polyaniline (PANI) becomes the most important novel material towards the emerging advancements such as NF based supercapacitor, sensor devices, scaffold materials and conductive tissue engineering, water filtration and purification, solar cells and so on. Though, the processability of PANI is quite tough in comparison with other CPs, mostly due to its firm structure of backbone with high conjugation level. To meet the demanding specifications towards the applications, the challenges in the E-spinning of PANI NF were explored and led to the progress in the electrospun based nanocomposites or hybrids and their blends. Thus, to explore more and to ignite the state-of-the-art progress, this review manuscript highlights a short review and understanding on the recent research efforts and escalation in the applications of E-spun PANI NFs in various fields such as supercapacitor, sensor, biomedical, and corrosion applications along with the fundamentals, theory, general working principle, and future prospects and challenges ahead of E-spinning.
