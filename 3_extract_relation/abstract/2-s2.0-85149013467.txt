Owing to the rapid climate change, a high-performance energy storage system (ESS) for efficient energy consumption has been receiving considerable attention. ESS, such as capacitors, usually has issues with the ion diffusion of electrode materials, resulting in a decrease in their capacitance. Notably, appropriate pore diameter and large specific surface area (SSA) may result in an effective ion diffusion. Therefore, graphene and multi-walled carbon nanotube (graphene@MWCNT) hybrid nanoma-terials, with covalent bonds between the graphene and MWCNT, were prepared via an edge-chemistry reaction. The properties of these materials, such as high porosity, large SSA, and high electroconductivity, make them suitable to be used as electrode materials for capacitors. The optimal ratio of graphene to MWCNT can affect the electrochemical performance of the electrode material based on its physical and electrochemical properties. The supercapacitor using optimal graphene-based hybrid electrode material exhibited highest specific capacitance value as 158 F/g and excellent cycle stability.
