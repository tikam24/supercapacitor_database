Recently, three-dimensional nickel foam (3D-Nf) has been increasingly studied; however, further modifications in nanoscale surface modification are necessary for particular applications. In this work, three-dimensional hierarchically porous nanogranular NiS (NiS-3D-Nf) and wrinkleshaped NiS (w-NiS-3D-Nf) structures were fabricated directly on nickel foam by a simple one-step solvothermal process using two different solvents. Several characterization techniques, including X-ray diffraction pattern, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy, were used to characterize the samples’ properties. To prove their applicability, supercapacitor electrodes were tested directly in a three-electrode assembly cell. The resulting w-NiS-3D-Nf electrodes exhibited greater capacitive activity than the NiS-3D-Nf electrodes. The optimized w-NiS-3D-Nf electrodes delivered an excellent specific capacitance of 770 Fg−1, at a current density of 1 Ag−1, compared with the NiS-3D-Nf electrodes (162.0 Fg−1 @ 1 Ag−1 ), with a cyclic stability of over 92.67% capacitance retention after 2200 cycles. The resultant unique structure with integrated hierarchical three-dimensional configuration can not only enhance abundant accessible surface areas but also produce strong adhesion to the 3D-Nf, facilitating the fast transportation of ions and electrons for the electrochemical reaction via the conductive 3D-Nf. This set of results suggests that the modification of 3D-Nf surfaces with a suitable solvent has highly significant effects on morphology, and ultimately, electrochemical performance. Additionally, the current preparation approach is simple and worthwhile, and thus offers great potential for supercapacitor applications.
