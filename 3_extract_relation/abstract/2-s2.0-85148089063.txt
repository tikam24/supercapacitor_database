In this work, an alkali metal cation doped transition metal oxide namely, sodium manganese oxide (NMO) was synthesized by a simple solid state calcination method. The structure, functional group, morphology and elemental composition of the prepared NMO were characterised using XRD, FTIR, SEM-EDAX, TEM and XPS. The electrochemical performance was analysed by CV, GCD and EIS. The specific capacitance of NMO was found to be 151 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g. To enhance the specific capacitance of the synthesised material, CNT was added to NMO and a comparison on the electrochemical studies of NMO/SWCNT and NMO/MWCNT was done. The results show that the NMO/MWCNT exhibits a high specific capacitance of 415 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g with a good rate performance and attains an excellent electrochemical stability of 99% initial capacitance retention and coulombic efficiency of 101% with 10,000 cycles at a current density of 5 A/g. As a whole, these positive results make NMO/MWCNT, as a promising electrode material for supercapacitor. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
