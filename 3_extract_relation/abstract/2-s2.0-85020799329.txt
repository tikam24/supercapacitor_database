Bacterial cellulose (BC) with unique three dimensional multilayer network structure and excellent mechanical strength is used for the substrate of the all-solid-state flexible supercapacitor. The technique was realized by in-situ depositing conductive polymer polyaniline (PANI) on BC, through both peeling off one side of the multilayer PANI/BC composition film and filtrating KOH activated pyrolysis PANI/BC (KPBC) obtained N- and O-enriched carbon powders on the peeling side. The flexible integral electrode-separator supercapacitor device was about 15 μm, which exhibited the well bending and stretching performance. The film supercapacitor also showed excellent cycle life with maximum 28.3 F cm−3 volumetric capacitance, and retains 100% over 2500 charge/discharge cycles at the 0.1 A g−1 current density. In addition, the flexible supercapacitor only indicated 2.48 Ω solution resistances (Rs) at 1 mol PVA/H2SO4 electrolyte. This flexible film supercapacitor has great potential in wearable devices.
