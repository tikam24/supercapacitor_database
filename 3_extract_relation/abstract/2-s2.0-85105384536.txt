The effect of physical activation temperature in the preparation process of activated carbon electrode for supercapacitor application has been analyzed successfully. The activated carbon made from jengkol shell (Pithecellobium jiringa) with a combination of chemical and physical activation. The physical activation temperature varied of 800 째C, 850 째C, and 900 째C. High specific capacitances of activated carbon electrode as high as 220F g-1was found in physical activation temperature of 850 째C. Additionally, physical properties of activated carbon also evaluated such as density, degree of crystallinity, surface morphology and chemical content. These excellent results show great potential for jengkol shell in developing energy storage devices of supercapacitor application.
