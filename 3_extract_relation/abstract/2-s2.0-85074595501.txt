A zinc containing metalâ€“organic gel (Zn-MOG) with embedded free ions, which exhibits self-healing properties, has been synthesized for application in supercapacitors. The activated carbon-based flexible supercapacitor device with the MOG electrolyte has a broad potential window of 2.1 V, with high retention of specific capacitance compared to the traditional polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based gel. The Zn-MOG does not require an additional electrolyte. The sodium and sulphate ions embedded in the MOG are sufficient enough for the charge storage.
