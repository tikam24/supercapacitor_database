Application of power management system (PMS) in microbial fuel cell (MFC) for potential energy harvesting is coming up as an emerging trend for field level applications. Though the energy recovery and environment benefits of MFC are well recognized, still scaling-up challenges are confronted during onsite applications for sufficient power generation. Increasing number of research on PMS in MFC studies reveals incorporation of various power electronic components and different maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm models to boost electricity generation. From the point of stacking-up of MFCs, present review focuses on use of different electronic circuits i.e. DC-DC booster, supercapacitor, Metal- Oxide Semiconductor Field- Effect Transistor (MOSFET), amplifier, transistor, etc. incorporated in PMS. Tracking of maximum power point in MFC has been described using different MPPT algorithms. Some recent field trials are described which emphasize the importance of incorporation of PMS for boosting and storage of electricity generated from MFC. A suitable electrical and hydraulic series parallel connection establishment during stack mode operation of MFC is inevitable to generate desired voltage output. Present review aims towards applications of PMS in MFC for making power output useable in realistic applications. Valuable studies providing useful information, challenges and their probable solutions regarding PMS for stacking of MFC are discussed.
