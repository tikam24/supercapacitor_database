The porous structure and specific surface area (SSA) of porous carbon are important factors affecting the performance of supercapacitors. However, it is still a great challenge to leverage the tradeoff between the SSA and mesopores to achieve both excellent capacitive and rate performance. Herein, we develop a facile pore- regulating strategy to integrate interconnected porous structure, large SSA and suitable mesopore volume in porous carbons. The co-pyrolysis of cotton stalks and oxidized coal can generate more defect sites, which is conducive to form a honeycomb-like morphology and reasonable porous structures in the following activation process. The integration of large SSA (1510 m2 g−1) and abundant mesopore volume (0.24 cm3 g−1) endow the optimal sample with a high capacitance (345 F g−1 @ 1 A/g), superior rate performance (69 % capacitance retention @ 50 A/g), and excellent long cyclic stability in 6 M KOH electrolyte. Moreover, the assembled symmetric supercapacitor exhibits a high energy density of 56 Wh kg−1 @ 741 W kg−1 in EMIM BF4. This work provides a simple strategy to tailor the morphology and structure of coal and biomass-derived porous carbon, and offers new insights into the tradeoff between SSA and mesopores for high performance supercapacitors.
