With the rapid development of flexible and portable microelectronics, the extreme demand for miniaturized, mechanically flexible, and integrated microsystems are strongly stimulated. Here, biomass-derived carbons (BDCs) are prepared by KOH activation using Qamgur precursor, exhibiting three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical porous structure. Benefiting from unobstructed 3D hierarchical porous structure, BDCs provide an excellent specific capacitance of 433 F g−1 and prominent cyclability without capacitance degradation after 50 000 cycles at 50 A g−1. Furthermore, BDC-based planar micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) without metal collector, prepared by mask-assisted coating, exhibit outstanding areal-specific capacitance of 84 mF cm−2 and areal energy density of 10.6 μWh cm−2, exceeding most of the previous carbon-based MSCs. Impressively, the MSCs disclose extraordinary flexibility with capacitance retention of almost 100% under extreme bending state. More importantly, a flexible planar integrated system composed of the MSC and temperature sensor is assembled to efficiently monitor the temperature variation, providing a feasible route for flexible MSC-based functional micro-devices.
