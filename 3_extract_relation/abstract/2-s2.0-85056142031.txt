Ti3C2Tx is one of the typical MXene materials, where Tx stands for various surface terminations (OH, O, and/or F groups). In this paper, the delaminated Ti3C2Tx, referred to as d-Ti3C2Tx, and MnO2 composites were prepared by a simple synthesis method. The substrate of the composite is the conductive d-Ti3C2Tx sheet. The MnO2 was grown on the surface of d-Ti3C2Tx and it can increase the specific capacitance of the composite. At the same time, the d-Ti3C2Tx substrate can provide a carrier for the growth and uniform dispersion of MnO2. Therefore, the d-Ti3C2Tx/MnO2 composite has high specific capacitance and good cycle stability. At a current density of 1 A g−1, the d-Ti3C2Tx/MnO2 composite has a specific capacitance of 242 F g−1, which is three times than that of Ti3C2Tx. The electrode capacitance retention rate can still reach 97% after 5000 cycles of galvanostatic charge and discharge.
