Herein, we have fabricated a flexible solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (FSASCs) with superior performance using CuGa2O4/nickel foam and FeP-rGO/nickel foam electrodes as the positive and negative electrodes respectively. The CuGa2O4/nickel foam electrode presents remarkable electrochemical performance, such as good specific capacitance (SC) of 1210.40 F g−1 with considerable rate capability and significant cycling stability. Furthermore, the FeP-rGO/nickel foam electrode depicts good electrochemical properties containing a high specific capacitance (SC) of 376.50 F g−1 with a good rate capability and remarkable durability. Due to the excellent electrochemical performance of CuGa2O4/nickel foam and FeP-rGO/nickel foam electrodes, the FSASC represents remarkable electrochemical performance such as SC of 202.10 F g−1, an energy density (ED) of 63.15 Wh k g−1. Furthermore, a flexible solid-state symmetric supercapacitor (FSSSC) was assembled using CuGa2O4/nickel foam as positive and negative electrodes, respectively. The FSSSC delivers a high SC of 275.65 F g−1 and good ED of 38.27 Wh kg−1 with excellent durability.
