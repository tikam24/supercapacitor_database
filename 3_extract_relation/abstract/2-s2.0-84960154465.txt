A new nanocomposite was synthesized via deposition of MnO 2 on Nitrogen-doped reduced graphene (MnO 2 /NRGO) by sonochemical method, in which, the particles of manganese oxide were uniformly distributed on NRGO sheets. The structure and morphology of MnO 2 /NRGO nanocomposites are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Raman spectroscopy. The electrochemical supercapacitive performance of the nanocomposite was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), continuous cyclic voltammetry (CCV), galvanostatic charge/discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods. The MnO 2 /NRGO nanocomposite shows enhanced specific capacitance of 522 F g -1 at 2 mV s -1 and its high synergistic effect was compared with MnO 2 /RGO. The high specific capacitance and exceptionally high cyclic stability of MnO 2 /NRGO attributes to the doping of nitrogen and uniform dispersion of MnO 2 particles on NRGO. The CCV showed that the capacity retention for MnO 2 /NRGO and MnO 2 /RGO still maintained at 96.3% and 93% after 4000 CVs. The improved supercapacitive performance enables this nanocomposite as efficient electrode material for supercapacitor electrodes.
