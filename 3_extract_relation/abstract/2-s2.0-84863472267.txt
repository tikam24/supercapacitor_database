We report here, the supercapacitive performance of a novel conducting polymer, namely, poly(5,12-dihydrothieno[3′,4′:2,3][1,4]dioxocino[6, 7-b]quinoxaline) (pTDQ), in an asymmetric n/p type pseudocapacitor cell. This novel polymer is coated on a graphite electrode and used in an asymmetric cell as a p-doped anode against poly(ethylenedioxythiophene) (pEDOT) coated graphite, an n-doped cathode. Supercapacitive performance of the asymmetric pseudocapacitor is evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge techniques in different supporting electrolyte-solvent systems. Performance tests show that this n/p type asymmetric pseudocapacitor has better supercapacitive performance; having the highest specific capacitance value of 213.7 F g -1 in the presence of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (Bu 4NBF 4) as supporting electrolyte. Besides, specific energy value of the asymmetric pseudocapacitor is calculated as 31.7 Wh kg -1. AC impedance spectroscopy results strengthen the supercapacitance value of the asymmetric pseudocapacitor cell and indicate that the pseudocapacitor cell is more suitable for the low frequency range applications. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.
