Enhancing the performance and durability of benchmarked metal catalysts using nanostructured non-metallic materials is an active area of research that is exciting from both a fundamental and an application perspective. The 2D CeO2 nanoflakes are characterized using structural and electrochemical techniques. Galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) revealed that the material delivers a specific capacitance of 1801 F/g at 1 A/g, among the best-reported values for transition and rare earth metal oxide electrode material. Due to its nanoflake-like structure, the sample has a modest surface area (12.6 m2/g). Asymmetric supercapacitor device (CeO2//AC) fabricated delivered an energy density of 57.6 Wh/kg and a power density of 771 W/kg with 83 % capacitance retention after 1000 cycles in 3 M KOH. This study reveals that CeO2 is a promising electrode material for energy storage applications.
