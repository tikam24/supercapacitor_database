Nanostructured carbon materials have shown promising applications for energy storage because of their high capacitive characteristic. However, developing three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical carbon materials with both high compressibility and capacitance is still challenging. Herein, we report the fabrication of hierarchical polypyrrole (PPy)/graphene (reduced graphene oxide (G) and holey reduced graphene oxide (h-G))/melamine composite foam through a simple template method. By systematically optimizing the mass ratios of the G/h-G and the sizes of the PPy nanoparticles (PPy NPs), the as-prepared composite electrode displays a gravimetric capacitance of 422.6 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. Due to the interconnected h-G/G network and elastic melamine foam (MF) skeleton, the as-prepared composite electrode also shows compressible performance, which can be compressed to a strain of 60% and completely recover to its original shape when released. When the composite electrodes are assembled to a compressible supercapacitor which shows a stable capacitance under different compressive strains (0%, 25%, 50% and 75%) and a long-term compression test at 50% strain for 100 cycles. Therefore, the successful preparation of compressible composite electrode should open many opportunities in compressible and durable energy storage devices.
