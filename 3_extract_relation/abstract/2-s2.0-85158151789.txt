In the current work, orange peels were employed to prepare the activated carbon by the carbonization method at low temperature (AC-OP) using the nickel mesh for the first time. Through the use of several depiction techniques, the essential characteristics of the novel AC-OP electrode have been examined. The electrochemical behaviour of the AC-OP's electrode has been assessed. By using the scanning electron microscope, the prepared AC-OP powder was found to exhibit honeycomb shape. The energy gap (E g) is discovered to be 2.06 eV. The electrochemical components of AC-OP powder, which is the primary active ingredient, deposited on nickel mesh act as a current collector. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic and cyclic voltammetric methods are used to analyse nickel mesh electrodes. The hydrogen diffusion co-efficient of AC-OP electrode is found to be 9.30 × 10–5 cm2 s−1. The developed AC-OP electrode's exceptional capacitive potential was confirmed from the galvanostatic charge–discharge tests, favourable for the fabrication of supercapacitors. These cutting-edge effects might also be quantified for the utility of power storage employing reasonably cost carbon resources in many applications for energy storage.
