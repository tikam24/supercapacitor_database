This paper reports the influence of the solvent's properties on the growth mechanism of zinc cobaltite (ZnCo2O4) microstructures and their surface morphologies. We observed that the ZnCo2O4 microstructures (ZCO) offer a large number of interacting sites due to the solvent variation, influencing the phase purity and high crystallinity of the ZnCo2O4, which strongly affects its electrochemical conductivity. ZCO crystals were synthesized separately in water, ethanol, and isopropyl alcohol solvent at 180 °C for 12 h, governing the formation of 2D sheet-like morphology in water (ZCO-DIW), 3D flower-like and peanut-like morphologies in ethanol (ZCO-ETH), and isopropyl alcohol (ZCO-IPA), respectively. The successful formation of ZCO morphologies was confirmed through high-resolution scanning electron microscopy. Concerning the solvent variation, the specific surface area of the three ZCO electrodes varies in ascending order as ZCO-DIW (23.78 m2 g−1) < ZCO-IPA (27.19 m2 g−1) < ZCO-ETH (37.19 m2 g−1). We also proposed a model for this solvent-dependent formation mechanism of three ZCO electrodes via the self-assembly process. The electrochemical performance of the ZCO electrodes exhibits excellent battery-type behavior with a specific capacity of 98.89 mAh g−1 (for ZCO-ETH) owing to the highly porous flower-like morphology. These results revealed a simple and cost-effective synthesis strategy to fabricate micro/nano-structure with diverse morphology for a wide range of interfacial applications.
