The attention to renewable materials is amazingly increased in recent years to decrease environmental pollutions. Zea mays (corn) is one of the most produced plants by humans to provide food and energy. Hence, corn wastes as abundant and low-cost biomass are easily found throughout the world. Tremendous efforts have been accomplished in recent years to fabricate electrochemical energy storage devices (EES) from renewable biomass materials because of increasing attention to the environment. All main parts of EES devices include electrodes, binder, electrolyte, and membrane (separator) can be produced via corn waste biochar and corn derivatives. The low-cost corn-based EES devices not only decrease environmental pollution but also have significant electrochemical properties include specific capacitance and electrochemical durability. This review investigates state-of-the-art development in the corn-based EES devices.
