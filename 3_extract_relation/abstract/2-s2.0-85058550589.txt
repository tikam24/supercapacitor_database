The surging growth of portable and wearable electronics along with increasing demand for electric vehicles has led to an exponential increase in the demand for lightweight, robust power sources with high energy and power density. Here, we demonstrate a single-step conversion process of seaweed Ulva fasciata to interconnected nanoporous carbon. Pyrolysis of marine origin green biomass resulted in inherently heteroatom-doped electrochemically active graphene nanocomposite. The present study outlines a simple and easily scalable electrode material production which resulted in a relatively high and stable specific capacitance through a double-layer charge-storage mechanism. Temperature-dependent morphology and texture variation was observed for the pyrolyzed samples, with best synergy between physical properties and application achieved at 800° C (UF-800). The physical characteristics of electrode material highlights high electrical conductivities of ∼9100mS/m and BET surface area of >376 m2/g. An all-solid supercapacitor device using H3PO4-PVA film as separator-cum-electrolyte and UF-800 as electroactive material exhibited high gravimetric capacitance of >330 F/g with a power density of 10 kW/kg. Furthermore, the symmetrical two electrode supercapacitor demonstrate ideal electrical double layer capacitive behavior stable up to 5000 cycles (97.5% capacitance retention). A high capacitance of ∼200 F/g at 5 A/g with a nominal loss of 2.5% in gravimetric capacitance reflects the cohesiveness of high electrical conductivity of the composite walls and the micro- and nanopores created during pyrolysis.
