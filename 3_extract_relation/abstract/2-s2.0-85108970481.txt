In this article, we incorporated the Metal-organic framework (MOF-5) on NiCo2O4. First, we synthesized the Nickel cobaltite nanoparticles by combustion method. Then incorporated the MOF-5 on NiCo2O4 via the hydrothermal method. NiCo2O4/MOF-5 supported more active sites for ion transportation and storage, improving the specific capacitance of electrode materials. Prepared NiCo2O4/MOF-5 electrode exhibit a good specific capacitance of CP curves shown 357.69F/g at 1A/g and CV curves shown 557.50F/g at 5 mV/s. Thus, the as-prepared NiCo2O4/MOF-5 has a definite advantage for supercapacitor electrode materials. Which proven their promising implications in next-generation high-performance supercapacitors.
