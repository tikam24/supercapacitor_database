With the continuous development of power electronics technology and the large-scale access of new energy power generation, the stable operation of the power grid is facing huge challenges. The MMC energy storage system has attracted more and more attention due to its strong ability to support the grid. However, the MMC energy storage system has a complex structure and contains many devices, and the research on high-performance control technology has always been a difficult point. In response to the above problems, this article proposes a constraint satisfaction model predictive control method for MMC energy storage system based on super capacitor. In the article, the operation mechanism of MMC energy storage system is analyzed, and the discrete domain mathematical model of MMC-ESSC is established. The article studies the prediction method of the future internal and external variables of the system, the rolling optimization mechanism and the method of establishing the objective function, and finally carries on the experiments verification. The analysis of experimental results shows that proposed control technology has high dynamic characteristics and efficiency.
