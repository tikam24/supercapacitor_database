Armoured Fighting Vehicle (AFV) is designed for mobility, firepower and protection. AFV is equipped with high energy power pack for its mobility, which needs a starter motor for starting the same. The starter motor demands a heavy inrush current which will leave a stress on the 24V, 400 Ah VRLA battery bank. Ultra Capacitor (UC) is a capacitor with low energy density and high power density which reduces the stress on batteries. After theoretical studies, the UC was integrated in parallel with the battery bank and tested for its performance. This paper will discuss the details of the configuration, testing and results of the performance of the battery with UC.
