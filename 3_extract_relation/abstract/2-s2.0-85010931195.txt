The Co-Ni mixed oxides/graphene composite has been prepared using the solution based oxidation route. The structures of bare Co-Ni mixed oxides and Co-Ni mixed oxides/graphene composite is clearly studied by X-ray diffraction. The electrochemical properties of Co-Ni mixed oxides/graphene composite are investigated by Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge discharge test. The result shows that, the NiO phase has not been detected in the composite, and the graphene composite delivers a discharge capacity of 353.6 F/g at a current density of 0.32 A g-1.
