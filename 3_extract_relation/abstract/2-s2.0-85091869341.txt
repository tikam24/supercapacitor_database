A facile strategy for synthesizing a highly performing hybrid supercapacitor electrode material by combining ternary doped (binary transition metals in combination with an inorganic acid) polyaniline (PANI) with cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) surfactant-wrapped environment-friendly activated carbon (AC) is reported. The composites were fully characterized and exhibited an excellent specific capacitance of 1250 F/g with a significantly beneficial cyclic stability (87% capability following 1000 cycles). This robustly architectured hybrid composite material further exhibited 85.069 Wh/kg energy density and 1049.991 W/kg output power. Furthermore, the material displayed superior dielectric properties with good crystallinity. The enhanced electrochemical performance achieved for the above hybrid composite is attributed to the structural advantage of its flaky morphology and the effective utilization of good surface span, conductivity, and stability of carbonaceous material in favor of the strong pseudocapacitance of ternary doped polyaniline. All of these results demonstrate that the hybrid composite can be ideal for supercapacitor applications.
