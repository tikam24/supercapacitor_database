3D hierarchical carbon nanocages, a novel carbon-based material, have demonstrated a strong momentum of high rate capability and power density supercapacitors. Herein we report the preparation of 3D carbon nanocage networks by nano coating carbon precursor on flower-like basic magnesium carbonate microspheres combining with in situ MgO template carbonization and KOH treatment. This material features with interconnected 3D network structure, crosslinked carbon nanocages (15–24 nm in size and 2.5–3 nm in shell thickness), high specific surface area (1470–1927 m2 g-1), multiscale pores (macro/meso/micropores) and uniform pore size distribution. Resulting from the multiple synergistic effects of these advantages, the 3D carbon nanocage networks present a remarkably excellent electrochemical performance with a large specific capacitance of 380 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and high rate capability of 82% when increasing the current density up to 50 A g-1 in three-electrode configuration. For HPCNC-700-a symmetrical supercapacitor, the specific capacitance reaches up to 288 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and still maintains at 256 F g-1 at 10 A g-1 with the capacitance retention of 89%.
