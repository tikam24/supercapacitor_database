The flexible nanostructured supercapacitors have gained vast majority of interests during recent years. In this article, flexible supercapacitor electrode based on TiO2/rGO/TiO2 sandwich is fabricated through a facile low cost solution process method based on pre-synthesized vapor assisted GO paper and titania sol. The XRD and FTIR spectroscopy analyses confirm the in-situ reduction of GO paper when faced with the titania sol. The Raman spectroscopy shows the coexistence of titania anatase phase beside rGO layers. Moreover, FESEM analysis demonstrates that the sandwich electrodes are composed of titania and rGO layers with thickness of about 660 nm and 15 Âµm, respectively. The optimum parameter for film deposition is 0.17 M concentration, water to Ti precursor ratio of 4, acid catalyst to Ti precursor ratio of 0.5, and solvent of 1-propanol. The supercapacitor electrode based on this optimum deposited sandwich illustrates capacitance of 83.7 F/g at scan rate of 5 mV/s and appreciable charge-discharge behavior. These hybrid pseudo- and electric double layer capacitance behavior in this supercapacitor not only can dramatically improve the performance of the future energy storage devices but also can be applicable in cost-effective wearable electronics.
