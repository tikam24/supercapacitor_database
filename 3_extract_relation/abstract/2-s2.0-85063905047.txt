To accurately describe the voltage performance of supercapacitor and estimate its energy, an equivalent circuit model with a controlled current source is proposed. First, the self-discharge effect of the supercapacitor is investigated based on experimental analysis at different charge and discharge stages. Furthermore, the controlled current source is utilized to reflect the self-discharge effect of the supercapacitor. The recursive least square method is introduced to identify the model parameters, and the particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted to identify the parameters of the controlled current source at different stages. On this basis, the supercapacitor energy is estimated. Results show that the proposed model and the parameter identification method can effectively reveal the supercapacitor's voltage performance. Moreover, the proposed model provides more accurate energy estimation for the supercapacitor.
