A new type of layered multi-space composite material was synthesized by solvothermal method based on the spindle shape of FeCo-MIL-88 sulfide, nickel sulfide and nickel oxide (Fe.92Co.08S@NiS/NiO). The morphology and structure of the hybrid were studied by SEM, TEM, XRD and XPS. The lamellar structure provided a large gap for effective electron transfer, and the composite showed significant electrochemical properties. This includes excellent specific capacitance (1868 F·g−1 at 1 A·g−1) and significant cycle stability (the specific capacitance remains at 62.5% after 5000 cycles). In addition, when the asymmetric supercapacitor is 251.1 W·kg−1, the energy density is 38.2 Wh·kg−1, and the cycle stability is excellent after 5000 cycles, and the capacity retention rate is 85.3%. The results show that Fe.92Co.08S@NiS/NiO composite electrode has potential application in high performance supercapacitors. This new material has strong competitive potential in high-performance ultracapacitor electrode materials.
