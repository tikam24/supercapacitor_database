Alloying metals change their characteristics significantly. Nanoalloy electrodes are excellent materials for pseudocapacitors, which bridge supercapacitors and batteries. We report an ultra-small bimetallic CoNi nanoalloy functionalized on 2D graphitic nitride (g-C3N4) sheets via hydrogenation. An asymmetric supercapacitor of CoNi@g-C3N4 nanoalloy fabricated with activated carbon nanofiber (ACF) shows a wide potential window of 1.5 V and an excellent life span of 8000 cycles at an ultra-high current density of 15 A g−1. Further, we operated the cell at 2 °C, RT, 50 °C and 65 °C, which shows an enhanced energy density of 26 Wh kg−1 at 50 °C than at a lower temperature (2 °C) of 15 Wh kg−1.
