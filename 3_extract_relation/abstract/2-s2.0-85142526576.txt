The well-designed porous polypyrrole/dicarboxylic acid (PPy/DCA) (0.02) electrodes were successfully synthesized by hydrothermal method. In this study, the interesting structural properties of the synthesized electrodes were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermal gravimetric analysis (TG-DTA), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The scanning electron microscopy results showed that a large number of random pores were formed on the electrode surface during the polymerization of pyrrole. The galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements exhibited a specific capacity of 854.2 F.g−1 at 2.7 A.g−1 with an energy density of 884.4 Wh.kg−1. Further, the supercapacitor electrode showed a good cycling test (87.3%) after 4000 cycles at a current density of 10.0 A.g−1 and wide operating voltage (3.0 V). Our studies suggest that 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid doped-polypyrrole electrodes with interesting structure and easy synthesized method are promising candidates for high-performance supercapacitor devices.
