In In this article, Mn-doped Snx-0MnxS (XMn = 0 â€“ 9 %) were synthesized by solvothermal method and named MN1, MN2, MN3, MN4, MN5 and MN6 nanoparticles (NPs), respectively. The X-ray diffraction confirmed the single-phase orthorhombic crystal structure of MN1, MN2, MN3, MN4, MN5 and MN6 NPs. The FT-IR results showed a slight shift of the Sn-S stretching vibration towards the lower wavenumber from MN2 to MN5 NPs. The ball-like spherical shapes were observed in SEM and TEM images. The XPS spectrum of MN2 NPs confirms the binding energies of Sn, S, and Mn. EDX spectrum confirms the Sn, S and Mn elements in different ratios. To explore potential applications for supercapacitors (SCs), the nanospheres of MN1, MN2, MN3, MN4 and MN5 electrodes were used to check their Cyclic voltammograms (CV) and Galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCDs) measurements in a three electrode system in an aqueous solution of 2 M KOH. The increase in the specific capacitance values of MN1 electrode from 9 to 30 (F/g) with Mn dopant ratifies that external impurities have improved the electrochemical properties of pure SnS NPs and becomes an alternative source for energy storage devices. The magnetic performance recorded by VSM measurements demonstrated room temperature (RT) ferromagnetism and doping Mn ions induces alteration of ferromagnetism and therefore suggests potential applications in the data storage devices.
