Nowadays, phosphorus compounds, like metal phosphates and phosphonates have attained considerable attention as electrode materials for energy storage devices i.e., supercapacitors (SCs) and solar cells, etc., because of their high porosity, enlarged surface area, suitable pore size, well-regulated structural stability, excellent electrochemical reversibility, and rich active sites. Porous metal phosphates/phosphonates compounds are the most explored and investigated trendsetter electrode materials owing to their non-toxic, light atom weight, rich covalent states, environmental-friendly, and low-cost nature. These electrode schemes show much good performances (i.e., high specific capacitance, extraordinary energy density, long chargeâ€“discharge cycle life, and improved power density). Herein, we have focused on the topical progress and development of metal phosphates/phosphonates by concentrating on their beneficial utilization and prospective applications for the next generation as a novel class of electrode materials in SCs. Methodologies and the modified fabrication techniques to bring out the best merits of synthesized metal phosphates/phosphonates are focused, along with the technical and systematic perceptions are elaborated, as such analysis sturdily influences the electro-chemical energy storing abilities of the devices. Specific considerations have been put to such hybrid-kind of materials, where robust synergistic properties occur. Finally, the forthcoming perceptions and challenges for the metal phosphates/phosphonates are projected and discussed.
