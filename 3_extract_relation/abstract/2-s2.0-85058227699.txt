Supercapacitors are consider superior than batteries in terms of cycle life and power delivery which make them more attractive in many applications. Commercially available supercapacitor mostly rely on carbon material which have low capacitance values as compared to nano or micro metal oxides structures. Among metal oxides, nickel oxides with different structures are widely under investigation, but still controlling over the structure is not addressed for supercapacitor application. In this study well controlled one dimensional nano structures were synthesized by using alumina template. Most importantly, full utilization of alumina template was carried out by optimizing growth time of the deposition of nickel wires in 1-D nano-channels of alumina. As prepared nickel nanowires were annealed in air and tested as supercapacitor electrode in potassium hydroxide electrolyte solution. Specific capacitance was calculated to be 380 F/g by cyclic voltammetry at scan rate of 2 mV/s.
