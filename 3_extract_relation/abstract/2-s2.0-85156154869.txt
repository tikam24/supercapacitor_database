In this study, a graphene oxide/zinc oxide (GO/ZnO) composite was synthesized by the one-pot hydrothermal technique using various GO/ZnO ratio compositions. These were characterised by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy. The findings reveal that the GO/ZnO composite has three different micromorphologies: ZnO-nanorods (ZnO-NRs) were embedded and agglomerated over the GO surface; ZnO-microrods (ZnO-uRs) adhered to and separated on the GO surface; and GO was coated by ZnO at 1:1, 1:2 and 1:8 ratios. In addition, the electrochemical performance of the synthesized GO/ZnO composites was investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV). The results show that the embedded and agglomerate of ZnO-NRs over the GO surface have the best performance, indicated by a larger CV curve area and higher specific capacitance than the GO and other GO/ZnO composites. The results indicate that the incorporation and insertion of GO and ZnO NRs have an effective reversible nature and are promising electrode materials for supercapacitor applications
