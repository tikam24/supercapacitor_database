Ultracapacitor storage system can achieve good effect of energy saving and voltage stabilization in urban mass transit system, the paper analyze the characteristics of voltage limiting when the vehicle is regenerative braking firstly, then the characteristic of 24 pulse rectifier is analyzed too. On this basis the selected method of voltage threshold of charging and discharging is discussed which is based on optimal energy saving, then propose the control strategy of UCESS (Ultracapacitor Storage System) based on dynamic voltage threshold. In the end, the control strategy is verified through simulation and experiment.
