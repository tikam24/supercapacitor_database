The present study addresses a cost effective method for fabricating high performance and flexible supercapacitor based on the transition metel oxides of Mn3O4 thin films. The Mn3O4 prepared by SILAR method at different cycles such as 25, 50, 75 and 100 cycles. The prepared Mn3O4 thin films were characterized by means of structural, morphological and electrochemical studies. The structural studies of X-ray diffraction (XRD) reveal that 75 cycles have good crystalline nature with tetrahedral structure. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) indicates the functional group of Mn-O. Raman spectra indicate the formation of Mn3O4 thin films. SEM analysis depicted that Mn3O4 thin films have a rod-like structure. TEM images show the SAED pattern and lattice fringes of Mn3O4. The electrochemical measurements of CV, GCD and impedance measurements are investigated using 1M Na2SO4 electrolyte. In the electrochemical measurement Mn3O4 thin films exhibit the maximum specific capacitance value of 295 Fg-1 at the scan rate of 2 mVs-1.
