The effect of co-doping and line-doping of N/P/S and heavy metals (TMs, Ti, V, Fe, Ni) in stanene on the geometric structure, electronic behaviors, and quantum capacitance was systematically studied using density functional theory (DFT). The calculated results suggested that the line-doping enlarged the quantum capacitance (CQ) of stanene more effectively than that of co-doping. The electron density of states indicated the increase of CQ was attributed to the hybridization of TM-dopant and sn-atoms around the Fermi level. However, the performance of quantum capacitance of doped-stanene was at a disadvantage to that of doped-graphene. We hope our results give further insights into the improvement of CQ of stanene-based supercapacitors.
