In the distribution network, intermittent loads such as fish pond and water pump can cause power peak-valley difference up to about 10 times, which affects the safe operation of distribution network. A HESS(Hybrid Energy Storage System) containing power-type and energy-type energy storage devices can be used to suppress power fluctuations of intermittent load. Therefore, the frequency division and capacity deter-mination technology in the design process of HESS is mainly studied. The characteristics of intermittent load are analyzed in frequency domain by using the combination method of empirical mode decomposition and Hilbert spectrum transformation. According to the principle of least energy aliasing, the parts of intermittent load responded by the supercapacitor and the battery respectively are determined. The rated power and capacity of HESS are determined under the charging and discharging constraints of energy storage devices. The optimization model of HESS frequency division and capacity determination including capacity cost and power cost is established, and the genetic algorithm is used to optimize the model, obtaining the optimal capacity configuration of HESS. Based on a practical example, the simulative results verify the effec-tiveness of the proposed method.
