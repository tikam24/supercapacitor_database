The present discussion shows a perspective about using graphite as a current collector in order to achieve high energy density in a symmetric supercapacitor system. Several electrochemical modes (such as rest potential analysis, CV, PEIS, GCPL) were carried out to evaluate the electrochemical characteristics of graphite in aqueous 6 mol/L KOH. And, the resulting performance was compared to an another conventional current collector system based on nickel-stainless steel. Interestingly, widening of cell voltage was observed for graphite when compared to nickel-stainless steel. The discussion reveals the reasonable influences and validations of widening in cell voltage towards the values in energy densities. This perspective also highlights some issues related to carbon (graphite) current collectors and encloses with some promising strategies in overcoming these issues, not limiting the domain of application (either micro or macro supercapacitor devices).
