Supercapacitors are important energy storage systems that need to be investigated for next-generation clean energy continuity, but their capacitance, energy densities, and discharge times need to be improved with a suitable electrode material. Herein, the galvanostatic electrodeposition method for supercapacitors has successfully synthesized copper-based electrodes containing separately S-, N-, and Cl-doped GO. The electrodes offer the perfect surface for enhancing the specific surface area and providing electrically active fields for the Faraday reaction. The Cl-GO@CuO/Cu2O electrode shows a maximum capacity of 577 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1. In addition, the Cl-GO@CuO/Cu2O symmetric supercapacitor achieved a maximum energy density of 25.3 Wh kg−1 and maximum power density of 700.0 W kg−1. With capacitance retention of 97.07%, the device exhibits stability for up to 2000 cycles.
