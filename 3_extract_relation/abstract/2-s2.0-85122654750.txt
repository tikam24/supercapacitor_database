The ever-increasing need for small and lightweight power sources for use in portable or wearable electronic devices has spurred the development of supercapacitors as a promising energy storage and conversion system. In this work, a simple, facile and easy-to-practice method has been developed to employ carbon paper (CP) as the support to coat molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and graphene oxide (GO), followed by electrodeposition of polyaniline (PANI) to render CP/MoS2-GO-PANI. The preparation parameters, such as amounts of MoS2, GO and number of aniline electropolymerization cycles, have been optimized to render CP/MoS2-GO-PANI the best capacitive performance. The as-prepared optimal CP/MoS2-GO-PANI is characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The supercapacitive properties of CP/MoS2-GO-PANI as an electrode have been evaluated electrochemically via cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy testing. CP/MoS2-GO-PANI delivers a specific capacitance of 255.1 F g-1 at 1.0 A g-1 and exhibits excellent rate capability under larger current densities. Moreover, a symmetrical supercapacitor is assembled and three are connected in series to power a light-emitting diode for âˆ¼15 min, demonstrating the promising application potential of CP/MoS2-GO-PANI-based supercapacitor.
