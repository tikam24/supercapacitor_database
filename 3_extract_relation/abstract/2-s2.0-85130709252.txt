Co3O4 nanomaterials as electrodes have been studied widely in the past decade due to their unique structural characteristics. However, their performance does not yet reach the level required for practical applications. It is, nevertheless, an effective strategy to synthesize hybrid electrode materials with high energy density. Herein we prepare Co3O4@NiMoO4 nanowires by a two-step hydrothermal method. The as-obtained sample can be directly used as cathode material of supercapacitors; with specific capacitance of 600 C/g at 1 A/g. An assembled capacitor delivers an energy density of 36.1 Wh/kg at 2700 W/kg, and retains 98.2% of the initial capacity after 8000 cycles. Graphical Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
