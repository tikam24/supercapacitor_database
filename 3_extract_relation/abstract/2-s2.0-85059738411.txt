Recently, because of excellent electrical conductivities and many active sites, transition metal sulfides have been utilized as efficient electrodes for supercapacitors. Herein, we synthesize hierarchical MoS 2 /Ni 3 S 2 structures grown on nickel foam by a facile one-pot hydrothermal process. The as-fabricated asymmetric hybrid capacitor based on hierarchical MoS 2 /Ni 3 S 2 electrode exhibit a specific capacitance of âˆ¼1.033 C/cm 2 at 1 mA/cm 2 . Furthermore, the hybrid capacitor unveils an energy density of 35.93 mWh/cm 3 at a power density of 1064.76 mW/cm 3 . The observed results clearly revealed that the synthesized MoS 2 /Ni 3 S 2 structure might be used as potential electrode material for future energy storage devices.
