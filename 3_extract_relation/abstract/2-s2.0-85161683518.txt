The presence of organic electrolytes in typical liquid supercapacitors ultimately results in inadequate safety and poor flexibility, which limits the development and application of supercapacitors. Thus, we developed an easy-to-prepare ion-gel supercapacitor with strong flame-retardant properties, thermal stability, flexibility, and good electrochemical characteristics. Specifically, this ion-gel supercapacitor provides excellent performance by using the in situ cross-linking of ion-gel electrolytes on electrodes. The introduction of ether-containing flexible chain segments to the ion-gel electrolyte results in a high ionic conductivity (6.5 × 10−3 S cm−1) at an ambient temperature, and the in situ cross-linking results in a tight interfacial contact between the electrolyte and electrode. The ion-gel supercapacitor retains a stable electrochemical performance while bending due to the tight interfacial contact and excellent mechanical characteristics. Furthermore, incorporating the diazonaphthone structure in the cross-linked electrolyte renders the ion-gel electrolyte excellent flame-retardant properties and thermal stability, allowing it to sustain dimensional stability at 150°C for 30 min. The supercapacitor with the optimized ion-gel electrolyte has a specific capacity of 105 F g−1 and an energy density of 41.6 W h kg−1. The results of this study provide a practical method for preparing and optimizing ion-gel cross-linked electrolytes. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
