The metal oxide nanostructures with high surface-to-volume ratio have been achieved using the Deinococcus radiodurans bacteria. In particular, the morphological properties of surface-layer proteins make them an ideal type of matrix for biotemplating the direct chemical synthesis of nanostructures. Surface properties of the metal-oxide nanostructures were investigated by electron microscopy. The surface area of that was also studied by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis method. The materials were used at the construction of supercapacitor as electrode active materials.
