Birnessite-type MnO 2/activated carbon nanocomposites have been synthesized by directly reducing KMnO 4 with activated carbon in an aqueous solution. It is found that the morphologies of MnO 2 grown on activated carbon can be tailored by varying the reaction ratio of activated carbon and KMnO 4. An asymmetric supercapacitor with high energy density was fabricated by using MnO 2/activated carbon (MnO 2/AC) nanocomposite as positive electrode and activated carbon as negative electrode in 1 M Na 2SO 4 aqueous electrolyte. The asymmetric supercapacitor can be cycled reversibly in the cell voltage of 0-2 V, and delivers a specific capacitance of 50.6 F g -1 and a maximum energy density of 28.1 Wh kg -1 (based on the total mass of active electrode materials of 9.4 mg), which is much higher than that of MnO 2/AC symmetric supercapacitor (9.7 Wh kg -1).
