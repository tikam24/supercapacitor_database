The development of efficient materials for the generation and storage of renewable energy is now an urgent task for future energy demand. In this report, molybdenum disulphide hollow sphere (MoS2-HS) and its reduced graphene oxide hybrid (rGO/MoS2-S) have been synthesized and explored for energy generation and storage applications. The surface morphology, crystallinity and elemental composition of the as-synthesized materials have been thoroughly analysed. Inspired by the fascinating morphology of the MoS2-HS and rGO/MoS2-S materials, the electrochemical performance towards hydrogen evolution and supercapacitor has been demonstrated. The rGO/MoS2-S shows enhanced gravimetric capacitance values (318 ± 14 Fg-1) with higher specific energy/power outputs (44.1 ± 2.1 Whkg-1 and 159.16 ± 7.0 Wkg-1) and better cyclic performances (82 ± 0.95% even after 5000 cycles). Further, a prototype of the supercapacitor in a coin cell configuration has been fabricated and demonstrated towards powering a LED. The unique balance of exposed edge site and electrical conductivity of rGO/MoS2-S shows remarkably superior HER performances with lower onset over potential (0.16 ± 0.05 V), lower Tafel slope (75 ± 4 mVdec-1), higher exchange current density (0.072 ± 0.023 mAcm-2) and higher TOF (1.47 ± 0.085 s-1) values. The dual performance of the rGO/MoS2-S substantiates the promising application for hydrogen generation and supercapacitor application of interest.
