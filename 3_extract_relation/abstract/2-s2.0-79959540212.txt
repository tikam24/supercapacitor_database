Simple and inexpensive electrodeposition method for the synthesis of polypyrrole (PPy) nanobricks has been reported. These PPy nanobricks are characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Polypyrrole nanobricks exhibit amorphous nature as confirmed from XRD study. Based on SEM and TEM analysis, the formation of the spherical bunches of PPy nanobricks with average size of about 20-30 nm are inferred. The electrochemical performance of PPy electrode was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge techniques. A high specific capacitance of 476 F·g-1 was obtained within the potential range of -0.4 to 0.6 V in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. Moreover, PPy electrode exhibited high discharge/ charge efficiency of 89%. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
