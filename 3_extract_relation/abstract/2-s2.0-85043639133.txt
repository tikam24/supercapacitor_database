An electrode of molybdenum nitride intermetallic material has been synthesized which possesses satisfying pseudo-capacitance of 171 F gâˆ’1, outstanding rate capabilities, and excellent cycling stabilities in acid electrolyte. Based on morphological characteristics and electrochemical analyses, the novel structure may offer more nano-channels and improved diffusion of electrolyte ions, which can promote the electrochemical performance. In addition, the Mo2N//AC asymmetric supercapacitor has been assembled at cell voltages between 0 and 1.6 V, exhibiting excellent cycling stability and stable energy and power characteristics, which reveals that such an intermetallic is promising in electrochemical energy storage applications.
