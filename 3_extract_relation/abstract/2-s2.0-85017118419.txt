Energy storage systems are generally required for guaranteeing power supply stability and sustainability aiming at independent Photovoltaic, PV, power generation system. The system needs to absorb pulse power issued by photovoltaic cells for inhibiting DC bus voltage fluctuation and meeting the needs of providing load with short-term high power. A super capacitor is characterized by high power density and long cycle life, which is very suitable for combining it with battery for large energy density for jointly forming energy storage part of independent photovoltaic power generation system. In this paper, a mathematical model with parallel connection of battery and super capacitor is developed. Independent photovoltaic system structure with battery hybrid energy storage and super capacitor is constructed. A control strategy is then proposed for a hybrid energy storage by super capacitor and battery. The simulation experimental results show that hybrid energy storage mode by battery and super capacitor can improve the system on load, reduce charge and discharge cycle frequency, and prolong service life of battery.
