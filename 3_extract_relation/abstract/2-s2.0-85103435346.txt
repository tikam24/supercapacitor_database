Cobalt sulfide is favorable for supercapacitors, but its application is inhibited by the inherent slow charge transfer kinetics and poor stability in alkaline solution. Herein, zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF)-derived Co3S4 nanoplate arrays (NPAs) decorated with CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs) grown on Ni foam have been developed. The obtained Co3S4/CeO2-NPAs display a 2D leaf-like nanoplate morphology (average thickness of nearly 230 nm) with a large amount of oxygen vacancies and exhibits remarkably boosted specific capacity/capacitance, i.e., 1155.8 C/g (2408 F/g) at 0.5 A/g with a notable rate capability (76.5% at 10 A/g), compared to Co3S4-NPAs or CeO2 NPs. More importantly, a two-electrode cell comprising the Co3S4/CeO2-NPAs and an activated carbon electrode displays a high energy density of 45.4 Wh/kg (at a power density of 850 W/kg) with decent long-term durability. Furthermore, a red light-emitting diode can be lighted up for 10 min by two charged cells, showing great prospect of Co3S4/CeO2-NPAs. The outstanding electrochemical properties of the Co3S4/CeO2-NPAs are mainly attributed to the 2D nanoplate morphology with much accessible active sites and the introduction of CeO2 NPs. The Co3S4/CeO2-rich interfaces promote electron transfer between Co3S4 and CeO2. The abundant oxygen vacancies adhere to the surface of Co3S4 and can enhance the electronic conductivity and the capture of OH-. In addition, the CeO2 layer can protect the Co3S4-NPAs from corrosion by the KOH electrolyte during the electrochemical process. Therefore, the electrode developed by this work has great potential in electrochemical applications.
