Wearable electronic devices represent a paradigm change in consumer electronics, on-body sensing, artificial skins, and wearable communication and entertainment. Because all these electronic devices require energy to operate, wearable energy systems are an integral part of wearable devices. Essentially, the electrodes and other components present in these energy devices should be mechanically strong, flexible, lightweight, and comfortable to the user. Presented here is a critical review of those materials and devices developed for energy conversion and storage applications with an objective to be used in wearable devices. The focus is mainly on the advances made in the field of solar cells, triboelectric generators, Li-ion batteries, and supercapacitors for wearable device development. As these devices need to be attached/integrated with the fabric, the discussion is limited to devices made in the form of ribbons, filaments, and fibers. Some of the important challenges and future directions to be pursued are also highlighted.
