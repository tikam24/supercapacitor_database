The porous structure of electrode materials was studied and an experimental analysis of the role of macropores in the electrodes of model double layer supercapacitors was carried out. It is shown that the excess value of the volume of macropores in the electrodes plays a negative role and, on the whole, in a complex manner, decreases the specific electrochemical characteristics of these devices. As a result of the research, high-efficiency activated carbons from wood waste, designed for use in supercapacitors, have been created. Correlations have been established between the parameters of the regime of thermochemical activation of wood, the porous structure of synthesized activated carbons and electrodes based on them and the specific characteristics of supercapacitors.
