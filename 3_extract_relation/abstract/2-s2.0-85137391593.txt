To achieve lithium ion-based energy storage devices having high power densities and stabilities, the use of a low-viscosity and low-dielectric-constant solvent [such as dimethyl carbonate (DMC)] as well as a chemically stable BF4-based salt (such as LiBF4 or quaternary ammonium salts [spiro-(1,1)-bipyrrolidinium tetrafluoroborate (SBPBF4))] is promising for application in next-generation electrolytes. However, these combinations are impractical for several reasons, including the low ionic conductivity of LiBF4/DMC and the phase separation of SBPBF4/DMC systems. Thus, we developed a DMC-based dual-cation system (1 M LiBF4 + 1 M SBPBF4/DMC) possessing a higher ionic conductivity (5.7 mS cm-1) than that of single-cation systems (1 M LiBF4/DMC, 0.5 mS cm-1) and realizing a stable single-phase solution. Raman measurements suggest that the dual-cation system constitutes one DMC and two or three BF4- complexes (not neutral-charged states), which should result in high ionic conductivity. Furthermore, the DMC-based dual-cation system exhibited a higher power performance in a Li4Ti5O12//activated carbon hybrid capacitor than the single-cation system (88 and 13% capacity retention at 50 mA cm-2, respectively) and demonstrated high Li+ conductivity (dual-cation: 1.6 mS cm-1, single-cation: 0.2 mS cm-1). Therefore, the dual-cation strategy could aid the development of diverse electrolyte combinations involving salts and solvents that have been considered impracticable.
