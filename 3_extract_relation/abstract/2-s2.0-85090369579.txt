Supercapacitors are the most promising energy storage devices that bridge the gap between capacitors and batteries. They can reach energy density close to the batteries, and power density close to the conventional capacitors. Several types of researches have been carried out in the field of supercapacitors for the development of promising electrodes, electrolytes, separators, current collectors as well as device fabrications to get a breakthrough in energy storage systems with diverse applications. This chapter provides the trend of supercapacitor electrodes made of carbon nanofibers, carbon nanotubes, graphene/reduced graphene oxide, activated carbon, transition metal oxides, conducting polymers and their composites concerning specific capacitance, and cycle life. The design and flexibility of electrode material has promoted the supercapacitor to design bendable, lightweight, miniaturized (micro), planar, flow, shape memory, piezoelectric, self-healing, and multifunctional energy storage devices, which suggest the near future demand of supercapacitor over a wide range of applications. The chapter is also ended with several concluding marks.
