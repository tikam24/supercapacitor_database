A layer of MnO2 was loaded between the SnO2/Ti substrate and the layer of PANI via a potentiodynamic electrodeposition. Electrochemical tests such as cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge were applied to investigate the performance of the electrodes. The morphologies of the electrodes were also observed to identify the effect of the MnO2 layer. The specific capacitance of PANI with MnO2 reached to 601.48 F g-1 at a current density of 0.1 mA cm -2, which is 1.69 times as that of PANI electrodes without MnO 2 layer. This gratifying result may due to the synergistic effect between MnO2 layer and PANI. Â© (2011) Trans Tech Publications.
