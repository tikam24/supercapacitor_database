A supercapacitor with graphene-based electrodes was found to exhibit a specific energy density of 85.6 Wh/kg at room temperature and 136 Wh/kg at 80 °C (all based on the total electrode weight), measured at a current density of 1 A/g. These energy density values are comparable to that of the Ni metal hydride battery, but the supercapacitor can be charged or discharged in seconds or minutes. The key to success was the ability to make full utilization of the highest intrinsic surface capacitance and specific surface area of single-layer graphene by preparing curved graphene sheets that will not restack face-to-face. The curved morphology enables the formation of mesopores accessible to and wettable by environmentally benign ionic liquids capable of operating at a voltage >4 V. © 2010 American Chemical Society.
