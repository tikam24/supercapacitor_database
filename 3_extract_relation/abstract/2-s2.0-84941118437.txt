A conceptually new all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor based on atomically thin sheets is presented which offers the opportunity to optimize supercapacitor properties on an atomic level. As a prototype, β-Co(OH)2 single layers with five-atoms layer thickness were synthesized through an oriented-attachment strategy. The increased density-of-states and 100 % exposed hydrogen atoms endow the β-Co(OH)2 single-layers-based electrode with a large capacitance of 2028 F g-1. The corresponding all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor achieves a high cell voltage of 1.8 V and an exceptional energy density of 98.9 Wh kg-1 at an ultrahigh power density of 17 981 W kg-1. Also, this integrated nanodevice exhibits excellent cyclability with 93.2 % capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles, holding great promise for constructing high-energy storage nanodevices. An atomically thin β-Co(OH)2 sheet electrode was used to fabricate an all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor with high energy density. The β-Co(OH)2 layers are characterized by 100 % exposed hydrogen atoms, thus facilitating efficient Faradaic redox reactions. The energy density of 98.9 Wh kg-1 can compete with the world's highest energy density for supercapacitors.
