α-MnMoO 4 nanorods were prepared on conducting glass substrate via sol-gel spin coating method at the optimum doping level. The effect of electrolyte on the pseudocapacitance behavior of the α-MnMoO 4 nanorods was studied using para toluene sulfonic acid (p-TSA), sulfuric acid (H 2SO 4) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) as electrolytes. X-ray diffraction analysis reveals the formation of α-MnMoO 4 in monoclinic phase. FTIR spectra contain vibrational bands associated with MoO, M-O and Mo-O-Mo bonds. SEM image reveals the formation of nanorods. Supercapacitor behavior has been studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis. α-MnMoO 4 nanorods exhibit maximum specific capacitance of 998 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV/s in H 2SO 4 electrolyte while a specific capacitance of 784 F/g and 530 F/g have been obtained using p-TSA and HCl electrolytes, respectively. At higher scan rates p-TSA electrolyte exhibits superior capacitive behavior than H 2SO 4. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
