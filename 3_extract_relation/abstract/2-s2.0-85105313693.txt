This chapter includes the synthesis of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and its applications in the field of energy. rGO has gained fame in the scientific community because it has properties similar to graphene and can be easily manufactured in large scale. rGO is synthesized by reduction of graphene oxide (GO) using simple and efficient techniques like thermal, chemical, electrochemical and hydrothermal. rGO is used as electrode, hole transport layer as well as an electron transport layer in organic solar cells. It is also used as counter electrode in dye-sensitized solar cells. Additionally, rGO serves as electrode material for supercapacitor devices exhibiting high specific capacitance and cyclic stability values.
