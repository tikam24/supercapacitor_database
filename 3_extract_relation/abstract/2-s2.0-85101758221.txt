Vertically aligned MoS2 nanosheet-polypyrrole (PPy) composites on reduced oxygen graphene (rGO) are fabricated by a one-step hydrothermal strategy (MP-rGO). The ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets mixed with PPy lamellas are well coated on the surface of rGO to form a ternary nanostructure. PPy lamellas are formed on rGO with MoS2 nanosheets by a redox reaction between ammonium tetrathiomolybdate and pyrrole. The conductivity of MoS2 was effectively improved by using PPy and rGO, and the MoS2/PPy (MP) nanohybrid endows MoS2 low crystalline and PPy amorphous. The MP-rGO electrode exhibits a specific capacitance of 1942 F g-1 (or 215.8 mA h g-1) at a density of 1 A g-1 and a satisfactory cycling stability. The MP-rGO//AC asymmetric supercapacitor has been assembled and exhibits a high energy density of 39.1 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 0.70 kW kg-1, which confirms its potential application in the energy storage.
