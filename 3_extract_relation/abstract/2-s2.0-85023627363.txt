The need for alternative and improved material for new energy storage method has become necessary. This can be achieved through the fabrication of biopolymer composites to achieve large surface area which enhances the energy storage potentials and increases the advancements in supercapacitor application. The development of the biopolymers and their wide applications which include military, automobile, electronics, etc., require deeper investigation. This chapter addresses different biopolymer composites, their fabrication and applications in supercapacitor as energy storage device. In addition to description of the basic supercapacitor operation, this chapter attempts to provide a detailed study of different biopolymer composites, their fabrication and application in supercapacitors, and electronics.
