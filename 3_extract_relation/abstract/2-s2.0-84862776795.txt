Highly corrugated graphene sheets (HCGS) have been prepared by a rapid, low cost and scalable approach through the thermal reduction of graphite oxide at 900 °C followed by rapid cooling using liquid nitrogen. The wrinkling of the graphene sheets can significantly prevent them from agglomerating and restacking with one another face to face and thus increase the electrolyte-accessible surface area. The maximum specific capacitance of 349 F g -1 at 2 mV s -1 is obtained for the HCGS electrode in 6 M KOH aqueous solution. Additionally, the electrode shows excellent electrochemical stability along with an approximately 8.0% increase of the initial specific capacitance after 5000 cycle tests. These features make the present HCGS material a quite promising alternative for next generation of high-performance supercapacitors. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
