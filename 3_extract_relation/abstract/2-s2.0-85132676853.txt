Purpose: The purpose of this paper is the investigation of a new coordinated switching strategy to improve the transient performance of a fuel cell (FC)- supercapacitor (SC) electric vehicle. The proposed switching strategy protects FCs from large currents drawn during abrupt power variations. Furthermore, it compensates the poor FC transient response and suppresses the transient ripples occurring during power source switching instants. Design/methodology/approach: Coordinated power source switching is achieved using three different transition functions. Vehicle model is fractioned into computational and console subsystems for its simulation using real time (RT) LAB simulator. Blocs containing coordination switching strategy, power sources models and their power electronics interface are placed in the computational subsystem that will be executed, in RT, on one of real time laboratory simulator central processing unit cores. Findings: Coordination switching strategy resulted in reducing transient power ripples by 90% and direct current (DC) bus voltage fluctuations by 50%. Switching through transition functions compensated the difference between FC and SC transient responses responsible for transient power ripples. Among the three proposed transition functions, linear transition function resulted in the best transient performances. Originality/value: The proposed coordinated switching strategy allows the control of the switching period duration. Furthermore, it enables the choice of adequate transition functions that fit the dynamics of power sources undergoing transition. Also, the proposed switching technique is simple and does not require the knowledge of system parameters or the complex control models.
