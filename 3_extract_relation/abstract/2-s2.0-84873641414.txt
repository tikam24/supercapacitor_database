For the purpose of enhancing the penetration levels of wind power, we must take measures to reduce the uncertainty of wind power generation. On the foundation of the classification on the fluctuation of wind power, this paper proposes an active-parallel hybrid energy storage system (APHESS) for balancing fluctuant wind power. The APHESS consists of a battery, a supercapacitor and two charge-discharge controllers. By the reasonable design on the configuration of APHESS and the energy management rule, the APHESS could obtain the enhanced energy storage performance to smoothen various fluctuation of wind power and reduce the investment and maintenance cost. Furthermore, we develop a double-layer control model for APHESS in this paper, which is equipped with an expert information base. The task for the each layer of control system is simply to search the expert information base in sequence to get proper control algorithm. Therefore, the response time can be reduced when the APHESS participates in the wind power regulation. By the simulation research, we conclude that the configuration of APHESS and the control system design are feasible and that the fluctuant wind power can be suppressed effectively by APHESS. As a result, the APHESS can be widely used in wind farm for the real-time regulation on wind power generation. Â© 2012 Springer-Verlag.
