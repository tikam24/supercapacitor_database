In this work, (Co0.94Fe0.06)3O4 nanoparticles embedded porous hollow carbon nanowire were prepared by a low temperature calcinations of Co2(BDC)2(dabco) powder loaded with Fe3+ ions. The overall morphology of the MOF material was largely maintained after this low temperature calcinations process. The morphological and compositional characteristics of the calcination products are investigated. It is found that the calcination leads to the generation of (Co0.94Fe0.06)3O4 nanoparticles decorated porous carbon hollow nanowire. The supercapacitance behavior of the (Co0.94Fe0.06)3O4 nanoparticles decorated porous carbon hollow nanowire was also explored.
