Doping is the most effective strategy to improve the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors. Herein, we report the doping effect of Magnesium on structural instability of Ni-Co LDHs as the supercapacitor electrode material. The morphology of different compositions of magnesium are studied. The derived material with the Ni:Mg ratio of 1:1 displayed an excellent specific capacity of 624 Cg−1 at current density of 10 Ag−1. Moreover, the specific capacity remained at 80% after 3000 cycles which suggest excellent cycle stability. An asymmetrc device was fabricated with N/M2 as positive electrode and activated carbon cloth as negative electrode, which displayed a specific capacitance of 200 Fg−1 at 0.25 Ag−1 with the energy density of 28 Whkg−1. The device showed the capacitance retention of about 99% after 1000 cycles at 1 Ag−1. Therefore, improved structural integrity, makes this material a suitable candidate for supercapacitors.
