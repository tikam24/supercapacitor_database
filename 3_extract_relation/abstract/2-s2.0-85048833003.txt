Microporous activated carbon was synthesised using waste compact discs as precursor through physical activation method for supercapacitor electrode application. The activated carbon prepared at 900 °C for a time interval of 8 h showed highest surface area of 1214.25 m2 g−1. The electrochemical measurements showed that waste CDs derived activated carbon exhibited good specific capacitance, cycle stability and good rate capability compared to other waste derived activated carbon. The specific capacitance 51 F g−1 at the current density of 10 mV s−1 and energy density of 21.43 Wh kg−1 at power density 0.7 kW kg−1 was achieved in non-aqueous electrolyte.
