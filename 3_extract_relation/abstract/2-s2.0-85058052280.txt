Nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) and iron oxide particles precipitated on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (IONCNTs) were fabricated by a liquid phase plasma (LPP) process for applications to anode materials in supercapacitors. The nitrogen element and amorphous iron oxide nanoparticles were evenly disseminated on the pristine multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The electrochemical performance of the NCNTs and IONCNTs were investigated and compared with those of pristine MWCNTs. The IONCNTs exhibited superior electrochemical performance to pristine MWCNTs and NCNTs. The specific capacitance of the as-fabricated composites increased as the content of nitrogen and iron oxide particles increased. In addition, the charge transfer resistance of the composites was reduced with introducing nitrogen and iron oxide.
