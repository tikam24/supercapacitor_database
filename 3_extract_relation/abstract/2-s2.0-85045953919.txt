Multifunctional wearable electronic textiles based on interfacial polymerization of polypyrrole on carbon nanotubes/cotton fibers offer advantages of simple and low-cost materials that incorporate bactericidal, good electrochemical performance, and electrical heating properties. The high conductivity of doped polypyrrole/CNT composite provides textiles that reaches temperature on order of 70 Â°C with field of 5 V/cm, superior electrochemical performance applied as electrodes of supercapacitor prototypes, reaching capacitance in order of 30 F g-1 and strong bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus. The combination of these properties can be explored in smart devices for heat and microbial treatment on different parts of body, with incorporated storage of energy on textiles.
