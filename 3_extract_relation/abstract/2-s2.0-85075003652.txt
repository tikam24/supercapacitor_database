Supercapacitors, also termed as electrochemical capacitors or ultracapacitors store charge using high surface area conducting materials. However, their extensive use is limited by the low energy density delivered and relatively high effective series resistance. In order to improve the specific capacitance, energy density as well as the power density, combining materials with requisite properties resulting in hybrids seems to be an attractive way out. Carbon forms one of the most prime materials to be used as supercapacitor electrodes. Structurally modified graphene through chemical functionalization reveals numerous possibilities for attaining tunable structural and electrochemical properties. Till now several chemical and physical functionalization methods have been explored in order to augment the stabilization and result in modification of the graphene. This chapter is concerned detailing the variety of chemical modifications routes of graphene reported so far, their effect on the electrochemical properties of graphene and the applicability of the developed material as a supercapacitor electrode material.
