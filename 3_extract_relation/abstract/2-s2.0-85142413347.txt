Herein, gamma radiation was used to assist the synthesis of Ag decorated nanoplates spinel-type oxide NiMn2O4 as a prospective electrode for supercapacitors. In addition to accelerating charge transfer, Ag nanoparticles provide a minor extent of pseudocapacitance. When evaluated in an aqueous KOH electrolyte, the Ag@NiMn2O4 electrode displays a capacitance of 622 Fg−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1 while retaining exceptional cycle stability (capacitance retention of nearly 88.8 % and 97.6 % coulombic efficiency at 10 Ag−1 after 5000 cycles). Whereas an asymmetric supercapacitor (Ag@NiMn2O4//rGO) has been assembled, it has a maximum specific density of 30.44 Wh kg−1 with a specific power of 10.3006 kW kg−1 within a broad potential window of 1.6 V. Moreover, the capacitance of the Ag@NiMn2O4//rGO hybrid supercapacitor device retains roughly retention of 94.8 % and exhibited approximately 100 % coulombic efficiency. As a result, with its enormous capacitance, high specific density, and extended cycle stability, the Ag-decorated the spinel-type oxide NiMn2O4 nanoplates electrode is an auspicious nominee for supercapacitors applications.
