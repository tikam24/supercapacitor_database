This paper presents the utilization of energy storage device composed of supercapacitor bank for future electric vehicles with a hydrogen fuel cell (FC) as the main power source. The study mainly focuses on the innovative control law based-on flatness properties for fuel cell/supercapacitor hybrid power source. Utilizing the flatness principle, we propose simple solutions to the hybrid energy management and stabilization problems. To authenticate the proposed control laws, a test bench is realized in laboratory. The control algorithm (energy and current control loops) is digitally implemented by dSPACE controller DS1103. Experimental results with small-scale devices (a PEMFC: 500 W, 50 A, 10 V; and a supercapacitor bank: 250 F, 32 V, 500 A) substantiate the excellent performance during load cycles. Â©2010 IEEE.
