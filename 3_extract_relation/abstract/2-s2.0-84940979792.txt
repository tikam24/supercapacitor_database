In this paper, scaled-down mathematical models, simulations, and experimental studies have been conducted to show the power sharing between battery and ultra-capacitor in a passive Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) using lithium ion battery and ultracapacitor. Detailed comparisons between a battery-only ESS and a passive HESS in terms of power capability, discharging time, and efficiency have been studied to investigate the advantages of passive HESS. Finally, we compare a passive HESS with an active HESS for Electric Vehicle (EV) and Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) applications, and the advantages of the passive HESS over active HESS are explained.
