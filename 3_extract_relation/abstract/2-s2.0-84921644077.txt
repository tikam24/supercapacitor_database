Carbon nanotube/graphene (CNT/G) composite sponge is prepared by in-situ partially unzipping of CNT sponge. Polypyrrole is then electro-polymerized onto the sponge to form CNT/graphene/polypyrrole (CNT/G/PPy) ternary composite sponge. The capacitive behavior of the composite is investigated by using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results show that the degree of unzipping of CNT can be controlled by regulating the period of reaction. The specific capacitance of CNT/G sponge shows a significant improvement compared to that of the original CNT sponge (from 4 to 103 F/g). With PPy coating, the CNT/G/PPy displays a high specific capacitance of 225 F/g and excellent capacitance retention of 90.6% after 1000 cycles. In addition, the CNT/G/PPy sponge shows a high capacitance performance under compression. This work indicates that it is possible to build high performance compressive electrodes using CNT/G core networks coated with conductive polymer.
