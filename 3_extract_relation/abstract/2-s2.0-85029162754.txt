Demonstration of the two step synthesis of MoSe2/MWCNTs (MSMC) hybrid thin films has been performed by simple and cost effective ‘dip and dry’ followed by chemical bath deposition (CBD) method. The uniform and porous nanonetwork of MWCNTs facilitates high surface area to anchor cryptomelane MoSe2. Due to the synergic effect and interfacial conjugation between MoSe2 and MWCNTs, the MSMC hybrid electrode and all-solid-state symmetric MSMC//MSMC device reveals excellent high potential electrochemical performance. The remarkable specific capacitance, energy density, power density and excellent cycle durability of all-solid-state symmetric MSMC supercapacitor device imply its potential applicability in the developing supercapacitors for hands-on applications.
