Wind and solar radiation are intermittent with stochastic fluctuations, which can influence the stability of operation of the hybrid system in the grid integrated mode of operation. In this research work, a smoothing control method for mitigating output power variations for a grid integrated wind/PV hybrid system using a battery and electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) is investigated. The power fluctuations of the hybrid system are absorbed by a battery and EDLC during wide variations in power generated from the solar and wind system, subsequently, the power supplied to the grid is smoothened. This makes higher penetration and incorporation of renewable energy resources to the utility system possible. The control strategy of the inverter is realized to inject the power to the utility system with the unity power factor and a constant DC bus voltage. Both photovoltaic (PV) and wind systems are controlled for extracting maximum output power. In order to observe the performance of the hybrid system under practical situations in smoothing the output power fluctuations, one-day practical site wind velocity and irradiation data are considered. The dynamic modeling and effectiveness of this control method are verified in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. The simulation results show that the output power variations of the hybrid wind/PV system can be significantly mitigated using the combination of battery and EDLC based storage systems. The power smoothing controller proposed for the hybrid storage devices is advantageous as compared to the control technique which uses either battery or ultracapacitor used for smoothing the fluctuating power.
