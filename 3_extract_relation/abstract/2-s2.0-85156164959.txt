A supercapacitor is a type of electrical component that has larger capacitance, due to asymmetric behavior with better power density, and lower ESR (effective series resistance) than conventional energy-storage components. Supercapacitors can be used with battery technology to create an effective energy storage system due to their qualities and precise characterization. Studies have shown that the use of quantum dots as electrodes in supercapacitors can significantly increase their effectiveness. In this research article, we have used a Drude model based on free electrons (asymmetric nature) to describe the supercapacitorâ€™s discharging characteristics. Commercially available Nippon DLA and Green-cap supercapacitors were used to verify the Drude model by discharging them through a constant current source using a simple current mirror circuit. The parameters of both the fractional-order models and our suggested method were estimated using the least-squares regression fitting approach. An intriguing finding from the Drude model is the current-dependent behavior of the leakage-parallel resistance in the constant current discharge process. Instead of using the traditional exponential rule, supercapacitors discharge according to a power law. This work reflects the strong symmetry of different aspects of designing a hybrid supercapacitor with high efficiency and reliability.
