The aim of this work is the design of an electrical drive for a motorized bicycle, characterised by new solutions for the control method and the regenerative braking system. A dynamic model of the vehicle has been realised, and the characteristics of the drive have been individuated. An effective closed-loop control strategy has been studied, adjusting the motor torque and the current in order to increase the availability range. Finally, a feasibility study of a regenerative braking system based on the supercapacitor technology has been carried out. All the components of the drive have been selected among the models available on the market. In the paper the results of the simulations are presented and other technical-economical aspects such as energy consumption and costs are also briefly discussed.
