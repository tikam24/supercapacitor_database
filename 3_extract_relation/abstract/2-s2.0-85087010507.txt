This article focuses on structural, optical, magnetic, and dielectric behavior of Ni-substituted CeO2 quantum dots synthesized by efficient chemical precipitation technique. Synthesized nanopowders were analyzed by XRD, FESEM, TEM, FT-IR, UV, PL, dielectric, electrochemical, and magnetic behavior. X-ray diffraction technique stipulated the nanopowders that exhibit FCC structure and don't have any unwanted phases. FESEM and TEM analyses showed that the particles are in the nanometer range and the microstructure alternation evidenced from spherical to the nanorods. The functional group and compositional study confirmed the substitution of Ni within CeO2. The UVâ€“Vis absorption spectrum approved the blue shift in absorption and increase in bandgap from 3.39 to 4.20 eV. The photoluminescence study confirmed the strong blue emission with the increase of Ni concentration. VSM analysis demonstrated that the Ni-doped CeO2 quantum dots are ferromagnetic nature and the magnetization increased. The electrochemical analysis confirmed the increase of supercapacitance property of CeO2 nanoparticles with Ni at a low scan rate. The dielectric analysis suggested that the CeO2: Ni can be utilized for the capacitor application.
