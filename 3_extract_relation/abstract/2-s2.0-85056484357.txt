Designing core–shell electrode materials with desired components and architectures is a promising strategy for boosting electrochemical performance. Here, three-dimensional hierarchical ZnCo2O4@Ni(OH)2 core–shell nanosheet arrays have been successfully fabricated on a Ni foam substrate, in which the porous ZnCo2O4 nanosheet “core” as the conductive scaffold was synthesized by a metal–organic framework (MOF)-templated method, and the ultrathin Ni(OH)2 nanoflakes “shell” with rich active sites were grafted on the ZnCo2O4 nanosheet through a hydrothermal treatment. When directly used as a free-standing electrode for supercapacitor, these hierarchical ZnCo2O4@Ni(OH)2 core–shell nanosheet arrays exhibited a high capacitance of 3063.2 mF cm−2 (1021.1 F g−1) at the current density of 1 mA cm−2. This electrode significantly outperformed individual Ni(OH)2 or ZnCo2O4 nanosheet arrays, benefiting from the robust core–shell arrays on Ni foam with good electrical conductivity and abundant active sites, as well as the synergetic effect between MOF-derived porous ZnCo2O4 “core” and the ultrathin Ni(OH)2 “shell”. Moreover, the assembled ZnCo2O4@Ni(OH)2//activated-carbon asymmetric supercapacitor displayed excellent energy and power densities (maximum of 40.0 Wh kg−1 and 8.02 kW kg−1) and superior cycling stability of 98.4 % retention with 91.2 % coulombic efficiency over 5 000 cycles at 10 A g−1.
