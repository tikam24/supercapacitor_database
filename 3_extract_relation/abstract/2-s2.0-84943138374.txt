It has recently been shown that energy gain in a tokamak fusion device is, surprisingly, almost independent on device size, and is strongly dependent on energy confinement time. Coupled with recent technical advances - high temperature superconductors offering compact high performance magnets, and the Spherical Tokamak which offers high efficiency and possibly improved energy confinement- it could be possible to achieve high fusion gain in a small device. This paper describes how an independent company, Tokamak Energy, plans to exploit this new understanding, and speed the realisation of fusion energy by a series of experimental demonstrations which should secure further investment.
