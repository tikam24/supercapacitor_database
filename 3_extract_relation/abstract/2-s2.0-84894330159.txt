The ever expanding cities and increasing pollution have emphasized the need for a better city transportation system which should abate the pollution in cities. Supercapacitor based electric buses area possible option but charging the supercapacitor directly from the grid may put extra burden on the grid. In this paper, a city capabus (electric bus which suits a supercapacitor) transportation system failure management has been presented. Capabuses acquire power from Capabus Stops (CBS), located along the ring road of Guwahati city, India.CBS consists of High Capacity Battery, which receives power from the grid in off-peak hours and discharges power to the grid in peak hours. A detailed analysis has been done on the possible failures that occur to the Transportation System and proper solutions have been incorporated for avoiding system collapse. Thus, making the complete system not only environment friendly but also grid-friendly. Â© 2013 IEEE.
