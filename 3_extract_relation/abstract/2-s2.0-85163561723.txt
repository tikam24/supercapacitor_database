In this study, an electrode material based on polypyrrole (PPy) conducting polymer with a versatile fabrication method has been fabricated instead of electrodes and electrolytes containing expensive metal materials for flexible and wearable electronics. An anthraquinone dye (Acid Blue 127) was used as a counter ion. Structural and morphological analyses of the electrodes, whose energy storage ability was investigated, showed that the surface morphology changes in an interesting way and increases the amount of stored charge by increasing the electrode/electrode interface interaction with increasing surface area (∼3 times). The involvement of AB 127, a textile dye, in the production of supercapacitor electrodes in wearable electronics provides new ideas that multifunctional properties of materials can be discovered and applied in many fields. The electrode material (PPy/AB-127) produced at 2 mM anthraquinone-dye concentration showed a maximum value of 606.6 F g−1 at a current density of 1.0 A g−1. When a symmetrical supercapacitor was formed, it exhibited an energy density of 22.9 W h kg-1 at a power density of 3500 W kg−1 in an aqueous electrolyte. this device retained 91.6% of its capacitance for 5000 cycles.
