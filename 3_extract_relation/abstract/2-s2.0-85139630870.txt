This paper describes the electrochemical studies of a magnificent new ternary complex whose nanoarchitecture consists of lanthanum iron oxide (LaFeO3) perovskite, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), and reduced graphene-based hydrogel (GH) for the supercapacitor (SC) approach. For this purpose, GH was used as the backbone structure in the main body of the hybrid structure. A hybrid form of g-C3N4 and GH was used in the appropriate architecture required to improve the usage area of LaFeO3 perovskite structure in supercapacitor applications. Thus, by increasing the interaction surface area between the electrodeâ€“electrolyte of the supercapacitor made with LaFeO3, the specific capacitance amount and long cycle life of the SC were increased. Within this context, the advanced three-dimensional (3D) LaFeO3/g-C3N4@GH hydrogel is created by using basic hydrothermal and freeze-drying processes. Electrochemical investigations revealed that LaFeO3/g-C3N4@GH has improved capacitive performance, with a specific capacitance (Cs) of 652.12 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV/s. These results displayed the simple production strategy of 3D GH-based hybrid hydrogel for high-performance SC.
