A Ni(OH)2-graphenehybrid with a three dimensional (3D) interconnected graphene network was prepared by a simple one-pot hydrothermal method. The 3D structure constructed of flexible and planar graphene sheets (GS) forms an effective electron transfer network and provides a continuous pore structure for ion transport. Moreover, this structure avoids the aggregation of GS and Ni(OH)2, resulting in a high utilization rate of Ni(OH)2 at high contents. This study shows the hybrid has a high rate capability and cyclic stability and exhibits a high specific capacitance of ~1461 F·g-1 at a scan rate of 5 mV·s-1 with a Ni(OH)2 mass loading of ~84 mass%.
