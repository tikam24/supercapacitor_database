This work mainly uses the one pot to synthesis RGO/δ-MnO2 composites, which is characterized using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), low pressure nitrogen adsorption stripping (BET), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), energy spectrum (EDS) and thermal gravimetric analyzer (TGA). The electrochemical performance is tested by the cyclic voltammetry (CV), constant current charge/discharge test (GCD) and loop test. Results show that the RGO/δ-MnO2 composites possess more excellent electrochemical performance than pure δ-MnO2 and pure graphene. When the current density is 1 A•g-1, the specific capacitance of RGO/δ-MnO2 composite can reach 322.6 F•g-1, which is higher than that of the pure δ-MnO2 (234.2 F•g-1) and the pure graphene (212.1 F•g-1). Moreover, the specific capacitance retention of RGO/δ-MnO2 composites remains 79.1% when current density increases to 10 A•g-1. The specific capacitance of RGO/δ-MnO2 composite is still as high as 252 F•g-1 (99.6%) even after 1000 times constant current charge/discharge tests. These results indicate that the composite will be a kind of promising supercapacitor electrode material.
