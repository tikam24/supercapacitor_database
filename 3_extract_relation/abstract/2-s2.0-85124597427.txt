By incorporating the advantages of different materials, the composite material can Preferably strengthen the electrochemical performance of the electrode material. In this paper, CQDs/P-Fe2O3 on carbon cloth (CC) as flexible electrode material was synthesized with one-pot hydrothermal synthesis procedure. The one-dimentional (1D) structure was favorable due to the chemical stability, electrical conductivity, and fast electrochemical kinetics. While the current density is 0.5 A/g, the specific capacitance of the composite reaches 1786.5 F/g. The assembled supercapacitor remains at 91.31% of its initial specific capacitance after 1000 cycles. When the power density is 639.99 W/kg, the energy density is 103.11Wh/kg, and even when the power density is 12800 W/kg, the energy density can reach 44.8 Wh/kg.
