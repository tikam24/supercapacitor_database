This paper presents the design, fabrication and characterization of a flexible solid- state electrical double layer supercapacitor fabricated in a single fabric layer. The proposed supercapacitors were based on fabric electrodes fabricated with low cost carbon materials via a spray coating technique. The single layer solid state supercapacitors achieved a specific capacitances of 40.5 F.g-1, area capacitance of 40.5 mF.cm-2.
