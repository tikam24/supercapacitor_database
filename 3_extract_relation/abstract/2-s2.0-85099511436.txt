A single power source in battery-powered electric vehicle (EV) has significant limitations and is usually not sufficient to efficiently handle short-term or instantaneous high-power demands of vehicle loads. Ultra-capacitor (UC)/battery hybrid power source (HPS) with both high energy density and high power density can effectively solve this problem and has recently become the focus of considerable attention among research institutions, thus making efficient UC/battery HPS for EV a very hot research topic nowadays. Topology optimization design of UC/battery HPS is the critical issue to obtain practical construction and proper control strategy with superior performances such as fine reliability and excellent efficiency. It is necessary to have an in-depth understanding of UC/battery HPS performance and topology optimization design methods. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive and critical review of UC/battery HPS for EV applications. Besides, key technologies for the design of UC/battery HPS for EV are summarized and discussed. Furthermore, in order to solve the problems of low efficiency and energy utilization of UC/battery HPS in traditional technology solutions, a novel UC/battery HPS and its control method are presented, and an overview of our research approach is given.
