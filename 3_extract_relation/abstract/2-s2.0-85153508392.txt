Porous carbon (PC) derived from biomass is one of the most attractive materials for supercapacitors because of their advantages of low cost and renewable. Honeysuckle stem is slender, and cylindrical. The PC derived from the hollow cylindrical stem may provide a path for electrolyte ions diffusion, which benefits to good electrochemical performance. Herein, we prepared PC material derived from honeysuckle stem powder by KOH chemical activation method, which possess an ultra-high specific surface area of 3188.2 m2 g−1 and suitable average pore size of 2.46 nm. In a three-electrode system, the specific capacitance of the PC is as high as 409 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 and 317 F g−1at 10 A g−1. When the current density increases from 2 to 10 A g−1, the rate capability of PC could reach 77.5%. More importantly, the specific capacitance retention of the PC is as high as 93.9% after 20,000 cyclic tests at 10 A g−1. Also, a PC//PC symmetric supercapacitor assembled with 3 M KOH as electrolyte achieves a high specific capacitance of 360 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and excellent rate performance of 81.3% capacitance retention with current density up to10 A g−1. Most importantly, the energy density of the PC//PC device in 3 M KOH solution can reach up to 12.5 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 500 W kg−1. The initial specific capacitance of 91.5% was remained after 20,000 cycles at 10 A g−1. These results reveal that the as-prepared PC has great potential as an electrode material for supercapacitors.
