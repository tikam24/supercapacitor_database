Polyaniline nanofibers were prepared by in situ polymerization of aniline in the presence of surfactants such as tetrabutylammonium hydroxide and sodium dodecyl benzenesulfonate stabilized graphene under acidic condition. A homogeneous dispersion of individual graphene sheets within the polymer matrix was achieved due to the good dispersibility of surfactant-stabilized graphene in aqueous phase. The morphology and electrochemical properties of both components were well preserved due to the mild reaction conditions. The composite materials were used for supercapacitor electrode and a high specific capacitance of 526 F g-1 was obtained at a current density of 0.2 A g -1 with good cycling stability.
