In this paper, a hydrothermal synthesis method for preparation Carbon Quantum Dots (CQDs)/Ni(OH)20.75H2O composite electrode material, and loaded on Nickel Foam(NF) by rolling method. The crystal phase, structure, morphology and the reaction process were characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical properties of the composite were measured by cyclic voltammetry impedance spectroscopy and couple method charge-discharge techniques. The results showed that the composites material was evenly adhered to nickel foam. When the current density is 1 A g-1, the specific capacity of CQDs / Ni (OH) 20.75H2O composite can reach 2115.4 Fg-1, which is close to 5 times of Ni (OH) 20.75 H2O electrode material.
