Mn/Pb composite oxides were prepared by solid-state reaction by KMnO 4 with manganese acetate and lead acetate at low temperature. The products were characterized by XRD and TEM. The results show that the composite oxides are nano-size and amorphous structure. Electrochemical characterizations were performed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and constant current charge-discharge in a three-electrode system. The potential windows of Mn/Pb composite oxides electrode are increased. With increasing the ratio of Pb, the specific capacitance goes through a maximum at 20% mol Pb. The specific capacitance of pure MnO2 is 158 F/g and is improved to 180 F/g for the Mn 0.8Pb0.2Ox composite oxide by constant current discharge.
