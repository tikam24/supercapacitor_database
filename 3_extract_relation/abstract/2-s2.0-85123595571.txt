Laser-based methodologies for synthesis, reduction, modification and assembly of graphene-based materials are highly demanded for energy-related electrodes and devices for portable electronics. Laser technologies for graphene synthesis and modification exhibit several advantages when compared to alternative methods. They are fast, low-cost and energy saving, allowing selective heating and programmable processing, with controlled manipulation over the main experimental parameters. In this review, we summarize the most recent studies on laser-assisted synthesis of graphene-based materials, as well as their modification and application as electrodes for supercapacitor and battery applications. After a brief introduction to the physical properties of graphene and a discussion of the different types of laser processing operations, the practical uses of laser techniques for the fabrication of electrode materials are discussed in detail. Finally, the review is concluded with a brief discussion of some of the outstanding problems and possible directions for research in the area of laser-based graphene materials for energy storage devices.
