Benefiting from tailorable component and structure, metal oxides exhibit great impetus towards high performance supercapacitors and oxygen evolution reaction catalyst. However, rational structural regulation of metal oxides-based electrode under mild conditions to simultaneously achieve abundant active sites and synergistic effects of multiple active centers is still very challenging. In this study, the Bi2MoO6 nanosheets with adequate oxygen vacancies and heteroatom nitrogen injection were synthesized via hydrothermal reaction and subsequent NH3/Ar plasma modification. Controllable generation of O vacancies and injection of N atoms in Bi2MoO6 was conducive to regulating the band structure of electrode material, achieving greatly enhanced conductivity, wettability, ionic infiltration capacity and significantly reduced dissociation barrier of surface adsorbates. Compared with pristine Bi2MoO6, the plasma engraved Bi2MoO6 electrode delivered superior charge storage performance for supercapacitor (79.0% of capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles at 20 Ag−1) and good electrochemical catalytic efficiency for oxygen evolution reaction (349 mV at 10 mA cm−2 with a Tafel slope of 42 mV dec–1). It is demonstrated that the plasma modification for metal oxides is a promising application in supercapacitors and electrochemical water splitting.
