As a first report, use of room temperature non-aqueous chemical bath deposited Sb2S3 thin film as active material for supercapacitor application; opens new era in energy storage field. Obtained films were characterized by using structural, surface morphological and compositional analysis. The electrochemical performance has been evaluated by using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge and electrochemical impedance techniques. The maximum specific capacitance of 248 F/g at 0.5 A/g has been achieved within 0.2 to −0.5 V potential windows in 1M Na2SO4 electrolyte. In addition, the Ragone plot confirms the better specific power and specific energy for Sb2S3 electrode.
