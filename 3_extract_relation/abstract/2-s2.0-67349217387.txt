V2O5·0.6H2O nanoribbons were prepared and their electrochemical behaviors in K2SO4 aqueous solution were investigated. Results show for the first time that K+ ions could intercalate/deintercalate reversibly in the V2O5·0.6H2O lattice. An asymmetric supercapacitor activated carbon/0.5 mol/l K2SO4/V2O5·0.6H2O was successfully assembled, which could be cycled reversibly in the voltage region of 0-1.8 V. This supercapacitor presents an energy density of 29.0 Wh/kg based on the total mass of the active electrode materials, a very good rate behavior with energy density of 20.3 Wh/kg at power density of 2 kW/kg, and also a rather good cycling performance. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.
