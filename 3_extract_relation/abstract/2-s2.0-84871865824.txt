The present communication reports on the preparation of WS2 nanoparticles-encapsulated amorphous carbon tubes (WS2NPs/CTs) via two-step processes. Firstly, CTs were grown in anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) film by hydrothermal carbonization of glucose. Secondly, the as-prepared CTs/AAO film was impregnated with (NH4)2WS4 followed by high temperature treatment in Ar atmosphere. We further demonstrate the application of the resulting WS2NP/CT composites as a novel electrode material for supercapacitor. Such composites were found to deliver a specific capacitance of 337 F/g at a high current density of 10 A/g with good cycle stability. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.
