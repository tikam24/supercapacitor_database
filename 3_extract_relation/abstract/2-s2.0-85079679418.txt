Research on the effect of supercapacitor types on crystal structure and microstructure on the electrode material of supercapacitors has been carried out. Supercapacitor is a new technology developed from conventional capacitors for storing the energy needed. Supercapacitors have energy densities far greater than conventional capacitors and have a much larger power density than batteries. This research was carried out to determine the crystal structure, crystal lattice diameter size, microstructure and elemental composition of the different types of electrode materials of supercapacitors namely 4.700 μF, 6.800 μF, and 15.000 μF. Tests carried out included the determination of the crystal structure and size of the crystal lattice using X-ray diffractometers and observations of surface morphology and elemental composition by Scanning Electron Microscopy and X-ray Disversive Energy. The XRD test results from the three supercapacitor electrode materials have the form of a Cubic central body or Cubic Body Center structure, with a crystal lattice diameter between 25 - 428 nm. The results of observations with SEM-EDXS show that the microstructure of phase particles is scattered in the boundary area of the main phase (matrix). And the chemical composition is C: 6-7% by weight, O: 34-36% by weight, Al: 53-58% by weight, and P: 0.23-0.60% by weight.
