A supercapacitor using non-aqueous electrolyte and multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWNTs) nanocomposite electrodes has been designed with polymer and metal oxide loaded carbon nanotubes as electrodes. These nanocomposites were coated on the carbon paper with Nafion solution to obtain the flexible electrodes. Carbon paper with the nanocomposite coating was pressed on either sides of the Nafion membrane, which acts both as a separator and as an electrolyte. The performance of asymmetric assembly of electrochemical double layer capacitor with polymer- and metal oxide-dispersed MWNTs composite materials with non-aqueous Nafion electrolyte is compared with symmetric assemblies, and the results are discussed.
