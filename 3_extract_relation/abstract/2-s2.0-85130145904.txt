The preparation of biomass derived carbon materials usually suffers from complicated and time-consuming procedures, which severely limits their large-scale application. In this work, a modified molten salt-assisted carbonization strategy is proposed to obtain biomass derived porous carbon materials in a convenient way. In particular, the rice-paper plant (RRP) is used as the carbonaceous precursor, and the role of molten salt in the whole reaction process is comprehensively investigated. Under the action of molten salt, oxide impurities can be easily removed by ultrasonication, and both the pickling and activation process are eliminated. The as-obtained carbonized product (MS-RRP) with robust pore structure is obtained with excellent supercapacitor and lithium-ion battery performance. The universality of this strategy towards porous carbon materials production is then verified by using different biomass as raw materials, which is vital for controlling the cost of potential large-scale manufacturing.
