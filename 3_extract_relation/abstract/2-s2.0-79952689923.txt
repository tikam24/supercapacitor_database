Electrochemical storage of hydrogen in activated carbon material has been investigated using different parameters of cathodic polarization. It has been proven that application of short galvanostatic pulses could be efficient for hydrogen storage in microporous carbon material. Charging current loads from 50 mA g-1 to 32 A g-1 have been used showing correlation between hydrogen capacity, time of charging and electrical efficiency. The anodic charge equivalent to electrooxidation of 1.0 wt% of hydrogen can be already reached after 90 s of cathodic polarization. Temperature effect has been also evaluated and a gradual increase of hydrogen capacity with a better pronounced oxidation plateau was obtained at higher temperatures. Reversible electrosorption of hydrogen is a useful reaction in supercapacitor performance and it might have a potential application for a negative electrode of supercapacitor as well as reversibly operating electrode in the secondary cell.
