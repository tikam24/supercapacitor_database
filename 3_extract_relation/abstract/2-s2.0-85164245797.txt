The surface mechanical alloying (SMA) technique achieved high capacitances, improved capacitance (C) and dielectric permittivity (ε′) of mixed Aluminum/fiber-glass ‘Al/F-glass’ formed on aluminum plates. The radiofrequency RF range 0.1–106 Hz was applied on the Al/F-glass on Al plates, acting as parallel electrodes sandwiching the mixed ceramic Al/F-glass as dielectric. Capacitance increase observed after surface alloying on treated Al with small 1.5 balls than 6 mm balls on Al-plate & 1 A l-plate 2 respectively, giving twice the permittivity constant of the annealed Al. Deformation micro-scale cavities in Al surfaces played important role in raising capacitance and permittivity values; Interpreted as condensers inside a condenser caused capacitance increase according Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars effect. Dielectric relaxation model Havriliak-Negami Model was used to examine the occurrence of the Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars effect in alloyed Al/F-glass surfaces on Al plates, which confirms micro-cavities important role due to pre-treatment of Al surfaces.
