Developing a simple, affordable, and scalable process for fabricating an energy storage device is still a challenge in the modern era. The fabrication of a Graphene-Silver/Polyindole (Gr-Ag/PIn NCs) nanocomposite for high-performance supercapacitor electrodes was performed using a low-cost and simple approach. XRD, FTIR, SEM, and TEM techniques were used to investigate potential interactions between Gr-Ag and PIn. Morphological analysis revealed that the synthesis of Gr-Ag was evenly decorated on the PIn surface. Binder-free electrodes of Graphene-Silver/Polyindole nanocomposite (Gr-Ag/PIn NCs) are among candidate materials for high-capacity supercapacitors. The findings indicate that the imidogen linking is essential in developing a Ï€-conjugated structure that promotes charge transport and provides high capacitance and cycle reliability. The Gr-Ag/PIn NCs electrodes exhibited a high specific capacity of 914 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g, attributed to the synergistic interaction. It also demonstrates 504 Wh/kg energy density and retains capacitance stability at 3 A/g of 94% after 1000 cycles. Furthermore, this study showed an efficient synthesis approach in developing nanocomposite; it can be used as promising electrodes for excellent energy storage.
