3D N-doped mesoporous graphene (N-3DMG) is fabricated by using amidated graphene oxide (AMGO) as the precursor. The amidation of graphene oxide not only avoids restacking of graphene sheets when AMGO is reduced to amidated graphene (AMG), but also provides nitrogen source for the N-3DMG. When the N-3DMG is used for supercapacitor, it exhibits a considerable specific capacitance, high rate capability and excellent cyclic stability. The 3D mesoporous structure and the high N-doping content are believed to be responsible for the high capacitive performances.
