Fe2O3, which shows promise as an abundant and low-cost electrode material for supercapacitors has attracted much attention due to its high theoretical specific capacity. In this report, homogeneous Fe2O3 nanospheres/oxidized g-C3N4 (Fe2O3/OCN) are synthesized by anchoring Fe2O3 nanospheres on the surface of oxidized g-C3N4 for the first time via a facile hydrothermal method. More importantly, these Fe2O3 nanospheres are well-dispersed on the oxidized g-C3N4 layers, which can offer an abundance of active sites and effectively prevent the aggregation of Fe2O3 nanospheres during electrochemical reactions. Moreover, 10%OCN/Fe2O3 exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with an excellent specific capacitance of 243 F g-1 at a current density of 1A g-1, which is better than that of pure Fe2O3 nanospheres. Moreover, there is no obvious capacitance decrease after 1000 cycles. Therefore, Fe2O3/OCN is demonstrated to be an excellent electrode material for supercapacitors.
