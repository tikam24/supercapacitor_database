In the past few years with increase in population and global warming the requirement to store energy from various sources has increased. Recent research have been focused on oxide materials as energy storage device due to their unique structure and interesting properties. Perovskites materials such as La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-Î´ and SrRuO3 shows capacitive behavior. In previous studies perovskite with different A and B sites have been studied. In this report we have chosen Ca2Fe2O5 perovskite material due to its interesting properties, structure and morphology which changes on introducing cobalt as dopant material. Further we investigated the performance of cobalt doping on the electrochemical behavior of Ca2Fe2-xCoxO5 (x=0, 0.01 and 0.03) using electrochemical characterization such as Cyclic voltammetry (CV), Galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS).
