In the present work, activated carbon (AC) was obtained from low-cost biowaste of black seed fennel flower (Lc-FF) through facile chemical activation. However, activated fennel flower (Ac-FF) exhibited relatively stable electrochemical performance among ACs, to enhance the electrochemical properties such as cyclic stability, energy density, power density, and specific capacitance (Cs), combined with functionalized graphene oxide (FGO). Then, to obtain POAP/FGO/Ac-FF (ternary nanocomposite), an extremely-slim layer of Poly-orthoaminophenol (POAP) was coated on the binary nanocomposite (FGO/Ac-FF). From the SEM and TEM images, the layered structure of the nanocomposite surface was visible, which led to the acceleration of ion transfer rate. In addition, an excellent specific surface area (SSA) of 2199.2 m2.g−1 was achieved via Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. Electrochemical analyses including galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were conducted to evaluate and compare the energy storage behavior of electrode materials. In a three-electrode system, the Cs value for the ternary nanocomposite electrode was calculated 1400.2 F.g−1 at 2 A.g−1. Besides, this material exhibited excellent cyclic stability with 94.4 % capacity retention after 5000 continuous charge-discharge cycles. This work provides new insights into the development of biowaste-based electrodes for high-performance supercapacitors (SCs).
