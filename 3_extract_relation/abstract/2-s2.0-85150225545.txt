Porous carbon nanofibers (PCNFs) with excellent physical and chemical properties have been considered candidate materials for electrodes used in supercapacitors. Herein, we report a facile procedure to fabricate PCNFs through electrospinning blended polymers into nanofibers followed by pre-oxidation and carbonization. Polysulfone (PSF), high amylose starch (HAS), and phenolic resin (PR) are used as three different kinds of template pore-forming agents. The effects of pore-forming agents on the structure and properties of PCNFs have been systematically studied. The surface morphology, chemical components, graphitized crystallization, and pore characteristics of PCNFs are analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and nitrogen adsorption and desorption test, respectively. The pore-forming mechanism of PCNFs is analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Fabricated PCNF-R have a specific surface area as high as ~994 m2/g, a total pore volume as high as ~0.75 cm3/g, and a good graphitization degree. When PCNF-R are used as active materials to fabricate into electrodes, the PCNF-R electrodes show a high specific capacitance ~350 F/g, a good rate capability ~72.6%, a low internal resistance ~0.55 Î©, and an excellent cycling stability ~100% after 10,000 charging and discharging cycles. The design of low-cost PCNFs is expected to be widely applicable for the development of high-performance electrodes for an energy storage field.
