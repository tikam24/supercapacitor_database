Direct laser writing (DLW) is a convenient approach for fabricating graphene-based flexible electronic devices. In this paper, laser-induced graphene was successfully prepared on a thin and transparent polyimide film through the DLW process. Experiments have demonstrated that interdigital thin film capacitor prepared by the DLW method has a high specific capacitance of 8.11 mF/cm2 and volume capacitance density of 3.16 F/cm3 (0.05 mA/cm2) due to the doped fluoride in the laser-induced graphene. The capacitance is about 20 times larger than the super-capacitor based non-transparent polyimide film of the same thickness. Owing to its thin, flexible, higher electrochemical characteristics, the transparent polyimide film is promising for integrating and powering portable and wearable electronics.
