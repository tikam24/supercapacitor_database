This paper investigates the model predictive control approach to optimize the operation of hybrid microgrid system which contain hybrid energy harvesting and storage (HEHS) devices and bidirectional 3-Level Neutral Point Clamped (NPC) based 3-Phase Voltage Source Converter (VSC). The intermittent nature of renewable energy sources has direct effect over the health of the connected microgrid system. Hence the essential salient feature needed for hybrid microgrid is to encounter the discrete nature of loading conditions. Which arises the need of that system which can deal with such kind of practical problems in the microgrid system. This work revisits and utilizes the key elements of Model Predictive Control (MPC) to achieve the voltage regulation in the DC link of AC/DC microgrid, reduction in grid harmonics and managing the power for the whole system. Along with this the given topology is optimally utilizing the DC link split capacitors by maintaining the same voltage level on them. Besides, the performance of MPC based grid connected HEHS system with 3-Level neutral point clamped converter topology is demonstrated via simulation in the MATLAB/Simulink environment.
