Hierarchical NiMoO4@MnO2 nanosheet arrays supported on titanium mesh are synthesized by cost effective hydrothermal methods for binder-free electrode. High specific area of porous MnO2nanosheets and exceptionally high pseudocapacitive behavior of NiMoO4nanosheets lead to a specific capacitance of 976 F g−1at a current density of 1 A g−1 with pleasurable rate characteristic in three electrode configuration. The excellent electrochemical performances of the integrated electrode can be ascribed to the unique core-shell nanostructure and synergic interaction. It is believed that the hierarchical NiMoO4@MnO2 nanosheet arrays supported on titanium mesh can provide great prospect for energy storage applications.
