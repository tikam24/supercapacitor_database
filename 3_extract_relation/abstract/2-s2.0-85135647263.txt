Compact, flexible, high energy and high density energy storage devices are required to power electronic skins, implantable devices and flexible sensors. Compact and flexible supercapacitors are the need of the hour. Research has been in progress to improve the performance of the electrodes and electrolyte with respect to the batteries and supercapacitors. A number of electrolytes have been designed and tested for the supercapacitor applications. Electrolytes based on ionic liquids are useful to improve the performance from the angle of widening operating voltage, improving energy density, charge-discharge cycling, etc. In this chapter, essential details of a supercapacitor, followed by different components of a supercapacitor, various types and features of electrolytes, developments in ionic liquid electrolytes, design aspects in ionic liquid electrolyte usage, concept of mechanical integrity in flexible supercapacitor design are explored.
