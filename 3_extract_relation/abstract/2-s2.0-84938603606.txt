Well-ordered three-dimensional Cu architectures serving as low-resistance current collectors for supercapacitor applications are fabricated by combining microfabrication and electrochemical techniques. These techniques enable the realization of electrodes with precisely controlled characteristic dimensions, including the surface area, thickness of the active material, and interlayer spacing. Highly laminated Cu structures are formed by through-mold electrodeposition of alternating Ni and Cu layers followed by selective electrochemical removal of Ni layers. Underpotential deposition is utilized to precisely measure the electrochemically accessible surface area of the resultant Cu structure. A conformal, thin layer of nickel hydroxide is electrodeposited onto the Cu backbone, forming the supercapacitor electrode. The resulting electrodes exhibit a high specific capacitance value of 733Fg<sup>-1</sup>. In cycle testing, the electrodes deliver 94% of their capacitance after over 1000 cycles. The supercapacitor is also shown to deliver 69% of its 5mVs<sup>-1</sup> capacity at rates as high as 25mVs<sup>-1</sup>. These results illustrate the benefits of using well-ordered metal architectures as current collectors for advanced electrochemical energy storage applications.
