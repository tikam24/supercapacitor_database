Due to the expeditious expansion of wearable electronics, all-solid-state flexible supercapacitors are being contemplated as promising energy-storage devices. Through the successful preparation of large quantities of high-quality semiconducting-type thin molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) sheets suspended in water, the authors have developed an environmentally friendly and simple method to fabricate ternary flexible electrodes with MoS2, polyaniline (PANI), and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The resulting MoS2/PANI/CNT all-solid-state supercapacitor can be easily integrated in series to power commercial light-emitting diodes without an external bias voltage. In addition, such a supercapacitor exhibits remarkable energy density (0.013 Wh cm-3) and power density (1.000 W cm-3), thus making it superior to commercially available lithium thin-film batteries (4 V/500 Î¼A h) and 2.75 V/44 mF activated carbon electrochemical capacitors. These results demonstrate that the exfoliated MoS2-based composite is a promising material for the development of high-performance and low-cost energy-storage devices.
