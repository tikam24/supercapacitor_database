Nitrogen-doped carbon (N-C) is pyrolytically prepared by using the nanocomposites of graphene Quantum dots (GQDs) and chitosan (CS) as the precursor. Due to the existence of GQDs nanofiller, the three-dimensional (3D) interconnected frameworks of CS are well preserved after the pyrolysis treatment; meanwhile, CS in the nanocomposites functions as nitrogen source for the N-C. The obtained N-C exhibits a considerable specific capacitance (545 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), high rate capability and excellent cyclic stability (88.9% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 10 A g−1) when it is used as the electrode materials in supercapacitors. The well-preserved 3D frameworks and N-doping are believed to be responsible for the excellent supercapacitive behaviors of the N-C.
