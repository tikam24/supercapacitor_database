A combination of soft lithographic printing and soft templating has been used to fabricate high-resolution interdigitated micro-supercapacitors (MSC). Surfactant-assisted self-assembly produces high surface area ordered mesoporous carbons (490 m2 g−1). For the first time, such precursors have been printed by nano-imprint lithography as microdevices with a line width of only 250 nm and a spacing of only 1 μm. The devices are crack-free with low specific resistance (1.2×10−5 Ωm) and show good device capacitance up to 0.21 F cm−3.
