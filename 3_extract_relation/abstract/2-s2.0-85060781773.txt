Molybdenum selenide (MoSe 2 ) nanosheets are prepared by a simple and facile sonochemical route. To optimize the synthesis process, the sonication is tested at three different time durations (15, 30 and 45 min) with a constant power of 500 W. In order to improve the electrochemical performance of the exfoliated MoSe 2 nanosheets, we report the hybridization of 2D-MoSe 2 with 2D-graphene by a simple solvothermal method. The exfoliated MoSe 2 nanosheets are perpendicularly oriented on the surface of the graphene nanosheets. These MoSe 2 nanosheet edges have a large number of electrochemically active sites, and the graphene sheets provide effective mass transportation of ions at the electrode-electrolyte interface. Cyclic voltammetry reveals the pseudocapacitive behaviour of a MoSe 2 /graphene nanohybrid based electrode. From galvanostatic charge-discharge studies, the specific capacitance is found to be 945 F g -1 at a current density of 1 A g -1 . An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device is fabricated, which delivers a specific capacitance of 75 F g -1 (@1 A g -1 ) with an energy density of 26.6 W h kg -1 and a power density of 0.8 kW kg -1 , and it retains 88% of its capacitance even after 3000 cycles.
