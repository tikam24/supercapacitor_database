In this work we report a flexible energy supply unit made by printing flexible disposable aqueous supercapacitor modules onto a light harvester. In order to demonstrate simpler and more scalable manufacturing processes, we printed the supercapacitors monolithically instead of laminating electrodes face-to-face and integrated the series connections into the fabrication process. The supercapacitor modules were printed onto the backside of the Organic Photovoltaic (OPV) modules to combine energy harvesting and storage module for harvesting light under normal indoor conditions, storing it in a supercapacitor module, and thus offering power for low power IoT devices.
