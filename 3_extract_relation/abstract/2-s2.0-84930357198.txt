A template free anodic electrodeposition process has been developed to deposit Mn oxide and Mn oxide/ PEDOT rods onto Ni foam substrates for use as a supercapacitor. The deposit morphology has been optimized by varying deposition conditions and by characterization using SEM imaging. TEM diffraction indicates that the deposits are poorly crystalline, with a grain size less than 20 nm. XPS analysis revealed that the deposits are present as a combination of MnO2 and MnOOH. The capacitive performance of the deposits was characterized using cyclic voltammetry. The addition of PEDOT increased the capacitance of deposits from 120 (0.29 F/cm2) to 159 F/g (0.50 F/cm2) at 5 mV/s. Capacitance retention after 500 cycles was 91% and 113% for deposits with and without PEDOT, respectively.
