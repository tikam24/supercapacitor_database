Highly crystalline FeWO4 nanorods (FWO NRs) prepared by a hydrothermal reaction is combined with g-C3N4 (gCN) nanosheet as an electrode material for the supercapacitor. Fabricated nanocomposites were analysed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron microscopy (XPS), and Raman Spectroscopy. Pseudocapacitive performance of the FWO/gCN nanocomposite was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance and galvanometric experiments in an alkaline medium. Thus FWO/gCN nanocomposite exhibited a high specific capacitance of 357 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 and demonstrated a superior long-term cyclic stability, with the specific capacitance retention of about 80% after 1000 cycles.
