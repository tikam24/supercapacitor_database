In order to overcome shortcomings of battery as a single energy source for electric vehicles and improve performance of electric vehicles, a simple multimode hybrid energy storage system (HESS) with battery and supercapacitor (SC) is proposed in this paper. The proposed simple multimode HESS can achieve boost mode when energy flows from power sources to motor inverter to supply power and buck mode when the energy flows from the motor inverter to the SC to recover power. The flexible power management can be achieved with the simple multimode HESS. Meanwhile, a small number of switches and a simple structure is helpful to design control strategy. In addition, taking into account the fractional characteristics of the HESS circuit, a fractional model of the HESS operation mode is established, and a novel fractional sliding mode control strategy is proposed based on the above model. Simulations are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed simple multimode HESS. Results show that the fractional order control strategy has better dynamic performance when compared with integer-order control strategy under the condition of system startup and parameters changes.
