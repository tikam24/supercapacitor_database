Transition metal and transition metal sulfides have been widely used as electrode materials in the field of energy storage and conversion. In this work, we fabricate uniform and compact NiCu film on the surface of nickel foam (NF) by a facile filtered cathodic vacuum arc technique (NiCu/NF). Then the electrode is sulfurized via electrochemical process (NiCu 2 S 2 /NF), which possesses abundant electroactive sites. Both the electrodes display good electrochemical performance in methanol electrooxidation and supercapacitors, simultaneously. NiCu 2 S 2 /NF electrode exhibits higher electrocatalytic activity of 825 mA mg −1 for methanol oxidation in KOH solution. In supercapacitors, NiCu 2 S 2 /NF electrode delivers a superior specific capacity of 1975.2 C g −1 at 0.5 mA cm −2 and better rate capability. NiCu 2 S 2 /NF electrode exhibits an improved electrochemical activity. Particularly, NiCu/NF electrode displays a higher cycle stability (76.8% retention) after 3000 cycles at 10 mA cm −2 , owing to the stable adhesion of NiCu film. Hopefully, filtered cathodic vacuum arc technique can be applied to prepare binary transition metal, which can be simultaneously applied in fuel cells and supercapacitors.
