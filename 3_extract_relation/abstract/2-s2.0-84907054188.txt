With assistance of the inert salt KCl, two-dimensional mesoporous graphitized carbon sheets were synthesized by using Ni(NO3)2 · 9H2O as the metal catalyst and glucose as the carbon source. The morphology and structure of the title sheets were investigated by using the X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and nitrogen adsorption-desorption. The formation mechanism of the title sheets was suggested. The electrochemical performances of the title sheets as the electrode materials for supercapacitors were also studied. The results show that the specific surface area of the title sheets is as high as 989 m2 · g−1 when using 10 g KCl. The electrode shows a high capacitance of 180 F · g−1 in 6 mol · L−1 KOH electrolyte and a good rate capability with a capacitance retention of 80% at 10 A · g−1vs. 0.5 A · g−1. It also delivers an excellent cycling stability without capacitance fading over 2 000 cycles.
