In this paper, firstly Al5Y3O12 (YAG) has been synthesized without any impurities using pulse electrochemical deposition technology and then fabricated hybrid POAP/YAG films by electro-polymerization of POAP in the presence of YAG nanoparticles to serve as the active electrode for the electrochemical supercapacitor. Electrosynthesized YAG nanoparticles and POAP/YAG nanocomposites have been characterised by common surface analysis techniques such as scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Different electrochemical methods including galvanostatic charge-discharge (CD) experiments, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are carried out in order to investigate the performance of the system. This work introduces new nanocomposite materials for electrochemical redox capacitors with advantages including ease synthesis, high active surface area and stability in an aqueous electrolyte to that of commonly used ruthenium based perovskites.
