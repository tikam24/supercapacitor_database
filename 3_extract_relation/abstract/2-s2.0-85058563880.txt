The problem of reasonable allocation of demand power for electric vehicle equipped with battery and super capacitor is discussed. By studying the topology of the composite power supply circuit and the traditional fuzzy control strategy, an improved fuzzy control power allocation method is proposed; a fuzzy control model for driving and braking is established. Using the vehicle simulation software ADVISOR 2002, the secondary development of composite power is carried out on the foundation of pure electric vehicle.Compared with traditional fuzzy control strategy, the improved power allocation control strategy can reasonably control the power supply of the battery and supercapacitor to the power bus, and recover more braking feedback energy.
