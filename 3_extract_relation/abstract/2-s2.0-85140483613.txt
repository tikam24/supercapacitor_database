Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have received much attention in energy storage devices because of they offer three-dimensional open network, large surface area with tunable pore size distribution and low-cost constituents. Herein, nanostructured nickel hexacyanoferrate (III) (NCF) was easily synthesized by co-precipitation method and explored as a symmetrical supercapacitor device in different supporting electrolytes for the first time. Crystalline NCF nanoparticles (NPs) with an average size of 30 nm and large specific surface area (SBET) of 269 m2/g were obtained. Superior storage capabilities with battery-like behaviors were observed in 0.5 M KCl and 0.1 M KOH with specific capacitance values of 546 F/g and 1753 F/g at 5 A/g, respectively. Further, the NCF modified graphite screen-printed electrode (NCF/GSPE) showed excellent stability and storage retention even after 10,000 cycles. This significant achievement offers a promising strategy for achieving efficient, optimal and low-cost energy storage devices.
