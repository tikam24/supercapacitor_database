12 V / kilo-Farad (kF) range substrate-integrated lead-carbon hybrid ultracapacitors (HUCs) wherein the conventional positive plates of lead-acid batteries are replaced with substrate-integrated PbO2 positive plates and the negative plates are replaced with carbon-coated graphitic electrodes, providing totally non-faradaic and corrosion-free electrodes, are developed and performance tested. Constant-current discharge data at varying load-currents, constant-power discharge data at varying power values, and the capacitance data at different temperature for a 12 V / kF range substrate-integrated lead-carbon HUC are described along with its resistance, leakage current, self-discharge and cycle-life characteristics.
