MnO1.88/MnO2/Ti3C2Tx composites on Ti3C2Tx (MXenes) were synthesized for potential applications as supercapacitor electrodes. A composite with a cotton candy-like morphology was formed on nanometer-sized Ti3C2Tx flakes by redox reaction using KMnO4 at room temperature, where Ti3C2Tx acts both as a molecular template and as a reducing agent. MnO1.88/MnO2/Ti3C2Tx has a high specific capacity of 312 F g-1 at 1 A g-1, and the capacity retention was over 91% after 5000 charge-discharge cycles. As such, the facile preparation of MnO1.88/MnO2/Ti3C2Tx composites promotes the highly specific pseudo-capacitance of MXenes, which have emerged as highly promising electrode materials.
