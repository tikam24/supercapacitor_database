Porous hybrid nanosheets of g-C3N4/β-Ni(OH)2(CN/β-NiOH) were constructed via gas bubble method in the NiCl2.6H2O-NH3.H2O-C2H5OH-CN system at 140°C for 6h. The resulting CN(5.3wt.%)/β-NiOH nanosheets show a porous texture and a large interface contact area, which facilitates the electrolyte ion diffusion during reversible insertion/deinsertion processes. The fabricated CN(5.3wt.%)/β-NiOH hybrid-based electrode displays an enhanced specific capacitance of 887Fg-1 at a current density of 0.5Ag-1 when compared with single phase β-NiOH (480Fg-1). Using CN(5.3wt.%)/β-NiOH porous nanosheets and activated carbon (AC) as cathode and anode, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was assembled and the energy density achieves 28.3Whkg-1 and 10.9Whkg-1 at a power density of 798.4Wkg-1 and 7991.9Wkg-1, respectively.
