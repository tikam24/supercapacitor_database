In spite of the excellent electrical and electrochemical properties, two-dimensional transition metal carbide (MXene) is often limited by the high stiffness for the direct implementation in next-generation stretchable and wearable energy storage devices. The improved deformability has been achieved in ultrathin composite electrodes utilizing additives that substantially reduce the specific capacitance. Here, we demonstrate an ultrastretchable and high-performing supercapacitor based on MXene electrodes with crumpled textures. After screening on the thickness, the crumpled MXene film of ∼3 μm in thickness is identified as the optimal choice to mitigate the crack formations under large and repetitive mechanical strains. The as-prepared symmetric supercapacitor, therefore, demonstrates a high specific capacitance of ∼470 mF cm-2, ultrahigh stretchability up to 800% area strain, and >90% retention of the initial capacitance after 1000 stretch-relaxation cycles. The developments offer an attractive avenue to design stretchable electrodes based on various two-dimensional nanomaterials and their composites.
