The recent transition in power generation and consumption is based on the integration of renewable energy sources using DC microgrids. To facilitate this integration, a multi-source DC microgrid structure with wind, photovoltaics, fuel cell and hybrid energy storage system including battery and supercapacitor is presented in this paper. These sources are linked to a DC-bus via DC-DC converters. A hierarchical control strategy with a device and a system-level control for coordinated control between energy sources and their storage devices is proposed. In the device-level control, a variable structure based sliding mode control is applied to regulate the DC bus voltage and to ensure global asymptotic stability. Whereas, the system-level control compensates for the supply and demand mismatches by using a rule-based fuzzy system. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and the superiority of one controller over another, the proposed controllers are simulated and compared in the MATLAB/Simulink environment under varying load and weather data conditions. Results show that super twisting sliding mode control had negligible chattering as well as better convergence as compared to controllers. Furthermore, the efficiency of the developed scheme is validated by controller hardware in loop experiments.
