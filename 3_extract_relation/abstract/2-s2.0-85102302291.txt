Composited materials (NC/PDTDA) of nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NC) and partial poly (2, 2â€²-dithiodianiline) (PDTDA) have been successfully synthesized by in-situ polymerization and can be utilized in alkaline electrolytes as electrodes for supercapacitors. The physiochemical properties of NC/PDTDA composites materials are characterized by field emission scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectrum, X-ray electron spectrum, and X-ray diffraction. In addition, the electrochemical properties of NC/PDTDA composites materials are tested in 3 M KOH aqueous solution with a representative three-electrode system. It shows the highest specific capacitance when the mass ratio of NC to PDTDA is 1:2 (NC/PDTDA-2), and the specific capacitance is 490.5 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g. More significantly, the asymmetric supercapacitor is also assembled with an extended operating voltage window of 1.4 V in PAM-PVA- KOH electrolyte. It exhibits an energy density of 13.49 Wh/Kg at a power density of 699.8 W/Kg.
