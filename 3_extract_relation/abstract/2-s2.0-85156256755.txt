Interface engineering of heterostructures with defined characteristics is crucial to unravel their potential by ensuring the synergism in both structural and interface effects. This work unveils the potential of interface-engineered directly linked NiMOF-MoS2 hybrids for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution and electrochemical supercapacitor applications. Directly linked NiMOF with covalently functionalized defect-rich MoS2 nanosheets (by aminophenyl linkages) maintained their large surface area with active sites for adsorption of hydrogen atoms (Hads) during electrocatalysis, where the direct interconnection ensures the charge transfer to active sites across the interface. Owing to the synergistic effect of both morphology and electron distribution across the interface, the hybrids exhibited the highest hydrogen production with an onset overpotential of 469 mV (Tafel slope of 152 mV dec-1) and excellent specific capacitance (3807 F g-1) as compared with the sole functionalized MoS2 nanosheets.
