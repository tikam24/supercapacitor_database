The development of the Blue-Angel light HEV started already in its 1st generation in 1992. In 2006, the 3rd generation redesign, first as a HEV and later on as a full EV with range extender, was started. The current design-concept is presented in this paper. Emphasis is put on the energy storage integration with a so called SAM2 storage 3rd generation which stands in communication with the energy management of the appropriate building. This paper presents the integration of Blue-Angel in the strategic field of research "living and mobility" of CC IIEE1 of the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts as well as the V2G concept. In this concept, PHEVs and EVs can be utilized for harnessing renewable energy and for providing power for both residential and commercial customers. The amount and the direction of power flow amongst the sub-systems, which include the grid, renewable energy sources, household load and Blue-Angel is part of a new management system. The proposed system is an open and universal platform and is expected to gain popularity amongst both commercial and residential users interested in resolving the global energy crisis. The system components will be demonstrated in a show-area platform of the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts in Horw-Lucerne as well as in a local utility. Â© 2009 AVERE.
