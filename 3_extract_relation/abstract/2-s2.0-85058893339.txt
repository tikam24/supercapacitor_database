This paper proposes unconventional control techniques for a portable power supply consisting of electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), a DC-DC converter, and a low-impedance load such a plasma load. Between the EDLCs and the plasma load consuming high power, a DC-DC converter is required to control the output voltage from the rapidly decreasing voltage of EDLCs. In addition, the DC-DC converter should maintain a set point by responding to arcs occurred in plasma process. This paper proposed hybrid analog and digital controls for a nonideal boost converter which was setup by theoretical analysis. The proposed system is verified with experiment and simulation. As a result, the proposed control method can maintain the constant output voltage longer than a traditional analog pulsewidth modulation control.
