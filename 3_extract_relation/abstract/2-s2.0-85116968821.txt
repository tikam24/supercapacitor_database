The components in traditional humanâ€“machine interaction (HMI) systems are relatively independent, distributed and low-integrated, and the wearing experience is poor when the system adopts wearable electronics for intelligent control. The continuous and stable operation of every part always poses challenges for energy supply. In this work, a triboelectric technology-based all-in-one self-powered HMI system for wireless remote telemetry and the control of intelligent cars is proposed. The dual-network crosslinking hydrogel was synthesized and wrapped with functional layers to fabricate a stretchable fibrous triboelectric nanogenerator (SF-TENG) and a supercapacitor (SF-SC), respectively. A self-charging power unit containing woven SF-TENGs, SF-SCs, and a power management circuit was exploited to harvest mechanical energy from the human body and provided power for the whole system. A smart glove designed with five SF-TENGs on the dorsum of five fingers acts as a gesture sensor to generate signal permutations. The signals were processed by the microcontroller and then wirelessly transmitted to the intelligent car for remote telemetry and control. This work is of paramount potential for the application of various terminal devices in self-powered HMI systems with high integration for wearable electronics.
