The restacking of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) with undesirable energy density and power density is still a thorny issue. In our work, we proposed a simple strategy from incorporating ionic liquid (IL) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in turn to impede the RGO sheets aggragation. With synergistic effect of IL ions intercalation and MWCNTs spacers, a uniformly dispersed hierarchical pore structure was obtained. For RGO-IL-MWCNTs, a very high specific surface area (588.7 m2 g−1) with enhanced fraction of mesopores and macropores can provide more accessible areas and pathways for charge accommodation and IL diffusion. This optimized hierarchical pore structure possesses a high specific capacity of 269.3 F g−1 (at 2 mV s−1) and a very high energy density of 131.8 Wh kg−1 (at a power density of 892.6 W kg−1) in pure IL electrolyte at room temperature. Interestingly, this simple method probably offers excellent potential for large-scale production of dispersed two-dimensional layered materials with superior performance.
