A nanoflower structure of Zn0.76Co0.24S directly grown on carbon fiber papers (CFP) was successfully designed by a mild two-step hydrothermal method. Benefiting from their fascinating structural features, Zn0.76Co0.24S/CFP electrode exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 300Fg-1 at current density of 1Ag-1 and 84% capacitance retention after 5,000 cycles at current density of 5Ag-1. Subsequently, Zn0.76Co0.24S/CFP//AC all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device is assembled and able to illuminate the red LEDs. ASC devices deliver a maximum energy density of 9.59Whkg-1 at a power density of 750Wkg-1. Therefore, this impressive result demonstrates that the nanoflower Zn0.76Co0.24S have promising applications in the development of high-performance supercapacitors.
