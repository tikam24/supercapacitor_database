Currently, selected materials integration transition metal oxides have allured great attention as favorable electrode materials for supercapacitors (SCs), but their recognition at the same time was still a valuable challenging exercise. Mn-Co Oxide nanostructure was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Scanning electron microscope (SEM), and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. The as-obtained Mn-Co oxide nano-sticks & flake-type arrays (NSFAs) having boost electrochemical activity. Remarkably, the Mn-Co oxide nano-sticks & flake-type arrays exhibits an marvelous specific capacity of 852 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1, notable rate performance of 82% even at 15 A g−1 along with notable cycling behavior of 92.9% through 4000 cycles at 3 A g−1 in 2 M KOH electrolyte. Finally, the remarkable/enhanced electrochemical activities show that the Mn-Co Oxide NSFAs as a favored-like electrode material holds substantial potential for energy storage applications.
