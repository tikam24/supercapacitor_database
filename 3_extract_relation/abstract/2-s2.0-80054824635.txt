We report three-dimensional bicontinuous nanoporous Au/polyaniline (PANI) composite films made by one-step electrochemical polymerization of PANI shell onto dealloyed nanoporous gold (NPG) skeletons for the applications in electrochemical supercapacitors. The NPG/PANI based supercapacitors exhibit ultrahigh volumetric capacitance (∼1500 F cm-3) and energy density (∼0.078 Wh cm-3), which are seven and four orders of magnitude higher than these of electrolytic capacitors, with the same power density up to ∼190 W cm-3. The outstanding capacitive performances result from a novel nanoarchitecture in which pseudocapacitive PANI shells are incorporated into pore channels of highly conductive NPG, making them promising candidates as electrode materials in supercapacitor devices combing high-energy storage densities with high-power delivery. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.
