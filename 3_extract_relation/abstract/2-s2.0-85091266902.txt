The main purpose of the research is to check an influence of supercapacitors as the elements increasing the efficiency of short-period energy storage in photovoltaic installations. Their task will be to substitute the batteries or enhance their performance as the energy bank. For the model storage setup consisting of six supercapacitors, the work charge-discharge characteristics were determined. Additionally, an influence of storage time on the amount of charge accumulated inside the battery was tested. Then the examined setup was coupled with a conventional PV module by the charge regulator system and tested in laboratory and under real operating conditions. Obtained results proved that the use of supercapacitors as buffer elements in energy storage system of photovoltaic installation can significantly increase operation lifetime and reliability.
