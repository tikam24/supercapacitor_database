The symmetric supercapacitor device is efficiently invented using two identical sprayed nickel oxide thin film electrodes equipped via an aqueous path. Firstly, we did a comparative study of structural, morphological and electrochemical characterizations of nickel oxide electrodes which are prepared by varying concentrations of the precursors (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0 M and renamed according to their concentration as AC (Aqueous Concentration) AC-1, AC-2, AC-3, AC-4 and AC-5 respectively). XRD patterns of all electrodes confirm cubic crystal structure. The highest value of specific capacitance of NiO@AC-4 (0.8 M) electrode is 256.32 Fg−1 at 0.002 Vs−1 which is the maximum among all electrodes. The specific energy and specific power of the AC-4 electrode at 0.002 Acm−1 are 29.08 Whkg−1 and 3.06 kWkg−1 respectively. NiO@AC-4 electrode shows 69.42% retention in capacitance value after 5000 cyclic voltammetric cycles. The fabricated device parades specific capacitance (SC) 92.81 Fg−1 at 0.002 Vs−1. The wettability study depicts the hydrophilic nature of all electrodes (except the NiO@AC-1 electrode). As concentration increases morphology of the prepared electrodes changes from impenetrable to porous micro globules. SEAD pattern rings and XPS investigation are well matched with XRD analysis.
