In this study, LaNiO3 nanoparticles are synthesized by co-precipitation method and annealed at different temperatures. Structure and morphology of the samples are analyzed by XRD and SEM. The electrochemical performance of the prepared samples as an active material for supercapacitor is evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, Galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The obtained result reveals that the prepared LaNiO3 at 700Â°C exhibit higher capacitance value of 206.37 Fg-1 at scan rate of 2 mVs-1 and 212.86 Fg-1 at current density of 2 Ag-1. The excellent capacitive performance of LaNiO3 offers great promise for high performance supercapacitors.
