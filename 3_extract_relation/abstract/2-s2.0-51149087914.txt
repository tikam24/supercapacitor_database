MnO2 powders were prepared by the molten salt method at different temperatures. X-ray diffraction results indicate that the MnO2 powders consist of α-MnO2 and γ-MnO2. Moreover, the crystallinity of MnO2 powder becomes higher with the increasing of reaction temperature. An experimental electrode was prepared by mixing MnO2 with graphite, acetylene black, polytetrafluoroethylene and carboxymethyl cellulose at a mass ratio of 75:10:10:2:3, and pressed under 10 MPa. The electrochemical properties of the electrode were measured by a three-electrode system in 2 mol/L (NH4)2SO4 solution. The results show that the supercapacitor performance of the electrode sample with MnO2 powder is greatly affected by the reaction temperature of MnO2 preparation. The sample with the MnO2 powder prepared at 450°C has the best supercapacitor performance. The results of cyclic voltampere curves show that the sample represents rectangular shape performance in the potential range of 0-1.0 V. Alternating current impedance measurement shows that the sample has typical capacity impedance characterization; its equivalent series resistance is 0.064Ω and the electrode reaction resistance is 2.825Ω. When charged and discharged at a constant current of 2 mA/cm2, the discharge specific capacity of the MnO2 electrode sample can reach 246.46 F/g.
