A H2SO4-Ti3C2Tx ion-gel is in situ fabricated to prevent the restacking of Ti3C2Tx for high-rate micro-supercapacitors. The ion-gel pillared by an electrolyte possesses an enlarged interlayer spacing facilitating ion transport. Furthermore, a bilayer structure is designed with dry Ti3C2Tx for fast electron conduction. The bilayer Ti3C2Tx film shows improved capacitance from 49% to 73% of the initial capacitance at a high scan rate of 200 mV sâˆ’1, along with excellent cycle stability. This study opens up a concise and efficient way for high-performance micro-supercapacitors.
