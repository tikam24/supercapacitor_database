This paper proposes a low voltage ride through(LVRT) scheme of doubly fed induction generator(DFIG) based on the supercapacitors energy storage. The novel control strategy of the bi-directional converter and the grid side converter is established. Simulation model of the DFIG system is developed. Simulation results show that the presented scheme can efficiently reduce the DC-link overvoltage, supply reactive power to the power system through grid side converter, and help grid recovery under system fault, improving the LVRT capability of the system.
