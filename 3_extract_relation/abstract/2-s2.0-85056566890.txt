MnO2, a metal oxide used as an electrode material in electrochemical capacitors (EDLCs), has been applied in binary oxide and conducting polymer hybrid electrodes to increase their stability and capacitance. We developed a method for elec-trodepositing Mn-Ni oxide/PANI, Mn-Ni oxide/PEDOT, and Mn-Ni-Ru oxide/PEDOT films on carbon paper in a single step using a mixed bath. Mn-Ni oxide/PEDOT and Mn-Ni-Ru oxide/PEDOT electrodes used in an electro-osmotic pump (EOP) have shown better efficiency compared to Mn-Ni oxide and Mn-Ni oxide/PANI electrodes through testing in water as a pumping solution. EOP using a Mn-Ni-Ru oxide/PEDOT electrode was also tested in a 0.5 mM Li2SO4 solution as a pumping solution to confirm the effect of the Li+ insertion/de-insertion reaction of Ruthenium oxide on the EOP. Experimental results show that the flow rate increases with the increase in current in a 0.5 mM Li2SO4 solution compared to that obtained when water was used as a pumping solution.
