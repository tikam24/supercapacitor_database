In this paper, high performance supercapacitor based on electrochemical reduced graphene oxide (ERGO)-polyaniline (PANI) nanocomposite film was prepared in facile two steps. ERGO sheets synthesized on surface of glassy carbon electrode (GCE) by an effective and environment-friendly electrochemical reduction of graphene oxide (GO), followed PANI formed on ERGO surface via cyclic voltammetry electrodeposition at potential window −0.20 to 0.80 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Electrochemical results indicate that ERGO-PANI nanocomposites exhibit a good capacitance performance with maximum specific capacitance of 1084 Fg−1, and high specific energy density of 53.12 Wh kg−1 with specific power density of 500.61 W kg−1 at a current density of 3.22 mA cm−2 in 1 M H2SO4 aqueous solution. Improved electrochemical performance of the nanocomposites arises from synergistic combination of electrically conductive ERGO and highly capacitive behavior of PANI. Therefore, the ERGO-PANI nanocomposite electrodes are promising candidate for application in energy storage devices. Moreover, the products have been successfully characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transformation spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM).
