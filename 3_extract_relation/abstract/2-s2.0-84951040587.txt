The proceedings contain 15 papers. The topics discussed include: top-gate organic field-effect transistors fabricated on shapememory polymer substrates; organic transistors for electrophysiology; transcap: a new integrated hybrid supercapacitor and electrolytegated transistor device; deposition of composite materials using a wire-bar coater for achieving processability and air-stability in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs); polymorphism in the organic charge-transfer complex dibenzotetrathiafulvalene-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (DBTTF-TCNQ) and its effect on optical and electrical properties; fabrication of water-stable organic transistors using crystalline rubrene thin-film and polymer-treated dielectric; and charge transport and device physics of layered-crystalline organic semiconductors.
