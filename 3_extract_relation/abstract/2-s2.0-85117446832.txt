Bidirectional DC/DC converters are widely used in hybrid DC power supply systems. Aiming at the hybrid power supply system of electric vehicle supercapacitor and battery, the article takes the new interleaved parallel Buck/Boost converter as the research object and uses the state space averaging method to establish the AC small signal model under the Boost state continuous mode (CCM). We get the open-loop transfer function of the circuit model. Aiming at the V2G load characteristics of electric vehicles, an optimal configuration model of harmonic suppression devices with the smallest sum of investment and network loss for harmonic suppression was established. The research shows that the model effectively improves the operating voltage level and reduces the network loss.
