α-Fe2O3 thin films were deposited through spray pyrolysis technique with different precursor solution concentrations i.e. (0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 M) of iron nitrate at optimized 400 °C temperature. The effect of precursor concentrations on material properties such as structural, morphological, contact angle and electrochemical supercapacitive were explored. Structural analysis, using X-ray diffraction confirmed the hexagonal phase of the films polycrystalline in nature. The Scanning electron microscopy showed large area grannual morphology. Contact angle analysis of α-Fe2O3 thin films illustrated hydrophobic in nature. The supercapacitive performance of Fe2O3 thin film electrodes were explored in 1M NaOH aqueous electrolyte. The specific capacitance was decreased from 277 F g−1 to 196 F g−1 as the concentrations of precursor solution varied from 0.05 to 0.2 M.
