Microwave irradiation was used to create Nb2O5/MoS2 nanocomposites. The composite was self-assembled from flaky MoS2 and Nb2O5 nanotubes, according to structural and performance studies. Cyclic voltammetry, the timed potential method, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were employed to investigate the electrochemical properties. The specific capacitance of Nb2O5/MoS2 nanocomposites (628 F/g) was greater than that of pure Nb2O5 nanoparticles (183 F/g) and MoS2 at a current density of 1 A/g (125 F/g). Cyclic properties confirmed that the nanocomposites had higher cyclic stability, with a capacitance retention rate of 90.6 % after 5000 cycles. Dynamic analysis revealed that large conductive networks ensured Nb2O5/MoS2 electrochemical performance. The specific capacitance of the Nb2O5/MoS2 composite has increased, allowing efficient transport of ions and charges across the electrode surface with electrolytes. According to electrochemical studies, Nb2O5/MoS2 nanocomposites have the potential to be effective electrodes for high-performance supercapacitor applications.
