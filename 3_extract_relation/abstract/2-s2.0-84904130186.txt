Lithium-ion capacitors (LiCs) are novel storage devices with a high power density and high energy density compared to conventional supercapacitors (SCs). This paper proposes a method to validate the previously developed characterization and modeling methods, which are the same as those used for a conventional SC with double-layer-activated carbon technology. This paper presents two relevant contributions. First, a full frequency range model and the experimental parameter identification of two kinds of LiC cells are presented. In order to extend the LiC cell parameter identification to a module composed of several series-connected cells, an aggregate model of the LiC module was investigated and validated. The results of experiments and numerical simulations demonstrate the value and effectiveness of the proposed model when the cells operate at room temperature. Â© 2010-2012 IEEE.
