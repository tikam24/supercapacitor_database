This mini review describes the synthesis and properties of carbon nanostructures containing organic-inorganic cage-like polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) nanoparticles. The physical and chemical functionalization of carbon nanomaterials such as graphene, graphene oxide, carbon nanotubes, and fullerenes with POSS towards the development of novel hybrid nanostructures is described in detail. Special emphasis is given to the potential impact of these hybrid nanostructures on various technological applications.
