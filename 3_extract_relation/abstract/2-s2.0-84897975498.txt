Carbon nanotubes have been successfully coated with a N-doped carbon layer via hydrothermal carbonization in the presence of a nitrogen-containing carbohydrate, i.e., glucosamine hydrochloride. By controlling the amount of glucosamine added, it was possible to tune the N content of the composites N-doped carbon/CNT between 1.8-2.5 wt %. The prepared composites exhibited superior supercapacitor performance in comparison to bare CNTs even though they possess lower textural properties. Thus, a 2- to 4-fold increase in specific capacitance per surface area was registered at low current densities and sweep rates and a 2-fold increase in energy density, while keeping the power density. Besides, the composites possess superb long-term stability, losing only 4-6% of specific capacitance after 10,000 cycles at 10 A g-1. Â© 2014 American Chemical Society.
