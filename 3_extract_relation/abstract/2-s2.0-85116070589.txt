This paper presents a combined control and modulation technique to enhance the power quality (PQ) and power reliability (PR) of a hybrid energy system (HES) through a single-phase 11-level cascaded H-bridge inverter (11-CHBI). The controller and inverter specifically regulate the HES and meet the load demand. To track optimum power, a Modified Perturb and Observe (MP&O) technique is used for HES. Ultra-capacitor (UCAP) based energy storage device and a novel current control strategy are proposed to provide additional active power support during both voltage sag and swell conditions. For an improved PQ and PR, a two-way current control strategy such as the main controller (MC) and auxiliary controller (AC) is suggested for the 11-CHBI operation. MC is used to regulate the active current component through the fuzzy controller (FC), and AC is used to regulate the dc-link voltage of CHBI through a neural network-based PI controller (ANN-PI). By tracking the reference signals from MC and AC, a novel hybrid pulse width modulation (HPWM) technique is proposed for the 11-CHBI operation. To justify and analyze the MATLAB/Simulink software-based designed model, the robust controller performance is tested through numerous steady-state and dynamic state case studies.
