In the present work, two-dimensional α-Fe2O3/rGO nanocomposites were fabricated by one-pot solvothermal approach. Structural and morphological studies showed that the as-prepared α-Fe2O3/rGO nanocomposites were actually composed of α-Fe2O3 nanoplates encapsulated in rGO nanosheets to form two-dimensional nanostructure. As an electrode material for supercapacitor, the specific capacitances of α-Fe2O3/rGO nanocomposites was 903Fg-1 at the current density of 1Ag-1, which is superior to that of bare α-Fe2O3 nanoplates. The α-Fe2O3/rGO nanocomposites with high electrical conductivity and nanostructure allows for effective ion and charge transport in the whole electrode. The results enable the α-Fe2O3/rGO nanocomposites to be promising materials for high performance energy-storage systems.
