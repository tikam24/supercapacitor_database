Power quality claims to be one of the major concern in the area of electric power systems and it has serious economic influences on high technology equipment related to automation, advanced control, on-line services. Voltage sag is a very important power quality issue which imposes a sudden reduction in voltage magnitude with duration ranging from half of a cycle up to one minute. Hence, for power quality improvement, here custom power devices are being used. Dynamic voltage restorer is having a supreme position among the custom power devices due to its inevitable role in the voltage compensation of sensitive loads. Even under high load conditions, Ultracapacitor is the most efficient energy storage devices with 85-90 % efficiency. Also on considering long life, safety in operation time, wide temperature range and less maintenance cost it is the best option as energy storage device. Therefore, the inclusion of Ultracapacitor as an energy storage system will only be aiding the benefits behind choosing DVR as the prime choice in mitigating power quality issues. By integrating ultracapacitor with DVR, compensation of voltage sag can be done in a most efficient manner. The compensation of voltage sag and related power quality issues was successfully simulated and validated results in MATLAB platform.
