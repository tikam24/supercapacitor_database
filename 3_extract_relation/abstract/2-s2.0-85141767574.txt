Multicomponent heterogeneous nanomaterials generally have the potential to exhibit excellent electrochemical performance. Herein, Mn-doped Ni(OH)2, NiO and C heterogeneous composites are designed and synthesized by using metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as self-sacrificial templates. The synergistic effect brought by the multicomponent heterogeneous composition effectively improves the charge storage capacity, the two-dimensional nanosheet structure provides a large specific surface area, and the graphitic carbon enhances the electrical conductivity. The Mn-Ni(OH)2/NiO@C composite as an electrode material exhibits a specific capacity of 732.1 C g−1 at 1 A g−1. Furthermore, the assembled Mn-Ni(OH)2/NiO@C//AC HSC device can output 38.0 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 849.2 W Kg−1, with 82.9% retention after 5000 cycles. This study provides a novel strategy for MOFs as templates to obtain multicomponent energy storage materials.
