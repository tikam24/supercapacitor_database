Nitrogen-doped graphene aerogel (NGae) with three-dimensional interconnected structure wassynthesized by a hydrothermal reduction of graphene oxide with hydrazine and a following freezing-dry method.The 3D morphology of conductive NGae provides diffusion pathways for electron and iontransportation. Also, the nitrogen-containing groups can store charges via surface redox reactions. Theas-fabricated NGae symmetric supercapacitor (CR20I6) in I M H2S04 electrolyteprovides a specific capacitance of 470.45 F g-1 at an applied current of 1 mA with maximum energydensity and power density of 41.71 Wh kg-1 and 2442.47 W kg-1, respectively.Incorporating Mn02 and polyaniline to NGae structure can provide higher specific powerand/or energy. The as-fabricated supercapacitors in this work may be practically used in high energy and powerapplications.
