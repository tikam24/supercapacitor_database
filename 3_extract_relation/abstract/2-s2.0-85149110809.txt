The design and synthesis of one-dimensional (1D) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with a high surface area are crucial for their potential usage in supercapacitor applications. 1D-Ni-MIL-77 MOF, synthesized by a one-step solvothermal method, is used here to investigate its activity in supercapacitor applications. High surface-to-volume ratios and short ion diffusion path lengths in 1D-structured nanomaterials result in high charge/discharge rates. 1D-Ni-MIL-77 MOF nanobelts show a high surface area of 93.48 m2 g-1 that gives ample active electrochemical sites. 1D-Ni-MIL-77 shows a specific capacitance (C) value of 1376 F g-1 under the current of 1 A g-1. Additionally, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was assembled by employing activated carbon as the negative electrode and a 1D-Ni-MIL-77 nanobelt as the positive electrode. With the assembled ASC, at a power density of 750 W kg-1, an energy density of 25 W h kg-1 was attained with a voltage ranging from 0 to 1.5 V. The cyclic durability of the ASC was examined, and it exhibited excellent retention of 95% of its initial capacitance after 5000 cycles.
