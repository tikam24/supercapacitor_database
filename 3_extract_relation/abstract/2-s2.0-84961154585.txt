In order to realize the voltage stabilization of rail transportation traction grid efficiently, a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) composed of lithium batteries and supercapacitors is presented for application in the DC power supply system to absorb and release the regenerative braking energy. Through studying the coordination control strategy of HESS, the control models are set up and simulated in MATLAB/Simulink. It can be seen from the simulation results that the control strategy makes the HESS well stabilize the traction grid voltage within an appropriate operating range. Moreover, the battery pack and the supercapacitor pack are both used in their optimal working states, causing the HESS to recycle the braking energy availably and satisfy the purposes of clean energy and green travel of rail transportation commendably.
