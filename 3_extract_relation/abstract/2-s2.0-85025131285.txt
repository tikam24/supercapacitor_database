Public transport is the basic need for transportation in any country. It is crucial to run the vehicle on green fuel or electrical supply. Electrical energy storage system has been a most extensive area in the automotive research. Hybrid storage system (HSS) based on battery and supercapacitor has the promising & optimized concept in the area of providing the input source to the driving system for the last decade. Storage system can affect the efficiency of the drive. Dempster Shafer Theory (DST) is based on probabilistic results and also includes the degree of possibility and certainty for the specific results. This paper represents Charge management technique in HSS by DST which is preferable for E-bus drive.
