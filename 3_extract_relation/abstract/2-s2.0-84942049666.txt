Four-factor power allocation strategy for the hybrid power system is proposed by selecting the motor required power, the battery state of charge (SOC) as switching between charge-depleting (CD) and charge-sustaining (CS), the super-capacitor upper limit of SOC, and the battery maximum constant discharge power from the point of hybrid power system model. Analyzing the super-capacitor energy efficiency and the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle operating environment and electric mechanism, and adopting control variable method, two different kinds of allocation strategies are established by combining clutch and speed and judging charging states of the super-capacitor in hybrid drive on CD. Compared with the control strategy based on the average motor power, the fuel economy of the strategy fully on CD reaches the most efficiency, which rises by 3.15%. The trend curves of influence of each factor on the integrated fuel consumption are drawn with the optimization results of SA to guide to construct power allocation strategy for hybrid power system.
