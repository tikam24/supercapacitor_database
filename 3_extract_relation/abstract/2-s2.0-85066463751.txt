Carbon nanomaterials with remarkable capacitance are highly notable. Although electronic double-layer capacitors exhibit high power density, their low energy density blocks the practical utility of these carbon materials. Herein, a type of porous-carbon nanoarchitecture with significant capacitive performance is successfully synthesized using a ZnO template and KOH activation. Benefiting from its excellent conductivity, ultrahigh surface area, and porous architecture, the as-prepared porous carbon delivers a high capacitance of 245.4 mF cm−2 at a current density of 2 mA cm−2 with impressive rate performance. Moreover, it shows superior cycling durability with more than 99% capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles. A cost-effective, eco-friendly, and promising strategy is proposed for the large-scale preparation of porous-carbon nanomaterial electrodes.
