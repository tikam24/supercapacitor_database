The research presented in this paper documents the implementation of an active hybrid energy storage system that combined a battery pack and an ultracapacitor bank. The implemented hybrid energy storage system was used to reduce the peak-power that the battery needs to provide to the load. An active topology utilising two direct current/direct current (DC/DC) converters and a switch was used to implement the hybrid energy storage system. Fuzzy logic was used as a close-loop control structure to control the DC/DC converters in the topology, whilst a rule-based control strategy was used to control the operating states of the hybrid energy storage system. Experimental implementation of the system showed that the system was able to actively control the energy flow throughout the hybrid energy storage system in order to limit the power drawn from the battery to a user-defined limit. The performance of the fuzzy logic controllers was also experimentally found to be sufficient when used in conjunction with the rule-based control strategy. The system allows one to utilize batteries that are optimized for energy density seeing that the system was able to actively limit the power drawn from the battery, whilst providing the required power to the load by utilising the ultracapacitor bank.
