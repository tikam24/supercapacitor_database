A high energy density asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is assembled utilizing polyaniline (PANI) nanotubes as the positive electrode and tungsten trioxide (WO<inf>3</inf>) rods as the negative electrode. The PANI nanotubes are synthesized via a simple chemical template-free method in the presence of D-tartaric acid as the dopant, and ammonium persulfate as the oxidant, and the WO<inf>3</inf> rods are synthesized via a simple hydrothermal process in the presence of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose as a template. The PANI//WO<inf>3</inf> ASC device operates with a voltage of 2.0 V and achieved a remarkable specific capacitance of 151 F g<sup>−1</sup> at a charge/discharge current density of 0.25 A g<sup>−1</sup> and a high energy density of 41.9 Wh kg<sup>−1</sup> at a power density of 261 W kg<sup>−1</sup>. Furthermore, the device showed an excellent charge/discharge cycling performance in 1 M H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> electrolyte, with capacitance retention of 71 % after 10,000 cycles. The high performance of the supercapacitor is due to the unique structure of the electrode materials which can provide high electrode/electrolyte contact area and make electrochemical reaction quickly.
