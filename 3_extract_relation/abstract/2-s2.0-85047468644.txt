This paper reports the synthesis of MnO2 nanorods by a facile hydrothermal method for supercapacitor applications. Lanthanum and cerium at different weight ratios were mixed to alter the morphology of the MnO2 nanomaterials. The crystalline nature and morphology of the synthesized MnO2 nanocomposites were examined by powder XRD and field emission scanning electron microscopy, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry, charge−discharge measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used to examine the electrochemical performance of La and Ce-mixed MnO2 nanocomposite. The 1La3Ce−MnO2 nanocomposite electrode exhibited a high specific capacitance of 575.25 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. Carbon nanotubes, reduced graphene oxide, and activated carbon materials were mixed with the 1La3Ce−MnO2 nanocomposite to improve the electrochemical performance. Among the three different electrodes, the rGO-mixed 1La3Ce−MnO2 nanocomposite electrode exhibited a relatively high specific capacitance of 951.25 F g−1 with a high energy density of 84.56 Wh kg−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. A rGO@1La3Ce−MnO2/rGO@1La3Ce−MnO2 symmetric supercapacitor device was also fabricated and its electrochemical behavior was studied. The analyses showed that the rGO-mixed 1La3Ce−MnO2 nanocomposite is a suitable material for supercapacitor electrode fabrication.
