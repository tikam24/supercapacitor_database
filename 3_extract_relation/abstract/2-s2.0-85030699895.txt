A facile method of preparing LiMnPO 4 /reduced graphene oxide aerogel (LMP/rGO) as cathodic material was reported here. LiMnPO 4 nano-particles were prepared using a facile polyvinyl pyrrolidone-assisted solvothermal route. Then LMP/rGO aerogel was prepared using the accessible restacking method. The influence of the cathodic electrode composition (ratio of rGO to LiMnPO 4 ) on the performance of the LMP/rGO was evaluated by constant-current discharge tests. When compared with 217C g −1 for the pristine LMP, the best LMP/rGO (the content of rGO is 27.3 wt%) exhibits a higher capacity of 464.5C g −1 (at 0.5 A g −1 ), which presenting the capacity enhance of 114%. Moreover, a lithium-ion hybrid supercapacitor (LIHS) was successfully assembled by using LMP/rGO aerogel as the cathodic electrode and rGO aerogel as the anodic electrode. The LMP/rGO//rGO device achieves excellent specific energy of 16.46 W h kg −1 at a power density of 0.38 kW kg −1 , even under the higher specific power of 4.52 kW kg −1 , there still holds the specific energy of 11.79 W h kg −1 . The LMP/rGO//rGO device maintains 91.2% of the initial capacity after 10,000 cycles (at 2 A g −1 ), which displays high rate performance and long cycle life. The 3D LMP/rGO aerogel could be a promising candidate material for the lithium-ion hybrid supercapacitors.
