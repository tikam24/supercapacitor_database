Nonvolatile, ion-dense electrolytes, such as ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are attractive candidates for safe, high-performance electrochemical/electrostatic energy storage devices. In this report, an inexpensive and eco-friendly DES (1 : 2 mixture of choline chloride/ethylene glycol) has been incorporated into a solid-state gel electrolyte using a chemically cross-linked polymer scaffold formed through in situ UV copolymerization of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate. A high room-temperature ionic conductivity of 5.7 mS cm−1 has been obtained for a DES gel containing 13.2 vol % polymer scaffold. Tunable DES gel compressive elastic modulus values, between 14 kPa and 1.0 MPa, could be obtained by varying the polymer content. Clear evidence of hydrogen-bonding interactions between the poly(HEMA) scaffold and the DES anion was revealed through species self-diffusivity measurements as well as by FTIR spectroscopy. Using a 22.9 vol % polymer-supported DES gel as electrolyte/separator in a supercapacitor prototype with activated carbon fabric electrodes, a specific capacitance of 33.3 F g−1 and an energy density of 15.8 Wh kg−1 (based on the mass of two electrodes) were obtained during discharge at a current density of 0.01 A g−1. This work supports the notion that chemically cross-linked polymer-supported DES gel electrolytes are suitable for solid-state, flexible supercapacitor applications.
