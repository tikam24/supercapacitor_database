Porous graphene ribbons are continuously fabricated and used as electrodes in all-solid-state supercapacitors. Their unique structure effectively prevents the inter-sheet restacking of graphene sheets and fully exploits the large surface area of graphene sheets for energy storage. The resultant symmetric all-solid-state yarn supercapacitor has a high specific capacitance of 208.7F/g (78.3mF/cm2 or 3.12mF/cm) and a high cycling stability (99% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles). Furthermore, the supercapacitor is flexible and its performance is only reduced by 5% after 100 bending cycles when weaved into a glove.
