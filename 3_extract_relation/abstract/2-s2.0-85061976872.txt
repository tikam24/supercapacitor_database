Graphene/polyaniline nanocomposites have attracted tremendous attention of the researchers because of their significant potential in the energy storage filed, especially supercapacitors. Polyaniline(PANI)is one of ideal electrode materials, due to high theoretical specific capacity and facile synthesis. However, its drawback is poor cycling life. Graphene(GN)possesses a high theoretical specific surface area and composites of polyaniline with graphene derivatives are used to acquire excellent electrochemical capacitive properties on account of the synergistic effect between the two components. In this feature article, new research results and important advances over the past few years on the synthesis of graphene-polyaniline based nanocomposite for electrochemical supercapacitors are reviewed. And we discuss how to improve the structure and performance of electrodes. In the meantime, the application of electrode materials blended with graphene-polyaniline for organic supercapacitors is introduced. Eventually, the application prospects of graphene-polyaniline nanocomposites are briefly described. The progress of graphene/polyaniline nanocomposites in the fields of supercapacitor depends on the appropriate microstructure design of the composites. The construction of an ideal 3D porous structure is one of research interests which is used to avoid the expansion and contraction of polyaniline. Furthermore, it is still difficult to find the balance between the performance and functionalization of graphene while improving the weak interfacial interaction between graphene and polyaniline. PANI-based nanocomposites with excellent mechanical properties can also play a vital role in the study of flexible quasi-solid-state supercapacitors.
