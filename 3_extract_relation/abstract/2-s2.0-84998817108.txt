In this study, microporous pyropolymers (GL-AMPs), a carbon-based material, were fabricated from ginkgo leaves by simple pyrolysis with KOH, followed by acid treatment. The GL-AMPs were mainly composed of aromatic hexagonal carbon layers, which were not well stacked, and contained many redox-active heteroatoms such as oxygen and nitrogen. In addition, the GL-AMPs had a high specific surface area of ∼1348.4 m2 g−1 with numerous ultramicropores (<0.7 nm). These unique material characteristics led to a significantly high specific capacitance of ∼731 F g−1, high rate capabilities, and stable cycling performance over 1000 cycles in a redox-mediated aqueous electrolyte.
