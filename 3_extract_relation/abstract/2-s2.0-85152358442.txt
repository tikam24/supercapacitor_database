Electrifying rural areas using a PV system combined with a diesel generator is one of the solutions to address geographical difficulties. However, the system could introduce power quality problems. Implementing a hybrid energy storage system could be one of the solutions to mitigate power quality issues. This paper investigates a hybrid energy storage of battery and supercapacitor to improve the power quality of a PV-diesel off-grid system. The system was modeled and simulated using Matlab Simulink, with reference to the system's characteristics in a remote area in Indonesia. It was shown that the implementation of a hybrid energy storage system could mitigate voltage sags and improve battery life expectancy, which are common issues in remote areas. The higher battery life is important for the context of remote areas given the difficulties in battery replacement due to geographical challenges.
