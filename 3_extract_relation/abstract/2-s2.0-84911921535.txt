Three-dimensional reduction of graphene oxide with a series of different degrees of reduction was performed by the hydrothermal method in the temperature range from 120 to 220 °C, with graphene oxide sols as the precursor and prepared by graphite oxide gels. The effect of the temperature of the hydrothermal reaction on the materials¹ appearance, structure, and super capacitor performance was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electrochemical measurements. The results show that the prepared three dimensional reduction of graphene oxide was porous and reticulated, and its volume and inner mesh aperture gradually decreased with increasing temperature, while its degree of reduction and order increased at the same time, and its structure gradually transformed to the graphite oxide structure. However, thematerials′ specific capacitance and energy density showed the tendency of first increasing and then decreasing, with the electric double-layer capacitor mainly remaining. The three-dimensional reduction of graphene oxide materials at 180 °C resulted in the best super capacitor performance, with a specific capacitance of 315 F∙g-1 when the current density was 0.5 A∙g-1 and 212 F∙g-1 when the current density was 10 A∙g-1. Its energy density was 40.5 Wh∙kg-1 and its specific capacitance was 86% after 5000 cycles, with all these properties indicating its good super capacitor performance.
