Three-dimensional nitrogen-doped graphene frameworks (3DNGFs) hold great promise in the application of supercapacitors for the advantages of superior conductivity, well-connected porous structure, and additional N-containing active sites for charge storage. Nevertheless, the developed techniques for preparing 3DNGFs always suffer from the drawbacks of high cost or complex processes for large-scale application. Herein, a new and cost-effective method has been developed to massively prepare monolithic 3DNGFs by a simple and scalable electrochemical oxidation process. Benefiting from the enhanced electrical conductivity, the increase in the pore volume for fast diffusion increased the electrode-electrolyte contact area and additional active sites resulting from the incorporation of nitrogen species, the 3DNGFs showed a high specific capacitance of 2250.3 mF/cm2 at 4 mA/cm2, with good rate capability. Furthermore, this 3DNGFs electrode also owns an excellent long-term cycling stability that can retain more than 97.5% of its original capacitance after 10,000 cycles.
