In the present work, we engineer hierarchical ultrathin CuCo 2 O 4 nanosheets arrays on Ni foam through a facile, controllable and low-cost electrodeposition method by controlling deposition time and adjusting precursor's type, as a binder-free electrode for high performance supercapacitors. The effects of deposition time and types of precursors on the morphology of the as-prepared electrodes were investigated by X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. As a results, the CuCo 2 O 4 electrode prepared by nitrate salts at the deposition time of 10 min, includes the most uniform and ultrathin nanosheet arrays and exhibits the highest capacitance performance, such as ultrahigh specific capacitance of 1330 F g −1 at 2 A g −1 with 70% capacitance retention (938 F g −1 ) at ultrahigh current density of 60 A g −1 , excellent cycling stability of 93.6% capacitance retention after 5000CD cycles and the maximum energy density of 29.55 Wh kg −1 at the power density of 0.4 kW kg −1 . These superior electrochemical performances have been attributed to its unique structures with direct connected ultrathin nanosheets on the surface of Ni foam and abundant pores provide large electroactive sites for electrochemical reactions, as well as facile electron, ion transport and high electrical conductivity.
