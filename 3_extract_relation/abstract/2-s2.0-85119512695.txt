The frequency stability of the power system is challenged by the high penetration of power electronic interfaced renewable energy sources (RES). Energy storage systems (ESS) are used to supply extra power injection to enhance the frequency stability during a disturbance. This paper presents a novel approach for improving the frequency dynamics by incorporating a designed ultracapacitor (UC) with a fully decoupled wind power generation (FDWG) unit. To this aim, a suitable model implementation of UC for real-time simulations is presented. The model constitutes a parallel RC branch, which is appropriate for illustrating the relevant fast UC dynamics that occur within the first milliseconds of the time period of action for fast active-power frequency control services. The frequency performance achieved by the support of the FDWG equipped with UC is compared against the performance achieved by using electrical batteries. The comparison includes the application of droop-derivative frequency control.
