This paper presents an analysis and simulation of two different control strategies for electric vehicles with two energy sources on board: one configuration with battery and fuel cell and one with battery and supercapacitors. For the hybrid system with battery and fuel cell we elaborated a fuzzy controller for power demand distribution as control strategy. For the other configuration, with battery and supercapacitors, we proposed a new method for prediction of power demand time series using a hybrid algorithm with Wavelet decomposition and Neural Network. The prediction model is then used for implementing in real-time a management strategy for the electric vehicle, being necessary for distributing the power demand of the vehicular system between energy storage devices according with their characteristics in order to improve the vehicle performances. All the simulations and results were conducted in Matlab Fuzzy Logic Toolbox and Wavelet Toolbox.
