Mechanochemical synthesis of α-MnO2 was carried out with KMnO4 and Mn(CH3COO)2 in 1:1 mole ratio. The electrochemical performance of MnO2 electrode was investigated by cyclic voltammograms and alternating current impedance. The charge-discharge process of MnO2 supercapacitor in 6 mol/L KOH was studied within 1.2 V at 200 mA/g, suggesting that it displays double-layer capacibility in low potential scope and pseudo-capacitance properties in high potential scope. It is found that Mn3O4, an electrochemical inert, mainly forms in the initial 40 charge-discharge cycles. During cycling, the pseudo-capacitance properties disappear and the discharge curves are close to ideal ones, indicating double-layer capability. The maximum capacitance of MnO2 electrode is as high as 416 F/g, and retains 240 F/g after 200 cycles. The equivalent series resistance increases from 17 to 41 Ω. © 2007 The Nonferrous Metals Society of China.
