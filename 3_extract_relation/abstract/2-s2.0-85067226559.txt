Developing patterning techniques with practicability, cost-effectiveness and safety are essential for shape-confirmable integrated energy storage devices. Herein we design a novel flash foam stamp-inspired technique for simple fabrication of flexible high energy in-plane micro-supercapacitors based on interdigital electrodes of self-depositing electrochemically exfoliated graphene on paper substrates. This technique is an attractive and novel bottom-up microfabrication technology due to its advantages of simplicity and low-cost. These novelly developed all-solid-state, paper-based in-plane graphene micro-supercapacitors exhibit excellent electrochemical performances, such as high area specific capacitance of ∼4.02 mF cm−2 and excellent cycling stability (95.6% retention at 0.08 mA cm−2 for 5000 cycles). And these solid-state flexible micro-supercapacitors are observed non-obvious structural change and loss of performance under bending state, suggesting remarkable flexibility and mechanical stability. Therefore, such all-solid-state, flexible paper-based graphene micro-supercapacitors can potentially be used for wearable and portable electronics.
