In this study, a facile one-pot hydrothermal route has been employed for the preparation of Cu3SbS4 nanoplates and its use as an electrode material for supercapacitors has been demonstrated. The physico-chemical characterizations such as X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscope, and laser Raman spectroscopic studies revealed the formation of Cu3SbS4 with plate-like structures. The electrochemical properties of the Cu3SbS4 electrodes was studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (CD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses. The CV analysis indicated the presence of a pair of redox peaks suggesting the pseudocapacitive nature of the Cu3SbS4 electrode with a high specific capacitance of 60 F g−1 (obtained at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1). The Cu3SbS4 electrode possess a specific capacitance of about 41.78 F g−1 obtained from the CD profiles recorded using an applied current of 0.25 mA. The Cu3SbS4 electrode possess a high energy of about 11.375 Wh kg−1 and power density of 175 W kg−1 with excellent cyclic stability over 2500 cycles. The collective findings of this work suggested that the use of Cu3SbS4 nanoplates as an advanced electrode for supercapacitor applications.
