This paper presents an LPV/Hâˆž control strategy applied to power source coordination on board of average-power electric vehicles. The proposed approach concerns frequency separation of responses between three power sources in order to satisfy power demand of vehicle's electrical motor, taking into account that sources are expected to work within distinct frequency ranges. The three sources - fuel cell, battery and ultracapacitor - are connected in parallel to a common DC-bus which supplies the electrical motor.
