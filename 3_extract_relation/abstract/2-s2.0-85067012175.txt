The increasing development demand of wearable electronics for intelligent life accelerates the studies and explorations on portable flexible energy storage system. However, how to achieve high performance power sources on a par with uncomplicated and high-efficient fabrication processes also is a huge challenge. Herein, Ni(OH)2/NiMoO4 composites with enhanced specific capacitance and cyclic lifespan are synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. And the composites are used as functional inks for the fabrication of printed electrode of flexible solid-state supercapacitors. Large specific capacitance of 1547.3 F g−1 is achieved by the composite electrode at 1 A g−1. After charging and discharging 1000 times, 88.1% of the initial capacitance at 20 A g−1 can be retained. Large-scale flexible solid-state supercapacitors are developed through fully screen printing technique in a very short time, which exhibit high stability (115% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles) and good flexibility (81.7% of capacitance remained after 750 bending/releasing cycles). Moreover, when three printed supercapacitors are connected in series, a yellow light emitting diode (1.9 V) can be easily lighted up, which is preconceived to be a promising portable energy storage system in future wearable electronics.
