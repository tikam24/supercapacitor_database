Fuel cell/ultracapacitor/battery hybrid power systems represent a promising architecture to satisfy the energy requirements for road vehicles. When the primary power source is a fuel cell, the objective of an energy management strategy (EMS) is to optimise the hydrogen consumption and fuel cell efficiency without compromising the performance of the overall system. In this study, a fuzzy logic controller together with a wavelet-transform algorithm (WTA) is proposed as EMS, which is a reasonable option to achieve an adequate solution of the problem since this supervisory control strategy can deal with a considerable amount of variables. Besides, a WTA is capable of separating the high and low frequency components of the load profile and help allocate them among the on-board energy sources. A simulation environment has been developed to test the EMS; it includes models for the power sources and energy storage devices, the power electronics and the vehicular power demand.
