In this work we have adopted a simple one step bamboo shoot-assisted chemical synthesis of reduced graphene oxide/manganese oxide nanocomposite via a sono-chemical reduction of MnO2− into Mn2+ in aqueous medium. Here graphene oxide nanosheets were used as a support material and potassium permanganate as the precursor source for MnO2 deposition. The conformation of the nanocomposite was done using Raman, X-Ray diffraction analysis, UV–Visible spectroscopy and the morphology were visualized using field emission electron microscopy. Further the mass of the precursor was varied from 0.2 wt% to 0.8 wt% and its effect on the electrochemical properties were investigated. It was observed that with the rise in precursor mass the value of specific capacitance and specific surface area increases as calculated by cyclic voltammetry and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analyzer. The highest specific capacitance was found to be 827F/g for 0.8% precursor mass loading at a scan rate of 10 mV/s with a charge transfer resistance of 1.42 Ω in 1 M KCl electrolyte which indicates a good synergistic effect between the EDLC and pseudocapacitive material.
