Nanomaterials are the reliable alternative of the future, with great results in industrial applications due to the capabilities they have on the very small particle size, these being of the order of nanometers (up to 100 nm). This small particle size leads to an increase in the active surface, which is quite sought in the development of many industrial applications today. This category of nanomaterials also includes most of the active materials used for making supercapacitor electrodes because having such a small particle size provides a very large active surface allowing storage of a large quantity of electrical charge, but to take advantage of very large active surface of these materials we should take into account a number of parameters regarding the realization conditions of the respective electrodes. Therefore, in this paper we aim to make electrodes with different mass loadings and through different deposition methods. The methods we will use are: spray deposition for thin electrodes and roll-To-roll deposition for thicker electrodes. These methods influence the quality of the electrode obtained and when we talk about quality, we consider that the performance of the material used can be improved by finding a balance on the main aspects mentioned above.
