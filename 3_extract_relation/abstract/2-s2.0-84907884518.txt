A one-pot method is introduced to construct three-dimensional (3D) nanohybrid composites by combining one-dimensional (1D) carbonaceous polypyrrole nanotubes with two-dimensional (2D) graphene sheets. The morphologies of 3D nanostructure can be controlled by adjusting the raw material ratio of pyrrole to GO. Interestingly, when the ratio is suitable, the interconnected structured formed. Nanotubes tend to be covered by nanosheets and interacted with each other tightly. The resulting material has a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 1173 m2 g-1, a total pore volume of 0.66 cm3 g-1, and an average pore diameter of 3.0 nm. And this material used as supercapacitor shows high specific capacitance, good rate capability and still retains 94.5% of the initial capacitance even after 10,000 cycles.
