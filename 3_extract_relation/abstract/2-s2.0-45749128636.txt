In this work, we studied the magnetic properties of LiNi 0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2 synthesized by wet chemistry via oxalate route. Measurements included the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility, Ï‡m(T) and magnetization M(H). The influence of the synthesis conditions on the magnetic and electronic properties is presented and discussed. Analysis of magnetic data allows the determination of the cationic disorder, i.e. the concentration of Ni2+ ions in the 3a lithium sites. copyright The Electrochemical Society.
