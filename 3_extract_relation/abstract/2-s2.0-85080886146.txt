The proceedings contain 104 papers. The topics discussed include: a study on high-frequency induction heating system for railway turnout; open-loop validation of a decoupled model of an induction motor supplied by a PWM inverter; a fast acting precharge control strategy for modular multilevel converters; Scott connection transformer analysis in the railway traction system using the simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis model; design and installation of active filters for power quality improvement for water treatment plants; control and operation of multifunctional DSTATCOM with battery-supercapacitor energy storage system; and inter-turn fault detection of induction machines using the voltage across the star-points of the machine and the source.
