A new cadmium metal–organic framework [Cd(NIPA)(CH3CH2OH)3] (NIPA = 5-nitroisophthalic acid) has been assembled and served as precursor to fabricate nanoporous nitrogen doped carbon material via carbonization process under 900 °C (NC900). The obtained NC900 shows high capacitance (367 F g−1 at 1 A/g), good cycling life (95% of initial capacitance after 3000 cycles). Moreover, NC900//NC900 supercapacitor device is assembled and shows energy density of 6.3 Wh kg−1 with a current density of 1 A/g and the capacitance retention maintains 65% at 0.5 A g−1 after 3000 cycles). The results obtained provide a facile way to prepare carbon material (MOF is used as precursor) for energy-storage devices. For the first time, the heteroatom doped nanoporous carbon material based on a new Cd MOF is served as supercapacitor materials.
