Faraday pseudocapacitors take both advantages of secondary battery with high energy density and supercapacitors with high power density, and electrode material is the key to determine the performance of Faraday pseudocapacitors. Transition metal oxides and nitrides, as the two main kinds of pseudocapacitor electrode materials, can enhance energy density while maintaining high power capability. Recent advances in designing nanostructured architectures and preparing composites with high specific surface areas based on transition metal oxides and nitrides, including ruthenium oxides, nickel oxides, manganese oxides, vanadium oxides, cobalt oxides, iridium oxides, titanium nitrides, vanadium nitrides, molybdenum nitrides and niobium nitrides, are addressed, which would provide important significances for deep researches on pseudocapacitor electrode materials.
