A simple cellulosic (C6H10O5)n substance, paper has many applications in addition to its use in writing, painting, and packaging. Papers have long been used in analytical chemistry; however, recently, their use in the development of cheaper portable sensors and energy storage devices has been explored. These paper-based environmental sensing devices are providing faster and simpler contaminant detection, along with the removal of sample storage and transportation. In addition to chemical pollutant detectors, the paper-based sensors are also being developed for the gases and volatile compounds. Such paper-based sensors will be very useful in rapid detection of toxic gases during any emergency.. These easy and cheap paper-based devices will be very useful for the developing countries, where environmental pollution concentration is very high and the sophisticated analytical laboratories are not easily accessible. Along with the exponentially increasing in pollution level, our energy demands have also increased by the same pace. Modern-day electronic devices and electric vehicles need robust energy storage devices, and our conventional batteries are not efficient for it. Therefore the supercapacitor has emerged as a solution to this problem; it is a rechargeable, high energy density and quick-release energy storage device, and the use of paper in its development let it to be used in deformable electronic devices.
