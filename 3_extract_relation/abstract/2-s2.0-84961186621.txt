Herein, we report the facile synthesis of β-Ni(OH)2 nanodiscs by chemical precipitation method and their use in supercapacitors. β-Ni(OH)2 nanodiscs are characterized by FTIR, XRD, FESEM, XPS and TGA analysis. Morphological analysis revealed the uniform nanodisc morphology of β-Ni(OH)2. The supercapacitor behavior is evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements in 1-M aqueous KOH solution with 0- to 0.6-V potential window. The specific capacitance of β-Ni(OH)2 nanodiscs is found to be 400 F g−1. The energy and power densities of the β-Ni(OH)2 nanodiscs are found to be 7.15 W h kg−1 and 1716 W kg−1, respectively, at the current density of 1 A g−1. The cycle life test shows the good stability of the electrode with 83 % retention capacitance even after 1500 cycles.
