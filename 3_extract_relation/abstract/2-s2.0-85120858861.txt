A sandwich-like flexible architecture electrode material composed of NiAl-LDH nanoplates grown on carbon cloths (CC), coupled with GO interlayer and NiCo-LDH nanowire on the interlayer was successfully assembled via hydrothermal and chemical bath deposition (denoted as CC@NiAl-LDH@GO@NiCo-LDH). The promising combination of NiAl-LDH, graphene and NiCo-LDH forming a multilayer structure through electrostatic absorption and in-situ growth process which endow a high mass loading superiority and synergistic effect for supercapacitors. In addition, the interspace inside the sandwich-like architecture constructed by the graphene and the NiAl-LDH/ NiCo-LDH nano-flakes contribute to alleviate of the volume expansion during the cycling process and promote the diffusion rate of ions. The CC@NiAl-LDH@GO@NiCo-LDH material demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance which exhibit remarkable specific capacitance of 2359.8F·g−1 (14.2F·cm−2) at 1 A·g−1 (6 mA·cm−2) and outstanding capacitance retentions of 93.1% after 1500 cycles. Subsequently, the CC@NiAl-LDH@GO@NiCo-LDH material was used as cathode material to fabricate a hybrid quasi-solid-state supercapacitor that exhibits a high energy density of 52.0 Wh·kg−1 at 796.7 W·kg−1 and 38.4 Wh·kg−1 at 12015 W·kg−1, revealing its potential and viability for commercial applications. Furthermore, the hybrid quasi-solid-state supercapacitor can be applied under different extreme operating conditions such as bending, twisting, sour/alkali soaking, ice bathing, warm bathing, hammering and cutting conditions. It is predictable that the unique sandwich-like structure will be an extremely promising electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.
