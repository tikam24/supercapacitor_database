The modular approach to configuration of a power-traction system of an electric vehicle (EV) is applied in a complex way. In particular, the power circuit combines such well-known efficient solutions as a modular hybrid on-board battery/supercapacitor electric energy storage system, a synchronous machine with permanent magnets and two three-phase armature winding sets, open ends of the armature winding sets with dual side power supply. Three voltage inverters were used to combine and control these machine's modules forming a symmetrical T-shaped configuration of the EV power-traction system. Another feature of the proposed configuration is the control system of electric drive based on a principle of the brushless DC motor (BLDCM), which greatly simplifies the control of energy flows in the system. To effectively combining the applied solutions, an appropriate control system algorithm has been developed, the operability of which is confirmed by the results of computer simulation.
