Lignin is rich in reserves with high carbon content and a large number of benzene structures, which is a potential raw material of electrode material for new energy storage devices supercapacitors. Lignin contains a large number of ether bonds, which account for more than 50% of the total linkage bonds, and easily forms polyphenolic hydroxyl units during carbonization. This structure can effectively enhance the pseudocapacitance during the charging and discharging process, which enables the electrochemical performance of electrode materials in supercapacitors to be improved. The applications of lignin composite electrode materials, lignin activated carbon materials and lignin template carbon materials were reviewed in this paper. The development direction of lignin-based supercapacitors was summarized and prospected. The application fields of ligin-based electrode materials for supercapacitors were prospected.
