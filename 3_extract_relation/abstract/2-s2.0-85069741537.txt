Development of efficient and durable electrocatalysts and electrode materials are significantly important to enhance the electrochemical performance for oxygen evolution reaction and supercapacitor applications. Herein, we design a hydrothermal-assisted biomimetic strategy to anchor CoS2 nanodots on heteroatom-doped carbon layer (CoS2@HADC). Numerous CoS2 nanodots and heteroatoms rich in N and S are in situ hybridized into the carbon layer in a homogeneously dispersed manner. The preparation procedure is quite simple and moderate, avoiding the high-temperature annealing step. The optimized hybrid not only act as effective electrocatalyst, in which overpotential of 226 mv is enough to drive a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with a Tafel slope of 56 mV Dec−1 during the OER process, but also serve as electrode material with specific capacitance of 565 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 for high-performance supercapacitor, compared with CoS2 (176 F g−1). Also, it exhibits superior cycling activity (~100% capability retention after 10000 cycles at 2 A g−1 in 6.0 M KOH) and remains a 57% high rate capability (320 F g−1 at 5 A g−1). The rational design concept for cobalt sulfides/heteroatom-doped carbon hybrid provide a simple strategy towards superior energy conversion and storage devices.
