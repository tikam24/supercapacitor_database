An all-in-one configured supercapacitor which is intrinsically compressible and stretchable is fabricated via one-step deposition of electrocapacitive nanocomposites onto two sides of a compressible and stretchable polyacrylic acid (PAA) hydrogel electrolyte. The supercapacitor affords a large degree of compression (up to 60% strain) without affecting the electrochemical performance. The exact same device also sustains stretching up to 150% strain, and meanwhile effectively powers an LED bulb.
