Mn 3 O 4 -CeO 2 /holey-graphene nano-composite was fabricated by hydrothermal reaction on the honeycomb-like porous graphene structure. The hybrid materials displayed enhanced capacitive performance (310 F·g −1 at 2 A·g −1 ). After 1000 cycles, the initial capacitance of the composite still has 92.4% retained. The improved electrochemical performance might be ascribed to the intimate combination of the pesudocapacitance from nanoparticles well-dispersed on graphene sheets and double layer capacitance from excellent conductive graphene scaffold. The investigation presents a promising application of nanoparticles/graphene composites as electrode materials for energy storage.
