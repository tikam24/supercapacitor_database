This investigation addresses the challenges in the development of efficient nanostructured Mn3 O4 cathodes for supercapacitors. A high areal capacitance and the ability to avoid a timeconsuming activation procedure for electrodes with high active mass loading of 40 mg cm−2 are reported. This facilitates practical applications of Mn3 O4 based electrodes. The highest capacitance of 6.11 F cm−2 (153 F g−1) is obtained from cyclic voltammetry at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 and 6.07 F cm−2 (151.9 F g−1) from the chronopotentiometry at a current density of 3 mA cm−2 in a potential window of 0.9 V in a neutral Na2 SO4 electrolyte. The new approach is based on the application of rhamnolipids (RL) as a capping agent for the synthesis of Mn3 O4 particles and a co-dispersant for Mn3 O4 and carbon nanotubes, which are used as conductive additives. The size and shape of the Mn3 O4 particles are influenced by RL. The enhanced performance of the electrodes is linked to the chemical structure and properties of RL molecules, which exert influence on Mn3 O4 particle size and shape during synthesis, reduce agglomeration, facilitate RL adsorption on Mn3 O4 and carbon nanotubes, and influence their co-dispersion and mixing at the nanometric scale.
