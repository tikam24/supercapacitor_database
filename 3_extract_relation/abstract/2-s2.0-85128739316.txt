We report the development of well optimised NiCo2O4 microflowers for high performance supercapacitor application. The efforts were made to optimise the electrode material by tuning the synthetic as well as electrolyte concentration parameters such as (i) hydrothermal reaction temperature, (ii) hydrothermal reaction time, (iii) sintering temperature, and (iv) electrolyte concentration. The physico-chemical and supercapacitive properties were analysed using TGA, XRD, SEM/TEM/HRTEM, XPS, BET, and electrochemical measurements. The well optimised electrode material was obtained at 150 °C hydrothermal reaction temperature, 12 h of hydrothermal reaction time, 300 °C sintering temperature, and 3 M KOH electrolyte concentration. The optimised sample displayed high specific -capacitance (1478 F/g), -energy density (16.5 Wh/kg), and -power density (248 W/kg). The specific capacitance can be retained to 97.61% after 1000 cycles. The developed NiCo2O4 microflower structures are well optimised and offer great promise for future industrial applications.
