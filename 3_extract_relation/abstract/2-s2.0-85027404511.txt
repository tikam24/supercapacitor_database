Alkaline electrolytes consisting of 6 M KOH and polymer (PEO, PVA, and PAAK) are coated on PAN nonwoven fabrics as a separator, and the electrochemical properties of the activated carbon supercapacitor adopting them are investigated in terms of redox behavior, specific capacitance, and interfacial impedance. Although the interaction between polymer and KOH are comparatively inactive in PEO and PVA, PAAK (3 wt.%)-KOH forms a hydrogel phase by active interactions between COO-K+ in side-chain of PAAK and K+OH- from alkaline electrolyte solution, improving ionic conduction of electrolytes and the electrochemical properties of the supercapacitor. As a result, the activated supercapacitor adopting the PAAK-KOH shows the superior specific capacitance of 46.8 F g-1 at 100 mV s-1.
