In the following paper a bi-directional converter for power supplying system of radio communication equipment has been reviewed. The converter provides the charging of the energy storage elements (ESE) – supercapacitor (SC) battery. The converter also provides supplying of the communication equipment from the energy stored in the ESE. The bi – directional converter is made of a resonant converter and synchronous rectifier. Each one of the bi – directional converters charges a separate ESE. The developed models of the bi – directional converters allow studying of the system when the converters are working on a common load. The proposed system is suitable for supplying a communication equipment with a specific load profile (the consumption during transmission is higher then the consumption during stand by).
