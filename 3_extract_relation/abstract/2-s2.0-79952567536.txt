Activated carbons (ACs) from petroleum coke by microwave heating KOH activation are treated by microwave to investigate the effect of microwave-treatment power on AC properties. The electrochemical properties of AC electrodes for supercapacitors were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, constant current charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results showed that specific surface area (SBET) and total pore volume of microwave-treated ACs, specific capacitance and energy density of microwave-treated AC electrodes decreased. The electrical conductivity and stability of AC electrodes for supercapacitors were improved. Fast microwave-treatment is an efficient method to obtain suitable ACs for supercapacitors.
