Highly active free-standing and flexible MoS2/rGO nanofilms is mass-produced via ball-milling the bulk layered materials and further hydrazine-reducing process. In the well assembled structure, the loose few layered MoS2 nanosheets and rGO make the composites with enhanced active reaction sites. The synergetic effect between MoS2 nanosheets and rGO could also improve the electronic conductivity and flexibility of the obtained electrode films. The flexible MoS2/rGO nanofilms films are fabricated as symmetric supercapacitor, which deliver a specific capacitance of 365 F g−1 at current density of 0.5 A g−1 and exhibits a high energy density of 89.0 Wh·kg−1 at the power density of 16.7 kW kg−1.
