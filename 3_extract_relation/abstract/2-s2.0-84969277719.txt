The electrochemical performance of polysulphide compounds as an electrolyte in supercapacitor was studied. Numerous reversible faradaic reactions during which oxidation state of sulphur changes from - 2 to - 0.4 work as an efficient source of faradaic reactions. Polysulphides were synthesized by a simple, inexpensive method. This innovative system offers quite high values of specific capacitance, more than twice as high as electrolyte without polysulphides. In addition, cyclability (5000 cycles) does not influence the capacitance of the electrochemical capacitor when polysulphide compounds are used as the electrolyte.
