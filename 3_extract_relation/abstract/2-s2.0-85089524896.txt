In this study, binary transitional metal-based compounds with highly electrochemical performance are designed and successfully synthesized on a Cu and Ni co-coated cotton textile as conductive substrate. The morphology study shows that cauliflower-like NiSe2 nanoparticles are grown on the surface of the three-dimensional interconnected Co(OH)2 nanoflakes, facilitating the electron transfer between two compounds. The cell possesses remarkable charge/discharge cycling durability and the capacity retention retains at 86.7% after 20,000 continuous cycles in the all solid-state cell (PVA-KOH). This work shows that combining Co(OH)2 and NiSe2 together via appropriate architecture design on Cu/Ni coated cotton textile is a promising route to achieve wearable supercapacitors with highly electrochemical performance.
