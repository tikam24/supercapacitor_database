The ever-growing demands of loads and sensors of the Internet of things (IoT) in fifth generation (5 G) era spur innovation and development of environmentally sustainable power supplies. Herein, a self-charging power source based on paper is designed to harvest mechanical energy produced by hand movements and store them in micro-supercapacitors (MSCs). The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) with free-standing structure and the in-plane MSCs are integrated on one piece of paper, ruling out extra processes for wire bonding, circuit pad, and packaging, and thus effectively simplifying the self-powering system. The pencil lead material is drawn onto the paper to obtain in-plane interdigital MSCs and followed by surface functionalization with small pseudocapacitive aromatic molecules. High areal capacitance of 6.96 mAh g−1 cm−2 is achieved, which is about 6 times as much as pure pencil lead coating. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, some microelectronic devices like a wireless positioning sensor can be powered by our all-in-one self-charging power paper.
