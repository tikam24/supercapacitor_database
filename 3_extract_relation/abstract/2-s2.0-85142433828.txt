Among many electrode materials, cobalt-based nanomaterials are widely used in supercapacitors because of their high natural abundance, good electrical conductivity, and high specific capacitance. However, there are still some difficulties to overcome, including poor structural stability and low power density. This paper summarizes the research progress of cobalt-based nanomaterials (cobalt oxide, cobalt hydroxide, cobalt-containing ternary metal oxides, etc.) as electrode materials for supercapacitors in recent years and discusses the preparation methods and properties of the materials. Notably, the focus of this paper is on the strategies to improve the electrochemical properties of these materials. We show that the performance of cobalt-based nanomaterials can be improved by designing their morphologies and, among the many morphologies, the mesoporous structure plays a major role. This is because mesoporous structures can mitigate volume changes and improve the performance of pseudo capacitance. This review is dedicated to the study of several cobalt-based nanomaterials in supercapacitors, and we hope that future scholars will make new breakthroughs in morphology design.
