Transition metal oxide (TMO) binary compounds have shown good performance in energy devices. Therefore, the present study investigates the performance of hydrothermally synthesized cobalt molybdate (CoMoO4) with a flower-like morphology for electrodes in supercapacitors and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). The morphology and microstructure were examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and energy-dispersive spectroscope (EDS) mapping. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic chargeâ€“discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were analyzed to examine the potential of nanocomposites for supercapacitor electrodes. The results showed the specific capacitance of 243 F/g in a 6 M KOH solution with a stability of 82% after 2000 cycles. The MOR investigation of the synthesized electrode suggested a suitable trend for methanol oxidation at the optimal scan rate and concentration. As a result, CoMoO4 can be a relatively cost-effective option for use in supercapacitor electrodes and an attractive and inexpensive catalyst for methanol oxidation.
