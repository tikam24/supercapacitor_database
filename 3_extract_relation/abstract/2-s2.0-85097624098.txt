Flexible electrodes based on carbon fiber with excellent conductivity were utilized in supercapacitor applications. Herein, the nanostuctured NiCo2O4 was synthesized along the nanofibers by a brief hydrothermal method. As-prepared NiCo2O4/CNF composite holds unique structure with NiCo2O4 nanoneedles uniformly grown on every carbon nanofiber, which promised shorter diffusion of electrons and ions. The composite electrode held a high capacitance of 660.41 F g-1 and showed great capacitance retention of 90.95% after 6000 cycles, which could be beneficial in future application of supercapacitors.
