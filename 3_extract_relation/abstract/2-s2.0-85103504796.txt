The ongoing surge in demand for sustainable energy technologies with little to no environmental impacts calls for the exploration of advanced energy storage materials. Inspiration from nature is undoubtedly a promising approach to comply with environmental legislations. Herein, we describe a facile and green electrosynthesis approach to fabricate a polydopamine (PDA) nanofilm supported on oxygen-functionalized carbon cloth (FCC). The surface functionalization of carbon cloth facilitates the PDA nanofilm adhesion and endows the as-prepared PDA-FCC electrode with excellent flexibility, good electrical conductance (22.6 mS), and outstanding wettability to the aqueous electrolyte. Owing to these merits, the PDA-FCC electrode delivers a favorable capacitance of 626 F g−1at 1.0 A g−1(617 mF cm−2at 2.2 mA cm−2, and 1296 mF cm−3at 5.3 mA cm−3), in which the catechol, amine, and imine moieties of PDA are responsible for its excellent pseudocapacitive behavior. The symmetric all-solid-state flexible PDA-FCC||PDA-FCC device covers almost the entire thermodynamic stability window of aqueous electrolytes (1.2 V), delivers a high specific energy of 11.7 W h kg−1, superb specific power of up to 6.4 kW kg−1, and excellent flexibility along with outstanding cycling stability (81% retention of the initial capacitance after 10 000 cycles). These performance characteristics are in part due to the binder-free PDA biopolymer film that adopts the inherent texture of the carbon cloth, enabling the pores to play the role of temporary ion-buffering reservoirs that facilitate effective mass transport. This new approach to fabricate electrodes from green sources is considered an important step toward environmentally-benign energy storage technologies.
