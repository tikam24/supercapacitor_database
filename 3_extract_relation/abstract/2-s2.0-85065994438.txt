Energy storage is an essential device in a smart hybrid system. The hybrid grid controllers are regulated through an Internet based supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. The involvement of internet makes the system vulnerable to cyber-attacks and affects the performance of the system. This work analyzes the effects of cyber-attacks on the performance of a supercapacitor energy storage (SES) located in a hybrid grid system. Two types of cyber-attacks, such as the tampering communication data/signals and crash override, targeting the controllers of the energy storage system, have been considered. To quantify the results, two indices, namely the voltage index (Vindex) at the point of common coupling (PCC) and the total harmonic distortion (THD) have been evaluated. Simulations have been performed by using the Matlab/Simulink software. Simulation results show that the performance of the hybrid grid system is deteriorated due to the cyber-attacks on the SES controller.
