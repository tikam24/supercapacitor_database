The growth of global fossil energy consumption and environmental pollution has become an urgent problem to be resolved, compelling the development of green renewable energy and efficient energy storage technologies. Supercapacitors attract considerable research interest as high-performance energy storage devices that can contribute to the rapid growth of low- power electronics (e.g., wearable, portable electronic devices) and high-power military applications (e.g., guided missile technology and highly sensitive naval warheads). The performance of supercapacitors can be assessed in terms of electrochemical properties through the combination of electrode and electrolyte materials. Supercapacitors with high capacitance and excellent stability are beneficial to various research and technical fields. This article reviews recent advances in supercapacitor technology with respect to charge storage mechanisms, electrode and electrolyte materials, particularly biomaterials for green renewable energy storage devices due to their unique structure and remarkable properties. The main highlight is the implement of biomaterials as an energy storage technology because it is sustainable, environmentally friendly, degradable, low cost, and promising material. This article also reviews recent developments in supercapacitors with the use of polysaccharide materials, as well as other types of biomaterials used in energy storage applications.
