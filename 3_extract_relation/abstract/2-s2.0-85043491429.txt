3D hybrids of interconnected porous carbon (PC) nanosheets/vertically aligned polyaniline (Pani) nanowires are prepared by a cost-effective facile approach and used as high-performance supercapacitor electrodes. The 3D PC/Pani hybrids are obtained by a simple in situ growth of Pani on 3D PC with a high specific surface area and good electrochemical performance fabricated via a one-step thermal pyrolysis of potassium citrate. The 3D PC/Pani hybrids show an excellent specific capacitance of 512 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in the three-electrode configuration, which is attributed to the synergistic effect of PC and Pani in the composite. In addition, the as-assembled asymmetric supercapacitor of PC/Pani composites exhibits good capacitive properties and a long-term cycling stability of 91% after 3000 cycles at 5 A g−1. Owing to its cost-effective preparation and high electrochemical performance, the PC/Pani hybrid composite has significant potential for use as practical electrode materials of supercapacitors.
