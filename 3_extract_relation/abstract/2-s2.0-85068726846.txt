The synthesis of a metal–organic framework (MOF) named IITI-1 is reported by employing an H2L linker with Cu(NO3)2⋅3 H2O in a mixed solvent system of N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) and H2O. Further, in order to explore the energy storage application of IITI-1, a IITI-1/CNT hybrid was prepared by a simple ultrasonication technique. Incorporation of a carbon nanotube (CNT) in the layered IITI-1 MOF gave rise to enhanced electrolyte accessibility along with improved electrochemical storage capacity. The electrochemical investigations reveal a high specific capacitance (380 F g−1 at 1.6 A g−1) with a good rate performance for IITI-1/CNT. The IITI-1 MOF and the IITI-1/CNT composite were characterized by PXRD, BET, SEM, and TEM techniques. Moreover, IITI-1 MOF was also confirmed by single-crystal XRD analysis.
