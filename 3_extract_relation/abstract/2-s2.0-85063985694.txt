A facile and novel one-step hydrothermalmethod was provided for the preparation of Ni-Co double hydroxides (NC-DH), which was directly grown on carbonized cotton cloth (CCC) and used as advanced binder-free electrodes for supercapacitors. The effect of different concentration of Ni 2+ and Co 2+ in the intial reactant (C-Ni-x-Co-y) on microstructure and electrochemical performance were studied. The results showed that flake-like structure grown uniformly under an appropriate concentration, which was benefit to improve the electrochemical performance. The electrochemical tests revealed that the C-Ni-4-Co-8 electrode displayed the maximum specific capacitance of 4.19 F cm -2 when the current density was 5 mA cm -2 and excellent rate capability maintained at 3.05 F cm -2 even at the high current density of 80 mA cm -2 . The electrodes of Ni-Co double hydroxides anchored on flexible conductive substrates with excellent electrochemical properties could be obtained by costeffective method, which could be ascribed as a highly promising potential electrode material for energy storage devices.
