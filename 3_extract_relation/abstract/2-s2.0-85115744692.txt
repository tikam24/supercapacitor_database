To obtain a flexible supercapacitor with excellent capacitance, good mechanical properties while maintaining self-healing ability, Î²-NiS/Ti3C2Tx with 2D/2D heterostructure was synthesized by hydrothermal reaction and introduced as filler to the polymer hydrogel PAA/CS(PC) network. Through mechanical and self-healing performance tests, it was found that the hydrogel electrode had high tensile properties with tensile strain up to 566% and excellent self-healing properties with efficiency as high as 84%. The electrode not only exhibits a specific capacitance of 10.92 F/g at a current density of 6 mA/g, but also still shows an excellent stability of 87% at a high current density of 20 mA/g for 2000 cycles. This novel hydrogel facilitates the further development of multifunctional, smart and flexible electronics.
