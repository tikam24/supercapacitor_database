An ultimate integration strategy making use of material and geometry is applied in a proof-of-concept study. Integrated supercapacitor-sensor systems with the capability of photodetecting and strain sensing are fabricated based on multifunctional conducting polypyrrole and piezoresistive textile geometry, respectively. This integration strategy enables promising applications for self-powered smart sensory, wearable and healthcare electronics.
