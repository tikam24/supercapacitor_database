In order to investigate the simultaneous adsorption property of functionalised multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) for sodium and arsenic, a new type of carbon fabric supported functionalised MWNTs (f-MWNTs) based supercapacitor was developed. In addition, this setup was tested for desalination of sea water. MWNTs were synthesised by chemical vapour deposition technique and purified, followed by functionalisation. MWNTs were characterised by different techniques. Performance of supercapacitor-based water filter was analysed for the adsorption of high concentration of arsenic (trivalent and pentavalent) and sodium as well as for desalination of sea water by using cyclic voltametry and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy techniques. Adsorption isotherms and kinetic characteristics were studied for the simultaneous removal of sodium and arsenic. High desalination (removal of sodium and magnesium) efficiency of sea water and cyclic repeatability for simultaneous removal of arsenic (arsenate and arsenite) and sodium have been demonstrated in this study. Easy handling and flexibility of this new type of electrodes-based setup provides a platform for the development of portable water filter. Â© 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.
