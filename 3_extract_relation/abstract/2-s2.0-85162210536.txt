Herein, we developed a nanostructured NiO and sweet potato derived carbon frame work (SPCF) composite by a facile hydrothermal reaction as a supercapacitor electrode material. Microstructural analysis revealed that the NiO/SPCF composites possessed the hierarchical structure with a microflower shape consisting of thin nano-petals. The electrochemical characteristics of the prepared materials were examined in a three-electrode cell configuration using 0.1 M Na2SO4 as electrolyte. The NiO/SPCF electrode displayed the supreme capacitance of 965.8 Fg− 1 at 2mAg− 1. Meanwhile, the NiO/SPCF composite exhibits excellent rate performance and superior cycling stability over 5000 cycles. The fascinating NiO morphology demonstrates a crucial part in offering simple ion transport, shortening electron, and ion passage channels and rich energetic spots for electrochemical reactions. In addition, an asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled by NiO/SPCF as positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as negative electrode, which successfully light four white light emitting diodes for 10 min. Moreover, NiO/SPCF//AC ASC presents a maximum energy density of 35.6 Wh kg− 1 at power density of 870.7 W kg− 1 and a high energy density of 19.8 Wh kg− 1 is still retained even at high power density of 4700 W kg− 1. This approach may advance the design and implementation of hybrid nanostructures in high-performance reversible supercapacitors.
