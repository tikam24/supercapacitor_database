The main specialties and properties of a double-layer capacitor as an electric-energy accumulator, based on the fundamental principles of electrodynamics and quantum statistics, is discussed. The electric double layer at the metal-environment is formed because the wave function of the metal electrons extend outside the visible surface and its amplitude decreases slowly. The charges at the inner and outer plates are equal and opposite in sign due to the absence of an external field. The electric energy stored in the capacitor, which is filled with a dielectric, is determined is by the molecular parameters of the environment and the intensity of the external field. The electric field intensity at the planar interface between two phases is obtained by free and bound charges. The field near the surface of capacitor is determined by the liquid in contact with the metal and temperature. The capacitance of a dipolar double layer is derived by the number of particles and their dipole moments.
