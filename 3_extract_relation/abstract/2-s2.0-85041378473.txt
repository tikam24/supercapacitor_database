The concept of monolithic integration of electrochemical energy storage modules was tested on serially connected supercapacitor cells balanced by passive resistive dissipation. Five electrode pairs with collectors, interconnects, corrosion protection layers, electrode material and shunt resistors were printed on a single substrate. The printed patterns, lamination film, and a hot-sealing tool were designed so that upon folding, lamination, and electrolyte filling and sealing, five serial cells were formed with each having a shunt resistance. In an open circuit idling period following charge and discharge, the standard deviation of the individual cell voltages decreased, demonstrating the balancing function of this so called “modulit”, a short term proposed for a monolithically integrated electrochemical energy storage module.
