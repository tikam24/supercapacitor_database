In the present work Polypyrrole nanoparticles are synthesized by oxidative polymerization method in the presence of aqueous nitric acid(HNO3) as solventandferric chloride (FeCl3) as oxidizing agent. During polymerization process the solvent and oxidizing agents played a crucial role in modifying the nanostructures of polypyrrole (PPy). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed theuniform globule morphology and narrow size distribution of produced PPy particles in acid medium. Combined effect of solvent and oxidant are advantageous for the production of PPy nanoparticles (PPyNPs) with a yield of 90%.Four point probe method and strong UV-Visible band confirmhigh electrical conductivity of PPy due to a large Î -conjugation in the polymer structure. The nature and composition of PPyNPs were confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrometer and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Electrochemical properties were confirmed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galavanostatic charge discharge (GCD) spectrum.CV and GCD spectra illustrate the excellent electrochemical properties of PPyNPs which show higher specific capacitance of 398F g-1 at 100mAg-1 current density.It has wide applications in electronic and electrochromic devices, sensors, membrane separation,corrosion protection, chromatographic stationary phase, rechargeable batteries, drug delivery,supercapacitors,light-weight batteries and microwave shielding etc.
