Carbon nanotubes (CNT) grown on nanoporous carbon (NPC), which yields coexisting amorphous and graphitic nanoarchitectures, have been prepared on a large scale from zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) by introducing bimetallic ions (Co2+ and Zn2+). Interestingly, the hybrid Co/Zn-ZIF-derived NPC showed rich graphitic CNTs on the surface. This NPC was utilized for a coin-type supercapacitor cell with an aqueous electrolyte, which showed enhanced retention at high current density and good stability over 10000 cycles.
