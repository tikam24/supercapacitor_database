MXene (MX) is a capable material for future generation supercapacitor devices. But, the attraction between active functional groups and hydrogen bonds on the surface of MX make the interlayer agglomerate obviously. In this work, we present a ZnCo-MOF (ZCM) derived ZnCo2O4 (ZCO) particles to adsorb on the (MX) nanosheets and form a mesoporous structure which may provide the flexible ion diffusion pathways. The as obtained MXene@ZnCo2O4 (MX@ZCO) composite is investigated using XRD, XPS, HRTEM, FESEM, and nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherm analysis. The ZCO particles not only provide activation sites for free movement of charges but also help to avoid the agglomeration of MX nanosheets. Benefitted from this novel composite structure, MX@ZCO holds a great specific capacity of 260 mAh g−1 at the current density of 1 mA g−1. Further, the MX@ZCO electrode exhibits a good cyclic stability of 78.9% even after 5000 cycles at the current density of 10 mA g−1, which can be ascribed to excellent electronic conductivity and short ion transport path. Furthermore, the fabricated aqueous HSC device with MX@ZCO/NF as a positive electrode and AC/NF as a negative electrode revealed a high energy density of 63.8 Wh kg−1 at power density of 3512.2 W kg−1, along with the outstanding capacitance retention of 91.3% even after 15,000 GCD cycles. This work offers an excellent approach for the preparation of MX and ZCO composite material as an electrode for hybrid supercapacitors.
