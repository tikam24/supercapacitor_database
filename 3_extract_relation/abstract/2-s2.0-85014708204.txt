On-chip micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) are important Si-compatible power-source backups for miniaturized electronics. Despite their tremendous advantages, current on-chip MSCs require harsh processing conditions and typically perform like resistors when filtering ripples from alternating current (AC). Herein, we demonstrated a facile layer-by-layer method towards on-chip MSCs based on an azulene-bridged coordination polymer framework (PiCBA). Owing to the good carrier mobility (5×10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) of PiCBA, the permanent dipole moment of azulene skeleton, and ultralow band gap of PiCBA, the fabricated MSCs delivered high specific capacitances of up to 34.1 F cm−3 at 50 mV s−1 and a high volumetric power density of 1323 W cm−3. Most importantly, such MCSs exhibited AC line-filtering performance (−73° at 120 Hz) with a short resistance–capacitance constant of circa 0.83 ms.
