Hierarchically porous structures are attracting marvelous concern in energy storage system, due to their excellent electrons and ions transport properties that spring from the high-pitched surface area and opulent porosity. However, the existing scientific methods for synthesizing hierarchically porous materials usually require a template-assisted procedure, which is elaborate, time consuming and not attainable for mass production. Herein, a nickel nitrate assisted polymer (polyvinyl pyrrolidone) in-situ ‘gel-blowing’ pyrolysis and subsequent low-temperature phosphorylation method is used to prepare porous carbon strutted nickel phosphide nanoparticles. As an anode material for supercapacitors, it contributes a high specific capacity of 116 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 in 2 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. To highlight, a novel aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor depended on the porous carbon strutted nickel phosphide nanoparticles and activated honeycomb-like porous carbon electrodes is assembled, achieving a large working voltage of 1.70 V, which delivers high energy density of 32 Wh kg−1 at a high power density of 907 W kg−1. What's more, it possesses exceptional cycling stability with 98% capacity preservation after 8000 cycles. The results suggest great potential in developing new families of the integrated and robust metallic compounds self-decorated porous carbon nanomaterials.
