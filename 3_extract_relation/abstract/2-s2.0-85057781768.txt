NiO hollow microspheres with micro-nano hierarchical structure were synthesized using lysine as the structure regulator, nickel chloride and ammonia as raw materials through hydrothermal synthesis and calcination method. The microstructure and phase composition of NiO materials were characterized by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and other detection methods. The results show that the prepared hierarchical NiO hollow microspheres with different sizes are well distributed, and the particle size is about 2−3 μm, which is stacked by of many NiO nanosheets. The length of the NiO flakes with clear edges is about 400−600 nm, while the thickness is only about 40−50 nm. Excellent dispersibility and spherical morphology of NiO microspheres can be obtained with addition of 0.6 g lysine at the reaction temperature of 40 ℃ as well as the hydrothermal time of 6 h. In addition, the obtained NiO sphere is hollow, with many flakes stacked and crossed to form a hierarchical structure. Such a unique structure can provide high porosity and specific surface area as well as open channels, all of which are beneficial to the diffusion and migration of both electrolyte ions and electrons. As working electrode, the specific capacitance of the prepared hierarchical NiO hollow microspheres can reach 1 340 F/g in the current density of 1 A/g using the three electrode system and after 1 000 cycles, and the capacity retention rate is 96.5%, showing superior electrochemical performance.
