Hierarchical N-doped porous carbons were synthesized using a self-templated and solvent-free assembly approach via directly heating green polyaspartic acid potassium. The samples prepared under different calcining temperatures were characterized, which exhibited the structural features of high pore volume (0.88–1.75 cm3/g) and large specific surface area (1592–3133 m2/g). Subsequently, these samples were applied for selective CO2 capture and supercapacitor electrodes. The N-PCM-900 prepared at 900 °C afforded superb electrochemical performance, including extremely large specific capacitance (346 F/g at 1 A/g), high-rate capability (charge-discharge profiles at 20 A/g), and excellent cycle stability (96.86 % retention after 1000 cycles) in KOH electrolyte (6 M). Moreover, N-PCM-900 simultaneously provided high CO2 adsorption ability (4.63 mmol/g) at 273 K, and high ideal adsorption solution theoretical value (25) for capturing CO2/N2 at 298 K. The multifunctional porous carbon presented herein exhibited great potential for electrochemical energy storage and gas adsorption/separation.
