Polyaniline (PANI) electrode material was prepared in an aqueous solution of aniline and sulfuric acid by cyclic voltammetry (CV) using the conductive glass (FTO) as the substrate material. A method of two-step CV with different scanning potential ranges of -0. 2 - 1. 2 V and - 0. 2 - 0. 8 V was carried out to fabricate optimized electrode materials for supercapacitor application. Moreover, the best deposition conditions of this method were also investigated through changing the deposition circles of CV. The morphological structure of PANI was characterized by scanning electron microscopy and infrared spectroscopy, and the cells' capacitive properties in H2SO4/polyvinylalcohol (H2SO4/PVA) gel electrolyte were analyzed by CV, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance tests. The results revealed that the PANI/FTO electrode had specific capacitance as high as 172. 7 mF/cm2 at 2 mV/s, and 92. 8% of its initial capacitance still retained after 2000 cycles. Furthermore, the experiment of partition deposition has been conducted, and it was very obvious that the color of PANI/FTO electrode changed from light green to dark green gradually in the process of charging. However, when discharging, the color of PANI/FTO electrode shifted from dark green to light green gradually.
