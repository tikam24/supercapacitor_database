Graphene is inclined to stack with each other that greatly hinders the full utilization of its intrinsic extraordinary properties. Introducing protuberant spacers is a straightforward strategy to avoid the stacking of graphene nanosheets, resulting in a novel unstacked double-layer templated graphene (DTG) structure. Herein, a family of layered double hydroxides were used for the bulk chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of DTG in a fluidized-bed reactor. A high specific surface area of 1554.2 m2 g-1 and a large pore volume of 1.70 cm3 g-1 were achieved. When used as the electrode material for supercapacitors, the DTG afforded a specific capacitance of 65.5 F g-1 at a sweep rate of 5.0 mV s-1 and a capacitance retention of 77% when the sweep rate was increased to 500 mV s-1. Therefore, the DTG obtained via fluidized bed CVD is a promising electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
