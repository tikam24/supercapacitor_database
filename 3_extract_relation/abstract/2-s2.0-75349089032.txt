Ru2·nH2O film as a potential cathode material for supercapacitor was deposited on tantalum foils using water solution of RuCl3·3H2O by galvanostatic-differential pulse voltammetry. The micro-morphology, composition phases and cyclic voltammetry of the film were studied by scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction and electrochemical method respectively. The results show that RuCl3·3H2O film precursor transforms into Ru2·nH2O after the heat treatment, and has bigger special capacitance when Ru2·nH2O is amorphous structure. The adhesive force of the film is improved and there is a change for Ru2·nH2O from amorphous to crystal and the special capacitance of film is reduced as the heat treatment temperature increases. When the film is heat treated at 300°C, the adhesive force of the film is measured to be 11.3 MPa, with unit surface mass of 2.5 mg/cm2. The special capacitance of the film is 466 F/g, and maintains at 93.1% after 1000 charge-discharge cycles.
