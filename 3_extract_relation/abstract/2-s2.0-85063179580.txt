The paper presents the research results of a few different conception of stationary energy storage system in a 3 kV DC system. The most attention is focused on the comparison between two topologies of the ESS: energy storage system with supercapacitor and with supercapacitor and LFP battery. The variants are compared in terms of energy saving and peak power demand reduction. The implementation of ESS with SC results the decrease of active energy drawn from traction substation. Meanwhile the implementation of ESS with SC and LFP battery leads to achieving of two aims - decreasing of active energy consumption by maximization of regenerative energy utilization and reduction of 15 - min. peak power demand of traction substation.
