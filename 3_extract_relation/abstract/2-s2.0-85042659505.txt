Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4 nanoparticles prepared by co-precipitation method were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was prepared by modified Hummer's route and then characterized by UV–Visible and XRD techniques. Nano-heterostructures of Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4 with rGO were prepared using ultra-sonication technique. XRD analysis of Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4 nanoparticles and Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4-rGO confirmed the cubic structure of ferrite nanoparticles. Cyclic voltammetry experiments showed that Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4-rGO nano-heterostructures exhibit the greater value of specific capacitance (151.33 Fg−1) as compared to Co0.30Zn0.70Fe2O4 nanoparticles (91.20 Fg−1). These values of specific capacitance were observed at 10 mV s−1. Moreover, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed that Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4-rGO nano-heterostructures have lower charge transfer resistance than the bare Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4 nanoparticles. Electrochemical experiments illustrated that Co0.3Zn0.7Fe2O4-rGO nano-heterostructures have efficient energy storage properties and can be utilized for electrode's fabrication in supercapacitors.
