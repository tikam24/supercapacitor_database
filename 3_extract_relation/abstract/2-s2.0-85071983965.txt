ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) using Prunus dulcis (Almond gum) was synthesized by greener approach. The hexagonal phase with wurtzite structure was confirmed by X-ray diffraction study. The size of the ZnO NPs were calculated and it was found to be âˆ¼30 nm. From the FTIR analysis confirms the presence of Zn band and other vibrations modes that are represent in the sample. However, from the absorption spectrum, it was noted that upto 243 nm absorption edges and the cutoff wavelength of 243.93 nm was calculated from ZnO NPs. From the cutoff wavelength the direct bandgap was found to be 5.17 eV. In addition, HRSEM analysis shows that the green synthesized ZnO NPs were well agglomerated and homogeneous; from the average particle size of ZnO NPs was found to be 25 nm. In the application point of view, supercapacitor properties of ZnO NPs was analyzed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) behavioral studies and electrolyte can be found using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). The zone inhibition of ZnO NPs on different gram positive, gram negative bacteria's and fungal microorganism shows excellent antimicrobial effects on the antimicrobial studies.
