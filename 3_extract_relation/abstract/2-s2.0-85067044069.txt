Nanocarbon electronic conductors combined with pseudocapacitive materials, such as conducting polymers, display outstanding electrochemical properties and mechanical flexibility. These characteristics enable the fabrication of flexible electrodes for energy-storage devices; that is, supercapacitors that are wearable or can be formed into shapes that are easily integrated into vehicle parts. To date, most nanocarbon materials such as nanofibers are randomly dispersed as a network in a flexible matrix. This morphology inhibits ion transport, particularly under the high current density necessary for devices requiring high power density. Novel flexible densified horizontally aligned carbon nanotube arrays (HACNTs) with controlled nanomorphology for improved ion transport are introduced and combined with conformally coated poly(3-methylthiophene) (P3MT) conducting polymer to impart pseudocapacitance. The resulting P3MT/HACNT nanocomposite electrodes exhibit high areal capacitance of 3.1 F cm−2 at 5 mA cm−2, with areal capacitance remaining at 1.8 F cm−2 even at a current density of 200 mA cm−2. The asymmetric supercapacitor cell also delivers more than 1–2 orders of magnitude improvement in both areal energy and power density over state-of-the-art cells. Furthermore, little change in cell performance is observed under high strain, demonstrating the mechanical and electrochemical stability of the electrodes.
