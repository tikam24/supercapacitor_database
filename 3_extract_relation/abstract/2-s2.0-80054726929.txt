Nano-structured spinel Li 2Mn 4O 9 powder was prepared via a combustion method with hydrated lithium acetate (LiAc·2H 2O), manganese acetate (MnAc 2· 4H 2O), and oxalic acid (C 2H 2O 4·2H 2O) as raw materials, followed by calcination of the precursor at 300 °C. The sample was characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy techniques. Electrochemical performance of the nano-Li 2Mn 4O 9 material was studied using cyclic voltammetry, ac impedance, and galvanostatic charge/discharge methods in 2 molL -1 LiNO 3 aqueous electrolyte. The results indicated that the nano-Li 2Mn 4O 9 material exhibited excellent electrochemical performance in terms of specific capacity, cycle life, and charge/discharge stability, as evidenced by the charge/discharge results. For example, specific capacitance of the single Li 2Mn 4O 9 electrode reached 407 Fg -1 at the scan rates of 5 mVs -1. The capacitor, which is composed of activated carbon negative electrode and Li 2Mn 4O 9 positive electrode, also exhibits an excellent cycling performance in potential range of 0-1.6 V and keeps over 98% of the maximum capacitance even after 4,000 cycles. © Springer-Verlag 2010.
