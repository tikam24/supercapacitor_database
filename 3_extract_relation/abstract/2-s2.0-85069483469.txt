In recent times, ultracapacitors (UCs) because of their characteristics related to faster charging and higher storage with reduced size has found wide applications in different fields including the design of very low frequency (VLF) oscillators. This paper presents a design scheme for an op-amp based single parameter tuned VLF oscillator using UC. The oscillator dynamics has been represented by fractional calculus and the model parameters corresponding to different specifications have been estimated using an optimization based approach. Further, a generalized approach for parameter tuning has been derived for generating the desired frequency using spline interpolation. The proposed scheme is able to correlate with the experimental frequency for different parameter settings. Considering the effect of variation in circuit elements on oscillating frequency, a quantitative robustness analysis using gradient based sensitivity function has been carried out. The analysis allows exploring the influence of individual elements on the system response and helps in their optimal selection for achieving higher accuracy and reliability.
