Nickel-based electrode materials have the advantages of higher theoretical specific capacitance and economical raw materials, et al. However, due to the lack of high specific surface area and relatively low conductivity, their practical application in supercapacitors is hindered. Nickel-based composite materials are a type of composite materials composed of nickel-based compounds and one or more different materials, which effectively combine the advantages of nickel-based compounds and other materials, such as good electrical conductivity and large specific surface area. They can overcome the shortcomings of a single nickel-based material, achieve excellent cycle stability and higher specific capacity, and have broad application prospects in the field of supercapacitor electrode materials. There are many ways to synthesize nickel-based composite materials, such as hydrothermal solvothermal method, chemical bath deposition method, sol-gel method, chemical precipitation method, electrochemical deposition method and so on. According to the dimensional classification of nickel-based composite materials, it can be divided into four types of composite materials: 0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D. The applications of these four types of composite materials in supercapacitors were mainly reviewed.
