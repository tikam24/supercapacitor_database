With the wave energy conversion system (WECS) integrated to grid, the lack of satisfactory ability to ride through transient voltage faults will reduce the stability and reliability of the grid. In this article, in order to enhance the low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) capability of the WECS, the structure and the mathematical model of a magnetic-gear permanent magnet synchronous generator (MG_PMSG) and a float-type wave energy converter are introduced first. The output power characteristic of the WECS is analyzed. Then, a novel coordinative LVRT control scheme based on supercapacitor energy storage system (SC_ESS) is proposed. The control scheme includes four modes, which are determined by the severity of voltage sags and active power deviation of the WECS. Machine-side converter control, grid-side converter, control and SC_ESS control are used coordinately in the four operation modes. The results of simulation and experiment have verified the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme in normal running conditions.
