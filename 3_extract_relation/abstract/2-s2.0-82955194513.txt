Tin oxide thin films were prepared via spray pyrolysis method. The structural and morphological properties of SnO2 thin films have been investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanned electron microscope (SEM) analysis. The XRD pattern confirms the tetragonal rutile structure of SnO 2 with preferential orientation along (200) plane. SEM image reveals the nanocrystalline nature of the SnO2 films. SnO2 thin films were subjected to electrochemical tests to study the supercapacitor behavior. Maximum specific capacitance of 168 F/g at a scan rate of 25 mV/s was obtained using 0.5 M KOH as the electrolyte. This is the highest value ever reported for spray deposited tin oxide thin films.
