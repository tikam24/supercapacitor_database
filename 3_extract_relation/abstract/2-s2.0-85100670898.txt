This article aims to use nitrogen-doped metal p-π conjugated-organic frameworks and derived carbon-rich electrode materials for high-performance electrode materials. Nitrogen-doped contributes to the energy storage performance, and the p-π conjugated-organic ligands of the conjugated system can not only improve the stability of the structure, but increase the conductivity of the material. Gradient carbonization can explore the maximum electrochemical potential of MOF-B, from which the previous 1271.0 increased to 2727.5 F·g−1 at a current density of 1.0 A·g−1. The excellent capacitance retention rate is 86.67% of the initial value at a high current density after 20,000 cycles. Besides, the MOF-B-600//AC also shows a high energy density of 63.62 Wh·kg−1 at a power density of 400 W·kg−1 and good coulomb efficiency of 90.7%. As a result, the excellent electrochemical performance of the nitrogen-doped and carbon-enriched MOF-B-600 has potential application prospects in energy storage devices.
