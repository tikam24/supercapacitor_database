Nanoporous carbon and nanoporous cobalt oxide (Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>) materials have been selectively prepared from a single metal-organic framework (MOF) (zeolitic imidazolate framework, ZIF-67) by optimizing the annealing conditions. The resulting ZIF-derived carbon possesses highly graphitic walls and a high specific surface area of 350 m<sup>2</sup>·g<sup>-1</sup>, while the resulting ZIF-derived nanoporous Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> possesses a high specific surface area of 148 m<sup>2</sup>·g<sup>-1</sup> with much less carbon content (1.7 at%). When nanoporous carbon and nanoporous Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> were tested as electrode materials for supercapacitor application, they showed high capacitance values (272 and 504 F·g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, at a scan rate of 5 mV·s<sup>-1</sup>). To further demonstrate the advantages of our ZIF-derived nanoporous materials, symmetric (SSCs) and asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) were also fabricated using nanoporous carbon and nanoporous Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> electrodes. Improved capacitance performance was successfully realized for the ASC (Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>//carbon), better than those of the SSCs based on nanoporous carbon and nanoporous Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> materials (i.e., carbon//carbon and Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>//Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>). The developed ASC with an optimal mass loading can be operated within a wide potential window of 0.0-1.6 V, which leads to a high specific energy of 36 W·h·kg<sup>-1</sup>. More interestingly, this ASC also exhibits excellent rate capability (with the highest specific power of 8000 W·kg<sup>-1</sup> at a specific energy of 15 W·h·kg<sup>-1</sup>) combined with long-term stability up to 2000 cycles.
