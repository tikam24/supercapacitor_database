AC impedance analysis is employed to study frequency-response characteristics of supercapacitors utilizing carbon nanotube and activated carbon block electrodes. Charge saturation for carbon nanotube occurs at about 250 mHz, but that of activated carbon is not observed in the frequency range of 100 mHz to 100 kHz. There is a 45° line in the complex-plane plot of each supercapacitor utilizing both carbon nanotube or activated carbon electrodes. Phase angles of supercapacitors with both kinds of electrodes are far smaller than 90° of pure capacitors.
