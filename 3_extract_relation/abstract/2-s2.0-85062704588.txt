Energy storage system (ESS) play an important role for power balance and stable operation in DC microgrid. Limited by current technology, hybrid energy storage system (HESS) consisted of battery and supercapacitor can meet the demand of power and energy in microgrid better than single energy. The distributed control based on consensus algorithm deal with voltage error and inaccurate power allocation caused by droop control. This paper proposed a novel distributed control scheme for multiple hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs) based on consensus algorithm. It can realize the internal coordination control of single HESS, i.e., power splitting between the battery and the super capacitor (SC) and regulate the DC bus voltage by setting the bandwidth of the outer-loop voltage controller. Meanwhile, the compensated power allocation among batteries or SCs were realized according to their state of charge (SOC) or terminal voltage. In addition, the consensus of these variables has been proved by the steady-state analysis. The small-signal stability analysis of a four-HESS DC microgrid system was investigated. Simulation results in the PSCAD/EMTDC verify the effectiveness of the control strategy in the case of different scenarios.
