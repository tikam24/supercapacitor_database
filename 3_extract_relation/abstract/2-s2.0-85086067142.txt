Owing to the superiority of high-power density and excellent cycling stability, supercapacitors (SCs) have been expected to substitute for secondary batteries as the desired orientation selected for energy storage devices. The incorporation of various heteroatoms into carbon-based materials via surface functionalization or doping technique has been considered as a significant way to ameliorate its properties for SCs application. In this review, a wide variety of fluorine-doped/fluorinated carbon-based materials are put together to overview the development path, preparation route and areas of application in detail. We critically review the optimization effect in electrochemical performance induced by the participation of fluorine element. Moreover, compared with large-scale energy storage devices, miniaturization, flexibility and planarization are an emerging development tendency of SCs. Fluorine-doped/fluorinated carbon-based materials hold great promise in the future.
