Monodispersed dumbbell-like Au-Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized and studied for use in supercapacitors. These dumbbell NPs show Au/Fe3O4-size dependent capacitive behaviors and the 7-14 nm Au-Fe3O4 NPs have the best specific capacitance of 464 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and capacity retention of 86.4% after 1000 cycles, much larger than pure Fe3O4 NPs (160 F g-1 and 72.8% retention). This capacitive enhancement is believed to arise from the Au-induced increase in electron transfer across the dumbbell-like NPs. Thise report demonstrates a new strategy to enhance oxide NP capacitance for applications in high performance supercapacitors.
