Flexible solid-state supercapacitors featuring lightweight and large capacitance have many attractive applications in portable and wearable electronics. Nitrogen-doped graphene is a promising electrodes material due to the extraordinary properties of graphene. This study demonstrates a magnetically enhanced dielectric barrier discharge that has the potential to efficiently exfoliate polyaniline-modified graphene at low input power. The plasma exfoliated N-doped graphene is subsequently used to fabricate flexible solid-state supercapacitors, which exhibit large specific capacitance of 45 mF/cm2 at 0.2 A cmâˆ’2 charging rate, ~100% capacitance retention after 1000 charge/discharge cycles at different current densities, and outstanding mechanical flexibility. The magnetically enhanced plasma exfoliation of graphite oxide offers a potentially cost-effective approach to producing high-quality carbon nanomaterials for energy storage.
