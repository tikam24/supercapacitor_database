A hierarchically porous carbon (HPC)/polyaniline (PANI) hybrid electrode was prepared by the polymerization of PANI on the surface of the HPC via rapid-mixing polymerization. The surface morphologies and chemical composition of the HPC/PANI hybrid electrode were characterized using transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. The surface morphologies and XPS results for the HPC, PANI and HPC/PANI hybrids indicate that PANI is coated on the surface of HPC in the HPC/PANI hybrids which have two different nitrogen groups as a benzenoid amine (NH) peak and positively charged nitrogen (N+) peak. The electrochemical performances of the HPC/PANI hybrids were analyzed by performing cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests. The HPC/PANI hybrids showed a better specific capacitance (222 F/g) than HPC (111 F/g) because of effect of pseudocapacitor behavior. In addition, good cycle stabilities were maintained over 1000 cycles.
