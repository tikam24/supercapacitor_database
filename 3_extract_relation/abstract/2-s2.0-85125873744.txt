Herein, a hybrid material composed of doped Polypyrrole (PPy) on two-dimensional Ti3C2Tx MXene surface is presented as a high-performance electrochemical supercapacitor electrode. PPy is deposited on the synthesized Ti3C2Tx surfaces employing in-situ chemical polymerization to fabricate PPy @Ti3C2Tx electrodes. The improvement of electrochemical performance of PPy@Ti3C2Tx is investigated by introducing two anionic dopants: α-naphthalene sulfonic acid (α-NSA) and a mixture of anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid sodium salt monohydrate/5-sulfosalicylic acid dihydrate (AQSANa,SSCA). While the maximum specific capacitances of the Ti3C2Tx, PPy@Ti3C2Tx and AQSANa,SSCA doped PPy@Ti3C2Tx are 232.2, 154.4, 105.9 F g−1 at the scan rate of 5 mV s−1, respectively; they retain less than 70% of their initial capacitance over 2000 cycles. α-NSA doped PPy@Ti3C2Tx exhibits the best electrochemical performance with the highest specific capacitance (347.6 F g−1) and significantly more capacitance retention (90% over more than 4000 cycles). This notable improvement proposes α-NSA doped PPy @Ti3C2Tx MXene nano structured material as a high-performance supercapacitor electrode.
