Self-powered integrated sensor with high-sensitivity physiological signals detection is indispensable for next-generation wearable electronic devices. Herein, a Ti3C2Tx/CNTs-based self-powered resistive sensor with solar cells and in-plane micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) is successfully realized on a flexible styrene–ethylene/butylene–styrene (SEBS) electrospinning film. The prepared Ti3C2Tx/CNTs@SEBS/CNTs nanofiber membranes exhibit high electrical conductivity and mechanical flexibility. The laser-assisted fabricated Ti3C2Tx/CNTs based-MSCs demonstrate a high areal energy density of 52.89 and 9.56 µWh cm−2 with a corresponding areal power density of 0.2 and 4 mW cm−2. Additionally, the MSCs exhibit remarkable capacity retention of 90.62% after 10 000 cycles. Furthermore, the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs based-sensor exhibits real-time detection capability for human facial micro-expressions and pulse single under physiological conditions. The repeated bending/release tests indicate the long-time cycle stability of the Ti3C2Tx/CNTs based-sensor. Owing to the excellent sensing performance, the sensing array was also fabricated. It is believed that this work develops a route for designing a self-powered sensor system with flexible production, high performance, and human-friendly characteristics for wearable electronics.
