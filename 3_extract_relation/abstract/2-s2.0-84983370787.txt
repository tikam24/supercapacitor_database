The proceedings contain 34 papers. The topics discussed include: characterizing new compositions of [001]C relaxor ferroelectric single crystals using a work-energy model; uncertainty analysis of continuum scale ferroelectric energy landscapes using density functional theory; creep behavior of magnetorheological elastomers under combined magnetic and mechanical loads; anisotropic thermal property of magnetically oriented carbon nanotube polymer composites; analysis of shape memory alloy sensory particles for damage detection via substructure and continuum damage modeling; fracture toughness of shape memory alloy actuators: effect of transformation-induced plasticity; characterization of origami shape memory metamaterials (SMMM) made of bio-polymer blends; layered conductive polymer on nylon membrane templates for high performance, thin-film supercapacitor electrodes; experimental characterization of PZT fibers using IDE electrodes; piezoelectric and dielectric properties of nanoporous polyvinylidence fluoride (PVDF) films; development, fabrication, and modeling of highly sensitive conjugated polymer based piezoresistive sensors in electronic skin applications; and mechanical analysis of carbon fiber reinforced shape memory polymer composite for self-deployable structure in space environment.
