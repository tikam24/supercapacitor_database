Two-dimensional metal-organic framework(2D MOF) nanosheets attract increasing research attention due to their unique properties originating from their abundant and easily exposed surface active sites, highly ordered pore structure, as well as varied and tunable chemical composition. These structural advantages help reduce the reaction potential and increase the diffusion rate and reaction rate in electrochemical energy storage and conversion. In this review, we first summarize the synthetic strategies of 2D MOF, and then an overview of applications of 2D MOF in supercapacitance(SC), oxygen evolution reaction(OER), oxygen reduction reaction(ORR), hydrogen evolution reaction(HER), carbon dioxide reduction reaction(CRR) is given. Finally, the status quo and prospects for the research of 2D MOF nanosheets are presented and discussed.
