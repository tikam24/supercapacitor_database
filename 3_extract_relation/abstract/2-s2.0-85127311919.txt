The energy storage devices for flexible/wearable and portable electronics are on immediate requirement demanding for high-performance flexible supercapacitors. Nevertheless, the real-time application of advanced electronics necessitates supercapacitors to own admirable mechanical properties to endure rigorous straining environments. Also, it is necessary to reduce the mass and volume of the whole device. Therefore, constructing a high-performance flexible supercapacitor based on better electrochemical and significant mechanical properties is still a formidable task. Herein, we have successfully fabricated a vanadium nitride thin film electrode onto the flexible, thin, and light-weight graphite paper substrate via reactive direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering method. The as-fabricated graphite sheets current collector is flexible, thin, light-weight, electrically conductiviting, cost-effective, and easy to fabricate. Furthermore, the as-prepared binder-free flexible negative electrode displayed better supercapacitor performance in terms of specific capacitance and cycle stability. The negative electrode exhibited an areal capacitance of 91 mF cm−2 and better cycling stability with > 64% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles. Moreover, the flexible hybrid supercapacitor is fabricated with NiCo hydroxide and VN films and showed a maximum energy density of 1.80 μWh cm−2 and power density of 387.5 μW cm−2 and good stability. These results propose that the fabricated electrode has great prospective as a power source for flexible, wearable, and portable electronic devices.
