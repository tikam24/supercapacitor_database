Co3O4 and NiCo2O4 spinels were successfully synthesized by simple sonochemical precipitation method. The above materials used as electrode materials for supercapacitor their structural and electrochemical responses were studied. The XRD results clearly evidence the formation of Co3O4 and NiCo2O4 cubic nanostructures. SEM analysis confirms the foams like morphology with porous structure. Electrochemical analysis shows the typical pseudocapacitve behavior of the materials with the specific capacitance values of 323 Fg-1 and 394 Fg-1 for pure Co3O4 and NiCo2O4 at the constant current density of 1 Ag-1. A high Cs value of the cobaltite nanostructure confirms the contribution of Ni2+ in the redox process. High conductivity and large Cs values of the NiCo 2O4 substantiate the promising electrode material for supercapacitor. Â© 2013 American Institute of Physics.
