Due to the need for increased power performance, supercapacitors are emerging as an alternative to conventional electric energy storage devices. Because of their unique properties, carbon nanotubes are a promising material for next generation supercapacitors. Specifically, the use of nanotubes to construct supercapacitor electrodes can increases the power density and performance of supercapacitors relative to conventional dielectric capacitors. The authors explain different methods of constructing supercapacitors using nanostructure materials and also outline the benefits of this innovative form of energy storage.
