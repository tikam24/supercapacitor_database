Poly[6,6′-bis(ethylene-3,4-dioxythien-2-yl)]-N,N′- dialkylisoindigo (PBEDOT-iI) was synthesized and incorporated as an electroactive material into electrochemical supercapacitors (ESCs) in type I and type III configurations. In type I ESCs, PBEDOT-iI provides a specific power of ∼360 W/kg and specific energy of ∼0.5 Wh/kg, while retaining about 80% of its electroactivity over 10 000 cycles. In addition, we report on the use of PBEDOT-iI in type III supercapacitors where operating voltages as high as 2.5 V were achieved with specific energies of ca. 15 Wh/kg, albeit with limited stability. © 2012 American Chemical Society.
