Renewable energies are generated from natural processes that are continuously renewed. Therefore, it is required to combine the PV modules either in series combinations or parallel combinations for developing the appropriate Photovoltaic (PV) panel/PV arrays. Several PV modules are connected in a series–parallel combination to constitute PV arrays. These PV arrays currently act as a decentralized source of D.C power for onward transmission. When identical wattages PV modules are coupled in a parallel or series connection, there must be a probability to the PV module's manufacturing process that gives rise to power loss. Mainly these types of losses are called Mismatch losses. Mismatch losses (power losses) in PV panels principally occur in terms of Relative Power Loss (RPL). Therefore, the authors carried out I–V characterizations of different technology of PV modules under varying insolation and temperatures. The main aim of the work is to develop the right kind of photovoltaic (PV) panel/PV arrays in a particular Eastern Indian climatic zone. From the authors' characterization of RPL, analysis was conducted to judge which technology is most suitable to build a large size array/BIPV. The experimental results reveal lower mismatch losses of poly-Si PV modules for crystalline silicon and amorphous silicon counterparts.
