Operating the cathodes of lithium-ion capacitors in an extended potential window for amphi-charge storage was proposed to be combined with a redox electrolyte-enabled capacity for balancing the typical gap between the capacity of the anode and that of the cathode. As a result, the as-obtained lithium-ion capacitors showed a three-fold increase in energy density. This journal is
