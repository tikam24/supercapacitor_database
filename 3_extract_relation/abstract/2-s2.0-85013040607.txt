Energy storage elements such as supercapacitors are widely used in high-power applications. However, due to single cell voltage limitation, an energy storage system with a large number of supercapacitors is often employed. Energy management systems are associated to energy storage systems in order to assure user and equipment safety. Balancing circuits, which enable the equalization of the voltage of each element in series, are a part of the energy management system device. The work presented in this paper aims to enhance the lifetime of energy storage systems. It relies on better controlling balancing circuits on the terminals of the storage system elements. With the conventional function of balancing circuit, the energy storage system is limited by its weakest element that may fail prematurely. Thus, a new balancing approach is presented, discussed, and analyzed. It is based on the elements degradation level prediction. The model predictive control used with the new approach aims to equalize aging speed between elements of a module and ensures a maximum lifetime to the energy storage system. A comparison with the conventional control shows that adopting this new approach, with the same equipment, can enhance the storage system's lifetime by dozens percent.
