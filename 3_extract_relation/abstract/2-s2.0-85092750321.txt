Indole molecules with fused heteroaromatic structures can be adsorbed on the N-doped graphene surface through the π-πinteraction. Therefore, the indole-functionalized N-doped graphene (InFGN) with mesopores is successfully fabricated by a simple hydrothermal method and subsequent vacuum freeze-drying process. The microstructure, thickness, element composition, pore structure, and electrochemical performance of InFGN are analyzed via SEM, TEM, AFM, BET, UV-vis, FT-IR, XPS, Raman, XRD, and electrochemical technologies. Since the five-membered aromatic heterocycles are electron-rich, the indole molecules fixed on the N-doped graphene surface can repair the structural defects generated by N doping. Electrochemical measurements show that the InFGN electrode highlights an excellent capacitance of 622.3 F g-1 at 2 A g-1 and a durable cycling life of 100.5% after 5000 charging/discharging cycle times. For further practical application, a symmetric device has been assembled by using InFGN electrodes, which realizes high-power and energy densities (18.8-20.6 Wh kg-1 at 800-8000 W kg-1). This study provides a shortcut for building green supercapacitors with enhanced energy storage performance.
