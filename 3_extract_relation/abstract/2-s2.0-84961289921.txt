α-Fe2O3 nanosheets grown on 3D nickel foam substrate have been successfully synthesized by a facile and efficient hydrothermal process and characterized by SEM, TEM, X-ray diffraction. The unique structural features endow them with excellent electrochemical performance. The as-synthesized product as the supercapacitor electrode is found to deliver a maximum areal capacitance of 383.3 mF/cm2 at a current density of 1 mA/cm2 in an aqueous electrolyte solution. It retains 88.15% of its initial capacity over 2000 cycles. The α-Fe2O3 nanosheets grown on nickel foam could be a promising candidate material for high-capacity, low-cost and environmentally friendly electrodes for the supercapacitors.
