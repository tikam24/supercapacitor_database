Novel nanoflake-like and nanobelt-like α-MoO3/graphene nanocomposites were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method through tailoring the content of Mo source. The formation mechanisms of α-MoO3/graphene nanocomposites with different morphologies has been investigated. As a model, the α-MoO3/graphene nanocomposites were studied for electrochemical energy storage supercapacitor devices. The results showed that α-MoO3 nanoflakes/graphene displayed better supercapacitive performances than that of α-MoO3 nanobelts/graphene, arising from the structural superiority and optimum compositions. The best composite exhibited a high specific capacitance (up to 360 F g-1) at a current density of 0.2 A g-1, good rate capability, and a nearly 100% long-term cycle stability. This study provided a facile and optimal experimental design to prepare α-MoO3/graphene composite materials which act as promising electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors.
