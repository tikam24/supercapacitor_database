Highly uniform polyaniline-Ag nanocable arrays (NCAs) had been electrodeposited into the anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) template for supercapacitor studies. Each nanocable has the average values dimensions, with approximately length of 20 μm and diameter of 100 nm. The supercapacitor using PANI-Ag nanocable arrays as electrode showed excellent stability over a long cycle-life by cyclic voltammogram tests. The capacitance value of the electrode was as high as 850 Fg -1 at 10 mVs -1 sweep rate, and there was a decrease in capacitance with an increase of current density. These interesting results indicated that PANI-Ag NCAs could be an ideal alternative to carbon based electrodes, regular conducting polymers and metal oxides for the fabrication of supercapacitor. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.
