The graphene/MnO2 composite was synthesized by a chemical co-precipitation method. The influence of the mass ratio of graphene and MnO2 on the structure and performance of the composite was investigated. The crystal structure and the surface topography of the composite were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. The electrochemical properties of composites were determined by constant current charge-discharge, cyclic vohammetry and AC impedance, respectively. The results indicate that the MnO2 in the composite is Î±-MnO2 at the mass fraction of graphene of 26.5%, and the composite exhibits good electrochemical properties. The constant current charge-discharge test confirmed that the specific capacitance was up to 313 F/g in the KOH aqueous electrolyte of 6 mol/L. The cyclic vohammetry test showed that the composite had a good electrochemical reversibility.
