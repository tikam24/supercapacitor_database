This paper introduces a methodology to size the fuel cell (FC) and ultracapacitor (UC) in a FC-UC hybrid electric vehicle (FC-UC HEV). The inputs of the methodology are the FC and UC datasheets and power profiles to drive the vehicle. The methodology considers two different energy management strategies (EMS) to define the power distribution between the FC and the UC. The methodology is performed to compare FC and UC sizes obtained with an optimal EMS based on dynamical programming and with a rule-based EMS based on fuzzy logic.
