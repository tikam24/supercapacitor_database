Synthesis and characterization of the tailored nanostructured vanadium molybdenum oxide (V xMo1-xOy) system is reported. TEM studies clearly show the formation of varying morphologies at vanadium and molybdenum rich ends. The effect of these differing morphologies on the surface area is presented. It is shown that compositions with x < 0.40 have electronic conductivity and a reduced contribution of ionic conductivity. Possible explanations for this observation are discussed. The VMO system shows promise for application as electrode materials in fields such as supercapacitors. Â© 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
