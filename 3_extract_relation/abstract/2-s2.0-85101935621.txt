Metal ion capacitors (MICs) are a new type of hybrid electrochemical energy storage (EES) device, comprising of a battery-type electrode and supercapacitor-type electrode, and with integrated the advantages of batteries and supercapacitors (high energy density, high power density, and long lifespan), making it an advanced energy storage device with commercial application prospects. However, the practical application of MICs is still limited due to the unbalance of kinetics and capacity between the electrodes, the slow ion/electron diffusion rate, and the poor structural stability of the electrodes. Recently, metal chalcogenides-base materials with distinct structure and fascinating characters have gained a great deal of attentions for applications in MICs, with outstanding improvement from charge storage capacity to reaction kinetics. In this article, we review recent research progress of metal chalcogenides-based materials in MICs. First, the energy storage principle and development requirements of MICs are introduced. Then, the critical advantages and vital functions of metal chalcogenides-base materials in the fabrication of MICs are discussed in detail. Finally, the challenges and prospects of the application of metal chalcogenides-based materials in high-performance MICs capacitors are presented.
