Electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) utilize electrodes with high surface area to achieve high-energy storage capability. In this study, flexible and freestanding carbon nanofibers derived from PIM-1, a microporous polymer with high free volume, were prepared by pyrolysis of the electrospun polymer. A BET surface area of 546 m2 g-1 was obtained upon carbonization of the electrospun PIM-1 fibers. After further heat treatments such as steam-activation and annealing, the surface area increased to 1162 m2 g-1. These carbon fibers were directly used as electrodes without the use of binders in a coin cell (CR2032) configuration and were characterized by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The activated and annealed fibers gave a specific capacitance of 120 F g-1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s -1 using 1,3-ethylmethylimidizaolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide as the ionic liquid electrolyte. From the galvanostatic charge-discharge test, the supercapacitor exhibited energy and power densities of 60 W h kg -1 (active material) and 1.7 kW kg-1, respectively, at a current density of 1 A g-1. High power application of this device was demonstrated by its 77% retention of the energy density (47 W h kg -1) at a higher discharge current density of 5 A g-1.
