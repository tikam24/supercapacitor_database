We report hierarchical-ordered ZIF−L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx MXene core–sheath fibers, in which a ZIF−L(Zn) nanowall array sheath is grown vertically on an anisotropic Ti3C2Tx core by Ti−O−Zn/Ti−F−Zn chemical bonds. Through highly efficient microfluidic assembly and microchannel reactions, ZIF−L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx exhibits well-developed micro-/mesoporosity, ordered ionic pathways, fast interfacial electron conduction and large-scale fabrication, significantly boosting charges dynamic transport and intercalation. The resultant ZIF−L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx fiber presents large capacitance (1700 F cm−3) and outstanding rate performance in a 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. Additionally, ZIF−L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx fiber-based solid-state asymmetric supercapacitors deliver high energy density (19.0 mWh cm−3), excellent capacitance (854 F cm−3), large deformable/wearable capabilities and long-time cyclic stability (20 000 cycles), which realize natural sunlight-induced self-powered applications to drive water level/earthquake alarm devices.
