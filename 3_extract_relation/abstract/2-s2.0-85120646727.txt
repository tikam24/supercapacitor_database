The flexible as well as wearable devices encroachment prerequisites proficient energy storage devices to satisfy their power demands. Metal ion batteries and electrochemical capacitors have attained the researcher's prodigious interest in the preset era owing to their grander energy storage features such as long cycle life, high energy, and power density. A major limitation in the practical application of metal-ion batteries in wearable devices is their inflexible and toxic nature, flammability, and low power density owing to organic nature electrolytes. In contrast, the utilization of aqueous electrolytes in supercapacitors makes them a safer substitute for wearable applications. As an emerging crystalline material, Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are innovative electrode materials implemented for energy storage devices because of their prominent features such as huge surface area, 3D porous and tunable structure, and permeability to extraneous entities, etc. Although the original MOFs exhibit less conductivity, this problem can be resolved by making their composites with conductive materials. Transition metal-based MOF electrodes are highly auspicious for wearable, and flexible supercapacitors due to their benign nature, low cost, high energy, and power density, as well as good stability. This review emphasizes the supercapacitors technology, their types, efficiency controlling factors for supercapacitors, new inventions in the field of non-noble metal-based MOFs electrode materials for the development of the supercapacitors by synthesizing the MOFs, MOFs derived materials, and composites by different fabrication schemes as well as the challenges associated with the utilization of MOFs and their promising solutions.
