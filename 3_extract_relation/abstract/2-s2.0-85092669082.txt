Herein, Zn-doped Co9S8nanoparticles were synthesized via an in situ solvothermal growth method. These particles have a pore size of 18 nm and specific surface area of 23 m2.g-1. A series of performance tests showed that microscale Zn doping significantly improved the catalytic activity and capacitor performance of Co9S8. In HER performance tests, Zn-doped Co9S8exhibited a lower potential of -361 mV at the current density of 10 mA.cm-2and the highest current density up to 38.26 mA.cm-2, excellent cycling stability as well. In capacitor performance tests, Zn- doped Co9S8showed pretty high specific capacitance with mass and area specific capacitances of 235.48 F.g-1and 812.4 mF.cm-2respectively at a current density of 1 A.g-1
