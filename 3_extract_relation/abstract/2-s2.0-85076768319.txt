Supercapacitor trams has been an emerging green and intelligent urban rail transportation system. Due to the high power demand of onboard supercapacitors, multiple charging modules are typically connected in parallel to charge the trams. However, The parallel connection of charging modules typically leads to the current imbalance and significant current ripples, which will degrade the reliability of the charging system. In this paper, we propose a cooperative charging approach for supercapacitor trams with ripple current suppression. In the proposed method, charging modules communicate with their neighboring nodes to synchronize the output current and achieve a constant phase difference. Then, a distributed phase-shift control method is proposed to diminish the ripple of the charging current. Experimental results show that the current imbalance can be nearly eliminated and the current ripple is reduced by 80.37% compared to the existing methods.
