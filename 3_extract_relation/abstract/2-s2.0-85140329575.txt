Flexible linear aqueous zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitors are considered as ideal materials for flexible and wearable electronic devices due to their advantages of safety, high flexibility and good wearable ability. Materials based on shape memory can satisfy the needs of fatigue resistance and deformation recovery, and have great advantages in the assembly of flexible wearable devices. In this paper, aqueous zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitor with shape-memory function was assembled by using PANI/NiTi shape-memory alloy wire as the cathode electrode and flexible zinc wire as the anode electrode. The device can be bent into different angles from 0° to 180°, after repeated bending for 200 times and heating to its deformation temperature, the original shape can still be restored, and the capacitance retention rate is up to 90%, with good mechanical resistance. By assembling with flexible zinc wire, the potential window can be expanded to 1.6 V, and the energy density has been greatly improved. Its energy density can reach 55.9 Wh kg−1 at 3 A g−1, which greatly improves its energy density and has great development potential in flexible and portable electronic devices.
