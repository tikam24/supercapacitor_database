The design of electrode materials with desirable morphology is of great importance and challenge to fabricate high-performance supercapacitors. In this work, NiCo2O4 nanopetal, nanosheet, nanoneedle and nanorod arrays on nickel foam have been synthesized through a facile hydrothermal method. The morphologies of NiCo2O4 arrays can be easily controlled by adjusting the kinds of alkali source and the addition of NH4F. The electrochemical results show that the NiCo2O4 nanoneedles electrode has the optimal electrochemical performance among four samples, demonstrating its promising application potential for high performance supercapacitors. This investigation about morphology control of NiCo2O4 electrode materials and the relationship between the morphologies and corresponding electrochemical performances provides strategies to enhance the performance of supercapacitor electrodes.
