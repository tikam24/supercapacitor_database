Two different heteroatom-doped microporous carbon materials, c-CBAP-N (nitrogen-doped) and c-CBAP-NS (nitrogen/sulfur co-doped), were prepared using a carbonyl-based aromatic porous polymer (CBAP) after amine-functionalization or chemical impregnation, followed by carbonization at 800 °C. The surface areas of c-CBAP-N and c-CBAP-NS were 1060 m2 g−1 and 1047 m2 g−1, respectively, which are predominantly microporous with a uniform pore size distribution centered at 0.4 nm. Their electrochemical performances as supercapacitors were measured by a three-electrode system using a 6 M KOH solution as the electrolyte. The specific capacitances of the c-CBAP-N and c-CBAP-NS electrodes were 203.2 F g−1 and 157.7 F g−1, respectively, as measured by galvanostatic discharge–charge analysis at a current density of 1 A g−1. Notably, these values are significantly higher than that of commercial activated carbon (130 F g−1 at 1 A g−1).
