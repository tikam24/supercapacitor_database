In-Wheel Motor (IWM) have been proposed to increase an efficiency and controllability of electric vehicle (EV). However, a risk of disconnection of power lines have been considered as a fundamental problem of IWM. Therefore, we proposed Wireless In-Wheel Motor (W-IWM) to solve this problem radically by using Wireless Power Transfer (WPT). In this paper, an advanced system of W-IWM which has multiple power sources, supercapacitor and dynamic charging circuit on its wheel side is proposed for a more effective operation. Additionally, a power-flow control of the advanced system is proposed and is verified by simulations and experiments. Furthermore, efficiency of the proposed system is investigated.
