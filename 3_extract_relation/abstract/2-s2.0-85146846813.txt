Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as intriguing porous materials with diverse potential applications. Herein, we synthesized a copper-based MOF (MOF-199) and investigated its use in energy storage applications. Methods were adapted to intensify the electrochemical characteristics of MOF-199 by preparing composites with graphene and polyaniline (PANI). The specific capacity of the synthesized MOF in a three-electrode assembly was significantly enhanced from 88 C g−1 to 475 C g−1 and 766 C g−1 with the addition of graphene and polyaniline (PANI), respectively. Due to the superior performance of (MOF-199)/PANI, a hybrid supercapacitor was fabricated with the structure of (MOF-199)/PANI//activated carbon, which displayed an excellent maximum energy and power density of 64 W h kg−1 and 7200 W kg−1, respectively. The hybrid device exhibited an appreciable capacity retention of 92% after 1000 charge-discharge cycles. Moreover, using Dunn's model, the capacitive and diffusive contributions as well as the k1 and k2 currents of the fabricated device were calculated, validating the hybrid nature of the supercapattery device. The current studies showed that MOF-199 exhibits promising electrochemical features and can be considered as potential electrode material for hybrid energy storage devices.
