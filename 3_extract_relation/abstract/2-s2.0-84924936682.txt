The physical and chemical characteristics of activated carbons produced from glucose and hydrothermally carbonized glucose are compared for the first time, as well as their performance as electrodes in supercapacitors with aqueous electrolyte (H2SO4). Both KOH-activated carbons exhibit similar textural properties, with Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface areas of ≈1400-1500m2g-1 and a pore volume of ≈0.70cm3g-1, with the pore size distribution centered in the micropore range. When tested as supercapacitor electrodes, the activated carbon produced from hydrothermally carbonized glucose exhibits a superior rate capability, owing to lower equivalent distributed resistance (being able to work at an ultrahigh discharge current of 90Ag-1), as well as higher specific capacitance (≈240Fg-1 vs. ≈220Fg-1 for the glucose-derived activated carbon at 0.1Ag-1). Both supercapacitors have excellent robustness, even for a large cell voltage of 1.2 V in 1 M H2SO4. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH
