Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) has the output characteristics of high voltage but low current/charge-transfer, making its low efficiency in powering most of electronics. To address this problem, power management circuits consisting of coupled inductors or transformers are usually employed. Here we report an inductor-free, auto-power-management design based on automatic switches between serial-connected and parallel-connected capacitors in a rationally designed manner, so that the output voltage can be lowered and the output charge is enhanced in proportion. In conjunction to theoretical analysis, a TENG along with proof-of-concept power-management units as automatically driven by the triggering motion for TENG is fabricated, which improves the rate for charging a supercapacitor by 5 times. Compared to previous work, this power-management design shows advantages of capability for harvesting low power/frequency scale energy, high scalability, and light weight, which paves a new approach for achieving high-efficient portable TENG-based self-powered system.
