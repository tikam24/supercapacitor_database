High energy density remains difficult to achieve using current lithium ion capacitors (LICs) because of the mismatch of kinetics between the capacitor-type cathode and battery-type anode. To enhance the kinetic match, a graphene aerogel (GA) supported LiNbO3 nanoparticles (LiNbO3@GA) 3D conductive network is configured as a novel anode as well as a boron carbonitride nanotube (BCNNT) as cathode for LICs. Kinetics analysis of LiNbO3@GA anode and BCNNT cathode are conducted to further investigate the cation/anion storage behavior. Benefiting from the high pseudocapacitive contribution of LiNbO3 and the appealing features of 3D conductive framework, the LiNbO3@GA anode demonstrates enhanced kinetic properties and high-rate pseudocapacitive behaviors. Anion storage from both surface-controlled pseudocapacitive reaction and diffusion-limited intercalation/ deintercalation reaction in BCNNT electrode enables the cathode to exhibit fast charge-discharge capability, which greatly reduces the kinetic mismatch between cathode and anode. The assembled LiNbO3@GA//BCNNT LIC delivers the maximum energy density of 148 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 200 W kg−1 with a desirable cycling stability (82% after 7000 cycles). This strategy exploits a new type of material and widens the path for pseudocapacitive advanced high-rate devices in energy storage area.
