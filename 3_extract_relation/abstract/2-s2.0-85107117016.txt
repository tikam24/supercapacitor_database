In this work, we demonstrate the fabrication of vertically aligned carbon nanowalls (CNW) enrobed with porous molybdenum sulfide (MoSx) as electrode for electrochemical capacitors with large areal capacitance that can be used for micro-supercapacitors. The deposition of MoSx onto the CNW electrode was performed using hydrothermal technique allowing a good coverage of the deposit along the CNW. The electrode can deliver an areal capacitance as high as 366 mF cmâˆ’2 (which is one of the highest reposted in the case of MoSx). Our strategy allows using hydrothermal technique to deposit different transition metal sulfides onto porous template in order to obtain materials with high specific capacitance and highlight CNW as promising template to deposit different materials for high-performance energy storage systems.
