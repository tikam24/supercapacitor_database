In recent years, the demand for energy storage equipment gradually increases, and supercapacitors are favored by researchers because of their excellent performances. Two dimensional transition MXenes are two-dimensional sheet materials similar to graphene, which have unique structure and rich functional groups. Ti3C2TX MXenes have the advantages of good conductivity, high specific area and high specific capacitance, and can be widely used as excellent electrode materials for supercapacitors. However, Ti3C2TX materials have the problems of easy oxidation and self-stacking, and needs to be modified and optimized as electrode materials. This paper mainly introduces the preparation methods of Ti3C2TX materials, such as HF etching, fluoride etching, alkali etching and electrochemical etching, as well as the research methods of performance modification of Ti3C2TX in the application process of supercapacitors, including the construction of Ti3C2TX porous structure, surface modification and preparation of Ti3C2TX composite electrode. The future progress trend of Ti3C2TX supercapacitors is also prospected.
