Novel micro-supercapacitors using ZnO nanowire (NW)-grown carbon fibres/carbon papers and SnO2 NW-grown carbon papers as electrodes are fabricated, and their electrochemical properties are presented. Carbon fibre and carbon paper combined with NW technology could provide insightful strategy to build wearable and flexible fabric-based electronics. Among four device strategies of electrodes (ZnO NWs on carbon fibre, ZnO NWs on carbon paper, bare carbon paper, SnO2 NWs on carbon paper), electrodes of SnO2 NW-grown carbon paper exhibited the best electrochemical properties such as the largest area specific capacitance (12 mF cm−2) and energy density (405 n Wh cm−2).
