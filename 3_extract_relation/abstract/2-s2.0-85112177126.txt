Electric power will be used in this proposed vehicle and electricity from a natural source of energy. The energy source outperforms a traditional solar panel in terms of high efficiency. Instead of batteries, the supercapacitor has been used as a battery that has a limited life cycle, although the battery is used in the real world and its regenerative energy will be used for short periods. Also, it is very quickly charged. Either wirelessly or with a wire can charge the car on run. A solar panel was used as the vehicle's power supply. The car performs well with high efficiency, which is the main goal is this research work. Day by day, battery-driven cars are very popular in Bangladesh. But to get charged takes a long time. It is also a costly source of power. So, the main purpose of this research work is to replace supercapacitor with battery because of its huge advantage, which technology makes a new era in the automotive industry. Supercapacitors based on graphemes improve daily. There is not much time when condensers compete with batteries. It has been said that this research work is a perfect model of an efficient electric car with clean energy with many significant improvements still to be made.
