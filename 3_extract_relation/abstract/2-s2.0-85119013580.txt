Heterostructures show great potential in energy storage due to their multipurpose structures and function. Recently, two-dimensional (2D) graphene has been widely regarded as an excellent substrate for active materials due to its large specific surface area and superior electrical conductivity. However, it is prone to self-aggregation during charging and discharging, which limits its electrochemical performance. To address the graphene agglomeration problem, we interspersed polypyrrole carbon nanotubes between the graphene cavities and designed three-dimensional (3D)-heterostructures of ZnMn2O4@rGO-polypyrrole carbon nanotubes (ZMO@G-PNTs), which demonstrated a high rate and cyclic stability in lithium-ion capacitors (LICs). Furthermore, the 3D porous structure provided more surface capacity contribution than 2D graphene, ultimately resulting in a better stability (333 mAh g-1 after 1000 cycles at 1 A g-1) and high rate capacity (208 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1). Also, the mechanism of performance difference between ZMO@G-PNTs and ZMO@G was investigated in detail. Moreover, LICs built from ZMO@G-PNTs as an anode and activated carbon as a cathode showed an energy density of 149.3 Wh kg-1 and a power density of 15 kW kg-1 and cycling stability with a capacity retention of 61.5% after 9000 cycles.
