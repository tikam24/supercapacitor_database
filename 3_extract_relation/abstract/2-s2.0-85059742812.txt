This paper describes the evaluation of carbon paper electrodes for supercapacitor applications. The electrodes are based on carbon micro-fiber paper modified with active material consisting of layers of silver nano-particulate ink and a nanocomposite of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and silver nano-particulate ink. The electrodes were characterized microscopically and electrically. Currentâ€“voltage studies revealed a consistent Ohmic behavior of the electrode when modified with different nanostructured active material. Among the active materials incorporated into the electrode, a nanocomposite of carbon nanotubes and silver nano-particulate ink significantly improved capacitance. The paper electrodes can be used for lightweight and ultrathin supercapacitors and other portable energy applications.
