Supercapacitors are playing a very important role in offering viable solutions for various requirements. In this paper, we attempt to explain the behaviour of a supercapacitor with the help of models using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD). We have studied the performance of supercapacitors using transmission line models and analytical models. We have made an effort to model and simulate the behaviour of a supercapacitor fabricated from porous activated carbon as electrode material. Molecular dynamic models help to study the particle size distribution, ionic behaviour etc. The instantaneous conductivity of a supercapacitor using a line transmission model is about 0.10071 S/cm and energy 0.152 J. Moreover, we analyse the variation of capacity of capacitor with the pore size of the electrode. In case of micropores, a constant capacitance value is observed with the change in pore size. The average pore size of activated carbon as an electrode material becomes ~1.21 Î¼m. This is attributed to the fact that the electrode ion boundary falls with the pore size. Further, few samples have been characterized using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy. In analytical models, the charging and discharging properties have been discussed using various circuit models.
