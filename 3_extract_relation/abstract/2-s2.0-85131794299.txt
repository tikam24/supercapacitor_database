Ni3S2 nanosheets dual-doped with manganese, cobalt elements on conductive nickel foam (MC-Ni3S2) had been synthesized by two steps hydrothermal and directly applied as the electrode for high-performance electrochemical Supercapacitors (SCs). A plausible mechanism is proposed to explain the formation of the manganese, cobalt elements dual-doped Ni3S2 nanosheets. SCs electrodes based on the MC-Ni3S2 nanosheets are characterized and exhibit a specific capacitance of 2922 F g−1 (365.3 mAh g−1) at 2 A g−1. After 2000 cycles, it exhibited an excellent cycling stability owing to the unique nanosheets architecture providing fast ion/electron transfer. The fabricate approach may offer a new strategy for the synthesis of other mix transition metal sulfide for applications in supercapacitor.
