In response to serious ecological and environmental problems worldwide, a novel graphene oxide (GO) induction method for the in situ synthesis of GO/metal organic framework (MOF) composites (Ni-BTC@GO) for supercapacitors with excellent performance is presented in this study. For the synthesis of the composites, 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (BTC) is used as an organic ligand due to its economic advantages. The optimum amount of GO is determined by a comprehensive analysis of morphological characteristics and electrochemical tests. 3D Ni-BTC@GO composites show a similar spatial structure to that of Ni-BTC, revealing that Ni-BTC could provide an effective framework and avoid GO aggregation. The Ni-BTC@GO composites have a more stable electrolyte-electrode interface and an improved electron transfer route than pristine GO and Ni-BTC. The synergistic effects of GO dispersion and Ni-BTC framework on electrochemical behavior are determined, where Ni-BTC@GO 2 achieves the best performance in energy storage performance. Based on the results, the maximum specific capacitance is 1199 F/g at 1 A/g. Ni-BTC@GO 2 has an excellent cycling stability of 84.47% after 5000 cycles at 10 A/g. Moreover, the assembled asymmetric capacitor exhibits an energy density of 40.89 Wh/kg at 800 W/kg, and it still remains at 24.44 Wh/kg at 7998 W/kg. This material is expected to contribute to the design of excellent GO-based supercapacitor electrodes.
