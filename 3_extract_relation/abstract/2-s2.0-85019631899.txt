Polydopamine and MnO 2 core-shell composites (PDA@MnO 2 ) for high-performance supercapacitors had been successfully synthesized by a facile and fast method. The morphology, crystalline phase and chemical composition of PDA@MnO 2 composites are characterized using SEM, TEM, XRD, EDS and XPS. The performance of PDA@MnO 2 composites are further investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in 1 M Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte. The PDA@MnO 2 core-shell nanostructure composites exhibit a high capacitance of 193 F g −1 at the current density of 1A g −1 and retained over 81.2% of its initial capacitance after 2500 cycles of charge-discharge at 2 A g −1 . The results manifest that the PDA@MnO 2 composites can be potentially applied in supercapacitors.
