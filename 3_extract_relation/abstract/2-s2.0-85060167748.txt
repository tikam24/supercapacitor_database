Common hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) usually suffer lithium-ion battery power fluctuations and it is difficult for them to meet the demand. This also constraints the performance of the energy storage system in which there is a the large amount of fuel consumption with less energy recovery of HEV in a single drive cycle. This paper selects a lithium-ion battery and super-capacitor hybrid energy storage system (Li-SC HESS) to drive the hybrid electric vehicle running together with an internal combustion engine. Besides, combined with particle swarm optimization-proportion integration (PSO-PI) controller and Li-SC HESS internal power limit management approach, this paper presents an improved HEV energy optimization control strategy based on the Pontryagin's minimum principle (PMP) algorithm. A simulation model of HEV is established by ADVISOR software to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the strategy. Results show that the energy optimization control strategy can improve the real-time ability of tracking the smallest track of HEV fuel consumption function for the purpose of energy conservation. The energy-saving emission reduction ratio is improved by 1.6% to 2.0%. Moreover, when power fluctuates the output of lithium-ion battery is reduced, thus improving the performance of the Li-SC HESS. The research is significant to the follow-up study on the key technologies in electric vehicles.
