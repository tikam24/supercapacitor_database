Abstract: In this work, nanostructured CoOOH grown on nickel foam as an electrode material for application in supercapacitor was prepared by a hydrothermal deposition strategy. The synthetic procedure includes formation of α-Co(OH)2 by epoxide precipitation, transformation of α-Co(OH)2 suspension to CoOOH colloidal solution and deposition of CoOOH particles on nickel foam by hydrothermal treatment. Due to the unique chemistry, the CoOOH particles deposited on nickel foam own extremely small size of about 3 nm. Induced by the small particle size and high conductivity of CoOOH, the as-prepared electrode material presents high electrochemical performance. It is demonstrated that the electrode material is capable of delivering high specific capacitance of 2165.1 F g−1 at scan rate of 5 mV s−1 with excellent cycle stability. It is surprising that this material presents high specific capacitance at very high current density (482.3 A g−1 at 63.9 A g−1).
