Transition metal selenides have sparked widespread interest in energy-related applications due to their unique physicochemical properties. Herein, polyhedral Co- doped NiSe2 (Co-NiSe2) is designed and built using MOFs as a template. The porous and electronic connected Co-NiSe2/rGO, which inherits the advantages of MOFs and has rGO uniformly covered, shows potential in the application of aqueous supercapacitors (SCs). The Co-NiSe2/rGO electrode for SCs has a high reversible capacity of 648 F g−1 at a current density of 10 A g−1 after 1500 cycles of continuous discharging/charging. In-situ Raman spectral analysis is also used to investigate the electrochemical mechanism of Co-NiSe2/rGO in the application of SCs. The concept of building electronic interconnected porous structured transition metal selenides can be expanded into a common methodology for advanced electrode in SCs.
