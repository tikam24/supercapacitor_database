Composite electrode engineering has been proposed as an ideal method for obtaining high-performance superapacitance devices. In this study, a surfactant-assisted electrodeposition technique was used to fabricate a hierarchical cobalt hydroxide/TiO2 nanotube hybrid electrode for supercapacitor applications. We observe that the cationic surfactant Cetyltrimethylammoinium bromide (CTAB) plays a major role in the formation of hierarchically architectured electrodes, as it provides control over the morphology of the deposited cobalt hydroxide nanosheets. For the optimum surfactant concentration, planar cobalt hydroxide planar structures were transformed into 3D architecture electrodes. Consequently, a superb specific capacitance of 1188 Fg−1 was obtained at a current density of 1 Ag−1 using the hierarchical Co(OH)2/TiO2 electrode which was twofold higher than that of a planar hybrid electrode (600 Fg−1). Furthermore, the three-dimensional hierarchical electrode also exhibited good cyclic stability with capacitance retention of 89.8 % after 5000 charge–discharge cycles. Finally, the role of surfactant-assisted hierarchical three-dimensional architecture design and its impact on the outstanding specific capacitance observed are been discussed in detail.
