This paper investigates the effects of the supercapacitor state of charge (SOC) on the peaking discharge current leading to the maximum charge delivered during a constant current discharge process. Recent studies show that the supercapacitor delivered charge first increases and then decreases when the discharge current decreases, i.e., the delivered charge peaks at a certain discharge current. By examining various SOC conditions, this paper reveals that for a fixed cutoff voltage, the peaking current increases when the SOC decreases. Moreover, for a specific SOC condition, the peaking current increases when the cutoff voltage increases. Therefore, this paper advances the understanding of the supercapacitor charge delivery behavior during a constant current discharge process.
