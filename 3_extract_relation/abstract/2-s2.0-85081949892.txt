At present, the demand for energy has increased dramatically, and supercapacitors have attracted much attention as green energy storage devices. Supercapacitors can be divided into electric double layer capacitors and Faraday tantalum capacitors according to the energy storage mechanism. Electrode materials of the electric double layer capacitor are mainly composed of carbon-based materials, and electrode materials of the Faraday tantalum capacitor are mainly composed of conductive polymers and metal oxides. The synergistic effects of the carbon-based materials combined with the conductive polymers or metal oxides can obtain more excellent electrochemical performance. The porous electrode materials have a large specific surface area, a unique porous structure and a diverse composition, and the excellent electronic conductivity has caused extensive concern. The relationship between preparation methods and structure-performance of supercapacitor materials with microscopic porous structure were summarized. It indicated that porous supercapacitor electrode materials were more favorable for obtaining high performance supercapacitors due to their higher specific surface area and porosity.
