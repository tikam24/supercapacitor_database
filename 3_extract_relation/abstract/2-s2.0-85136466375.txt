Amorphous MnO2/CuO/ZrO2nanocompositeswere synthesized by facile hydrothermal method at 120 Â°C. The nanomaterialswere prepared from KMnO4 with Mn, Cu and Zr aqueous salts. The mixed oxide active materials were produced through three different molar ratios. The synthesized nanocomposites demonstrated a phase mixer of tetragonal-MnO2, monoclinic-CuO and tetragonal-ZrO2. The ultrahigh specific capacitance of 1964F/g at a current density of 1A/g was achieved for the nanocomposite MnO2/CuO /ZrO2synthesized at a mole ratio 1:2:1. Based on the electrochemical performance; the nanomaterial synthesized at higher mole percentage of copper has shown a high-rate capability of 20.93 Wh/kg at constant power discharge of 4013.10 W/kg. These findings interrogated that Manganese Copper, Zirconium mixed nanocomposite is proved to be an excellent electrode material for energy storage devices.
