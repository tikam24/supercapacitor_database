Nickel cobaltite has become a popular energy storage material in recent years for high performance energy storage devices because of its low lost, high electronic conductivity, high electrochemical activity and environmental benignity. Nickel cobaltite (NCO)/porous graphene nanosheets network (PG) composites were synthesized via the two-steps hydrothermal method to enhance electrochemical properties in this study. The NCO/PG composite electrode demonstrated high specific capacitance of 3965 F g-1 at the current density of 1 A g-1 compared with the value of NCO that capacitance is 644 F g-1, and it maintained the 72% of the original capacitance after 3,000 charge-discharge cycles. It showed the maximum energy density of 46.3 Wh kg-1 and maximum power density of 1450 W kg-1. The NCO/GO composite has high potential as a psudocapacitance material for energy storage devices.
