Linear flexible supercapacitors are of considerable interest for future wearable electronics and photodetectors. Inorganic metallic oxide-based electrochemical pseudocapacitors have a high energy density whereas supercapacitors based on carbon-nanotube (CNT) yarns show high flexibility and high power densities. Besides high power density and energy density, fabrication of linear supercapacitors with excellent flexibility is still a challenge. Here, we report a linear supercapacitor architecture obtained by integrating CNT yarn and a Cu filament with NiCo2O4 nanowires. NiCo2O4 nanowires grow in situ on the surface of CNT yarn intertwined with the Cu filament. Due to the high electrochemical performance of both NiCo2O4 nanowires and CNT yarn and the high charge-transport efficiency of the Cu filament as current collector, the supercapacitor demonstrates a specific areal capacitance as high as 277.3 mF cm2 and an energy density of 35.76 μWh cm−2 coupled with a power density 0.154 mW cm−2. The linear supercapacitor is very flexible and can be woven into a fabric without losing its capacity to store energy. Its capacitance remains at 89 % after 5000 charge/discharge cycles. The linear supercapacitor may be used as an ultraviolet photodetector with good stability in response to the UV light signal and also to power light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
