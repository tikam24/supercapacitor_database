NiCo2O4 nanosheets for hybrid supercapacitors with long cycle stability are successfully fabricated by a one-step hydrothermal method. The battery type electrode material shows capacitances of 571.3 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 and excellent cycling stability. The specific capacitance retention can still retain 100% at 5 A g−1 after 10,000 cycles. In addition, When acts as electrocatalyst, the as-prepared samples present a low overpotential of OER (290 mV) and HER (165 mV) at 10 mA cm−2, and a low cell voltage of 1.72 V at 10 mA cm−2 and long-term durability for 14 h, indicating that NiCo2O4 structure can effectively improve electrochemical performance, which provides a broad possibility for the further development of cheap electrode materials for overall splitting.
