Renewable energies are increasingly used in the alternative supply of the future. Based on this, different energy source are interconnected in order to provide the sufficient energy to the electrical grid. However, meteorological conditions may affect the produced energy from photovoltaic panels and wind turbine generators. As a consequence, it may also trouble the quality of the exchanged power. This paper proposes a new storage system (hybrid four-level inverter) to solve the problem caused by the brutal impact of active and reactive powers. The main idea of the proposed hybrid structure is to compensate active and reactive power fluctuations through the intermediate stored energy into supercapacitors. To regulate the current injected or absorbed by the inverter, the control strategy is expressed by means of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI) technique. In addition, Space Vector Modulation (SVM) technique is applied for this hybrid structure to produce pulses for the different switches. Simulation results are presented to verify the advantages of the developed system in smoothing fast power variation.
