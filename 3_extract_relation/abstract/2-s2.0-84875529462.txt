The present study investigates a novel approach by which MnO2 nanoparticle and camphoric carbon nanobead blends are coated on Ti-foils for rechargeable energy storage applications. Depending on the amount of nanocarbon blended onto the MnO2 nanoflake system, these thin film nanocomposite electrodes can exhibit a specific mass capacitance value as high as 1020 F g-1. It has been shown that electrodes based on such a composite system can allow significant room for improvement in the cyclic stability of a rechargeable electrode system.Â© 2013 Acta Materialia Inc.
