The applications of traditional asymmetric supercapacitors are restricted due to the low specific capacitance of carbon negative materials. The rational design of positive and negative electrodes that afford high-performance asymmetric devices is particularly important. In this paper, we fabricate a cost-effective, environmental-friendly aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor by using CuCo2O4/CuO nanowire arrays as the positive electrode and RGO/Fe2O3 composites as the negative electrode. The assembled device exhibits a high energy density of 33.0 W h kg-1 at a power density of 200 W kg-1, and it still operates at a high power density of 8.0 kW kg-1 with an energy density of 9.1 W h kg-1. The current strategy will provide a fresh route for the design and fabrication of novel asymmetric supercapacitors with high energy density and high power density.
