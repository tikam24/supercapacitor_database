Composite of FeCo alloy embedded in nitrogen self-doped biocarbon was faciely prepared by pyrolysis of precursor of eggshell membrane mixed with nitrates. Three samples were prepared at different pyrolysis temperatures and well characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectrometry, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and N2 adsorption-desorption analysis. The as-prepared samples exhibit high electrocatalytic activities toward oxygen reduction reaction under alkaline conditions. Especially, the sample pyrolyzed at 800 Â°C exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity, stability and resistence for methanol corrosion compared with commercial Pt/C (20%) and exhibit a four-electron ORR pathway in alkaline condition. The catalyst also exhibits brilliant capacity of supercapacitor.
