Along with the emergence of wearable electronic devices, green energy devices like Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSCs), which are extremely safe and cheap, and have excellent stability and high power energy densities, have received great attention. Carbonenes, mainly including graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), are promising materials for ZHSCs because of their exceptional electrical conductivity and excellent mechanical stability. A comprehensive overview of strategies for the modification of carbonene-based materials for ZHSCs, and a brief summary of their energy storage mechanisms is given and topics for potential research are suggested.
