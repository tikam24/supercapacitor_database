A battery–supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system is investigated as a solution to reduce the high-power delivery stress on the battery. An optimally-sized system can further enhance the storage and cost efficiency. This paper discusses several possible problems in the sizing of a battery–supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system for practical applications. A sizing method that utilises data collected from a fully active embedded control hybrid energy system is proposed. The feasibility of the method is then tested on three load profiles that represent the load demand of inter-and intra-applications with a battery–supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system. The result is compared to a battery-only single energy storage system. The results verified that the number of batteries required in the hybrid energy storage system is reduced by at least 50% compared to the battery-only single energy storage system.
