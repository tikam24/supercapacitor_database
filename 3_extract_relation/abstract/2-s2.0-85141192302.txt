Recently, micro/mesoporous biomass-based functional carbon as an excellent electrode material and energy storage device has attracted massive attention due to the availability of abundant raw materials, adaptability to pore structure, good chemical-physical behaviors, high conductivity, enhanced energy density, and long life cyclic stability. This study performs micro/meso carbon from the novel galangal leaves biomass through KOH and CO2 activation as electrodes material for symmetric supercapacitors. The activated carbon obtained showed a clear hierarchical pore structure with an excellent micro:meso ratio of 56.72 %:43.28 % which caused their high electrochemical properties. The carbon was further assembled into electrodes through a binder-free solid disc designed to assess the electrochemical performance as a supercapacitor. The results indicated that the galangal leaves-based adapted micro/mesoporous carbon obtained a high specific capacitance of 161 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. Additionally, the symmetric supercapacitor had a specific capacitance retention rate of 78 % at 10 mV s−1 and low resistance in the aqueous electrolyte of 1 M H2SO4. The maximum energy density was 19.53 Wh kg−1 at an optimum power density of 132.32 W kg−1. Therefore, the appropriate micro/mesopores carbon ratio based on the novel galangal leaves biomass can be considered as a good electrode material for high-performance supercapacitor.
