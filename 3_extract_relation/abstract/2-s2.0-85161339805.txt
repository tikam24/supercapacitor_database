Two-dimensional niobium carbide (Nb2C), a member of the emerging MXene family, has recently garnered attention in various fields, including materials science, physics, chemistry, and nanotechnology. In this review, we highlight the material properties, synthesis strategies, and applications of Nb2C in energy storage devices, catalysis, and photovoltaic devices. We first introduce the synthesis methods, structural characteristics, and notable chemical and physical properties. Then, we discuss the influence of morphology, functional groups, and electrolytes on electrochemical energy storage devices, and present and compare advancements of various Nb2C-based batteries and supercapacitors. Next, we summarize the current progress of Nb2C MXene in electrocatalytic and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions. Finally, we present the implementation of Nb2C MXene as a charge transport layer in organic and perovskite solar cells. These examples encompass diverse architectures, interface configurations, and functionalization approaches, showing a promising future for Nb2C as a rising energy material. They also inspire researchers to come up with innovative material designs to improve device performance and extend possible applications of Nb2C MXene.
