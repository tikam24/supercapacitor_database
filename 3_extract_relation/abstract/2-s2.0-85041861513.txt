Herein, we report a facile and cost-effective electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of Co−Ni- layered double hydroxide (Co−Ni LDH) nanosheets on a stainless steel substrate without the use of any additives and binders. The structural features and surface morphology of the LDH were studied by FTIR, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy (SEM & TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The as-prepared electrodes were assessed for their performance in electrochemical supercapacitors by both cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge methods. The Co:Ni feed ratio during deposition played a vital role in influencing the specific capacitance value. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data indicate a favourable charge transport for the Co−Ni LDH prepared with a Co:Ni feed ratio of 2:1. The EPD parameters were optimized to maximize the electrode performance in the supercapacitor. A high specific capacitance of 1931 F g–1at a discharge current density of 1.25 A g–1has been obtained for a Co:Ni feed ratio of 2:1 which is quite comparable with the values reported in the literature. Moreover, the obtained specific capacitance value is higher than that of the electrophoretically deposited films of Co(OH)2(756 F g–1) and Ni(OH)2(281 F g–1). The protocol developed for the synthesis of Co−Ni-LDH is easily adaptable for large scale synthesis making it viable for practical applications.
