We report a simple strategy to prepare novel 2-dimensional graphene analog MoS2/MWCNT (molybdenum disulfide/multi-walled carbon nanotube) composites as electrode material for supercapacitor. The MoS2/MWCNT composites exhibit superior electrochemical performance to pure MWCNT and MoS2. The composite shows a high specific capacitance of 452.7Fg-1 at a current density of 1Ag-1, as compared to 69.2Fg-1 for MWCNT and 149.6Fg-1 for MoS2. In addition, the cycling measurements show that the MoS2/MWCNT composites maintain a specific capacitance of 412.2Fg-1 at 1Ag-1 after 1000 cycles corresponding to a reduction of capacitance of about 4.2%. The enhancement in supercapacitor is believed to be due to the layered MoS2/MWCNT conductive network which promotes not only efficient charge transport and facilitates the electrolyte diffusion, but also prevents effectively the volume expansion/contraction and aggregation of electroactive materials during charge-discharge process.
