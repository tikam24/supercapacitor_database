A heterostructured nanocomposite material consisting of MoS2 nanowires and RuO2 nanoparticles has been synthesized by an easy hydrothermal method and a simple chemical reduction technique followed by a calcination process. For the first time, the electrochemical performance of the as-prepared RuO2 nanoparticle dispersed MoS2 hybrid composite has been evaluated in three-electrode as well as symmetric two-electrode configurations in 1 M KOH electrolyte. At 1 Ag-1, the MoS2-RuO2 hybrid electrode exhibits specific capacitance (Csp) values of 972 Fg-1 (3- electrode) and 719 Fg-1 (two-electrode). Moreover, the symmetric supercapacitor based on the composite electrodes retains 100% cycling stability over 10000 cycles, which makes MoS2-RuO2 composite, a promising electrode for energy storage applications.
