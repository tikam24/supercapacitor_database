Graphene-based fiber electrodes have attracted more interests for portable/wearable electronics. Here, the porous structure of the graphene-based fibers was investigated with nanoscale carbon powder (NC) and micrometer carbon black (CB) as spacer, respectively. The well-defined honeycomb-like mesoporous reduced expandable graphene oxide (rEGO)/NC fiber was fabricated by the wet spinning of the expandable graphene oxide (EGO) with 30% of NC as spacer, possessing a unique mesoporous structure with pore size of ∼4 nm and BET specific surface area of 142.0 m2 g−1. Owing to the unique mesopores and larger specific surface area, the rEGO/NC fiber delivered a higher specific capacitance up to 113.0 F cm−3, in comparison with the rEGO/CB fiber (73.7 m2 g−1 and 75.7 F cm−3). After the in-situ electropolymerization of aniline adsorbed in the honeycomb-like fiber, the polyaniline (PANI)@rEGO/NC composite fiber was obtained with specific capacitance of 177.5 F cm−3. The symmetrical solid-state supercapacitors based on the proposed PANI@rEGO/NC composite fibers exhibited better electrochemical, bending and cyclic performance than the PANI@rEGO/CB ones, owing to the well-defined honeycomb-like mesoporous structure.
