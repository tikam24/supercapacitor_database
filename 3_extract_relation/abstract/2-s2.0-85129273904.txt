Nitrogen-doping three-dimensional hydrangea-like porous carbons (NHPCs) were prepared by coal tar pitch oxidized by KMnO4 (OCTP) as carbon precursor and p-phenylenediamine (pPDA) as nitrogen source. The terminal amine group on the pPDA and the oxygen-containing functional group on the OCTP were grafted together by chemical oxidative polymerization. Not only successfully achieved nitrogen-doping, but also the benzene ring in pPDA could occupy the branching space of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in OCTP and reduce its irreversible accumulation. The as-prepared NHPCs showed a unique three-dimensional hydrangea-like structure, which could provide large specific surface area (2237 m2 g−1), abundant micro/mesopores and high nitrogen content (3.7%). Remarkably, NHPC-600 exhibited excellent electrochemical performance as the electrode material of supercapacitors, such as a high specific capacitance up to 423 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and long cycle stability (maintaining 94.3% of the initial capacitance after 10,000 cycles) in 6 M KOH. Simultaneously, NHPC-600 achieved a higher working voltage (3.6 V) in EMIMBF4 electrolyte, thereby obtaining a high energy density (56.4 Wh kg−1).
