Recently, hybrid supercapacitors gained the interest of energy experts because of their high energy/power density and long lifespan. In this manuscript, Zn1-xNdxO (x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, and 0.05) nanoparticles were synthesised using the microwave assisted co-precipitation method and characterized using XRD, Raman, TEM, XAS, and electrochemical analyses.The HR-TEM images confirmed that all of the samples exhibited spherical morphologies with average particle sizes in the range of 17â€“20 nm. The XRD and Raman spectroscopy studies infer that crystallinity enhances with increase in the doping concentration. The Nd ions were revealed to possess a valence state of +3, while the Zn ions had a valence state of +2, confirmed from XAS analyses. The electrochemical analysis showed that 3 % Nd-doped ZnO electrode exhibited the maximum specific capacitance (SC) of 154 F/g, at a current density of 2.5 A/g and the best cycle stability when compared to the undoped and other Zn1-xNdxO samples (retaining 92 % after 1000 cycles). The specific capacitance of undoped ZnO determined at a current density of 2.5 A/g was found to be 21 F/g. The energy density and specific power of a 3 % Nd3+-doped ZnO supercapacitor were measured at 7.36 Wh/kg and 730 W/kg, respectively. The electrochemical results suggest that Nd3+-doped ZnO material would serve as an electrode material for supercapacitors application.
