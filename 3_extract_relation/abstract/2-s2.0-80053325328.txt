Reduced graphene oxide (RGO)-carbon nanotubes (CNTs) composite films were successfully fabricated by electrophoretic deposition and used as electrode materials for electrochemical supercapacitors. RGO was obtained by microwave-assisted reduction of graphene oxide dispersion in acidic aqueous solution using a microwave synthesis system. The electrochemical performances of the films were analyzed through cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry tests. The results showed that as compared with pure RGO and CNTs, RGO-CNTs composite with 40% CNTs exhibited an optimal electrochemical capacitance of 87 F/g due to a synergistic effect of RGO and CNTs.
