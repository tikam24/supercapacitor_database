The present work reports a simple method to form SrO nanostructures onto the cotton cloth carbon surface to improve the performance of electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) characteristics. The SrO-ACC (activated carbon cloth) is synthesized by a simple adsorption technique and in this study, pure and SrO-ACC electrodes were prepared without using any binders. The morphology of the as-prepared carbon electrodes were characterized by HR-SEM. The surface area, pore volume, and pore size distribution were measured by using nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms at 77 K. The capacitance of pure and SrO-ACC electrodes were measured by cyclic voltammetry in a standard electrochemical three-electrode cell, which contains platinum counter electrode and a standard Ag/AgCl reference electrode in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The obtained results pointed out that pure and SrO-ACC shows a good electrochemical property and the specific capacitance in the range of 174–400 F/g at the scan rate of 2–3 mV/s.
