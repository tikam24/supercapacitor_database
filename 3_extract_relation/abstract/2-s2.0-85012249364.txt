Layered birnessites were prepared by reflux reaction of concentrated hydrochloric acid and KMnO4 at 100â„ƒ. The Mn average oxidation state (AOS), affected by the relative content of Mn(IV) and Mn(III), was controlled by adjusting the molar ratio of hydrochloric acid and KMnO4. The crystal structures, micromorphologies, compositions and bond length were characterized using X-ray diffractometer (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and the influence of Mn AOS on the electrochemical performance of birnessites was studied by cyclic voltammetry and charge/discharge test. Results indicated that birnessites with three-dimension hierarchical microspheres composed of disk-shaped plates were formed. Mn AOSs were obtained as 4.02, 3.88 and 3.72 when the molar ratios of concentrated hydrochloric acid and KMnO4 were controlled as 1.35:1, 1.66:1, and 2:1, respectively. The particle size of microspheres and the thickness of plates decreased, and the corresponding specific surface area increased with a decrease of Mn AOS. The measured interlayer distances of (001) crystal plane and the content of K+ and crystal water increased due to the increasing of Mn AOS. The supercapacitor performance increased with an increase in Mn AOS, and the interlayer distances of (001) crystal plane, the content of K+ and crystal water possibly played an important role in improving the electrochemical performance of birnessite. Birnessite with Mn AOS of 4.02 exhibited the best electrochemical performance with initial discharge capacity of 232 F/g, and it decreased to 222 F/g with retention rate about 95.7% after 200 cycles.
