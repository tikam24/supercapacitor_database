Supercapacitors have attracted great attentions for their excellent performance in the energy devices. In this work, the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) modified NiCo2O4 (rGO/NiCo2O4) are fabricated by a simple hydrothermal route. After the rGO modification, the sea urchin-like structure of NiCo2O4 was broken and the NiCo2O4 nanowires would intertwine with each other. Benefit from the large surface areas and the active sites of this unconsolidated structure, the as-prepared rGO/NiCo2O4 exhibited the excellent specific capacitance of 1003 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1 and enhanced rate capability (89% from 1 to 10 A g−1). And the cycle stability could reach 57% retention after the 10000 cycles. The rGO/NiCo2O4 composite might hold great promise for future application of the high-performance supercapacitor.
