The majority of the world's energy needs come from fossil fuels, which are a major contributor to climate change since they release carbon dioxide, one of the main global greenhouse gases (GHG). Natural resources that are readily available, such as water, wind, solar, and biomasses, are being thoroughly investigated to displace fossil fuels. The generation, storage, and conversion of energy from these sources is challenging and required special materials. Multi-metallic carbide nanostructures are one of the many functional materials that can be used for energy generation and storage. The metal carbide nanostructures show better catalytic performance in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors, the nanostructure electrocatalysts are used as anode and cathode electrodes. To increase the catalytic activity, stability, and durability in the electrochemical reactions, several state arts of transition metal carbide-based nanomaterials have been developed. The electrical and chemical properties of the transition metal catalysts are enhanced by the introduction of carbides. The multi-metallic carbide can replace expensive electrocatalysts like platinum, iridium oxide, and ruthenium oxides in addition to their promising activity and stability. The electrocatalytic applications of bimetallic and trimetallic carbide nanostructures/nanocomposites in electrochemical water splitting, lithium-ion batteries, and supercapacitor is highlighted in the current review.
