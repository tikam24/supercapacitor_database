In this study, we presented the synthesis of tin telluride (SnTe) nanoparticles and reduce graphene oxide mixed with SnTe (rGO/SnTe) nanocomposite through the hydrothermal technique. The rGO with various contents (0, 5 and 10%) has been added in SnTe and nominated as ST, STG-1 and STG-2 respectively for electrode materials of supercapacitor. The prepared materials were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Cyclic voltammetry (CV), Charging/discharging (GCD) and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis. XRD patterns approve SnTe form a cubic crystal phase. Based on the FTIR results Sn–Te vibration modes was observed in pure SnTe and in rGO/SnTe composite some vibration mode were disappeared at 10% rGO content. FESEM study presences samples exhibit spherical like shapes morphology with wide space and the average grain size is in between 45 and 32 nm. EDX analysis confirm the stoichiometry of the electrode materials. The specific capacitance (SC) for SnTe electrode 623 Fg-1 rises to 1316 Fg-1 with 10% rGO/SnTe nanocomposite, which specifies that rGO has improved the electrochemical characteristics of SnTe nanoparticles. The rGO/SnTe nanocomposite electrode has the highest specific energy density and specific power density value of 16 Wh/kg and 3748 W/kg, respectively with columbic efficiency retention is 92.2% after 1000 cycles. These outcomes collectively indication that SnTe/rGO nanocomposite have extensive application prospects.
