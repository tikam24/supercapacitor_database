Herein, we report a facile hydrothermal synthesis of MoSe2 nanoflowers composed of several MoSe2 nanosheets for electrochemical energy storage. As an electrode material of supercapacitor, MoSe2 nanoflower exhibits high specific capacitance (95 Fgâˆ’1) and excellent cycling stability (90% after 10,000 cycles) due to their porous morphology, indicating their applicability as a potential electrode material for energy storage devices.
