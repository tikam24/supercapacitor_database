Design and construction of multiphase nanostructures of metal organic frameworks (MOF) has recently been considered an effective method for the preparation of synergistic and excellent performance supercapacitor materials. Herein, Ni-Co-Mn-based metal organic frameworks (Ni-Co-Mn MOF) are prepared through an effortless one-step hydrothermal method, in which multiple metal nodes were evenly distributed between MOF nanostructure through ligands and formed a multiphase nanostructure through synergy. The synthesized Ni-Co-Mn0.25 MOF exhibits a prominent specific capacitance of 1575 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, remarkable rate capability and cycling stability. Moreover, we constructed an asymmetrical supercapacitor, which performed an excellent energy density of 73.56 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 399 W kg−1 and great cycling stability with 81.64% of original capacitance after 5000 cycles. Ni-Co-Mn MOF is a promising hybrid electrode material for excellent performance supercapacitor as well as it provides a simple and economic way to fabricate supercapacitor composite materials.
