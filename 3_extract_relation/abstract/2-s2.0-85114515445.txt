The concept of graphene in a carbon framework has given rise to enormous improvements to the specific properties of materials. Notably, the combination of graphene with polymeric, metallic and ceramic materials has significantly improved mechanical resistance, electrical and thermal conductivity, and thermal stability of the resulting composite material. In this review, we discuss comprehensive literature on graphene-based composite materials for biomedical and related energy storage applications with emphasis to the synthesis techniques and improved properties of the nanocomposite materials due to graphene addition.
