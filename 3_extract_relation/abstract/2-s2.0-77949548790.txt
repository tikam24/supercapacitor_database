Manganese dioxide nanoparticles were prepared by a chemical precipitation method. Composite electrodes for electrochemical supercapacitors (ES) were fabricated by impregnation of slurries of the manganese dioxide nanoparticles and carbon black into porous nickel foam current collectors. In the composite electrodes, carbon black nanoparticles formed a secondary conductivity network within the nickel foam cells. Obtained composite electrodes, containing manganese dioxide and 0-20wt% carbon black with total mass loading of 55mgcm-2, showed a capacitive behavior in the 0.1-0.5M Na 2SO4 solutions. The highest specific capacitance (SC) of 128Fg-1 was obtained at a scan rate of 2mVs-1 in the 0.5M Na2SO4 solutions. The SC increased with increasing carbon black content in the composite materials and increasing Na2SO 4 concentration in the solutions and decreased with increasing scan rate.
