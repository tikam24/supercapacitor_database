In this study, novel nickel (Ni) doped Iron (Fe) metal-organic frameworks (Fe-MOF) were synthesized using a facile one-step solution strategy, which was developed greenly in a sealed hydrothermal system. The obtained Fe-MOF (Ni) displayed short, thick sheet-like structure; large nanoparticles; long sheet-like structures when the concentrations of nickel were changed. Especially, tested as supercapacitor electrodes, when the ions concentration ratio of Ni and Fe in the reactants was 1:1, the product Fe-MOF (Ni 50%) exhibited an excellent electrochemical performance with superior specific capacitance (4248 F/g under 1 A/g current density), and remarkable cycling life (88% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles), mainly attributed to high surface area of the product.
