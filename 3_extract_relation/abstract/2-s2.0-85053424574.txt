An efficient alternative for the management and valorization of the huge amount of seasonal wastes generated by winery industries is shown. Sustainable porous carbons were successfully prepared by one-pot activation of grape bagasse, stalks and oil free-seeds. Benefiting from the high moisture of these residues, a prior hydrothermal carbonization increases the activation yield and generates carbons with less oxygen content and inorganic impurities. The mild physical or chemical activation of winery wastes resulted in highly microporous carbons with specific surface SBET up to 2053 m2/g and great potential for environmental protection and electrical energy storage. They are excellent sorbents for CO2 capture under post- and pre-combustion conditions (16 and 69 wt%, respectively) and achieve superior electrochemical capacitance of nearly 300 F/g in aqueous electrolyte and 180 F/g in ionic liquid based-medium.
