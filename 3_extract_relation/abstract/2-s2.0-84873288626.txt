In this paper a new front-end converter for charging and discharging of supercapacitor based on the single-phase matrix converter and buck-boost converter topologies is considered. The advantage of this converter is the absence of large reactive elements and the ability to control the output of AC sinusoidal voltage within a wide range. The results of simulation of this converter in the PSIM environment prove the ability of this topology to operate well with the defined storage. Â© 2012 IEEE.
