In order to obtain a supercapacitor positive electrode material with a higher specific capacity, the capacitance performance of polymetallic organic frameworks and their derivatives was studied on the basis of a single metal-organic framework material(MOF), and polymetallic organics were prepared with different proportions of metal elements (Ni, Co). The MOF material is further obtained as a nano-scale hollow rod-shaped metal phosphate. When the metal element ratio of Ni ∶Co is 8 ∶1 in the raw material, the metal phosphate has the maximum specific capacitance value of 895. 29 Fg-1.
