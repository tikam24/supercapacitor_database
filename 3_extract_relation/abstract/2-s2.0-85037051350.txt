A hybrid of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) interlacing hollow NiCoO2 (G-HNCO) nanocages in a size range of 300~500 nm with rough surface is synthesized by a chemical etching Cu2O templates and followed by GNR interlacing process. The G-HNCO showed high electrochemical performance of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which exhibited small onset potential of 1.50 V and achieved current densities of 10 mA cm−2 at potentials of 1.62 V. Also, the hybrid delivered high capacitance of 937.8 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in supercapacitor (SC) tests as well as stable cycling performance in both OER and SC measurements. The approach to synthesize the hybrid is simple and scalable for other graphene nanoribbon-based electrocatalysts.
