Automated guided vehicle (AGV) plays an important role in the context of industry 4.0. The power supply is the key to ensure reliable and efficient AGV. Lithium-ion capacitor (LIC) is an innovative hybrid energy storage device, possessing the advantages of high energy density, high power density, long cycle life and wide working temperature range. LIC can be used with Opportunity (OP) charging for a vehicle during the operation phase, using predefined fast charging stations and avoiding full and long-time charges. In this work, the consistent screening and grouping techniques of LIC pack, equivalent circuit model, maximum working power matching method, fast-charge and working condition measurement for AGV have been studied. By the fast-charge test of constant current and constant voltage for LIC pack at various constant current (60−360 A), the experimental results show that LIC pack can complete 100% department of defense charging within 2 min when the constant current is higher than 300 A. According to the constant power (200−1200 W) and working condition measurement for LIC pack, this work provides technical support for the maintenance-free and uninterrupted operation of AGVs.
