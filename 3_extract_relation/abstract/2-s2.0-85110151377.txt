The wide application of lithium ion capacitors (LICs) is now seriously limited by the complex synthesis process of cathode carbon with a demand for high capacity. In this study, a metal organic frameworks (MOFs)-derived porous carbon with super large porous volume (3.504 cm3 g−1) and specific surface area (3132 m2 g−1) is obtained by carbonization at a reasonable temperature and acid pickling. The MOF can be facilely and efficiently synthesized by the coprecipitation method (for a few seconds) in deionized water from fluorine-containing organic precursors and zinc-based salts. Moreover, benefiting from the reasonable graphitization and optimized O doping, the porous carbon has a high specific capacity (123.4 mAh g−1) and excellent cycling stability (10000 cycles) in a half-cell with organic electrolyte. The porous carbon was also used as the cathode in LICs devices with the sucrose hard carbon as an anode. The LICs devices can possess an energy density of 157 Wh kg−1 and a power density of 40 KW kg−1, as well as the the capacities remain ~ 85% after 4000 cycles. This preparation method of ultra-high pore volume MOFs-derived carbon and high-performance LICs devices can provide a unique pathway toward the more advanced energy storage equipment.
