A novel hierarchical structure of Ni3S2 nanosheets coated on mesoporous NiCo2O4 nanoneedles arrays was designed and investigated. Due to the positive synergistic effect of the two materials resulting from the three-dimensional coated structure, the as-prepared NiCo2O4/Ni3S2 heterostructure hybrid exhibited excellent electrochemical performance with areal capacitance of 4569.1 mF cm-2 at current density of 1 mA cm-2 as well as remarkable cycling stability of 89.2% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles. The impressive results here may pave the way to development of high-performance electrode materials for supercapacitors.
