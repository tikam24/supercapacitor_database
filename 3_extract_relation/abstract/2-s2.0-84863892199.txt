The weight and volume of conventional energy storage technologies greatly limits their performance in a range of mobile platforms. Significant research efforts are currently underway to reduce device size and mass through improvements in energy density and power density. Enabling a device to perform additional functions, such as bearing mechanical load, is an alternative approach to weight reduction if it operates at a high enough efficiency relative to the individual materials it replaces. Our research focuses on structural batteries and structural supercapacitors, which could be used to replace conventional structural components, such as vehicle frame elements, with power-generating components to provide significant system-level weight reductions and extend mission times. In this study, structure is being designed directly into the electrolyte and electrode supercapacitor components. Novel solid polymer electrolyte materials are being developed as a matrix for fiber composites. In this case, the high surface area, conductive carbon fibers act as composite reinforcement as well as capacitor electrodes. Scalable, cost-effective composite processing techniques are being used to integrate the components. The development of comprehensive testing methods for solid state supercapacitors has been essential for evaluation of these multifunctional systems. Cyclic voltammetry conditioning and galvanistatic charge-discharge testing, and EIS are used to determine the capacitance, energy, and power density of the supercapacitors. Composite mechanical testing targeting fiber and matrix properties independently are carried out to ASTM standards. Metrics have been developed to correlate the material and electrochemical properties with the multifunctional performance of the structural supercapacitors.
