Gel polymer electrolytes are an important advancement in energy storage technology due to their enhanced safety and practical ionic conductivities at ambient temperatures. Herein, a simple one-step facile synthesis of chemically crosslinked polyurethanes containing polyethylene oxide (PEO) and polypropylene oxide (PPO) macromolecular segments was developed, using ubiquitous non-toxic tetrabutylammonium or potassium chloride and bromide salts as catalysts. These salts were shown to catalyze the gelation of diol-diisocyanate polyaddition reactions within minutes. When impregnated with a liquid electrolyte, the resulting gel electrolyte exhibited a practical ionic conductivity of 1.1×10−4 S cm−1 at 40 °C and low segmental chain motion activation energy (11 kJ mol−1). These findings further promote PEO-PPO polyurethanes as a biocompatible class of materials suitable for further exploration as gel polymer electrolytes for supercapacitors.
