Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is an efficient mechanical energy harvesting technology that relies on the coupling effects of contact electrification and electrostatic induction. Here, inspired by the principles of electrical double layer and supercapacitor (SC), we present a newly designed TENG based on electrostatic double layer formed by electrostatic charges adsorbing on the surface of the dielectric layer coated on the electrodes. We built three-dimensional electrodes using polyurethane sponge and silver nanowires, by mimicking the structure and mechanism of SC. After electrochemical polarization charging or corona charging, a thirteen times enhancement of output power was achieved. Furthermore, a whole compressible self-charging power system composed of TENG and SC was fabricated to sustainably drive electric devices. These findings show a proof-of-concept TENG based on electrostatic double layer, and provide new opportunities for chemical principles to promote energy conversion.
