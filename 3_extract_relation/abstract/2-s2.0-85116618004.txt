Energy storage has long been regarded as the pinnacle of energy technology. Low-cost energy storage will usher in a new era in power systems, allowing for extensive use of renewable energy technology. This hybrid energy storage device uses a super-capacitor in conjunction with a battery in an electric vehicle. In this paper, a neural network training method is described for optimizing energy demand from batteries and super-capacitors, hence enhancing device efficiency. Results shows that the error is decreased to its minimum extend by using proposed hybrid storage system and neural network toolbox in MATLAB.
