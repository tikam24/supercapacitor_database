The one dimensional nickel ferrites/graphene composites are synthesized by one-step hydrothermal strategy. Uniform claviform nickel ferrites with a diameter of 40 nm and a length of about 200 nm are homogeneously anchored on graphene sheets. The in situ growth of nickel ferrites on graphene guarantees good structural stability and electrochemical properties. The capacitive performance of the as-synthesized composites is evaluated by galvanostatic charge-discharge, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The composites electrode exhibits the specific capacity of 481.3 F g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1, and 298.2 F g-1 at 10 A g−1, suggesting good rate capability. Furthermore, the composites harvest a superior cycling stability over 10000 cycles without obvious capacitance attenuation. The composites demonstrate promising electrochemical performance for supercapacitor electrode due to the synergetic effect between graphene and nickel ferrites.
