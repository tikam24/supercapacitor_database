Due to the characteristics of thin thickness, rich active sites and short diffusion distance, the carbon nanosheets have been widely used as electrodes for energy storage in supercapacitors. Herein, N-doped mesoporous carbon nanosheets (N-MCS) were prepared by using cheap mica powder as template and resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) resin as carbon precursor. The ethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was introduces as porogen to create rich mesopores and to increase surface area. The ethylenediamine can be used not only as catalyst for TEOS hydrolysis and RF resin polymerization, but also as nitrogen dopant. The N-MCS faithfully replicated the template morphology, exhibiting sheet-like morphology, porous and N-doping characteristics, which can effectively improve the electrochemical performance.
