Novel polypyrrole-polyoxometalate/reduced graphene oxide ternary nanohybrids (TNHs) are synthesized via a one-pot redox relay strategy. The TNHs exhibit high areal specific capacitance (2.61 mF cm-2), and the fabricated solid device also exhibits good rate capability, excellent flexibility and mechanical stability.
