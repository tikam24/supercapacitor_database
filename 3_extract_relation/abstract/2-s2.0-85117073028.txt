Batteries used for providing backup power in renewable energy sources (RES) fed standalone power systems often suffer from a limited lifetime because of high charging and discharging currents arising from sudden changes in load and/or generation. To prevent this, supercapacitors (SCs) are used to supply the high-frequency (HF) power surges. In this article, a new way of interfacing hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs) (Battery + SC) with RES and loads by employing a current fed dual active bridge (DAB) converter based multi-port converter (MPC) is proposed. The proposed approach enables the MPC to regulate the load voltage while tracking the maximum power point (MPP) of the RES and protecting the battery from transients arising from variations in load and/or renewable generation. The SC is used for tracking MPP so that the transient changes in RES generation do not cause a sudden rise/fall in the battery current. The employed MPC structure is designed in such a way that most of the power processing takes place in one stage only resulting in lower losses. The number of switches is reduced by merging the power conversion stages, which helps in keeping the cost low. Experimental results on a laboratory prototype under various static and dynamic conditions are presented.
