This paper suggests and investigates a 48V recuperation storage for hybrid vehicles based on supercaps. A recuperation system composed of 48V components provides a low-cost solution with a promising proportion of fuel saving and system costs. First, a complete system model of a HEV is presented in order to simulate the fuel consumption. The model includes a supercapacitor model as well as a battery model. The storage models are validated in a laboratory setup. Next, both storage technologies are characterized and investigated. Finally, an extensive comparison of both technologies is made regarding a specific energy storage device each. Both storage devices are subjected to a load which derived from the power flow that occurs within the driving cycles NEDC and WLTC. The supercap solution acquires promising results, considering fuel savings and costs in particular.
