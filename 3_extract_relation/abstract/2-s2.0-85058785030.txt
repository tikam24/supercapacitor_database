A novel sandwich-like g-C3N4/PPy nanocomposite based on the integration of polypyrrole (PPy) onto the surfaces of layered g-C3N4 nanosheets has been successfully fabricated through a chemical oxidation method. The obtained g-C3N4/PPy nanocomposite exhibits large specific surface area and high specific capacitance, cyclic reliability and rate capability characteristics. The specific capacitance reaches 471 F g−1 at current density of 1A·g−1, remaining >80% of its original value with cycling up to 1000 times or at the current density of 20 A g−1, while still remaining >71% with cycling up to 5000 times. As a potential electrode material for supercapacitor, the unique sandwich-like g-C3N4/PPy nanostructure not only benefits the diffusions of ions and electrons during the electrochemical reaction, but also releases the stress generated by the PPy's volume changes during charge and discharge, leading to the improved cyclic reliability.
