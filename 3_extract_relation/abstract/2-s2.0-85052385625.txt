The modern city growing passenger traffic creates the need for rolling stock fleet expanding, where a substantial proportion is autonomous vehicles. A standard bus is equipped with an internal combustion engine, which is accompanied by the carbon dioxide allocation into environment. At present concentration CO2in the atmosphere exceeded the permissible one, which has a negative impact on the environment. In this regard, it is necessary to undertake a study aimed at the development of traction drive, providing the required high-speed transport characteristics with minimal impact on the environment.
