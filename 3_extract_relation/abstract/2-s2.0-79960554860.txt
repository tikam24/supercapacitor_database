Hydrothermally reduced graphene/MnO2 (HRG/MnO2) composites were synthesized by dipping HRG into the mixed aqueous solution of 0.1 M KMnO4 and 0.1 M K2SO4 for different periods of time at room temperature. The morphology and microstructure of the as-prepared composites were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman microscope, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The characterizations indicate that MnO2 successfully deposited on HRG surfaces and the morphology of the HRG/MnO2 shows a three-dimensional porous structure with MnO2 homogenously distributing on the HRG surfaces. Capacitive properties of the synthesized composite electrodes were studied using cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in a three-electrode experimental setup using 1 M Na 2SO4 aqueous solution as electrolyte. The main results of electrochemical tests are drawn as follows: the specific capacitance value of HRG/MnO2-200 (HRG dipped into the mixed solution of 0.1 M KMnO 4 and 0.1 M K2SO4 for 200 min) electrode reached 211.5 F g-1 at a potential scan rate of 2 mV s-1; moreover, this electrode shows a good cyclic stability and capacity retention. It is anticipated that the synthesized HRG/MnO2 composites will find promising applications in supercapacitors and other devices in virtue of their outstanding characters of good cycle stability, low cost and environmentally benign nature.
