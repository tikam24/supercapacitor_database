Despite intense development of inkjet printing for scalable and customizable fabrication of power sources, one major shortcoming is the lack of eco-friendly aqueous inks free of additives (e.g., toxic solvents, surfactants). Here, an aqueous printable MXene/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (MP) hybrid ink is demonstrated that has an adjustable viscosity to directly inkjet-print micro-supercapacitors (MP-MSCs) with excellent performance, seamless integration, and desirable customization, which is crucial for scalable industrialization of self-powered integrated systems. The MP-MSCs deliver an unprecedented volumetric capacitance of 754 F cm−3 and a remarkable energy density of 9.4 mWh cm−3, superior to previously reported inkjet-printed MSCs. Such outstanding performance is partly attributed to highly conductive PH1000 that prevents restacking of MXene nanosheets, enabling fast electron and ion diffusion throughout the microelectrodes. Moreover, MP-MSCs present exceptional miniaturization and superior modularization featuring high voltage output up to 36 V from 60 serially connected cells and impressive areal voltage of 5.4 V cm−2 connected in tandem. Further, a printable temperature sensor integrated with the MP-MSC and a flexible solar cell exhibits an exceptional response of 2% and mechanical flexibility without any bias voltage input. Therefore, the MXene inks are expected to create various opportunities for miniaturization and innovative construction of flexible, self-sustaining, energy harvesting–storing–consuming microsystems for printable electronics.
