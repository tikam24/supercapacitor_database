Due to environmental pollution and the increasing shortage of fossil fuels, sustainable hybrid electrode materials must be developed to improve the performance of semiconductor-based supercapacitors, thus allowing for the realization of alternative energy storage systems. An ordered mesoporous (OM) NiO/ZnO p-n heterojunction electrochemical electrode was prepared by using a soft-template method and facile hydrothermal technique. The p-type NiO was successfully assembled on the ordered mesoporous n-type ZnO matrix, thus forming p-n heterojunction artifacts with hierarchical porous structures. The capacitive performance and mechanism were systemically investigated. The prepared p-n heterojunction OM-NiO/ZnO supercapacitor exhibited excellent capacitive performances with a significantly higher specific capacity of 1394 C g − 1 (1 A g − 1), high rate capability of 560 C g − 1 at 20 A g − 1, stable cycling property (constant at 538 C g − 1 after 2000 cycles at 5 A g − 1), and wide potential window of 0.6 V. These high supercapacitor performances can be mainly attributed to the synergistic effects of the nanoscale ordered mesoporous structure, loose 3D- networks, and p-n heterojunction formed by two phases of ZnO and NiO, which provide abundant active sites and charge transfer pathways for the diffusion of ions and electron transfer, respectively. The results show that this novel approach involving the p-n heterojunction with a hierarchical mesoporous structure allows for the development of energy materials.
