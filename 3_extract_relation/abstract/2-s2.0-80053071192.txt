Due to the high specific surface area, large pore volume, hydrophobic, great aqueous and thermal stability, excellent conductivity, mesoporous carbon materials have been widely used in many fields, such as catalyst support and electrochemical, and then become one of the most popular topics at home and abroad. Based on the recent research progress of the mesoporous carbon materials from polyacrylonitrile, we summarized the preparation of mesoporous carbon materials with different structures, and covered representative research results, discussed their applications in catalysis, supercapacitor and fuel cell, we also analysiszed the development prospects of the new carbon material in future.
