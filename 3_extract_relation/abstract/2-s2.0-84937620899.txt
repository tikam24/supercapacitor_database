A sophisticated hierarchical nanoarray consisting of a conducting polymer (polypyrrole, PPy) core and layered double hydroxide (LDH) shell are synthesized via a facile two-step electrosynthesis method. The obtained PPy@LDH-based flexible all-solid-state supercapacitor meets the requirements of both high energy/power output and long-term endurance, which can be potentially used in highly-efficient and stable energy storage.
