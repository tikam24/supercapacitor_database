MnO2@bamboo leaf (BL) carbon composites have been prepared by a hydrothermal method, wherein, the BL porous carbon structure was based on BLs. The MnO2@BL composites were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, Raman, XPS, and TGA. The electrochemical properties of the composites were investigated in a three-electrode system using 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution as an asymmetric supercapacitor electrolyte. Electrochemical measurements showed that the MnO2@BL composites can be applied in asymmetric supercapacitors and exhibited a good cycling stability with a capacitance retention ratio of 85.3% after 5000 cycles (at 0.5 A g-1). The MnO2@BL composites were promising materials for application in supercapacitors.
