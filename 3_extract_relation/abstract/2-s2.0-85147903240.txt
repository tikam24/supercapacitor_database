As an energy storage technology, supercapacitors (SCs) have become an important part of many electronic systems because of their high-power density, long cycle life, and maintenance-free characteristics. However, the widespread development and use of electronics, including SCs, have led to the generation of a large amount of e-waste. In addition, achieving compatibility between stability and biodegradability has been a prominent challenge for implantable electronics. Therefore, environmentally friendly SCs based on polypyrrole (PPy)-stabilized polypeptide (FF) are demonstrated in this study. The fully degradable SC has a layer-by-layer structure, including polylactic acid/chitosan (PLAâ€“C) support layers, current collectors (Mg), FF/PPy composite layers, and a polyvinyl alcohol/phosphate buffer solution (PVA/PBS) hydrogel. It has the advantages of being light, thin, flexible, and biocompatible. After 5000 cycles in air, the capacitance retention remains at up to 94.7%. The device could stably operate for 7 days in a liquid environment and completely degrade in vitro within 90 days without any adverse effect on the environment. This work has important implications for eco-friendly electronics and will have a significant impact on the implantable biomedical electronics.
