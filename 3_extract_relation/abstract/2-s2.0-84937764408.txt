CuO nanofilm arrays on copper foam are synthesized through a simple hydrothermal method. The unique nanostructure features endow them excellent electrochemical performance. It should be pointed out that the charge–discharge voltage of these integrated electrodes was improved by testing in LiPF6/EC:DEC electrolyte solution, which greatly increases the power densities and energy density. For example, the energy densities are 23.3, 20.6, 16.5, 11.8 and 9.7 W h kg−1 at different power densities of 0.4, 0.7, 1.6, 2.9 and 6.8 kW kg −1 in NaOH solution and 190.6, 125.5, 95.5, 26.7 and 15.1 W h kg−1 at different power densities of 1.43, 3.42, 26.2, 64 and 90 kW kg−1 in LiPF6/EC:DEC electrolyte solution. Hence, the integrated electrode can be potentially used in some novel electrochemical supercapacitors and other electronic devices.
