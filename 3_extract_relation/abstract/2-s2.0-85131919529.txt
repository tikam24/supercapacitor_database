Flower-like cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) nanflake arrays with high mass-loading was directly grown on Ni foam with a facile two-step hydrothermal method. First, hierarchical tulip-like Fe microstructure was electrodeposited on Ni foam from an alkaline Fe2O3 suspension. Then, CoFe2O4 flower-like CoFe2O4 nanoflake arrays on Ni foam (CoFe2O4/Ni foam) was produced by heating Fe-modified Ni foam in cobalt nitrate aqueous solution containing low concentration of copper sulfate. The CoFe2O4/Ni foam was characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), energy dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy (EDS) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller gas sorptometry measurements (BET). The electrochemical performances of CoFe2O4/Ni foam were tested with cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostastic charge/discharge technique (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). As capacitive electrode, CoFe2O4/Ni foam exhibits high areal capacity (9.7C cm−2 at 10 mA cm−2), good columbic efficiency (97.25% at 10 mA cm−2) and excellent cycling stability (capacity retention of 89.7% after 5000 GCD cycles at 20 mA cm−2). Asymmetric supercapacitor, assembled with CoFe2O4/Ni foam and activated carbon (AC) as positive and negative electrodes, respectively, exhibits high energy density of 6.01 W h m−2 at energy density of 50 W m−2, indicating the promising application prospect of CoFe2O4/Ni foam in energy storage.
