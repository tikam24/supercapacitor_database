Manganese dioxide/polypyrrole composites as supercapacitor electrode materials are successfully prepared by in situ chemical oxidative polymerization. X-ray diffraction spectroscopy measurement(XRD),Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Canning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) reveal that MnO2 nanoparticles are incorporated in PPy matrix. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) indicates that the combination of MnO2 and PPy enhances the capability of the composite and the largest specific capacitance, 205F g-1, is obtained when the content of MnO2 in composite is ca.30%. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements prove that 30.5%MnO2/PPy composite electrodes own the smallest charge transfer resistance and the chronopotentiometry test indicates that MnO2/PPy composite have an ideal capacitive behavior and an excellent cyclibility. The excellent electrochemical performances of MnO2/PPy composite suggest that in-situ chemical oxidation polymerization is an effective method to obtain MnO2/PPy composite for supercapacitors.
