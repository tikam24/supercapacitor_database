This research studied on the coating of molybdenum oxide on anodized aluminium plate via electrochemical plating technique applied for ultracapacitor electrodes. Preparation of the samples, aluminium plates with the size of 1X1 cm2 were anodized at voltage of 6, 12 and 24 volts with the constant electric current of 6 Amperes for 10, 20 and 30 minutes, respectively. The plate samples were then coated with molybdenum oxide by electrochemical plating technique. Thereafter, the samples were examined using the SEM techniques. Besides, the surface areas and the chemical composition of the plate samples were determined by AFM and XPS techniques, respectively. The results show that transitions metal oxide MoO3 can be obtained from MoO3/Al2O3 film prepared by electrochemical plating technique.
