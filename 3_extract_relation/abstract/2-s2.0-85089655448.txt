Dumbbell-shaped Mn2O3 was synthesized by annealing hydrothermal products with a precisely controlled concentration of ethanol. When the ratio of ethanol increased, various Mn2O3 nanostructures with different morphologies, ranging from a dumbbell-like shape to a spherical shape, were obtained. Dumbbell-like Mn2O3 had a mesocrystal structure, which was formed by an orderly stacking of nanocrystallites. In addition, with a water to ethanol volume ratio of 1:1, Mn2O3 exhibited the highest specific capacitance of 273.1 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte and a good capacitance retention of 97.7% after 1000 cycles. Furthermore, the noninsertion and insertion capacities of the sample materials were further analysed. The total maximum capacitance and the minimum capacitance were calculated to be 411.5 F g-1 and 230.5 F g-1, respectively; moreover, it could be calculated that the insertion capacity percentage was 44%. This work provides new innovative insights to improve the capacitance performance of a Mn2O3 material by optimizing the crystal structure.
