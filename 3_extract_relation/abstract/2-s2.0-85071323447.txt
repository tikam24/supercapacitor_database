Carbon- and carbon derivatives are widely employed as efficient electrode materials for supercapacitor applications. Herein, we demonstrate a cost-effective dip-coating process followed by dehydrohalogenation of PVDF-Ni for the preparation of carbyne enriched carbon anchored on nickel (CEC-Ni) as high-performance electrode material. The removal of halogens in the prepared CEC-Ni were widely characterized using XRD, XPS, Laser Raman, and FT-IR analysis. The occurrence of carbon-carbon vibration in the prepared CEC-Ni foam was confirmed using FT-IR spectroscopy. Laser Raman analysis confirms that the CEC-Ni foam contains both sp and sp2 hybridized carbon. The electrochemical properties of prepared carbyne enriched carbon anchored on nickel foam electrode (CEC-NiE) showed an ideal capacitive properties and delivered a maximum specific capacitance of about 106.12 F g−1 with excellent cyclic retention. Furthermore, the mechanism of charge-storage in the CEC-NiE was analyzed using Dunn's method. In additon, the asymmetric supercapacitor device was fabricated using CEC-NiE as positive and rGO as negative electrode achieved a remarkable energy density of 33.57 Wh Kg−1 with a maximal power density of 14825.71 W Kg−1. These results suggested that the facile preparation of CEC-NiE could be a promising and effective electrode material for future energy storage application.
