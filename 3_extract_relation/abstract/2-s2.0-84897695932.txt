A composite of graphene and carbon nanotubes has been synthesized and characterized for application as supercapacitor electrodes. By coating the nanostructured active material of Co(OH)2 onto one electrode, the asymmetric supercapacitor has exhibited a high specific capacitance of 310 F g-1, energy density of 172 Wh kg-1 and maximum power density of 198 kW kg-1 in ionic liquid electrolyte EMI-TFSI.
