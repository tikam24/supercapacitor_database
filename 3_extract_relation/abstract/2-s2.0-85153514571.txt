The zinc-ion hybrid capacitor is a promising energy storage device, but current overall capacity is limited by the capacitance of the carbon cathode. We produced a hierarchically porous, nitrogen-doped carbon cathode with good cycling and mechanical stability by 3D printing and pyrolysis of the zinc-based metal–organic framework ZIF-8. When incorporated into a zinc-ion hybrid capacitor, we achieved an areal capacitance of 16.9 F cm−2 and energy density of 7.23 mW h cm−2, outperforming zinc-ion hybrid capacitors based on conventional cathodes.
