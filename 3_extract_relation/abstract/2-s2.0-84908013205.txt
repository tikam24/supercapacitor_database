Simultaneously achieve high power and large energy capacity at a high rate is still difficult in the development of electrochemical double layer capacitors. We design a bowl-like carbon sheet (BCS), which is a promising electrode material for high-rate electrochemical double layer capacitor application. These BCSs have interconnected channels and hierarchical porosity for fast ion diffusion and can maintain 105 F g-1 at 100 A g -1. BCSs can maintain a rectangular degree at a high scan voltage of 1 V s-1. BCSs show the tendency of stack on top of each other, and such behavior can increase the bulk density and subsequently increase volumetric capacitance. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
