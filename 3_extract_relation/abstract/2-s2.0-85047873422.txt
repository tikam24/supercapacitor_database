Energy and environment as the current research hots pot, how to effectively combine the two is very important and full of challenge. In this research, we design a new type multifunctional aerogel material, which not only can applied for supuercapacitors, but also acted as adsorbents for adsorb organic pollutant. This multifunctional aerogel was prepared by one-pot hydrothermal and freeze-drying method based on elongated TiO2 nanotubes (eTNTs) and graphene. During the hydrothermal process, the graphene nanosheets and eTNTs self-assembled into three-dimensional (3D) interconnected networks, in which the eTNTs with uniform size are intercalate the pore interconnected framework. The results show that the as-prepared eTNTs/graphene aerogel (TGA) exhibits a high specific surface area of 343.2 m2 g-1. The highly porous and interconnected 3D nanostructure provided efficient migration of electrolyte ions and electrons, and thus the TGA exhibited excellent electrochemical performance for supercapacitors. The binder free TGA electrode possessed high performance electrochemical properties with an excellent specific capacitance (476.8 F g-1 at scan rate of 5 mV s-1), and outstanding cycle stability (92% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles). In addition, the TGA also showed admirable adsorption capacity for organic pollutant of bisphenol A, which reached 523.5 mg g-1. The excellent electrochemical and adsorption capacities suggest the TGA to be the promising materials application in energy storage and environmental remediation.
