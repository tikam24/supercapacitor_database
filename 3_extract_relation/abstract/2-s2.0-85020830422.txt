Manganese oxide and cerium dioxide (Mn3O4/CeO2) nanorods grown on the surface of graphene nanosheet were successfully obtained by hydrothermal treatment. The supercapacitor performance of Mn3O4/CeO2 nanorods nanostructured electrodes was greatly improved. The composite shows the excellent specific capacitance as high as 209.2 F gâˆ’1 in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte and the good long term cycle stability. The prominent electrochemical properties could be attributed to the enhanced conductivities and the improved accessible area for ions in electrolytes. The present study provides a facile way to design a high-performance Mn3O4/CeO2-graphene based supercapacitor electrode and the conception is extendable to other pseudocapacitive electrodes.
