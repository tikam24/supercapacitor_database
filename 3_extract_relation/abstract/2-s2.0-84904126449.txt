The fundamental aspects of a porous electrode from electrochemistry and material chemistry standpoints are discussed in the light of battery engineering designs. For example, the ionic diffusion, the electrode-electrolyte interface, interfacial charge transfer and electrode catalytic processes are discussed. The discussion of such fundamental electrochemical aspects is in conjunction with the design of batteries, e.g. the electrochemical assessable surface area for porous electrode, electrode catalytic reactions. The porous electrodes used as a gas diffusion electrode and the electrode in a supercapacitor are discussed to demonstrate the application of electrochemical principals in battery design.
