This paper deals with calendar aging of a proton exchange membrane open-cathode fuel cell. Calendar aging is already developed for energy sources as supercapacitor and batteries but the literature is very poor for fuel cell stacks. However, this kind of test is necessary to determine the actual lifetime of the system without running it and to define the aging impact of the storage of such a system. One possible outcome for fuel cells is to provide electricity in remote areas without connection to the grid. This issue becomes even more challenging under hard environmental conditions, especially in areas with possible negative ambient temperatures. Experimental research on the degradation of open cathode fuel cells under these tricky conditions is needed to investigate the impact of resting states on the fuel cell lifetime and to evaluate the impact of the sub-zero temperatures on the performance losses.
