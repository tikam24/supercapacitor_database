The bidirectional converters become an integral part ofHybrid Energy Management Systems (HEMS) which can transfer power both in forward and reverse directions. This chapter examines the control strategy for HEMS through different bidirectional converters such as Boost converters, Interleaved Boost converters (IBC), combined SEPIC Luo converters, and Dual Boost Converters (DBC). The HEMS requires the energy transfer among various sources and the drivetrain of the Electric Vehicle (EV) and vice versa. The features of each bidirectional converter fed from the battery and supercapacitor to drive a PMDC motor are discussed to validate the control strategy used for the Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS). This study provides a performance level comparison of various converters and helps to realize the appropriate converter topology and specification.
