In this paper, a different control scheme has been proposed in order to attain the precise control between battery and ultracapacitor (UC) of a hybrid energy storage system (HESS). An MFB controller is considered with four individual math function corresponding to the speed of the motor and treated as a universal controller. Thereafter MFB is integrated with a conventional/intelligent controller to attain the main objective of the paper. The considered MFB is join with conventional PI as well as ANN and comparative analysis is done between two controllers performance based on different time domain specifications. In order to know the performance of the specific controller entire circuit can be configured into four modes, and each mode of operation, the proposed controllers are implemented separately in MATLAB/Simulink. The solar panel is used here to charge the battery directly via control switch two, the battery charging and discharging conditions are controlled by the state of charge (SOC) as well as the output voltage level of a solar panel converter.
