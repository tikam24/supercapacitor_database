Carbon-based materials are important materials for the fabrication of electrodes for supercapacitor devices. They can be manifested in various forms or structures. In this short review, the emerging trend of employing carbon materials and their derivatives in supercapacitors are highlighted, namely graphene, carbon nanotube and carbon nanodot. The hybridization route is also discussed which is a method of properties enhancement of the electrodes. Examples of the effect from the modification of the nanostructured carbon-based materials are also shown. As the properties enhanced, more durable and high energy density supercapacitors are expected to be developed in the near future.
