Using frequency splitting, two energy management strategies (EMS) based on Haar wavelet decomposition and Fourier analysis for fuel cell hybrid vehicle (FCHV) are proposed to manage efficiently the power flow between components. The paper aims to discuss the performances of the proposed EMS in terms of dynamic behavior, robustness operation, real time application and fuel economy. For apply this methodology, two EMS approaches are elaborated and successfully tested for parallel Fuel Cell/UC: conventional approach using Fourier Transform analysis (FT) and Wavelet analysis approach allowing natural frequency splitting. Finally, and to evaluate the performance and relevance of the developed approach, a comparison analysis were conducted. The simulation results exhibit the effectiveness of both strategies. Indeed, Wavelet analysis leads to better results in terms of energy flow and dynamic behavior, excellent robustness and stability of system, as well as energy economy improvement. A very relevant strategy is proposed based on Wavelet analysis using digital filtering techniques, which enables a natural frequency splitting to ensure the best global performances. In addition, the approach remains simple and suitable for real time operation.
