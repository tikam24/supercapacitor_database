Herein, the circular ring-like cobalt manganese pyrophosphate (Co0.55Mn0.45)2P2O7 wrapped by nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) are synthetized through a facile one-step microwave method with numerous open porous structures as electrochemically active sites. The circular ring-like (Co0.55Mn0.45)2P2O7 possess honeycomb-like structures to storage more ions and have more electrochemically active sites from the honeycomb edges, which faster ion/electron transporting through the pores. Therefore, these honeycomb-like hybrids obtain an excellent specific capacity of 236.21 mA h g−1 at 1 A·g−1 under three-electrode conditions, contribution a wonderful cycle stability of 86.7% after 10,000 cycles. Anode material of asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is assembled with biomass hierarchical glucose carbon (HGC), the maximum energy density of the ASC device is 75.72 Wh·kg−1 at a power density of 800 W·kg−1 (remained 60.08 Wh·kg−1 at 8000 W·kg−1). The enhanced capacitive storage of the ASC device can be attributed to the interconnected circular ring-like structure and the perfect combination of nitrogen-doped graphene.
