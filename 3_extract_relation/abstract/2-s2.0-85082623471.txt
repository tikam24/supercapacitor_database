In view of the fluctuation of DC bus voltage caused by the load change of power system, a method based on hybrid energy storage system control is proposed to stabilize the bus voltage of microgrid. Based on the complementary characteristics of battery and supercapacitor, the voltage division strategy is adopted to improve the DC bus voltage. The simulation results show that the method can stabilize the voltage of DC bus.
