Recently, prussian blue analogues (PBAs), as the most classical class of metal-organic frameworks, have been widely studied by scientists. Nevertheless, the inferior conductivity of PBAs restricts the application in supercapacitors. In this work, nickel cobalt hexacyanoferrate (Ni2CoHCF) had been produced via a simple co-precipitation approach and coated with polypyrrole on its surface. The conductivity of PBAs was improved by the polypyrrole coating. The Ni2CoHCF@PPy-400 microspheres were demonstrated to the outstanding specific capacity of 82mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1. After 3000 cycles, the Ni2CoHCF@PPy-400 microspheres had a long cycle life and 86% specific capacity retention rate at 5 A g-1. Additionally, it was coupled with activated carbon to build high performance asymmetric supercapacitor (Ni2CoHCF@PPy-400//AC), which displayed a high energy density of 21.7Wh kg-1 at the power density of 888Wkg-1 and good cycle stability after 5000 cycles (a capacity retention rate of 85.2%). What is more, the results reveal that the Ni2CoHCF@PPy-400 microspheresare a prospective candidate for exceptional energy storage devices.
