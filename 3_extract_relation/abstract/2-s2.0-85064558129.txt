In this article, an algorithm has been developed to study the influence of hybrid energy storages system management on the performance of this last one in terms of weight, volume, cost and stresses applied to the two storage systems witch compose our source. The main storage system is composed with a high energy or ultra high energy density batteries. Otherwise, the secondary one can be an ultra high power, high power batteries or supercapacitor. Simulation results show that gains in weight and volume are obtained using ultra high energy cells as the main battery or/and an ultra high power as secondary source. The power management is improved to ameliorate the performances of storage system for automotive application.
