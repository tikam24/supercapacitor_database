A variation in the size of metal nanoparticles leads to a difference in their properties. As the size of metal nanoparticles decreases, the surface area increases which leads to an increase in the reactivity of metal nanoparticles. Metals like Au, Ag, Pd, and Pt have interesting properties when used in nanometric dimensions. They function efficiently in significant industrial processes as electrocatalysts and photocatalysts in various organic reactions. Recently, the green biosynthesis of nanoparticles has attracted the attention of researchers. With environmental pollution rising over the past few decades, metal nanoparticle catalysts could be the key to subdue the toxic effects. Being versatile, they can be used to degrade pollutants, develop solar cells, convert toxic nitroaromatic compounds, significantly reduce CO2 emissions per unit of energy, and many more. Owing to their unique properties, nanoparticles have wide applications in biomedicine, for example, gold cages are promising agents for cancer diagnosis and therapy. Transition metal-oxide nanoparticles have been considered one of the best supercapacitor electrodes with high electrochemical performance. In this review, we have summarised fundamental concepts of metal nanoparticles over the last decade's main emphasis from 2010 to 2021. It focuses on the exceptional use of these nanocatalysts in various organic reactions. Additionally, we have also discussed the utility of these reactions and their crucial role in solving the problems of today. Through this article, we hope to provide the necessary framework needed to further advance the applications of metal nanoparticles as catalysts.
