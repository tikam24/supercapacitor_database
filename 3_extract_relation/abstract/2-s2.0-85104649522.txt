Conducting polymers incorporated with binary metal oxides are the upcoming pseudocapacitive materials, which are in high demand owing to their impressive electrochemical performance. In the current study, we describe the synthesis of FeCo2O4/PANI by in-situ polymerization method and its applicability as electrode in supercapacitors. The as-prepared FeCo2O4/PANI was characterized via various physico-chemical techniques. The electrochemical behavior of FeCo2O4/PANI was analysed by Cyclic voltammetry (CV), Galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopic (EIS) methods. The studies revealed pronounced specific capacity (Csp) value of 940 C g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1 by GCD. Moreover, the elevated capacitive behavior was mainly due to its very porous nanorod like structure with a huge number of active sites, which substantially resulted in good ion and electron transport. The high specific capacity of FeCo2O4/PANI and the simple one-step fabrication process depicted its potential and promising applicability as electrode material for advanced energy storage devices.
