A hybrid distributed generation system (HDGS) using a multi-input multi-output positive buck-boost converter (MIMO-PBBC) is proposed for the supply-side of the grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) generation power plant, where three PV clusters, one battery bank, and one supercapacitor module are hybridized and regulated by a centralized three-phase dc-ac inverter with their corresponding control systems. The major functionalities of the proposed systems including reactive power control, dc-link voltage regulation, low-voltage ride-through and maximum power point tracking are validated with excellent performance via computational simulation.
