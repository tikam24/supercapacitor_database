Hybrid energy storage systems (HESS) are used to optimize the performances of the embedded storage system in electric vehicles. The hybridization of the storage system separates energy and power sources, for example, battery and supercapacitor, in order to use their characteristics at their best. This paper deals with the improvement of the size, efficiency, or cost of the embedded source using new management strategies for HESS. In addition, one of the most important advantages of this novel strategies is the improvement of battery lifetime. As a result of this development, significant reductions in the cost and optimizing the performance of electric vehicles can be achieved. Simulation results show that the RMS (root mean square) power of battery is effectively reduced, and the quantity of charge can be considered as main factor in the concepts of embedded energy management. Experimental validation is achieved with a low power test bench, where the battery and supercapacitor are emulated by power electronic devise with electrical models of the storage system implemented in software environment. The experimental results verify the proposed energy management strategies through demonstrating the decreasing of the power constraint applied to the battery.
