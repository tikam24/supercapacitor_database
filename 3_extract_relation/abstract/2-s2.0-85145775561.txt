This study sought to determine the effect of graphene on the electrochemical performance of MgFe2O4. The electrode preparation was done directly on the nickel foam surface using a hydrothermal technique. The crystallographic, morphological, and chemical configurations of the electrode components were investigated using XRD, FTIR, XPS, SEM, and TEM. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectrometry (EIS) were used to evaluate its electrochemical characteristics. The findings of the characterization demonstrate that MgFe2O4 was successfully synthesized with GNPs in a porous structure on a Ni foam surface. The electrochemical experiments show that the greatest specific capacitance (Cs) value found is 828 mF/cm2 at 1 mA current. At the same time, its stability after 1500 cycles at 4 mA was observed to be 136%, and its energy-power densities were calculated to be 28.75 mWh/cm2 and 200 mW/cm2. The Cs value in this study is roughly 242% higher than pure MgFe2O4 and 95% higher than MgFe2O4/GNPs in the literature, which is a significant effect of GNPs.
