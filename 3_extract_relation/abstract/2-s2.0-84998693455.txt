We have prepared NiCo2O4 nanoparticles decorated graphene nanosheets (NiCo2O4/graphene) nanohybrids via a dry and scalable synthesis technique. FE-SEM and TEM images of as-prepared NiCo2O4/graphene nanohybrids showed uniformly well decoration of NiCo2O4 nanoparticles on the surfaces of graphene nanosheets. The electrochemical performance of NiCo2O4/graphene nanohybrids was analyzed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The NiCo2O4-decorated graphene electrode exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 886 Fg−1 at a scan rate of 5.0 mVs−1, and also showed high cyclic stability with retention of 82.1% after 2000 cycle. As an enzymeless glucose biosensor, the NiCo2O4/graphene modified GC electrode showed excellent electro-catalytic behavior towards glucose with higher oxidation peak current.
