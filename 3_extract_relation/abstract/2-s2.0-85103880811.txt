As the two classical power allocation methods in battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage systems, split-frequency methods and power-level methods have been developed separately for many years. In this article, we made an attempt to integrate the advantages of the two methods and proposed an adaptive frequency-split-based quantitative power allocation strategy. First, an adaptive power preallocation is quantitatively determined according to the state of charge (SoC) of batteries and supercapacitors. Then, a windowed fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based power spectrum calculation algorithm is designed to derive the power level corresponding to each sampling frequency. By mapping the preallocated power to the power spectrum, the split frequency is adaptively computed. Finally, the power allocation is implemented through a low-pass filter (LPF) with the derived split frequency. Extensive experiments verify that the proposed method provides an improved performance in suppressing the dc bus voltage fluctuations and protecting batteries when compared with existing methods.
