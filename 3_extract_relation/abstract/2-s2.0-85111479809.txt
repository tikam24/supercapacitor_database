In order to use lignin as a renewable and degradable raw material in the preparation of carbon fiber, lignin/polyacrylonitrile (PAN) based carbon fiber was prepared by electrospinning, pre-oxidation and carbonization. The effect of lignin addition on the properties of spinning solution and structure and properties of preoxidized fiber and carbon fiber were studied by means of rotary rheometer, conductivity meter, scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and specific surface area tester.The results show that the mass ratio of lignin to PAN can be increased to 90:10 on the basis of ensuring the solution spinnability and fiber-forming property, which maximizes the high-value utilization of lignin. The pre-oxidized fiber has a heat-resistant and stable trapezoidal structure after adding lignin. The specific surface area of carbon nanofiber increases from 50.49 to 849.89 m2/g, which has important potential application value in battery, supercapacitor and other energy fields.
