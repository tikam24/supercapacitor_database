Novel hierarchical porous NiMoS 4 microspheres with high electrochemical performance was successfully prepared using a facile one-step hydrothermal method. The dual application of porous NiMoS 4 microspheres in energy harvesting and storage (i.e., dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and supercapacitors (SCs), respectively) is explored. In contrast to NiS 2 nanosheets, MoS 2 nanosheets and Pt counter electrodes (CEs), the NiMoS 4 microspheres CE demonstrated the lowest charge transfer resistance and highest electrocatalytic activity for the I3-/I- redox couple reaction. The NiMoS 4 -based DSSC showed a higher power conversion efficiency (8.9%) even than that of Pt-based DSSC (8.7%) under simulated standard global AM 1.5G sunlight (100mWcm-2). As an electroactive material for SCs, the assembled NiMoS 4 //AC asymmetric supercapacitor showed excellent specific capacitance (118.7Fg-1 at 1Ag-1), high energy density of 42.2Whkg-1 (with a power density of 799.2Wkg-1), and superior cycling durability with a specific capacitance retention of 79.5% after 9000 cycles at 3Ag-1.
