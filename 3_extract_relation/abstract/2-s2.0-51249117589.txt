The given paper deals with uninterruptible power supplies with supercapacitors. Parameters of the supercapacitors and common lead-acid batteries are compared. Various opportunities of supercapacitor implementation into the uninterruptible power supplies are discussed, pros and cons are analyzed. Initial numerical comparison of energy capacity for these devices is done. Experimental testing of the supercapacitors and batteries as energy sources for a boost converter has also been made.
