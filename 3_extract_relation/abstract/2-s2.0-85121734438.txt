The authors of the title paper [Colloids and Surfaces A 606 (2020) 125456] reported to have hydrothermally synthesized nanosheet-constructed porous MnMoS4 arrays on 3D Ni foam as a binder-free electrode in high performance supercapacitors. A critical analysis of the reported results viz. X-ray powder pattern and the elemental composition reveals that the electrode material is not MnMoS4 as it contains substantial oxygen in addition to less Mo content than Mn. In this letter to the Editor, many points of criticism concerning the hydrothermal synthesis and interpretation of the experimental data are described to prove that MnMoS4 (I) is a dubious material.
