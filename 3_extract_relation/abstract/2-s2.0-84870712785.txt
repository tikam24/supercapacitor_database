Based on the extraordinarily properties of graphene oxide (GO), nickel oxide nanoparticles (NiONPs)/GO/glassy carbon (GC) modified electrode was prepared by electrodeposition of NiONPs on the GC surface previously modified with GO, which was characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The results showed that GO was partially reduced and three-dimensional NiONPs were electrochemically synthesized on the surface of GO. Compared with NiONPs/GC electrode, NiONPs/GO/GC modified electrode exhibited more excellent conductivity, more superior electrochemical capacitive behavior (16-folds) and better electro-catalytic oxidation of glucose, applying for the electrochemical detection of glucose. The linear range for glucose is from 3.13 μM to 3.05 mM with the detection limit of 1 μM. In addition, the effects of common interfering species, including ascorbic acid (AA), uric acid (UA), and NaCl were investigated in detail. The result indicated that these foreign substances did not interfere significantly on the determination of glucose. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
