Pseudocapacitance holds great promise for energy density improvement of supercapacitors, but electrode materials show practical capacity far below theoretical values due to limited ion diffusion accessibility and/or low electron transferability. Herein, inducing two kinds of straight ion-movement channels and fast charge storage/delivery for enhanced reaction kinetics is proposed. Very thick electrodes consisting of vertically aligned and ordered arrays of NiCo2S4-nanoflake-covered slender nickel columns (NCs) are achieved via a scalable route. The vertical standing ∼5 nm ultrathin NiCo2S4 flakes build a porous covering with straight ion channels without the “dead volume”, leading to thickness-independent capacity. Benefiting from the architecture acting as a “superhighway” for ultrafast ion/electron transport and providing a large surface area, high electrical conductivity, and abundant availability of electrochemical active sites, the NiCo2S4@NC-array electrode achieves a specific capacity up to 486.9 mAh g−1. The electrode even can work with a high specific capacity of 150 mAh g−1 at a very high current density of 100 A g−1. In particular, due to the advanced structure features, the electrode exhibits excellent flexibility with a unexpected improvement of capacity when being largely bent and excellent cycling stability with an obvious resistance decrease after the cycles. An asymmetric pseudocapacitor applying the NiCo2S4@NC-array as a positive electrode achieves an energy density of 66.5 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 400 W kg−1, superior to the most reported values for asymmetric devices with NiCo2S4 electrodes. This work provides a scalable approach with mold-replication-like simplicity toward achieving thickness-independent electrodes with ultrafast ion/electron transport for energy storage.
