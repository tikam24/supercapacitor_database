Supercapacitors possess prominent advantages compared to traditional capacitors or batteries and have been increasingly attracting attentions for their application in energy storage. Carbon materials are the most highly used material for supercapacitors due to the unique characters. However, traditional carbon materials fail to meet up-to-date energy storage application, which requires to develop new carbon structure with superior performances. Herein, we developed a new hollow carbon rods (HCR) using ZnO@ZIF-8 rods as a template. We first achieved ZnO@ZIF-8 rods using ZnO as a template. Then, ZnO@ZIF-8 rods were transformed into ZnO@C, which was further transformed into HCR by removal of ZnO. The result shows that the HCR-800 exhibited high specific capacitance of 228.3 F/g and good cycling stability of retaining 96.51% after 10,000 cycles in 2 M KOH under -1â€“0 V at 1 A/g. Together, our newly developed HCR has unique structure and superior characteristics and is promising to improve the performances of supercapacitors.
