In this paper, a dynamic power management scheme (PMS) is proposed for a standalone hybrid ac/dc microgrid, which constitutes a photovoltaic (PV)-based renewable energy source, a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (FC) as a secondary power source, and a battery and a supercapacitor as hybrid energy storage. The power management algorithm accounts for seamless operation of the microgrid under various modes and state-of-charge limit conditions of hybrid energy storage when all the sources, storages, and loads are connected directly at the dc link. The PMS generates current references for dc converter current controllers of the FC, the battery, and the supercapacitor. The average and fluctuating power components are separated using a moving average filter. The dc-link voltage regulation under dynamic changes in load and source power variation is proposed. Also, PV power curtailment through control is formulated. The proposed power management is modified and extended to multiple PV generation systems and batteries, with all the sources and storages geographically distributed and operating under multitime-scale adaptive-droop-based control with supervisory control for mode transition. The proposed PMS is validated using simulation results. Also, field programmable gate array/Labview-based laboratory-scale experimental results are presented to validate the PMS under various critical conditions.
