Carbon nanotubes have long attracted great scientific interest because of their simplicity, ease of synthesis and unique properties. The novel properties of nanostructured carbon nanotubes including its high surface area, stiffness, tensile strength, thermal and electrical properties which become suitable for the application in the fields of energy storage, hydrogen storage, electrochemical supercapacitor, field-emitting devices, transistors, nanoprobes and sensors, composite material, templates, etc. In this study, carbon nanotubes were synthesized through arc discharge plasma with two different configurations, transverse and axial field, applied across arc plasma synthesis process to enable a much rapid rate growing of tubular carbon multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). TEM, FESEM, RAMAN, FTIR and XRD were used to investigate the morphology and structural evolution of the MWCNT samples produced with different synthesis environment. Introduction of magnetic field during the MWCNTs synthesized through arc discharge plasma technique has also been found to enhance the carbon nanotube growth, increase the high aspect ratio and its chemical stability, and shows potential for regulating the number of walls formed.
