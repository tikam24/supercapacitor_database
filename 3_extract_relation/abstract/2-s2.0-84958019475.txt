In modern power distribution systems power quality is considered as a major factor. The ac power always generates and delivers electrical disturbances to the sensitive electronic equipments. Among various options to improve power quality, custom power devices is considered more effective. A Dynamic Voltage Restorer operating in different topologies is considered in this paper. Synchronous Reference Frame control is used in all topologies. The MATLAB simulation results are also discussed.
