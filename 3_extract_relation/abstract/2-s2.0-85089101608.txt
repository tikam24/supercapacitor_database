Supercapacitors (SCs) have attracted great attention as renewable energy storage devices due to their high power densities and cost effectiveness. In this work, a one-step method is reported to fabricate the laser scribed SC using laser reduced Polyimide (LRPI) electrodes as a substrate. An Iono-gel polymer electrolyte based on polyvinyl alcohol, potassium hydroxide and 1-Butyl-3-methyl imidazolium Bromide ([Bmim]Br) was utilized because of its wider voltage window, good ionic conductivity and better adhesion with electrode material. The assembled device exhibited an excellent specific capacitance of 2.19 mFcm−2 at a maximum current density of 0.263 mAcm−2. The energy density is measured to be 1.21 μWhcm−2, which is much higher than a usual capacitor. Given these electrochemical properties, a cost-effective one-step method and scalable approach provides a strategy to fabricate lightweight, stretchable and flexible supercapacitors for future microscale energy storage devices i.e., flexible displays, electrical sensors and wearable electronics.
