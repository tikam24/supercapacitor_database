A new avenue for fabricating ultra-high specific surface area (SSA) carbons with hierarchical porous and excellent energy storage ability is achieved from the biomass-waste of pitaya peel with the pre-treating process by ethanol and KOH to optimize the microstructure and porosity, displaying excellent supercapacitance in different electrolytes.
