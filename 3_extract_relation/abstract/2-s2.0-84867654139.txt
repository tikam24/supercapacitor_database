Nanoscience and nanotechnology can provide tremendous benefits to electrochemical energy storage devices, such as batteries and supercapacitors, by combining new nanoscale properties to realize enhanced energy and power capabilities. A number of published reports on hybrid systems are systematically reviewed in this perspective. Several potential strategies to enhance the energy density above that of generation-I electric double layer capacitors (EDLC: activated carbon/activated carbon) are discussed and some fundamental issues and future directions are identified. We suggest a new hybrid supercapacitor system that is able to meet the energy and power demands for a variety of applications, ranging from microelectronic devices to electrical vehicles, which presents itself as a breakthrough improvement. Two practical hybrid supercapacitor systems, namely, a lithium-ion capacitor (LIC: graphite/activated carbon) and a nanohybrid capacitor (NHC: (nc-Li 4Ti 5O 12/CNF composite)/activated carbon), are featured and compared. The proposed NHC can pave the way toward generation-II supercapacitor systems by taking advantage of a novel, high quality, high efficiency and inexpensive nanomaterial preparation procedure. With such a breakthrough in nanofabrication-nanohybridization technology, the NHC, which utilizes an ultrafast nano-crystalline Li 4Ti 5O 12, is considered to be an alternative for conventional generation-I EDLCs.
