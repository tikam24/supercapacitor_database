Metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived hybrids are promising electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage due to their high surface area, which provide plentiful redox sites and excellent electrical conductivity compared with fresh MOFs. Herein, different derivative strategies (oxidation, vulcanization, and phosphorization) were used to improve the energy storage performance of ZIF-67 metal-organic framework in the electrode of supercapacitor. The energy storage performance of the derived material is obviously improved compared with that of the untreated material through a series of analysis results, while the phosphating strategy has better modification ability than the oxidation and vulcanization strategy. Thanks to the good conductivity and suitable hole size of the phosphide, P-ZIF-67 shows the best charge storage ability, while the mass specific capacitance is 120.01 F g−1 under a current density of 1 A g−1. Besides, the fabricated P-ZIF-67//AC asymmetric device presented an energy density of 19.7 W h kg−1 at a power density of 500 W kg−1. This work provides experimental basis for the further application of ZIF-67 in supercapacitors.
