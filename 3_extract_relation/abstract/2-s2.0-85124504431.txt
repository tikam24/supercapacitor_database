Creating nanosized pores in layered materials can increase the abundant active surface area and boost potential applications of energy storage devices. Herein, a unique synthetic strategy based on polyaniline (PANI) doped 2D cobalt–iron layered double hydroxide (CoFe-LDH/P) nanomaterials are designed, and the formation of pores at low temperature (80 °C) is developed. It is found that the optimized concentration of PANI creates the nanopores on the CoFe-LDH nanosheets among all other polymers. The well-ordered pores of CoFe-LDH/P allow the high accessibility of the redox-active sites and promote effective ion diffusion. The optimized CoFe-LDH/P2 cathode reveals a specific capacitance 1686 (1096 Cg−1) and 1200 Fg−1 (720 Cg−1) at 1 and 30 Ag−1 respectively, a high rate capability (71.2%), and a long cycle life (98% over 10 000 cycles) for supercapacitor applications. Charge storage analysis suggests that the CoFe-LDH/P2 electrode displays a capacitive-type storage mechanism (69% capacitive at 1 mV s−1). Moreover, an asymmetric aqueous supercapacitor (CoFe-LDH/P2//AC) is fabricated, delivering excellent energy density (75.9 Wh kg−1 at 1124 W kg−1) with outstanding stability (97.5%) over 10 000 cycles. This work opens a new avenue for designing porous 2D materials at low temperature for aqueous energy storage devices.
