A Co3O4/RGO/Co3O4 (CRC) pseudocomposite on a cobalt foil was prepared using a one-pot in situ hydrothermal method. Carrying out a chemical redox reaction between the Co foil and graphene oxide (GO), which involved an electrostatic attraction between GO (negative charge) and Co2+ (positive charge), allowed for the design and construction of a novel sandwich structure including Co3O4 (from Co2+ ions), RGO, and Co3O4 (from the Co foil). The CRC@Co nanocomposite was directly utilized as a binder-free supercapacitor electrode. When this composite was prepared at 200 Â°C for 24 h, it exhibited superior electrochemical performances: a specific capacitance of 2272.7 mF cm-2 at 5 mA cm-2, and a capacity retention of 81.6% after 2000 charge-discharge cycles.
