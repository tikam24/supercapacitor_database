In order to deal with energy and environmental problems, more and more researches have been made on electrode materials of supercapacitors in recent years. Among many electrode materials, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) is favored by researchers because of its high theoretical capacity. In this work, we report a facile route for synthesizing Ni Co-LDH, we choose the ZIF-67 as the template and the source of Co to synthesis Ni Co-LDH by microwave in the mixture of ethanol and DIwater. Through this route, the Ni Co-LDH can be synthesized in 3 min. The as prepared Ni Co-LDH exhibits outstanding specific capacitance of 2376F•g-1 at 1A g-1 and it can maintain 84.61% of its initial value after 1000 cycle. Asymmetric supercapacitor(M-3//GO) with a maximum voltage of 1.5V has demonstrated a high energy density of 39.28Wh•kg-1, a high power density of 7513W•kg-1 at 20.21 Wh•kg-1.
