The present study proposes a new consensus control based multi energy storage system for DC microgrid. The proposed design achieves the consensus in finite time by sharing, both the local information of State of Charge (SoC) and battery power with the neighbours. The consensus based control equalises the SoC of multiple energy storage, irrespective of changes in the load demand and photovoltaic (PV) generation and regulate the DC bus link voltage. The overall system behaves essentially as a Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) where the Supercapacitor (SC) absorbs all the transients arising from any power imbalance of the system due to the load demand change and then pass this to the multi- battery storage system which increases the battery life. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated via simulations considering several numerical examples.
