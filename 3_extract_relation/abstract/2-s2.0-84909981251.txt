Polyaniline (PANI) films doped with Mn2+ (PANI/Mn2+) were synthesized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) on stainless steel wire mesh substrates with various concentration of manganous sulfate monohydrate (MnSO4Â·H2O). The structure and morphology of PANI and PANI/Mn2+ films were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The electrochemical properties of PANI and PANI/Mn2+ films were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge test and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 0.5 mol/L H2SO4 electrolyte in three-electrode system. The results suggest that the PANI/Mn2+ films show a larger specific capacitance of 859 F/g at the current density of 5 mA/cm2, remain to be 540 F/g after 500 charge-discharge cycles and lower resistance compared with the pure PANI film. The results indicate that the PANI/Mn2+ films are promising material for supercapacitors.
