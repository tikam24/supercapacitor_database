Porous carbon materials prepared from the porous organic polymers are currently the subject of extensive investigation. On the basis of their interesting applications, it is highly desirable to develop new synthetic methodologies to obtain carbon materials with controllable pore size and morphology. Herein, a facile synthesis of hollow microporous carbon spheres (HCSs) from hollow microporous organic capsules (HMOCs) with a good control over the pore morphology, hollow cavity, and the shell thickness is reported. The highly porous hollow carbon spheres are prepared by the pyrolysis of HMOCs-based microporous polymers. The synthetic parameters, such as hypercrosslinking and pyrolysis conditions, are optimized to modify the porous structures and the properties. The morphology and porosity as well as energy storage applications of the microporous structures HCSs, derived through a combination of divinylbenzene-crosslinking and micropore-generating hypercrosslinking, are discussed. These findings provide a new benchmark for fabricating well-defined HCSs with great promise for various applications.
