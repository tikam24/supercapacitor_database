Solid-state fiber supercapacitors (SCs) that meet the requirements of high performance, flexibility, durability and wearer comfort are promising power sources for wearable electronics. The bottleneck in this field is how to develop devices with combined advantages of high specific capacitance, excellent flexibility and high conductivity. Here we report a novel flexible all-solid-state fiber SC by using Ti/TiO2/MoS2 coaxial fiber electrodes that consist of MoS2 nanosheets grown on titanium wires by a TiO2 buffer layer assisted hydrothermal growth strategy. The symmetrical supercapacitor achieved a specific capacitance of 230.2 F g-1 (70.6 F cm-3), an energy density of 2.70 Wh kg-1 (4.98 mWh cm-3) and a power density of 530.9 W kg-1 (977.4 mW cm-3). Remarkably, the flexible and mechanically stable fiber SCs show outstanding processability in well-controlled ways, including being assembled into a stretchable, spring-shaped device and knitted into the fabric to lighten light-emitting diodes. In addition, the fiber SCs have been integrated in a self-powered photodetecting system and power the ultraviolet (UV) photodetector steadily, demonstrating that the fiber SCs can be easily integrated into future sustainable self-sufficient sensor networks.
