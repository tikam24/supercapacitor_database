Nowadays thereâ€™s a high demand for Electrochemical Energy Storage which has the high specific capacitance, power density, and energy density. To address this need, supercappteries are being developed that can combine the merits of batteries and supercapacitor into one device as innovative hybrid EES devices. Herein, Mn2O3/GO/AC composite has been synthesized by using a simple procedure for blending and subsequent annealing procedure. This composite was applied as anode material in supercapatteries. With the mass variation Mn2O3 and the scan rate variation, it shown that 20 wt% Mn2O3 at 10 mV/s has the highest spesific capacitance among them, 18.93 F/g, and 2.63 Wh/kg for energy density.
