Bio-oil, an oxygen-enriched precursor, is the liquid product from the fast pyrolysis of abundant and renewable biomass. Herein, nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanosheets (NPCS) with a unique interlinked architecture were synthesized successfully from bio-oil. The optimized sample shows a high specific surface area of 2566 m2 g-1, large pore volume (2.108 cm3 g-1), tunable hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure and considerable content of heteroatoms (∼5.83 at% N and ∼9.78 at% O). Benefitting from the favorable characteristics mentioned above, it exhibits a prominent specific capacitance of 289 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 and excellent rate capability (84.1% capacitance retention at 10 A g-1) in 6 M KOH. In addition, the electrode demonstrates superb cycling stability with only 3% capacitance loss after 10 000 cycles. The assembled symmetric supercapacitor can deliver a superior energy density of 21.0 W h kg-1 at a high power density of 463.0 W kg-1. These results highlight that the as-prepared samples have considerable potential for low-cost and renewable energy storage devices.
