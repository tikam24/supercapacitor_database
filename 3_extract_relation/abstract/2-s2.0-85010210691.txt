Mesoporous NiCo2O4 materials with different 3D structures, including flower-like hierarchical structures (NCO-flower-like HSs), nanoflake@nanoneedle-like multiple hierarchical structures (NCO-MHS) and urchin-like hierarchical structures (NCO-urchin-like HSs), were prepared by using a facile, one-step, NH4F-induced hydrothermal method followed by thermal annealing. The physicochemical characterization of the as-prepared materials was investigated by means of X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The performance of the synthesized NiCo2O4 material as supercapacitor electrode materials was measured and the results demonstrate that the NCO-MHSs and NCO-urchin-like HSs exhibit high specific capacitance values of 640 and 655 F ⋅ g−1 at a current density of 1 A ⋅ g−1, whereas the capacitance retention is 99.6 and 95 %, respectively, after 1000 cycles at a current density of 5 A ⋅ g−1. The electrocatalytic performance of synthetized NiCo2O4 for methanol electro-oxidation was evaluated in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The NCO-MHSs and NCO-urchin-like HSs deliver an electro-oxidation current density of 51 and 48.5 A ⋅ g−1, respectively, at 0.65 V with excellent stability. The results indicate that the hierarchical structure of NiCo2O4 offers a promising electrode material for supercapacitors and methanol electro-oxidation.
