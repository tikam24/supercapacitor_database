It is well agreed that supercapacitors form an important class of energy storage devices catering to a variety of needs. However, designing the same using eco-friendly and earth abundant materials with high performance is still the dire need of the day. Here, we report a facile solvothermal synthesis of a porous graphene-NiFe2O4 (PGNF) nanocomposite. Thorough elemental, diffraction, microscopic and spectroscopic studies confirmed the formation of the PGNF composite, in which the NF nanoparticles are covered over the PG surface. The obtained 10 PGNF composite showed a surface area of 107 m2 g-1, with large pore volume which is favorable for charge storage properties. When utilizing the material as an electrode for a supercapacitor in a 2 M KOH aqueous electrolyte, the electrode displayed an impressive specific capacitance value of 1465.0 F g-1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1 along with a high capacitance retention of 94% after 10 000 discharge cycles. The fabricated symmetrical supercapacitor device exhibited an energy density of 4.0 W h kg-1 and a power density of 3600.0 W kg-1 at a high applied current density of 14 A g-1. The superior electrochemical performance is attributed to the synergetic effect of the composite components which not only provided enough electroactive channels for the smooth passage of electrolyte ions but also maintained the hybrid structure intact in the ongoing electrochemical process. The obtained results underpin the promising utility of this material for future electrochemical energy storage devices.
