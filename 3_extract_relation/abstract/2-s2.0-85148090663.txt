Nanostructured transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have emerged as an attractive material in energy storage domains, owing to their high electrical conductivity and easy redox properties. However, the low actual specific capacitance and weak cycling stability hinder its further application. In this paper, the hierarchical nanosheet of CoP nanoparticles embedded in a two-dimensional carbon skeleton (Co-NP@C) with flake-like ZIF-67 as its precursor was synthesized by facile carbonization and phosphorization and employed as positive electrodes for asymmetric supercapacitors. Due to the presence of carbon skeleton and nanoparticles, a stable structure and more reaction channels for the electrochemical reactions were created, leading to a remarkable improvement of the electrical properties of Co-NP@C. The Co-NP@C electrode presents the exceptional electrochemical performance of 540 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1. Furthermore, an asymmetric symmetric supercapacitor with Co-NP@C cathode and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) anode achieves superior cycling stability (92.4% after 10, 000 cycles at 10 A g−1) and a high energy density of 20.22 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 649.93 W kg−1. This study offers a simplified method for guiding the design of MOF-derived phosphide electrode materials and provides additional opportunities for optimizing high-efficiency supercapacitors.
