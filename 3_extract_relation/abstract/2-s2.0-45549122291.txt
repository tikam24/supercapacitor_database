For the first time activated carbon nanobeads have been synthesized for supercapacitor applications by a simple pyrolysis technique. TEM analysis suggests the size of the carbon nanobeads are around 40 nm and XRD measurement reveals an amorphous structure. The average surface area of the nanobeads by BET studies is measured to be 79.6 m2/g, which is higher than the previously reported values. This cell shows an excellent cycleability successfully cycled more than 100,000 cycles and with minimum IR drop. It is suggested that this carbon nanobeads may be used as an active electrode material for supercapacitor applications. Â© 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
