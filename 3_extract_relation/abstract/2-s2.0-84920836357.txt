Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) nanoparticles were synthesized via an anionic, cationic and non-ionic surfactant assisted hydrothermalmethod in which Ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3) was used as precursor. The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by using powder X-Ray Diffractometer, Scanning Electron Microscopy and UV-Vis spectroscopy. Crystalline nanoparticles were formed using different surfactants like Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate (SDS), Cetyltrimethylammonium Bromide (CTAB), Polyvenylpyrollidone (PVP) and Sodium Dodecyl Benzene Sulfonate (SDBS). The specific capacitance of V2O5 was calculated in 0.5 M KCl and 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte by using cyclic voltammetry (CV). Electrochemical impedance, and Chronocoulommetry studies revealed a good capacitive and charge-discharge behavior of the prepared V2O5, which is very promising for the application for next-generation high-performance electro-chemical supercapacitors.
