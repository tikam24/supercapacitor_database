With the growing demand in the field of advanced materials, carbon nanomaterials have been widely used for various electronic applications such as solar cell, light-emitting diode, flexible/wearable device, battery, transistor, and supercapacitor. Notably, interfacial engineering and structural integration of carbon nanomaterials have become one of the prominent strategies to realize high-performance electronic applications. In this review, the fundamental material and electronic properties of carbon nanomaterials such as fullerene, carbon nanotube, graphene, and carbon nanofiber are reported. Significantly, recent progresses on interfacial engineering and structural integration of carbon nanomaterials, which result in the outstanding performance of advanced electronics are demonstrated. We believe that this review can provide a prospective insight of advanced electronic applications based on carbon nanomaterials to stimulate further research for nanomaterials and nanoelectronics.
