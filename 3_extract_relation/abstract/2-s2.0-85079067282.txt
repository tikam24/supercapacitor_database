A pomegranate-like ZnMn2O4 sphere electrode material was prepared via co-precipitation and calcination method, and was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and electrochemical workstation. Experimental results display that the calcination temperature has a large influence on the morphology of ZnMn2O4 porous microsphere. When the annealed temperature is 600 Â°C, ZnMn2O4 porous microsphere possesses the best electrochemical performance, in which the specific capacitance reaches 447 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g. The excellent electrochemical performances are mainly attributed to the porous structure and large specific surface area, indicated that the pomegranate-like ZnMn2O4 porous microsphere has a potential application in electrode material of supercapacitor.
