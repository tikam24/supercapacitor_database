Adjustable speed drives are highly sensitive to voltage sags.. In this paper an appropriate ride-through scheme based on Supercapacitor as an energy storage device for ASD (Adjustable Speed Drive) during various power quality events has been presented. The proposed compensator topology has been evaluated analytically using MATLAB and experimentally verified. The LABView (8.5) software and DAQ board has been used to record the generated waveforms during normal and abnormal conditions. Â©2009 IEEE.
