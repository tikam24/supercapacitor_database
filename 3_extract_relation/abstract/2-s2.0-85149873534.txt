The NiCoP material directly grown on the nickel foam substrate was prepared by hydrothermal method and low temperature phosphating method, NiCoP was directly grown on the conductive current collector to make an adhesive-free electrode, and rGO was used as a conductive network to cover the surface of the active material to form a self-supporting structure composite electrode, denoted as NiCoP/rGO-NF. The results show that the NiCoP/rGO-NF electrode has a specific capacitance of 2137.8 F g−1 (at 1 A g−1 current density), while NiCoP/rGO-NF still maintains a specific capacitance of 86.5 % after 10,000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g−1. The assembled ASC device has an energy density of 54.25 W h kg−1 at a power density of 750 W kg−1. At a current density of 5 A g−1, NiCoP/rGO-NF//AC showed a capacity retention rate of 87.3 % after 10,000 cycles, indicating that the prepared NiCoP/rGO-NF greatly improved the electrical conductivity of the material and the conductivity in contact with the electrolyte area, has the potential as an excellent electrode material for supercapacitors.
