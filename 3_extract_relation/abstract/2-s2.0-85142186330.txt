Hospital-acquired infections and antibiotic-resistant pathogens are major threats to human health. We develop an antibacterial film that maintains the long-term stability of titania (TiO2) while minimizing the disadvantages, the low photocatalytic efficiency of TiO2, especially in visible light, that limits the application of TiO2. Here, TiO2 nanotubes are modified with capacitive materials as a visible-light-triggered antimicrobial surface; its mechanism is based on substantially increased content of reactive oxygen species produced from the photocatalytic reaction during the electrochemical capacitive process. The system is functionalized with MIL-125(Ti) nanosheets and monodispersed Fe2O3 nanoparticles, enabling a large capacitance (149.0 mF cm−2) in a neutral aqueous electrolyte and high visible-light absorption. Importantly, the photocatalytic activities of the resulting capacitive semiconductor are proportional to the bias provided by the capacitive sample in its self-discharging (SD) process. As a proof-of-concept of the SD-triggered photoelectrocatalysis, the capacitive semiconductor exhibits ≥ 99.9 % reduction in Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus by only 30 min treatment and remarkably has a bacteria-free surface for recycling bacterial applications. Furthermore, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor cell also exhibits excellent performance in bacteria inactivation, suggesting an efficient sterilization device for environmental applications.
