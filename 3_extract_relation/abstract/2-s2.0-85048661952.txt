Co containing zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) with polyhedral morphology was synthesized in aqueous media and utilized as precurser for synthesis of nanoporous carbon polyhedra without using any other carbon source. The phase, composition and morphology of the annealed products could be tailored by changing the annealing temperature as well as acid treatment. Our study herein provides a new insight into the formation of porous carbon polyhedra from ZIF-67.
