Binder-free bimetallic oxides, especially NiCo2O4, are important electrode materials for asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs), and their structural characteristics have a profound effect on the electrochemical performance. Herein, mesoporous NiCo2O4 with unique double layer structure formed by 3D miniature sea urchins growing on the first layer with nanowire arrays on nickel foam (NiCo2O4/NF) are prepared. The prepared NiCo2O4 can be used as an electrode without adding conductive agent and binder. Under different hydrothermal time (NCO/NF-x, x = 6, 8, 10 and 12 h), NCO/NF-10 shows the largest specific surface area of 83 m2 g−1 and the highest specific capacitance of 2010F g−1 at 1 A g−1. The capacitance retention rate of the asymmetric supercapacitor assembled by NCO/NF-10 with activated carbon (AC) can reach 87% after 4500 cycles, and the maximum energy density is 37.4 Wh Kg−1 at a power density of 400 W Kg−1.
