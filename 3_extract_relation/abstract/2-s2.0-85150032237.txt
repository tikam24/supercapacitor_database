Nanocrystals of bare and different levels of nickel (0.025–0.1 M) doped CdO are made by chemical precipitation technique. The as-prepared products undergo annealing at a temperature of 550 °C. The annealed products are studied for their structural, optical, and morphological characterizations. The electrochemical capacitance behaviour of the pure and 0.75 M of nickel-doped CdO was studied by Cyclic Voltammetry (CV). At a low scan rate of 10mV/s, the electrode of CdO provides a capacitance of 52 F/g, whereas, the value is increased to 156 F/g on doping. Nowadays Nickel (0.025–0.1 M)-doped CdO is developing electrode material for the storage of charge due to their low decomposition temperature, which helps in synthesizing pure and homogeneous oxide nanoparticles, also the oxalate from the 3d series is isomorphous in nature, which enables the enhancement of physical properties of the oxide semiconductor by doping the precursor in the course of synthesis. Higher thermal stability, excellent chemical stability, higher theoretical values of specific capacitance, and natural resource pose nickel as an environment-friendliness material. The various levels of Ni (0.025–0.1 M)-doped CdO, their composite oxides have shown good structural stability, reversible capacity, and long cycling stability and have been also studied as nanostructured electrode materials for electrochemical supercapacitor applications.
