3D lion's mane like AlV3O9 microspheres deposited on the well-exfoliated graphene were successfully synthesised through a facile solvothermal method where the graphene sheet was prepared solely via the liquid phase exfoliation process. The highly electrical conductive graphene was introduced as a conductive substrate or a backbone to support the diffusion of the electrolyte ions (OH−). In order to achieve the optimum electrochemical performance, graphene/AlV3O9 nanocomposites with different weight ratios were fabricated wherein G-5AlV possessed an exceptional charge storage ability which surpasses that of other nanocomposites. The G-5AlV sample was found to possess a magnificent specific capacitance of 551.72 F∙g−1 at 0.5 A∙g−1 and achieve a remaining capacitance of 468.97 F∙g−1 as the current density was increased. After 5000 continuous intercalation/de-intercalation processes, G-5AlV delivered a specific capacitance of 441.38 F∙g−1 and a coulombic efficiency of 95%, confirming its remarkable cycling stability and coulombic efficiency. More importantly, it exhibits good energy and power densities as a symmetric supercapacitor, further suggesting itself as a potential candidate for use in high-performance charge storage devices.
