An ice templating coupled with hard templating and physical activation approach is reported for the synthesis of hierarchically porous carbon monoliths with tunable porosities across all three length scales (macro- meso- and micro), with ultrahigh specific pore volumes ∼11.4 cm3 g -1. The materials function well as amine impregnated supports for CO2 capture and as supercapacitor electrodes. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
