As supercapacitor electrode materials, their structures, including specific surface area, instability, and interconnection, determine the electrochemical performances (specific capacitance, cycle stability, and rate performance). In this study, 1T-MoS2 nanosheets were self-assembled into nanoflowers via a one-pot facile hydrothermal reaction. The nanoflowers retain the excellent electrical conductive performance and the feature of inherent high specific surface area of the nanosheets. For the sheets are interconnected to each other in flower structure, the structure is more stable and the charges are more easily transferred. Thus, compared to the nanosheet electrode, the nanoflower electrode shows the remarkable advantage when used as the electrode of the energy-storage device, whether it is 1T phase or 2H phase in KCl or in KOH. When measured at 0.5 A g-1 in KOH electrolyte, the MoS2 nanoflower electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 1120 F g-1. At the same time, when cycling 2000 times at a current density of 10 A g-1, the capacitance retention ratio can reach up to 96%.
