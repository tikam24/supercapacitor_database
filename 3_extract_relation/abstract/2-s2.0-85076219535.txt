Abstract: Graphene, an ideal two dimensional material, has attracted much attention due to its unique structural and physicochemical properties. Herein, we report synthesis of CuO/SiO2 modified amine functionalized reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and its excellent potentialities in environmental remediation and energy storage application. The structure, purity, functional groups and morphology of as-prepared CuO/SiO2:rGO nanocomposites were characterized by XRD, FTIR, FESEM and TEM. The catalytic activity of the CuO/SiO2:rGO in different ratios was evaluated by degradation of methylene blue (MB) under visible light condition. The CuO/SiO2:rGO (mass ratio 1:3) exhibits high catalytic activity with 99% degradation of 20 ppm MB in 7 min. CuO/SiO2:rGO nanocomposites (1:3) also demonstrate good electrochemical performance with specific capacitance of 235 F g−1, which is about fivefold higher than CuO nanoparticles. The nanocomposite (1:3) also reveals excellent cycling stability at 4 A g−1 for 1000 cycles and the capacitance retention was found to be 95% after 1000 cycles. These results validate that the development of a new class of composite necessitates the proper loading of metal oxide and GO to be used for energy and environmental applications.
