To construct a suitable structure for both electronic conduction and ionic transport towards supercapacitors, peanut-like hierarchical manganese carbonate (MnCO3) microcrystals assembled with floss-like nanowires are synthesized via a hydrothermal process and primarily used as an active material for supercapacitors. The formation mechanism is illustrated by means of a dissolution-recrystallization process and magnetically driven self-assembly. The electrode with peanut-like hierarchical MnCO3 microcrystals exhibits a high specific capacitance of 293.7 F g-1 and a superior cycle stability of 71.5% retention after 6000 cycles, which are higher than those of the reported Mn-based active materials in alkaline electrolytes. The asymmetric supercapacitor, assembled with the peanut-like MnCO3 electrode as the positive electrode and a home-made porous carbon electrode as the negative electrode, exhibits an energy density of 14.7 W h kg-1 at a power density of 90.2 W kg-1 and an energy density of up to 11.0 W h kg-1 at 3.3 kW kg-1. An as-assembled all-solid-state supercapacitor series can light up a LED indicator for 10 min, indicating a promising practical application of peanut-like MnCO3 microcrystals.
