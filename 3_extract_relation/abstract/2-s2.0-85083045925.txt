Necessity of novel energy storage devices extensively increased due to consumption of high power in various devices. To address the issues, in this report, we are addressing with a composite Iron Sulfide/reduced Graphene Oxide (Fe3S4/rGO) synthesized using the standard solvothermal method. X-ray diffraction and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope analysis results confirmed that Face-Centered cubic crystal structure of Fe3S4 and rGOâ€™s surface is decorated with a mean diameter of < 50 nm Fe3S4 respectively. Transmission Electron Microscopy images show further evidence that dispersed Fe3S4 on the rGO surface. Fe3S4/rGO exhibits specific capacitance of 560 F/g than its individual counterparts (Fe3S4 = 200 F/g and rGO = 145 F/g) at 1 A/g of current density and maximum cyclic stability of 91% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles that may be the influence of synergy between the composite materials.
