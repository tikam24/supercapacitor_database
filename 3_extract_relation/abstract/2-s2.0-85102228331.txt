Nano structure carbons exist in different forms like exfoliated graphite, activated carbon, graphene, and carbon nanotube. Nano structure carbonaceous materials exhibited varying surface electronic properties and can be realized as electrically conducting or even semi-conducting material depending on the structural orientations. In addition, the electronic and electrochemical properties of the carbonaceous nano materials can be tailored by doping and surface modification. sp2 hybridized carbon shows unique electrochemical double layer capacitance. However, by tuning its band gap energy and grafting specific functionalized species additional redox capacitance can be achieved. The covalent or non-covalent functionalized species not only generated additional redox active site but also acted as the spacer element preventing the restacking. Due to the high specific surface area carbon nano structured acted as the template for the growth of metal oxide/hydroxide to achieve high specific capacitance and energy density. Thus, carbonaceous materials can be employed both as positive and negative electrode materials for asymmetric supercapacitor. The presence of carbon nano structure in supercapacitor device minimizes the IR drop and ensure fast charge discharge process. In addition, due to facile mechanical and surface electronic property carbon nano materials are suitable for the fabrication of light weight, flexible, and bendable supercapacitor device.
