This article proposes a new control law for an embedded DC distributed network supplied by a supercapacitor module (as a supplementary source) and a battery module (as the main generator) for transportation applications. A novel control algorithm based on the nonlinear differential flatness approach is studied and implemented in the laboratory. Using the differential flatness theory, straightforward solutions to nonlinear system stability problems and energy management have been developed. To evaluate the performance of the studied control technique, a hardware power electronics system is designed and implemented with a fully digital calculation (real-time system) realized with a MicroLabBox dSPACE platform (dual-core processor and FPGA). Obtained test bench results with a small scale prototype platform (a supercapacitor module of 160 V, 6 F and a battery module of 120 V, 40 Ah) corroborate the excellent control structure during drive cycles: steady-state and dynamics.
