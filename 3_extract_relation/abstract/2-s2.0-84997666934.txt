An effective method was developed to fabricate highly stretchable supercapacitors with high electrochemical performances by incorporating a family of nitrogen (N)-doped coresheath carbon nanotube (NCNT) array as an elastic electrode. The supercapacitors demonstrated a high specific capacitance of 31.1 mF/cm2. The specific capacitance has been maintained by 98.9% after stretching to a 400% strain and by 96% after stretching for 1000 cycles at a 200% strain. The designed three-dimensional cross-linked structure of the NCNT contributes to both high electrochemical property and stretchability.
