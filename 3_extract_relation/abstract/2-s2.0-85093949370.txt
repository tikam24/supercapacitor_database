Depleting fossil fuels, natural gas resources, escalating oil prices, and global warming issues have made fuel cell (FC) based electric vehicles (EVs), a vital replacement to its conventional counterpart. Modeling of such a system contains power-conditioning circuitry, which exhibits nonlinear nature. In this paper, a model for hybrid electric vehicle is proposed with FC as primary source, whereas ultra-capacitor (UC) and battery are secondary sources. All the sources are linked with a direct current (DC) bus comprising of DC-DC converters. The study of the system is done mathematically and simulations are performed on MATLAB/Simulink. The dynamic model based on Lyapunov based adaptive control technique with model uncertainties designed to accomplish the following objectives. Firstly, the perfect regulation of DC bus voltage having minimum steady-state error under the load variations. Secondly, current of battery and UC precisely followed quickly under their relating reference values. Finally, asymptotically stability of the closed loop system. Proposed controller performances are analyzed using MATLAB/Simulink and comparative analysis is done with the sliding mode controller (SMC) and proportional integral derivative (PID) controller, which demonstrates the closed-loop stability of the proposed controller. Moreover, all control objectives are achieved efficiently.
