Electrospun nanofibers are regarded as ideal candidates for energy storage materials due to their large specific surface area, high porosity, low density and other merits. In this review, we have presented the recent application progress of the electrospun carbon nanofibers, metal oxides/sulfides/nitrides, conducting polymers and their composites in supercapacitor electrodes. In addition, the relationship between the composition, structure and electrochemical performance was discussed in detail. Finally, the prospects for the development of the electrospun nanofiber-based electrode materials are highlighted. It is expected that this review will stimulate ideas and inspiration for the architecture design and controllable preparation of high-performance supercapacitor electrode materials.
