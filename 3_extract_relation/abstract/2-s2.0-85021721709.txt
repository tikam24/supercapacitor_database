The present study involves the synthesis of a bismuth oxide (Bi2O3) electrode consisting of an arranged nano-platelets for evolving a flower-type surface appearance on nickel-foam (Bi2O3-Ni-F) by a simple, inexpensive, binder-free and one-step chemical bath deposition (CBD) method, popularly known as a wet chemical method. The as-prepared Bi2O3 on Ni-foam, as an electrode material, demonstrates 557 F g-1 specific capacitance (SC, at 1 mA cm-2), of which 85% is retained even after 2000 cycles. With specific power density of 500 kW kg-1, the Bi2O3-Ni-F electrode documents a specific energy density of 80 Wh kg-1. Furthermore, a portable asymmetric supercapacitor device, i.e. a pencil-type cell consisting of Bi2O3-Ni-F as an anode and graphite as a cathode in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte solution, confirms 11 Wh kg-1 and 720 kW kg-1 specific energy and specific power densities, respectively. An easy and a simple synthesis approach for manufacturing a portable laboratory scale pencil-type supercapacitor device is a major outcome of this study, which can also be applied for ternary and quaternary metal oxides for recording an enhanced performance. In addition, we presented a demonstration of lighting a light emitting diode (LED) using a home-made pencil-type supercapacitor device which, finally, has confirmed the scaling and technical potentiality of Bi2O3-Ni-F in energy storage devices.
