In the past internal combustion engines in commercial trucks, buses, and automobiles were often allowed to idle during stops, whether short or extended. This practice mitigated engine non-starts but increased fuel usage along with air emissions and accelerated engine wear. Engine starting can be performed more reliability by electrochemical capacitors rather than by batteries, especially at low temperatures. Capacitor modules are now available to start engines of all sizes. This paper will discuss the starting requirements of large diesel engines and present low-temperature engine cranking results using Nippon Chemi-Con DLCAP non-toxic-electrolyte electrochemical capacitor.
