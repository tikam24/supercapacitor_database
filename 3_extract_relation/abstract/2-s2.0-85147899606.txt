A chemical polymerization of aniline is followed by a hydrothermal self-assembly of PANI and a graphene oxide (GO) dispersion in this two-step synthesis of polyaniline reduced graphene oxide (PANI/rGO). The systematic investigation of the component's influence on the composite porous structure, morphology and chemical properties. PANI/rGO electrode materials with specified physical and chemical properties, when employed as electrode materials for supercapacitors operating in an aqueous electrolyte, showed high specific capacitance values and excellent cyclic stability. The results show that one of the most important factors impacting composite electrochemical performance is the chemical composition of the PANI/rGO. The hydrothermal technique provides a wide range of synthesis options for creating hybrids with desirable physical and chemical properties. Furthermore, the PANI/rGO electrodes did not require an additional binder, making the fabrication process easier, emphasising its potential for use in flexible or asymmetric supercapacitors.
