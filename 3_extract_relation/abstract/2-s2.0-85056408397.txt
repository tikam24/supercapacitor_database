Flexible supercapacitors are a significant class of energy storage devices for the wearable flexible electronic devices. In this study, a flexible electrode material for polypyrrole hollow nanospheres and reduced graphene oxide was prepared for flexible supercapacitor. The polypyrrole hollow nanospheres were prepared by emulsion polymerization and in-situ polymerization, and HI was used to reduce Graphene oxide (GO). The electrochemical performance of obtained electrode material was tested, which exhibits area specific capacitance of 381.54 mF/cm2 at 2 mA/cm2, and shows capacitance retention of 93.94% after 1000 GCD cycles, demonstrating the good cycle stability of electrode material of PPy/rGO. Furthermore, we assembled a simple symmetrical supercapacitor based on the prepared electrode material to assess its electrochemical performance and reliability in application. It has been shown that the assembled symmetrical supercapacitor can be used as a power supplier to lighten light-emitting diode (LED) light. These electrochemical results indicate that the prepared material is a suitable flexible supercapacitor electrode material.
