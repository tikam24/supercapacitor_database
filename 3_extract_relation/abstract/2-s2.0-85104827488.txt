Harvesting of ambient renewable energy resources, such as indoor light, is a viable solution for the development of autonomous, "install-and-forget", environmental nanosensors. In this work we fabricated and characterized photovoltaic cells based on AgBiI4 rudorffites as promising indoor photovoltaic energy harvesters demonstrating photoconversion efficiency of 5.17% and power output of 1.76 μW cm-2 measured under white LED light of 1000 lux. Considering that modern low-power wireless transmitters consume <1 μJ per bit for data transmission, the indoor rudorffite photovoltaic cell combined with a supercapacitor can be used for sensor readout and reliable intermittent data transmission.
