Scientists at Rice University have developed a new power source that has the structure of a supercapacit5or but behaves like a battery, combining the best qualities of each in a high-power, high-energy power source. The novelty of this device lies in its electrodes, which are made of three-dimensional nanoporous layers of nickel fluoride. At about one-hundredth of an inch thick, the new device is made of a simple method and delivers extremely high power. At âˆ¼ 1-1.2 v, the supercapacitor achieves a maximum capacitance of 66 mF/sq cm, an energy density of 384 w-hr/kg, and a power density of 112 kw-kg.
