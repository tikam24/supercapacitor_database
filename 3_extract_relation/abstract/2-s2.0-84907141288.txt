Here we report a high-performance all-solid-state C@KCu7S4hybrid supercapacitor based on carbon (C) particles coated on a KCu7S4electrode. The C@KCu7S4hybrid supercapacitor (2 mg C) shows good electrochemical behavior with a large specific capacitance of 352 F g-1at a scan rate of 10 mV s-1, the highest energy density of 26.2 W h kg-1and the highest power density of 994.8 W kg-1, still retaining 86% of the capacitance after 2000 cycles. Moreover, a light-emitting diode (LED) can be lit by three supercapacitors in series for about 3.5 min, indicating the good application prospects of using C@KCu7S4hybrid supercapacitors for energy storage.
