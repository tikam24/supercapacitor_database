To synthesize porous carbon-based electrodes for supercapacitors, a bimetallic strategy is used from zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), i.e., ZIF-67 and ZIF-8 are used for derived carbon material. The synthesized electrode comprises two metals, nitrogen and nanoporous carbon with sulfur, which have precisely controlled specific surface area, porosity, and graphitization degree. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) methods are used to explore the electrochemical behavior of the prepared materials using three-electrode configurations in an electrolyte solution (2 M KOH). By combining the consequences of sulfur and bimetal, the prepared specimens performed exceptionally well. The modified final ZIF-derived bimetallic sulfide exhibited an enhanced specific capacitance value of 815 F/g at a scan rate of 2 mV/s. According to the findings, the modified composite has very little resistance to charge transfer, a fast frequency response time, and an improved specific capacitance value. The composite's coulombic efficiency remains at 83.9% after 5000 cycles. The final composite's outstanding performance is due to its nitrogen-doped nanoporous carbon nature/structure and bimetallic derived sulfide composition.
