The Quasi-Z-Source Inverter (qZSI) is a promising solution for Hybrid Energy Storage Systems (HESS) like electric vehicles (EV) and grid-connected storage facilities. In grid-connected applications, the qZSI-HESS can help to mitigate power fluctuations. Furthermore, using the different energy sources in the Z-network it is possible to efficiently manage the power demand. In this paper, a qZSI-HESS with the integration of batteries and ultracapacitors is proposed. The small-signal model of the system is deduced, and the parameter design is given. Finally, various operation modes are investigated through simulations in PLECS. The simulation results demonstrate the power management flexibility of the proposed system.
