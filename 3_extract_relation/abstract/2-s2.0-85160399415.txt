With the rise of new energy power generation, various energy storage methods have emerged, such as lithium battery energy storage, flywheel energy storage (FESS), supercapacitor, superconducting magnetic energy storage, etc. FESS has attracted worldwide attention due to its advantages of high energy storage density, fast charging and discharging speed, high energy conversion rate, easy maintenance, and no environmental pollution, and has been applied in aerospace, military, electric power, and transportation fields. This article uses the citespace review tool to intrinsically analyze and summarize the papers published from 2010 to 2022 in the field of FESS. Relevant knowledge maps such as keywords and research hotspots that carry out FESS research were obtained. Since this technology is developing gradually ►The historical development of FESS is summarized in this article for new/existing researchers. Finally ►This paper presents the future development trend based on reviewed literatures.
