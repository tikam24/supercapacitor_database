CNT/GNF/Fe2O3 ternary composites were synthesized via a simple hydrothermal route. The electrochemical findings reveal that the incorporation of iron oxide (Fe2O3) into CNT/GNF (174 F g−1) boosts the specific capacitance (Cs) to 307 F g−1 at 10 mV s−1. The system also shows good capacity retention, as it maintained 92% of its original capacitance after 200 cyclic voltammetry cycles. Physicochemical characterization shows that Fe2O3 was anchored randomly on the CNT/GNF sidewalls, forming a network for facile ion diffusion. The improved supercapacitance of CNT/GNF/Fe2O3 can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of the double-layer capacitance of CNT/GNF and the pseudocapacitance of Fe2O3.
