As promising candidates for energy-storage devices, supercapacitors (SCs) have attracted considerable attention because of their unique features, such as their high power density, outstanding rate capability, excellent cycling performance, and safety. The recent boom in portable electronic devices requires high-performance SCs that are flexible, simplified, thin, and integrated. Tremendous efforts have been directed towards the design and integration of planar micro-SCs (MSCs) based on different active electrode materials by various methods. This review highlights the recent developments in the device design of flexible planar MSCs and their integration with other electronic devices. The current challenges and future prospects for the development of flexible MSCs are also discussed. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
