The automotive industry has rapidly introduced pollution-free vehicles such as Electric Vehicle (EV). The development and improvement of the EV to replace the conventional vehicle become crucial to obtain the customer satisfaction and high technology achievements. The main systems in EV that are improvise to be switch from the conventional engine with a fuel source to an electric type drive system, include the electric motor and the energy/power storage called battery. There are several types of electric motors that suitable for EV and the best solution was Brushless Direct Current (BLDC) motor in terms of power, speed, torque and low maintenance. Meanwhile, the fuel source replacement is the electrical energy/power storage such as batteries. The aims were to study the best Energy Storage System (ESS) in EV which leads to introducing Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), but the drawbacks of the system give the opportunity improvement, in replacement using Supercapacitor Energy storage System (SESS) and Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS). SESS is a reliable source, but the stand-alone Supercapacitor also has a minimum operation time. With several adjustments in the energy management control strategy, the discharge rate of energy from a supercapacitor can be minimized to prolong its operation.
