It is anticipated that, in the near future Electric vehicles will occupy an indispensable part in the emerging modern vehicular system. One of the major problems to be addressed in electric vehicles paradigm is its energy storage capacity enhancement. Researchers all over the world are working to enhance the capacity of batteries to store energy with small size, weight and reduced cost. The fuel demand is continuously increasing with number of vehicles. India is dependent on other countries for fuel supply. Also, there are no facilities available yet for charging or replacing the batteries during the long journey. It is necessary to improve the capacity of batteries or design a new system as an alternative. Dual energy storage system using a super capacitor and battery helps to develop a modern E-vehicle as premeditated in this paper to ensure a long lasting functionality and cut down the cost of transportation facilities. In the near future, Li-on batteries are seeming to be used for all E-vehicles due to better capacity at small sizes. Control of these batteries with the help of super-capacitors is designed and presented in this paper. With this, the size of the battery has been made to be compact enough to occupy smaller space. Herewith, the proposed system has proven to be effective by presenting simulation and experiment..
