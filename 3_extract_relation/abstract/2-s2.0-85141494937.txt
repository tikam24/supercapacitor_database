This article presents an idea for developing virtual instrument based on LabVIEW and used for dynamic measurement of the capacitance of supercapacitors cells. The cells are part of an energy storage system, where they are connected in series in order to form a battery pack with the desired voltage level. The capacitance measurement is achievable during both charge and discharge stages directly when the battery is in use. An experimental set up with four series connected cells has been developed for testing and verifying the reliability of the virtual instrument.
