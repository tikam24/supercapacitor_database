Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) based materials have recently attracted a wide attention for developing of high-performing supercapacitors (SCs). In the present work, the Ni3(HITP)2 MOF was successfully electrosynthetized via a one-pot approach from and to the surface of nickel foam (NF) and served as ultra-stable thin film electrode. The presence of the active layer is evidenced by a wide range of technique ranging from morphological, spectroscopic to electrochemical ones. As the film was formed within the diffusion layer of the NF surface, the electrochemical accessible surface area was improved and the drawback of being low electrically conductive of MOF based materials could be minimized. Accordingly, it is confirmed by a significant charge accumulation over dissipation obtained by electrochemical impedance microscopy and a capacitance retention about 40% from 0.01 to 10 V.sâˆ’1. Besides, this approach allows the formed materials to be strongly attached to the surface of the current collector, thus significantly enhance the cycling stability around 100% capacitance retention over 0.9 V for 170,000 cycles
