NiFe2O4@CoFe2O4 core-shell nanofibers were prepared by the co-electrospinning method. The prepared core-shell NiFe2O4@CoFe2O4 nanofibers electrode has the specific capacitance of 480 Fg-1 at a current density of 1Ag-1. After being cycled 2000 times at a current density of 5Ag-1, the capacity of NiFe2O4@CoFe2O4 core-shell nanofibers remained 87%. The electrochemical performance of the supercapacitor is improved by the synergistic action of the multi-metal and indicates that core/shell NiFe2O4@CoFe2O4 nanofibers are promising materials.
