Nanospheres of Co3O4, NiO, and their composites (Co3O4/NiO) are prepared by the co-precipitation method and utilized as supercapacitor electrode materials. The materialâ€™s chemical composition was identified using EDX, and the crystallite sizes of Co3O4, NiO, and their nanocomposite determined using X-ray diffraction were obtained to be 25.36 nm, 21.80 nm, and 23.58 nm, respectively. FTIR was utilized to check the functional groups of the prepared material, and scanning electron microscopy revealed that there were many interconnected nanospheres with spherical morphology in Co3O4, NiO, and their nanocomposite. To investigate the electrochemical properties, cyclic voltammetry was utilized to find the specific capacitance of nanocomposites (Co3O4/NiO), which was 2769.2 F/g at 5 mV/s, and galvanostatic charging/discharging was utilized to measure the excellent power density of 3629.76 W/kg at current density 7 A/g and the excellent energy density of 131.96 Wh/kg at 1 A/g current density of the nanocomposite Co3O4/NiO. In comparison with the studies, all of these findings are exceptional and may yield useful results for the production of high energy density supercapacitors.
