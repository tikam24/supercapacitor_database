Conducting polymer technology doped with nanodiamond particles enhances processability, tractability, electrical, mechanical, electrochemical, optical, thermal, and other essential physical properties. This review outlines some major conducting polymer/nanodiamond nanocomposites advances obtained with major conjugated polymers such as: polyaniline, polypyrrole, polythiophene, and polythiophene derivatives. Moreover, this article concisely and inclusively discusses how important conducting polymer nanocomposites are for supercapacitor, actuator, solar cell, corrosion protection, and biomedical fields. Finally, challenges and perspectives are deliberated for viable future high performance materials.
