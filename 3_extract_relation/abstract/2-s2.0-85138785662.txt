Porous carbons with controlled morphologies and porous structures were successfully prepared by a simple method. The morphology and the porous structure of the porous carbons could be controlled by adjusting the solvent species. When used as the electrode materials for supercapacitors, porous carbon achieved a specific capacitance of 174 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. The supercapacitor device provided an energy density of 4.9 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 225.0 W kg−1 and 3.9 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 4457.1 W kg−1. The capacitance retention rate after 10,000 cycles was 92.1%.
