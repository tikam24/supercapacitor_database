The proceedings contain 166 papers. The topics discussed include: characterizing sic-based drive inverter losses using the method of reduced continuous operation; optimized design of the PLL with reconstructed singular return ratio matrix for grid-connected inverter; a new control scheme for a single phase modular multilevel converter connected to the grid under unbalanced arm power conditions; perspectives on lithium-based batteries and post-lithium batteries for electric vehicles; adaptive ramp-rate control of hybrid energy storage system for PV application; control strategy of multi-level converters for soft open point applications; harmonic resonance mitigation and impedance stability improvement of converter-based resources in active distribution grids; a passivity-based high-bandwidth voltage control for grid-forming inverters; high performance power hardware-in-the-loop testing of traction inverters at high voltage levels; a technical and economic feasibility study of campus microgrid implementation; suppression of low-frequency voltage ripple in cascaded h-bridge multilevel converters-based large-scale PV systems; an application analysis of wide-bandgap device for medium voltage wind energy conversion system; harmonic modeling methods for power electronic converters: case study and comparison; a pilot protection scheme for HVDC transmission lines based on simultaneous existence of forward and backward voltage travelling waves; and optimal sizing for a battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system.
