Electronically conducting polymers are suitable electrode materials for high performance supercapacitors for their high specific capacitance and high dc conductivity in the charged state. Supercapacitors and batteries are energy storage and conversion systems which satisfy the requirements of high specific power and energy in a complementary way. Ion beam (energy >1MeV) irradiation on the polymer is a novel technique to enhance or alter the properties like conductivity, density, chain length and solubility. Conducting polymer polypyrrole thin films doped with LiClO4 are synthesized electrochemically on Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) coated glass. The polymer films are irradiated with 160MeV Ni12+ ions at different fluence 5 × 1010, 5 × 1011 and 3 × 1012 ions cm-2. dc conductivity measurement of the irradiated films show 50-60% increase in conductivity. Absorption increases in the higher wavelength region in the UV-VIS spectra, but no significant changes have been obtained in the FTIR spectra. The capacitance of the irradiated films is lowered. However, the capacitance of the supercapacitors with irradiated film shows enhanced stability compared to the devices with unirradiated films while characterized for cycle life up to 10,000 cycles. © 2005 IACS.
