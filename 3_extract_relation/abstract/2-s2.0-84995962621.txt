Lithium-ion batteries have been widely applied to power various devices because of their high energy density. However, their power performance is generally limited by the Li+ diffusion in the bulk of electrode-active materials and is much lower than that of a supercapacitor. Herein, nano-structured cathode (spinel LiMn2O4 nanorods) and anode materials (carbon-coated Li4Ti5O12 nanowires) are prepared by hydrothermal approaches with subsequent heat treatments or a chemical vapor deposition treatment. Electrochemical investigation demonstrates that the nano-size and one-dimensional structure of the prepared electrode materials can efficiently shorten Li+ diffusion length and reduce interface impedance, and thus they exhibit much higher rate capability than that of the micro-sized LiMn2O4 and Li4Ti5O12. The LiMn2O4 nanorods and carbon-coated Li4Ti5O12 nanowires were then used to build a full cell that exhibits supercapacitor-like power performance (a maximum power density of 6880 W kg−1), long life (500 cycles with a capacity retention of 81%) and high energy density (a maximum energy density of 140 W h kg−1).
