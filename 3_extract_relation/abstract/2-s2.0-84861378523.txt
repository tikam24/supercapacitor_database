Since a few years, problems regarding power quality issues in general get increasing interest. They have their own negative influence on several aspects of modern society. The problems in industry have been addressed for a longer time. However, also home and the non-manufacturing industry suffers from the lack of power quality. Besides the visual disadvantage, such as flicker, electronic equipment and domotic systems are very sensitive to deviations in the main voltage. To avoid these problems, they can use power supplies, which are redundant during normal main supply, but become active in case of voltage sags or in case of total lose of power. All these systems are based on the storage of energy. During the last years, more powerful techniques like Super Magnetic Storage Systems (SMES) and systems with Super Capacitors as an alternative for the conventional solutions became attractive. Recently, Redox Flow Batteries give another alternative. A literature study is carried out to have an overview of the advantages and drawbacks of these new storage systems against the existing systems, and to study their usefulness in the distribution grid.
