Flexible power sources are critical to achieve the wide adoption of portable and wearable electronics. Herein, a facile and general strategy of fabricating a fibrous electrode was developed by 3D active coating technology, in which a stepping syringe with electrode paste was synchronously injected onto a rotating conductive wire, distinguished from the conventional direct-write 3D printing without a current collector. A series of such electrodes with different coating weight can be fabricated accurately and efficiently by adjusting critical process parameters following a set of derived equations. The demonstrated fibrous Zn-MnO2battery with a high commercial Ïµ-MnO2loading of 14.9 mg cm-2onto a stainless steel wire shows a reasonable energy density of 108 mWh cm-3, while the fiber-shaped supercapacitor with commercial porous graphene exhibits a high capacitance of 142.9 F g-1and good durability for bending 10,000 cycles. This work constructs a bridge between materials and fiber-shaped electrodes for flexible energy storage devices.
