Asymmetric supercapacitors can effectively increase the energy density of supercapacitors, and the key is to develop high-performance electrode materials and electrolytes. Hierarchical carbon nanocages are promising electrode materials for supercapacitors because of the large specific surface area, coexisting micro-meso-macropore, good conductivity and high stability. By introducing pseudocapacitance and improving wettability via N&S dual-doping, the N&S dual-doped carbon nancages (NSCNC) exhibit a high specific capacity of 337 F•g-1 at 1 A•g-1 within the potential window of 0~1 V in 1 mol•L-1 H2SO4solution. Hydrated tungsten trioxide (WO3•0.6H2O) nanorods can achieve the insertion/de-insertion of H+ via the redox reaction between W6+/W5+, and exhibit a high specific capacity of 454 F•g-1 at 5 A•g-1 within the potential window of -0.55~0.3 V. The solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (SASC) with NSCNC and WO3•0.6H2O nanorods as positive and negative electrodes, and in situ polymerized gel electrolyte (IPGE/H2SO4) as solid electrolyte has the working voltage of 1.5 V. And the rate performance of the SASC is very close to that of the H-type device with 1 mol•L-1 H2SO4 solution as electrolyte, much better than the counterpart with the traditional gel electrolyte of polyvinyl alcohol/sulfuric acid (PVA/H2SO4). The much improved SASC performance is attributed to the establishment of the effective charge transfer interface between the IPGE/H2SO4 and the electrode materials, which enhances the transfer of H+ ions and thereby much reduces theIR drop. The energy density of the SASC with IPGE/H2SO4 is 22.31 Wh•kg-1 at 0.375 kW•kg-1 (0.5 A•g-1) and 8.55 Wh•kg-1 at 7.5 kW•kg-1 (10 A•g-1), locating at the top-ranking of literatures. The SASC also exbibits excellent cycling stability, with the capacity retention of 95.2% after 4000 cycles at 5 A•g-1. This study not only demonstrates the excellent energy storage performance of NSCNC//WO3•0.6H2O supercapacitors in acidic electrolytes, but also provides a new in-situ polymerized gel electrolyte for building high-performance SASCs.
