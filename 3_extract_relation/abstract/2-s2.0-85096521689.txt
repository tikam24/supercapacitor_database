Bare and 10 mol% Dysprosium (Dy) doped α-MnO2 nanorods have been successfully synthesised through one step simple and facile hydrothermal synthesis technique as an electrode material. The electrochemical properties are evaluated using cyclic voltammetry test, where we demonstrate a significant enhancement in specific capacitance after incorporating Dy in α-MnO2 nanorods. XRD (X-Ray diffraction) and FE-SEM (Field Emission-Scanning Electron Microscopy) measurements show that although the structure of Dy doped α-MnO2 remains tetragonal, the crystallinity degrades along with the reduction in aspect ratio of nanorods. Poor crystallinity and smaller nanorods are an evidence of high capacitance observed in Dy doped α-MnO2 nanorods. The effect of incorporating Dy on structure, morphology, and electrochemical properties are discussed in detail for the application of supercapacitor.
