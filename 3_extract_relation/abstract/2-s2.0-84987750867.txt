This paper reports a facile means of fabricating a flexible supercapacitor with excellent cycling stability, based on the use of carbon cloth (CC) activated and subsequently modified with birnessite-type MnO2. In this study, sections of commercially-available CC were treated using a simple wet method and then served as substrates for the direct growth of MnO2 via an electrochemical process. The resulting CC electrodes allowed the deposition of a large amount of MnO2 while maintaining its electrochemical utilization efficiency. The optimal mass loading of MnO2 was determined to be 4.27 mg cm-2, a level that gave an areal capacitance of 568 mF cm-2 at a scan rate of 2 mV s-1. This MnO2/CC material was employed in conjunction with an activated carbon-coated CC section as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively, in a solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor. The device generated a cell voltage of 2.0 V with a maximum volumetric energy density of 0.978 mWh cm-3 at a minimum power density of 3.52 Ã— 10-3 W cm-3 0.439 mWh cm-3 at 0.158 W cm-3. This performance was maintained at 94.4% of the original level, even after 10,000 cycles, at a constant current density of 50 mA cm-2.
