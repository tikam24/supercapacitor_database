In this study, Co11(HPO3)8(OH)6 was fabricated via a facile solvothermal process. The product with different morphologies of spherical-like, rod-like, bundle-like and flower-like microstructures can be easily controlled by adjusting the amount of DMF. Furthermore, flower-like Co11(HPO3)8(OH)6 obtained at 160 Â°C after 12 h with a H2O/DMF ratio of 1 : 1 shows improved electrochemical performance. The flower-like Co11(HPO3)8(OH)6 can be directly used as an electrode, demonstrating an excellent specific capacity of 919.3 C g-1 (1532.2 F g-1) at 1 A g-1, and its capacity retention can reach 71.3% at 20 A g-1. The as-prepared Co11(HPO3)8(OH)6//AC device delivers a higher energy density of 14.5 W h kg-1 and has an outstanding cyclic stability of 83.5% after 7800 cycles. This journal is
