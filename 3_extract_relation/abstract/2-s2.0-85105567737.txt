In this work, a cubic-like ZnMn2O4 nanostructure was prepared by a cost-effective double-hydroxide-mediated hydrothermal route. As-synthesized material was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy studies. The cubic-like surface morphology of the material was viewed using scanning electron microscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy analyses. The electrochemical properties of the ZnMn2O4 electrode were examined by cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses. The electrochemical results revealed that the ZnMn2O4 electrode had battery-type Faradic behavior with the highest capacitance of 776 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in a 2 M KOH electrolyte and showed good cyclic stability, with an efficiency of 91.7% after 5000 continuous long cycles. The synthesis method entails that the ZnM2O4 electro-active material acts as a promising high-performance supercapacitor electrode.
