Reduction of the nanocomposite of the conductive polymer composite in the GO/conductive polymer and the RGO imparts excellent mechanical, thermal, electrical and electrochemical properties to the composite. Therefore, the RGO/conductive polymer has become the main research direction of new functional materials. The polypyrrole/GO composite was prepared by in-situ polymerization using graphene oxide as the matrix and polypyrrole as the guest of the difference layer. The additive type, the mass fraction of GO emulsion, the molar ratio of NaOH to pyrrole, the molar ratio of oxidant to FeCl3 to pyrrole and the reaction temperature were investigated systematically for polypyrrole/GO. The influence of the structure and properties of GO composites. The supercapacitors properties of nanocomposites as electrodes were investigated.
