Supercapacitors are new energy storage devices that exhibit such unique features as high capacitance, high power density, and a long cycle. Some required features such as higher stability, durability, and catalytic activity, and a lower cost are crucial for new types of materials used in supercapacitors. Carbon derivatives, especially graphene-based systems, are very important materials for energy applications, owing to their physical, morphological, and structural properties. Besides, polymer-based materials have attracted much attention for supercapacitor applications. Herein, different polymers and polymer-based carbon derivatives will be discussed as potential electrode materials for supercapacitor applications. Finally, all graphene and polymer-based materials developed recently for flexible supercapacitor applications are also discussed.
