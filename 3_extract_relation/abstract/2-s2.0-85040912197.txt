Currently, it remains a great challenge to achieve all-solid-state supercapacitors with both high electrochemical performance and excellent stretchability because of the limitations of stretchable electrodes and solid-state electrolytes. Here, we developed all-solid-state supercapacitors by using aligned carbon nanotube/conducting polymer (Ag-doped poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate)) composites as electrodes and polyvinyl alcohol-based electrolytes. The obtained all-solid-state supercapacitors not only exhibited a high specific capacitance of 64 mF cm-2 (corresponding to 85.3 F g-1), but could also maintain 98% of their original capacitance even under a tensile strain as high as 480%, which represents the highest value for thin-film all-solid-state supercapacitors using the same electrolyte to date, to the best of our knowledge. The newly developed thin-film supercapacitor maintained 90% of its original capacitance after 100 stretching cycles to a tensile strain of 400% and maintained 93% after stretching to 200% for 2000 cycles, indicating excellent stretching stability. The present work provides an efficient strategy to achieve highly stretchable energy storage devices with high performance.
