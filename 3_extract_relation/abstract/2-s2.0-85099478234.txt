Novel photo-assisted supercapacitor electrode, bismuth-iron oxide/graphene, has been successfully developed via facile one-step chronoamperometric deposition. The highly dense nanorod-like structure of mixed bismuth-iron oxide aligned on graphene surface can facilitate ion/charge transport and perform well-synergistic materials. This as-prepared hybrid electrode reveals the highest specific capacitance of 306.67 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 under UV irradiation, which is increased by 39.29% of capacitance value compared to that obtained from dark condition. Furthermore, the better rate capability of the as-prepared electrode under UV irradiation is demonstrated, confirming the boosting of ion diffusion and charge redox reaction via photo-voltaic effect. This finding strategy provides a new class multipotential electrode material to the direct storage of the abundant solar energy.
