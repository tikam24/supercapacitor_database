Saving of energy in tram traction can be achieved by use the energy storage system placed at the end of the tram line. In the paper is presented the description of the energy storage system based on battery of supercapacitors and DC/DC converter enabling energy flow during loading and unloading of the battery. The basic sources of power losses in the energy storage system are discussed. The storage system parameters choice leading to minimizing the power losses during energy flow between battery and line are analyzed.
