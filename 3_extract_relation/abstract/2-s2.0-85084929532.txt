A trihybrid bioelectrode composed of lignin, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), and poly(aminoanthraquinone) (PAAQ) is prepared by a two-step galvanostatic electropolymerization, and characterized for supercapacitor applications. Using PEDOT/Lignin as a base layer, followed by the consecutive deposition of PAAQ, the hybrid electrode PEDOT/Lignin/PAAQ shows a high specific capacitance of 418 F g−1 with small self-discharge. This trihybrid electrode material can be assembled into symmetric and asymmetric supercapacitors. The asymmetric supercapacitor uses PEDOT + Lignin/PAAQ as positive electrode and PEDOT/PAAQ as negative electrode, and exhibits superior electrochemical performance due to the synergistic effect of the two electrodes, which leads to a specific capacitance of 74 F g−1. It can be reversibly cycled in the voltage range of 0–0.7 V. More than 80% capacitance is retained after 10 000 cycles. These remarkable features reveal the exciting potential of a full organic energy storage device with long cycle life.
