The phenolic resin was mixed with hexamethylenetetramine and ferrocene by blending them in methanol to prepare activated carbon. The samples had a relatively large size mesopore in the range of 3-4 nm, whose double electric capacitor was as high as 0.26 F/cm2. The capacitance/surface area ratio of the mesoporous activated carbon decreased with the increasing activation time, which leads to the low C/H ratio and destructed structure.
