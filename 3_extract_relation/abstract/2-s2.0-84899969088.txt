With developments in technology, tremendous effort has been devoted to produce flexible, scalable, and high-performance supercapacitor electrode materials. This report presents a novel fabrication method of highly flexible and scalable electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors using solution-processed polyaniline (PANI)/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) hybrid film. SEM, TEM, Raman, and XPS analyses show that the PANI/RGO film is successfully synthesized. The percentages of the PANI component in the film are controlled (88, 76, and 60%), and the maximum electrical conductivity (906 S cm -1) is observed at the PANI percentage of 76%. Notably, electrical conductivity of the PANI/RGO film (906 S cm-1) is larger than both PANI (580 S cm-1) and RGO (46.5 S cm-1) components. XRD analysis demonstrates that the strong π-π interaction between the RGO and the PANI cause more compact packing of the PANI chains by inducing more fully expanded conformation of the PANI chains in the solution, leading to increase in the electrical conductivity and crystallinity of the film. The PANI/RGO film also displays diverse advantages as a scalable and flexible electrode material (e.g., controllable size and great flexibility). During the electrochemical tests, the film exhibits high capacitance of 431 F g-1 with enhanced cycling stability. Size-controllable PANI/RGO hybrid films are fabricated via solution processing. The film shows the enhanced electrical conductivity and crystallinity greater than both RGO and PANI components. The film also demonstrates excellent performance as a supercapacitor electrode with various film sizes and under bending conditions. This approach offers a promising tool for producing highly flexible, scalable, and high-performance supercapacitor electrodes. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
