Background: FeTe:Fe2TeO5 nanodots encapsulated MWCNTs as a nanocomposite is a new hybrid electrode material tested for supercapacitor energy storage application for the first time. Method: For the deposition of FeTe:Fe2TeO5 over MWCNTs simple, inexpensive, binder free and low-cost and thin-film method named successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) was used. Significant findings: FeTe:Fe2TeO5 nanodots encapsulated MWCNTs as a nanocomposite have been accomplished with the aid of sequential growth controlled chemical method. Mixed phase of iron telluride consisting of FeTe (Tetragonal) and Fe2TeO5(Monoclinic) has been well analyzed through structural studies. Due to growth of nanodots as seen through SEM images have been responsible to enhance surface area of MWCNTs/FeTe:Fe2TeO5 than that of bare FeTe:Fe2TeO5 supported by BET analysis. Oxidation states of mixed elements have been well confirmed through XPS studies. These characterization results of the electrode supporting for electrochemical supercapacitor application and hence, analyzed through electrochemical investigation inclusive of CV, GCD, EIS and electrochemical capacitance retention. Interestingly, MWCNTs/FeTe:Fe2TeO5 nanocomposite yields remarkable capacitance of 773.69 F/g at 3 mV/s, with an energy density of 8.19 Wh/kg and power density of 108 W/kg at current density of 0.8 mA/cm2. Electrodes good cyclic stability (capacitive retention) of 95% at 5000 CV cycles explores its candidature for future energy storage applications.
