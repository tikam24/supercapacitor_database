Noticeable surface reaction in the energy storage mechanism has attracted tremendous research due to its relationship with electrochemical capacity and rate capability. In this work, in-situ grown heterostructured metal silicates are prepared through a facile hydrothermal method. The composites are employed as anodes for supercapacitor and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The ratio of cobalt and copper in the heterostructure has a significant effect on its properties, including porosity, electrical conductivity, and pseudo-capacitance contribution during the energy storage process. The combination of metal silicates, heterostructure, and porous bio-mass derived carbon into one system results in a unique electrode material with optimized reaction kinetics. The integration leads to a superior capacity and rate capability. Specifically, the cobalt silicate/copper silicate heterostructure composites present improved electrochemical performance as anode for LIBs and supercapacitor. For lithium-ion storage, the B-C@CoCuSi-(3-1) delivers a capacity of 574.5 mAh g−1. When used as an anode material for supercapacitor, the B-C@CoCuSi-(1-3) shows a capacitance of 80.4 F g−1.
