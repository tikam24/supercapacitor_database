Large-scale manufacturing of thick electrode films with high energy storage is critical for practical applications. Two-dimensional materials are promising candidates due to their high surface areas to volume ratios. However, various studies have reported that the storage capacity of these two-dimensional materials is highly dependent on the thickness of the films. Here, we demonstrate a scheme based on the reduced graphene oxide/carbon fiber composites as supercapacitor electrodes which demonstrate a mass loadings-independent energy and power performances. Randomly oriented and interconnected carbon fibers are utilized to provide a framework to alleviate the restacking issues of reduced graphene oxide nanosheets and promoting ion flows in the networks. High capacitances maintain even the mass loadings up to 4 mg cmâˆ’2. An all-solid symmetrical supercapacitor has been fabricated to power a LED light and also can power a commercial gas sensor, which shows the practical application potential.
