High-performance porous carbon materials have always received much interest for supercapacitors due to their excellent cycling stability, superior conductivity, etc. Herein, sulfur, phosphorous and chlorine tri-doped hierarchically porous carbon (SPC) were prepared by simply co-activating using KOH and Na2S with wheat bran as precursor. Na2S can not only improve the specific surface area (1310.3 m2 g−1 to 1585.5 m2 g−1) and pore volume (0.767 cm3 g−1 to 0.977 cm3 g−1), but also introduce sulfur atoms to contribute extra pseudocapacitance. Benefitting from the heteroatom doping and surface structure optimizing, the as-prepared SPC exhibits a large specific capacitance of 488 F g−1 (at 1 A g−1), superior to the porous carbon that was only activated by KOH (245 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), and still remains 51.6% of the initial specific capacitance at 20 A g−1.The supercapacitor assembled by SPC delivers a high energy density of 12.5 Wh kg−1 (at 250 W kg−1). After charge-discharge for 9000 cycles (at 10 A g−1), the capacitance can still remain 96% of the initial value, showing that SPC is a promising candidate for high-performance supercapacitor.
