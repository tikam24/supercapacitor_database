This study reports the utilisation of degradable biomass to create high-value porous carbon materials with excellent energy storage properties. We explore the extraction of soluble collagen from chicken feet using a sustainable and cost-effective method and its conversion to collagen sponges with interconnected porous features. In this study, we developed unique graphene integrated 3D porous carbon sponges from chicken feet derived collagen for the first time. We have also investigated graphene integrated porous carbon's (C-G-collagen) surface, chemical, thermal, and electrochemical properties. The unique porous structure of C-G-collagen provides a large surface area of 1087 m2/g and improved electrochemical performance with a high capacitance of 365 F/g at 1 mV/s. The as-fabricated electrode material possesses constant cyclic stability even after 10,000 cycles at 100 mV/s. This study confirmed that chicken-feet-derived porous carbon sponges are a viable option to fabricate the highly porous structures with large surface areas, and unique electronic and chemical properties. These porous carbon sponges can be used in energy storage applications, thereby demonstrating a unique pathway for developing functional materials suitable for a wide range of multifunctional applications.
