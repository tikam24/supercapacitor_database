An energy saving control strategy that utilizing regenerative braking energy with on-board super capacitor (SC) is researched in the paper. The equivalent circuit model of the electrical train and the simplified model of the on-board SC are built. After modeling, the charge and discharge process of the SC is analyzed. Relating to the state of charge (SoC) of the SC, the energy consumption function of electrical train based on the power flow is developed and the multi-objective optimization function is derived. Besides, the running process is discretized by dividing the railroad section. In order to solve the objective function, an approach based on the dynamic programming (DP) is proposed and verified by simulation. The simulation results demonstrate that the energy saving effect is affected by the weight coefficient of each objective function, and the largest energy saving index is up to 18.23%.
