In recent years, the crucial role of energy storage materials in environmentally friendly and versatile energy applications has drawn considerable attention from researchers. A hollow nanostructure is an excellent solution to develop advanced materials for these purposes. In the past decades, hollow nanostructures hold prospects for application in many fields such as new energy batteries and supercapacitors. Researchers have invested substantial investigational effort in devising highly complex hollow nanostructures with improved electrochemical properties by manipulating their geometry, chemical composition, building blocks, and internal structure. However, surface modification, an effective and commonly employed strategy to enhance material properties, has still not been systematically applied to hollow nanostructured energy storage materials. In this review, a comprehensive review of surface modification of complex hollow nanostructures for energy storage applications is discussed. After a brief classification of different surface modification methods and principles, surface modification applications of hollow nanostructures are outlined, including lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors, lithium-sulfur batteries, and several other energy storage devices. The superiority of hollow structures for surface modification of energy storage materials is particularly emphasized.
