Sub-micron-scaled sodium cobalt oxide (NaCo2O4) powders are prepared by a solid-state reaction method. Characterization using X-ray diffraction indicates that the synthesized NaCo2O4 has a hexagonal layered structure. The electrochemical performance of the NaCo2O4 electrodes is investigated using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge in NaOH solution. The results show that the specific capacitance of the NaCo2O4 electrode reaches 337 F/g over the potential range of 0.15-0.65 V at a mass normalized current of 50 mA/g. Moreover, NaCo2O4 exhibits very good stability and cycling performance as a supercapacitor material. Â© 2013 Zhao-Rong Chang. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Chinese Chemical Society.
