A nanostructured Ni(OH)2 electrode was prepared and evaluated in supercapacitor application. Mesoporous Ni(OH)2 tubes were integrated onto carbon fiber paper without the use of a binder. The large surface area and porous structure of Ni(OH)2 combined with the effective diffusion of electrolytes through carbon network resulted in an excellent charge storage capacity and good long-term cyclability.
