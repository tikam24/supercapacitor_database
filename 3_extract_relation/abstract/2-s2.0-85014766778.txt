In this paper, oriented arrays of polyaniline (PANI) nanowires were fabricated on the surface of hierarchical graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets by in situ polymerization method. Then the GO was reduced to be graphene, the graphene/polyaniline (rGO-PANI) nanocomposites were obtained. After that, electrochemical properties of the rGO-PANI nanocomposites were well studied. The results showed that the rGO-PANI nanocomposites exhibited significant charge-discharge reversibility and electrochemical stability. It is more important that, compared with GO-PANI, the rGO-PANI nanocomposites generated much higher conductivity value and electrochemical capacitance.
