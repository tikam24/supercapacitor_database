Carbon derivatives like graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and several other derived materials have arose as favourable solution in enhancing the challenges facing renewable energy transformation and storing devices. The problems they had to solve are due to large specific surface area (SSA), great chemical stability, high electrical conductivity as well as extraordinary mechanical flexibility and strength. This chapter is an assemblage of some properties of carbon derivatives and metal oxide composites for enhancement of energy storage devices (batteries and supercapacitors). This chapter will explicitly study the role of carbon derivatives in upgrading the cycle stability, life span, storage capacity and non-toxic nature of electrodes for energy storage device applications. This study will evaluate the easiest and cheapest technique of fabrication of affordable, portable and available electrode materials for these energy storage devices based on carbon derivatives.
