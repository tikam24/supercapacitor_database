Piaggio has successfully operated a fully integrated hydrogen fuel cell scooter at its test ground in Pontedera. The "Fresco" project was coordinated by the ECN Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands, and also involved Selin Sistemi SpA. Piaggio aims to extend its activities in cleaner propulsion systems that began with its leading role in the development of hybrid technology. The scooter's maximum speed is 70 km/hr, with a range of > 120 km. The liquid-cooled PEM fuel cell stack produces 6 kw of electric power, and is used in combination with a 45 w-hr supercapacitor, with regenerative braking employed to boost the overall capacity efficiency. The on-board hydrogen supply is a 525 bar tank with a carbon-reinforced aluminum liner.
