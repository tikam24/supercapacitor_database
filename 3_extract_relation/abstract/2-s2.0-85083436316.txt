A stacked lamellar rGO film coated on carbon cloth (rGO/CC) was facilely prepared for application in flexible all-solid-state supercapacitors, in which the reduction degree of rGO was tuned to control interlayer spacing and wettability of rGO film. Furthermore, the effect of reduction degree on electrochemical performance of rGO film was investigated in detail. The result showed that the rGO film with higher reduction degree showed larger capacitance of ca. 185.7 F gâˆ’1. The enhanced capacitance of rGO film with higher reduction degree was mainly attributed to larger electrochemical active surface area and more channels for diffusion of ions. The work did not only report a new flexible all-solid-state supercapacitors with high performance, but also provided a new method to improve the electrochemical performance and stability of rGO film for various applications.
