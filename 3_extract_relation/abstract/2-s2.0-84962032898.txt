In this paper we focus on the estimation of the essential availability and reliability characteristics of super capacitors. The estimation is based on experimental data calculation using a Wiener process. The experimental data were acquired when performing the accelerated tests of super capacitors in the thermal climatic chamber VÃ¶tsch VC3 7034. Three thermal levels were used when performing the accelerated tests. Our approach presented in the paper is predominantly not focused on a failure occurrence but on performance durability and availability assessment such as functional stability. We will assess correct functioning and first hitting time if the super capacitor loses its power capacity.
