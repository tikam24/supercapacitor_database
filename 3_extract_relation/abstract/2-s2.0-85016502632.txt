Here we describe the production of carbon cloth coated with MnO2 nanosheets or MnOOH nanorods through a normal temperature reaction or a hydrothermal approach, respectively. Of note, the electrochemical performance of MnO2-coated carbon cloth was better (429.2 F g−1) than that of MnOOH-coated carbon cloth. When the MnO2-coated carbon cloth is introduced as the positive electrode and the Fe2O3-coated carbon cloth as the negative electrode, a flexible asymmetric supercapacitor was obtained with an energy density of 22.8 Wh kg−1 and a power density of 159.4 W kg−1. Therefore, such a hierarchical MnO2-coated carbon cloth nanocomposite is a promising high-performance electrode for flexible supercapacitors.
