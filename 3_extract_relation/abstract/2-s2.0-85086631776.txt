The constant-current constant-voltage (CC-CV) charging method is a common approach to charge batteries with a single charger. Recently, with the emergence of high power-density batteries, e.g., supercapacitors, several chargers are typically connected in parallel to provide the required charging power in many applications. However, the classical decentralized control scheme for the multicharger system leads to the current imbalance, which deteriorates the reliability of the charging system. In this article, we extend the CC-CV charging protocol to multicharger systems using a cooperative control method, which can alleviate the current imbalance among chargers effectively. First, the motivation and charging system modeling of this work are provided. Then, a cooperative CC charging protocol and a cooperative CV charging protocol are presented, respectively, and a switching logic is designed to achieve the switching between them based on the supercapacitor voltage. The closed-loop model of the proposed charging system is developed using the block diagram. A laboratory testbed is built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experiment results show that the proposed method provides a better current balancing and voltage regulation performance when compared with existing decentralized control methods.
