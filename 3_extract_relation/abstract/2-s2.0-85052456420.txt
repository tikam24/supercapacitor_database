A facile and low-cost strategy has been developed to prepare a highly porous polyaniline/carbon nanotube/polyvinyl chloride film (PANI-CNTs-PVC) as an electrode for flexible supercapacitors with the improved performance. The flexible porous film was fabricated via introducing Zn nanopowder into the composition of PANI-CNTs-PVC film and then leaching of Zn from the obtained film in an acidic solution. A maximum areal capacitance of 298 mF cm−2 with 86.5 % retention after 5000 cycles at a current density of 0.6 mA cm−2 is achieved for the porous flexible PANI-CNTs-PVC film. The capacity is considerably larger than that of the non-porous flexible PANI-CNTs-PVC film prepared without Zn introduction process (90 mF cm−2 with 87 % retention after 5000 cycles). The excellent electrochemical performance of the porous PANI-CNTs-PVC film compared to non-porous PANI-CNTs-PVC film is due to the porous 3D network structure and its high hydrophilic property which help to transport electrolyte to the inner region of the composite and facilitate the charge-transfer between the film and electrolyte. Furthermore, an all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor fabricated from two porous flexible PANI-CNTs-PVC films with solid-state PVA/H2SO4 gel as electrolyte displayed superior flexibility and high electrochemical activity.
