This work reports the electrochemical performance of sustainable solid-state supercapacitors (SCs) made with cellulose (extracted from diaper waste) and graphene. The electrodes of these SCs were decorated with nanoparticles of PbFe11CrO19 (PbFeCr) ferrite to increase the capacitance of the devices by redox reactions. SCs were fabricated by coating the surface of a diaper with graphene ink, producing a continuous and conductive network and diaper + graphene was employed as the SC electrode. Subsequently, two electrodes were assembled to form a solid-state device (the dielectric separator was a soft textile layer taken from the diaper). The flexible devices were electrochemically characterized and capacitances of 1894.8 and 411.4 F g−1 were obtained for the SCs fabricated with and without PbFeCr, respectively. Thus, the addition of ferrite increased the capacitance by 360%. Furthermore, there was an increase in the energy density of the SCs after the incorporation of ferrite from 36.6 to 164.4 W h kg−1. Also, the SC made using ferrite provided a steady operating voltage of 0.48 V after 10 minutes of uninterrupted discharge, while the device fabricated without ferrite only maintained 0.12 V for the same discharging time. Surface characterization techniques such as absorbance spectroscopy and XPS confirmed the formation of oxygen vacancies, Fe2+/Fe3+ and Cr3+/Cr6+ species on the surface of the electrodes, which worked as redox-centers for the storage of charge in the SCs. In general, the results of this investigation demonstrated that using diaper waste is a feasible option for the fabrication of efficient and sustainable flexible SCs. This benefits the environment because recycled materials were employed.
