Supercapacitors are a promising energy storage device for portable products, electric vehicles, and smart grid applications. However, the major scientific challenge in this system is to significantly increase energy density. This study expands energy density by constructing an all-solid-state supercapacitor with graphene oxide (GO) based composite electrodes and gel polymer electrolyte (GPE). Composite electrodes integrating nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) fabricated through a hydrothermal process are validated via x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and FTIR. Electrochemical performance of the composite electrode and all-solid-state supercapacitors are further examined by electrochemical procedures. The high resistance of metal oxide is shown to be overcome, and performance of the composite electrode approaches currently available published data. An all-solid-state supercapacitor with expanded operation window up to 3 V is demonstrated.
