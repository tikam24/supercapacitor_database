Hard-switching-induced switching loss can contribute significantly to the power loss of an isolated bidirectional dual-active-bridge (DAB) dc-dc converter operating at high frequency. An $LC$-type series resonant DAB converter based on a switch-controlled-inductor (SCI) is proposed to mitigate the loss arising from hard switching under wide-range variations in output voltage and current. Zero-voltage switching is achieved at the primary side (high voltage), while at the secondary side (low voltage), zero-current switching is preferred to reduce excessive ringing due to circulating current and switching loss. In order to achieve reduced conduction loss, a nominal operating point is chosen where the root-mean-square resonant tank current is the minimum. To validate the proposed topology and modulation scheme, an $LC$-type series resonant DAB converter based on SCI operating at 100 kHz is designed to interface a 400-V dc bus to a supercapacitor-based energy storage. Simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed topology for charging/discharging a supercapacitor with an output voltage variation of between 10 and 48 V and a maximum rated power of 480 W. A maximum efficiency of 94.6% is achieved using the proposed topology and modulation scheme.
