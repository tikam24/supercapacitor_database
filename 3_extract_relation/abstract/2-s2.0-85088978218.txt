Multifarious layered electrode materials are attracting increased attention in the field of energy storage because of their high specific surface and interlayer modifiability. However, the natural tendency to be re-superimposed and the inherent disadvantages of a single layered electrode significantly affect electronic transport and ion migration. Considering the poor electrochemical performance and low structural stability, a novel MXene@PDDA/NiAl-LDHs hybrids as supercapacitor electrode via an electrostatic-assembled approach is elaborately designed. The alternate MXene and PDDA/NiAl-LDHs layers with 3D interconnected networks architectures could ensure intimate contact to efficiently take advantage of high electron conductivity of MXene and high pseudocapacitance activity of PDDA/NiAl-LDHs, thus effectively accelerating the ionic/electronic transport rates and improving the electrochemical storage of hybrid electrodes. As a consequence, as an electrode for supercapacitor, the MXene@PDDA/NiAl-LDHs exhibits a high specific capacitance of 1825.8 F g−1 at a current density of 1.0 A g−1, a remarkable synergetic effect, leading to a high rate capability after 100 cycles at different current densities and long cycling stability with only 0.9% degradation after 5000 cycles at 5.0 A g−1. This work provides a strategy for 2D layered materials to design electrodes with excellent electrochemical performance in the field of energy storage.
