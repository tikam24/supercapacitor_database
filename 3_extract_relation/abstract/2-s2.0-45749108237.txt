3-D ordered macroporous carbon having wall composed of mesosized pores was prepared by colloidal crystal templating method. Colloidal crystals consisting of monodisperse polystyrene (PS) sphere (204 nm diameter) and silica particles (10-20 nm) were carbonized in Ar, and the silica was removed by etching in HF, and then porous carbon with bimodal porous structure was obtained. The specific surface area of the prepared carbon was 1003 m2 g-1, and the pore sizes of macropores and mesopores corresponded to the sizes of PS and silica particles, respectively. The electrochemical properties of the carbon were investigated as an electrode material for electric double layer capacitor in organic electrolytes. Specific double-layer capacitance of the prepared carbon in propylene carbonate containing 1 mol dm-3 (C 2H5)4NBF4 was 94 F g-1 and showed relatively good rate capability. copyright The Electrochemical Society.
