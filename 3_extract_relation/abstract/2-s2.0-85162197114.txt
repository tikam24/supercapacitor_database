Porous carbon has attracted enormous attentions as electrode materials for supercapacitor due to its sufficient porosity and large specific surface area. In this paper, we reported a convenient approach for the preparation of activated porous carbon (APC) by one-step activation method using bacterial cellulose as carbon source and potassium gluconate as activator. The obtained porous carbon possesses a unique porous framework with suitable specific surface area and rich oxygen content. Benefiting from the unique structure, the obtained electrode shows a high specific capacitance of 437 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and excellent electrochemical stability. More interestingly, the constructed APC-700//APC-700 symmetrical supercapacitor exhibits a high energy density of 23.5 Wh kg−1 and good cycling stability in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. Therefore, the work provides a new and facile method to prepare porous carbon-based electrode materials from biomass for supercapacitor.
