Pure ZrO2, graphitic carbon nitride, Cu-doped ZrO2 nanoparticles (Cu–Zr), and doped Cu–Zr nanoparticles decorated on the g-C3N4 surface (g-CuZr nanohybrids) were successfully prepared by a hydrothermal technique. Synthesized catalysts were examined by XRD, FE-SEM, TEM, UV–Vis spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL), and BET surface measurements, respectively. The photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) photoreduction as well as energy storage supercapacitor applications were thoroughly investigated. The g-CuZr hybrid photocatalyst outperformed other pristine photocatalysts in terms of light absorption and catalytic Cr(VI) reduction performance under stimulated solar light irradiation. Furthermore, methylene blue (MB) was used as a photosensitizer to further improve the Cr(VI) photoreduction performance. In precise, the heterostructured hybrid catalyst exhibited improved photocatalytic Cr(VI) photoreduction activity (∼88.1%) in 5 mg/L MB solution over other catalysts. Moreover, the decoration of Cu–Zr on the surface of g-C3N4 enhanced the absorption ability of light and catalytic Cr(VI) photoreduction performance. The PL, EIS, and transient photocurrent analysis demonstrated that the efficiency of the charge carrier's separation in the nanohybrid catalyst was superior over other catalysts. Furthermore, heterostructured g-CuZr nanohybrid electrode exhibited superior specific capacitance (297.2 F/g) over other electrodes, which are 5.5 folds (54.01 F/g), ∼2 folds (144.01 F/g) better than pure ZrO2 and g-C3N4 electrodes. Likewise, the nanohybrid electrode retained about 90% of the capacitive value after 2500 cycles over its initial capacitance.
