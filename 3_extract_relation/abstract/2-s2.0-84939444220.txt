Wearable energy storage devices that can be used in the garment industry are strongly required to power E-textiles. In this article, polypyrrole (PPy) nanorods were deposited on cotton fabrics via in situ polymerization of pyrrole in the presence of the fibrillar complex of FeCl3 and methyl orange as a reactive self-degraded template. The obtained fabrics could be directly used as supercapacitor electrodes, with a maximum specific capacitance of 325 F g-1 and an energy density of 24.7 Wh kg-1 at a current density of 0.6 mA cm-2. The capacitance remained higher than 200 F g-1 after 500 cycles.
