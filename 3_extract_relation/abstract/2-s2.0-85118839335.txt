Research work is going on to develop advanced materials for electrodes of super capacitors (SCs) to overcome current power crises and to meet the future energy demands. Among power storage devices, SC are highly attractive to run portable devices. Performance of SCs depend strongly on electrode material, its morphology and fabrication methods. Generally, electrode material of SCs should be lightweight, efficient, cheap, and durable. Review articles on SCs electrode material, electrolytes and their applications are common. However, reviews on metal organic framework (MOF) as electrode material of SCs are very rare. Current mini review is a comprehensive document on metal organic framework (MOF) as electrode material for SCs.
