This research aims to determine the effect of KOH concentration on the electrochemical properties of activated carbon from raw fibers of oil palm empty fruit bunches (OPEFB) and the effect of platinum nanoparticles growth of stainless steel on a current collector electrode supercapacitor. Furthermore, varying KOH concentrations of 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 M were used to conduct that the chemical and physical activation processes using N2 and CO2 gas at 600°C and 700°C, respectively. Furthermore, platinum nanoparticles were grown on the surface stainless steel current electrode by using a simple wet chemical method to improve the performance of supercapacitors Therefore, to achieve, KOH concentration on the morphology, adsorption, and electrochemical properties of the obtained electrode were investigated. Furthermore, many spherical platinum shapes ranging from 20 to 100 nm were observed through FESEM, while the high specific surface area of the carbon electrodes was confirmed by using the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm at 77K. In addition, the surface areas of both carbon electrodes were measured at 395 and 373 m2 g-1 for KOH concentration using 0.9 M and 0.6 M, respectively. The results showed that the cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the modified supercapacitor electrode with platinum nanoparticles increased the specific capacitance with the highest value at 149.63 F g-1.
