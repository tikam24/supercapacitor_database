Persuing both high energy and power density in one supercapacitor at low cost is very challenging to date. Here, we report the fabrication of nitorgen and Sulphur co-doped graphene (GN) modified lignin/polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based carbon nanofiber (ACNFs) from mainly the biomass of lignin following a process of electrospinning, carbonization and activation. GN is used as nitrogen/sulphur immobilization agent to successfully capture HCN, NH3 and SO2 released from lignin and PAN during carbonization, and thus the content of heteroatoms of N and S in ACNFs is increased. The resulting ACNF with 0.30 wt% GN content possesses the maximum specific surface area of 2439 m2 g−1. It shows a typical three-dimensional porous network structures with the highest heteroatom doping content and high degree of crystallinity. The assembled supercapacitor exhibits superior electrochemical performance with ultra-high specific capacitance of 267.32 F g−1, low equivalent series resistance of 5.67 Ω, and outstanding cycling stability of 96.7% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles of charge/discharge in a two-electrode system with 6 mol L−1 KOH as electrolyte. Most importantly, the assembled symmetric supercapacitor shows that ACNFs doping with GNs increases the energy density from 4.12 to 9.28 Wh kg−1 and at the same time with barely reduced power density.
