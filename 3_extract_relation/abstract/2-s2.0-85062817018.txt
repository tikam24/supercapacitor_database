The unique synergistic effect of hierarchical core-shell structures demonstrates great potential for designing the next-generation electrode materials for supercapacitors. In this work, we design binder-free MnCo2O4@NiMoO4 heterostructure core-shell nanowire arrays (NWAs) grown over a current collector of nickel foam (NF) achieved through a modified and simple hydrothermal process. The capacitive performance of the core MnCo2O4 NWAs was remarkably improved by growing a layer of NiMoO4 nanosheets (1244 F g-1 at 1 A g-1), which is superior to the capacitance of pristine MnCo2O4 (457.85 F g-1 at 1 A g-1). Moreover, the prepared MnCo2O4@NiMoO4 core-shell NWAs have been used along with commercial activated carbon (AC) to fabricate an asymmetric full supercapacitor device. MnCo2O4@NiMoO4//AC delivers a high energy density (42 W h kg-1) at a power density of 852.3 W kg-1 and a good cyclability with 93% of the initial capacitance retained at the end of 8000 successive charge/discharge cycles. Therefore, the MnCo2O4@NiMoO4 electrode material holds a great promise as a suitable candidate for high performance supercapacitors.
