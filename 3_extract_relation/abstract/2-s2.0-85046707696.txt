not only to improve the PANI conductivity, but also relieve graphene oxide aggregation via a synergistic effect. We report an easy synthesis of a polyaniline/graphene oxide (PGO) composite with a relatively high specific capacitance by chemical oxidation polymerization. As the employ of phytic acid and increasing aniline monomer concentration, more and more PANI nanoparticles deposited into the interval between GO layers. PGO3 composite exhibits the largest specific capacitance (349 F·g-1) and PGO4 composite follows (314 F·g-1), whereas PGO has a minimal specific capacitance (206 F·g-1). The enhanced originates from the high capacitance of more PANI nanoparticles and better configuration as well as higher surface area of PGO3 and PGO4 composites for fast ion transport. The as-prepared PGO3 sheets composite with improved electrochemical performance is a promising electrode material for supercapacitor.
