The paper describes the intelligent autonomous power source designed for a long time maintenance-free operation in the adverse weather conditions. The power supply contains non-renewable and renewable energy sources including solar panels. The operation algorithm of the power supply microcontroller provides charging the accumulator and supercapacitor, connecting the necessary energy source to the regulation circuit of the output voltage and giving the information about the running performance and operation period prediction. The passivation phenomenon of lithium batteries and depassivation algorithms are considered.
