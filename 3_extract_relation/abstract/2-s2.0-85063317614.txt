In recent years, Co-based metal-organic framework have drawn increasing attention as electrochemical applications due to their facile preparation methods, adjustable sizes, tunable structures and high specific surface areas. However, deficiency like poor electrical conductivity of pristine Co-based metal-organic framework have limited their further application. Hence, their composites and derivatives possessing specific property have arouse many researchersâ€™ attention and been widely used in the fields of energy conversion and storage. Here, relevant synthetic processes, morphologies and electrochemical performances of cobalt-based metal-organic framework composites and their derivatives for applications in electrocatalysis, rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors are reviewed and summarized.
