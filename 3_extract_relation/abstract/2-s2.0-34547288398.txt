CoOx·yH2O porous films were electrodeposited successfully on graphite electrode with a high cathodic current density in 0.2 mol/L CoSO4+1.5 mol/L H2SO4 aqueous solution through H2 gas template. The micrographs of the CoOx·yH2O porous films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the capacitive properties of the CoOx·yH2O porous film/graphite electrode were investigated in 2 M KOH by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge method. The CoOx·yH2O porous film/graphite electrode exhibited a high electrochemical reversibility, high power characteristics and excellent charge-discharge property. A specific capacitance of 64.8 F·g-1 was obtained at a charge-discharge current density of 0.2 mA·cm-2 Only 9.1% loss of the specific capacitance was found after 1400 charge-discharge cycles, which demonstrates that the CoOx·yH2O porous film/graphite electrode has excellent long-term cycle stability.
