In this work, we report on the development of novel materials using a combination of known materials with diverse functionality for energy storage applications. We prepared graphene-inorganic 'hybrids' coupled with electrochemically synthesized manganese oxides on graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide platforms such that each component play a unique and critical function for high-performance. A range of complementary characterization tools reveal the surface morphology, local (lattice dynamical) and average structure, and local charge transfer due to adsorbed manganese oxides highlighting the surface structure and interfaces of hybrids. The electrochemical performance of the graphene-based hybrids as asymmetric supercapacitors is evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and impedance techniques exhibiting nearly rectangular cyclic voltammograms superimposed with redox peaks from manganese oxides with an average specific capacitance of > 550 Fg-1 and it was charged / discharged within seconds or < 1 minute. We also determined the electric-double layer or interfacial capacitance, charge transfer resistance and low frequency capacitance. The results demonstrate that this facile approach affords chemical adsorption thus expected to have synergistic coupling between the pseudocapacitive / supercapacitive components and displaying stable high-performance behavior attributed to reasonable density of tailored interfaces. Scanning electrochemical microscopy allowed mapping enhanced electrochemical activity/(re)activity of surface ion adsorption at solid/liquid interface.
