Redox active conjugated polymers have been received great research interest due to their potential applications in electrochromic devices and supercapacitors. In this work, three donor-acceptor (D-A) monomers (TPA-BY, TPAP-BY, TPAT-BY) consisting of single triphenylamine unit were synthesized and further deposited on ITO glass via electrochemical polymerization for electrochromic devices and supercapacitors. The obtained polymer films (PTPA-BY, PTPAP-BY, PTPAT-BY) exhibited reversible redox behavior and obvious color change upon voltage variation, especially the optical contrast of PTAP-BY reaching up to 81% at 720 nm. Moreover, the present novel conjugated polymers showed supercapacitor performance with areal specific capacitance among 2.2 ∼ 3.9 mF·cm−2 at a current density of 0.06 mA·cm−2, guaranteeing their potential application in energy saving smart windows.
