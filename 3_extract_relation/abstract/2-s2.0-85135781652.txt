This paper is concerned with the development of an energy management strategy for electric buses with hybrid energy storage. This is achieved through evaluating the use of batteries, supercapacitors, and their combination to provide energy for the electric bus. The energetic macroscopic representation formalism is used to develop the mathematical model, local control system, and simulation model of the electric bus. The paper shows that given a real-world bus route, the introduction of supercapacitors and an energy management strategy in the bus's powertrain leads to range extension and an increase in battery life. Furthermore, the paper shows that the electric bus can operate its real-world route only powered by supercapacitors which significantly reduces the charging time required for a battery-powered electric bus. The optimal charging points for the electric bus on the given bus route will be at the two end stations.
