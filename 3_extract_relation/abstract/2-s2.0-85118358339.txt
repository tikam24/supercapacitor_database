In the present study, our main aim is to show that the first synthesized metal-doped tea factory waste (TFW) catalyst can be used in both hydrogen production and supercapacitor application. In this context, TFW catalyst doped with copper (Cu) (TFW-Cu) was synthesized for methanolysis of NaBH4 and supercapacitor measurement. In the presence of four different parameters (metal type, metal amount, carbonization temperature, and carbonization time), methanolysis experiments of NaBH4 were performed and the catalyst with the maximum hydrogen production rate (HPR) was determined. As a result, it was determined that the 30% Cu-doped TFW (TFW-30%Cu) catalyst had a maximum HPR at a carbonization temperature of 300 °C and a carbonization time of 60 min compared to other substances. As a result of the methanolysis experiments performed in the presence of TFW-30%Cu catalyst, the maximum HPR and activation energy were determined as 9475 mL (min.g)−1 and 13.02 kJ mol−1, respectively. In supercapacitor application, the capacitance of the electrodes in the presence of TFW-30%Cu was calculated as 7–19.9 F.(g)−1. Thus, it is expected that the synthesized catalyst will make a promising contribution in both energy storage and energy production areas—especially for distributed generation systems operating in national networks.
