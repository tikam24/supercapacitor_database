This paper proposes a switching power converter that allows determining the ESR value for a supercapacitor. The model proposed intends to be one ofthe future methods for charging ofthe supercapacitor tacking into account the necessary charging conditions, constant current and maximum voltage across the capacitor. Also this model of converter propose by us can be used for other types ofsupercapacitors with different limiting values and parameters such as time of charging and maximum voltage across the capacitor.
