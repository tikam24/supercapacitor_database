Supercapacitors have been considered as one of the main energy storage devices. Recently, electrospun nanofibers have served as promising supercapacitor electrodes because of their high surface area, high porosity, flexibility, and resistance to aggregation. Here, we investigate the effects of electrospinning parameters and nickel precursors on the nanostructure of electrospun nickel oxide (NiO), as well as on their electrochemical performance as supercapacitor electrodes. In contrast to the case of using nickel nitrate, increasing the nickel acetate molar concentration maintains the flexible fibrous sheet morphology of the as-spun sample during the polycondensation and calcination of NiO. As a result, our flexible electrode of NiO nanofibers derived from nickel acetate (NiOA) exhibits much better electrochemical performance values than that of nickel nitrate-derived NiO. To further improve the electrochemical storage performance, we combined NiO-A nanofibers with single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as a hybrid electrode. In both half-cell and full-cell configurations, the hybrid electrode displayed a higher and steadier areal capacitance than the NiO-A nanofibers because of the synergetic effect between the NiO-A nanofibers and CNTs. Altogether, this work demonstrates the potency of the hybrid electrodes combined with the electrospun NiO-A nanofibers and CNTs for supercapacitor applications.
