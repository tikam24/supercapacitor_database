In order to study the effect of the large-scale solar energy system that can provide fast frequency support to the grid, this paper studies the modeling and frequency control strategies of the solar energy system. The paper firstly explains the working mechanism of the solar energy system consisting of photovoltaic cells and supercapacitor, and then sets up a detailed model of the charge/discharge processes of the solar energy system. Based on the detailed model, this paper compares the different frequency control strategies of the solar energy system and proposes a simplified model of the solar energy system for the power system transient stability analysis. The accuracy of the simplified model is validated through the comparison with the full model.
