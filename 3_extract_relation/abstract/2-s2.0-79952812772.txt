Mesoporous electrode materials were prepared directly from magnesium citrate. N2 adsorption shows that the specific surface area of the porous carbons prepared amounts to approximate 2 000 m2· g-1, and that mesopore size and volume increase with the rise of carbonization temperature. Typical meso-structured porous carbon can be prepared when carbonization temperature is higher than 800 °C. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that MgC-800 and MgC-900 possess good capacitive behavior. Compared to hard-templated OMC, MgC-800 and MgC-900 have lager specific capacitance within the applied current densities in this work, which can be ascribed to their large surface area and mesoporous structure that favors fast electrolyte diffusion in the pore channels.
