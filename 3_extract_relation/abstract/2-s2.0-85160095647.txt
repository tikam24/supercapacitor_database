Study and characterizations of NiCo2O4/rGO as candidate of supercapacitor electrodes material performance with co-precipitation method. The compositions such as NiO pure, Co2O pure and NiCo2O4/rGO using co-precipitation methods. The measurement that have been done for both samples were XRD (X-ray diffraction), SEM (Scanning electron microscopy), CV-Meter (Current Voltage-Meter) for analysis of microstructure and electrical properties. The results showed that all samples were having one phases. XRD results confirmed that the cyrstalline phase of NiCo2O4/rGO confirmed 2?=16.24°, 26.47°, 27.38°, 29.69°, 31.62°, 39.44°, 45.55°, 56.42°, 66.24°, 75.38°. SEM image of neat NiO, CoO, and NiCo2O4/rGO displays aggregates of an average between 1a µm with 20.000 times magnification. The conductivity decreased with addition rGO. In range 30000a Hz, conductivity of all samples is 7x10-4 S/cm, whereas the measured conductivities in all samples were around 2x10-4 S/cm to 9x10-4 S/cm. This conditions affect of the crystal defects on the bulk samples as the effect of Ni and Co2 ions subtitutions to graphene.
