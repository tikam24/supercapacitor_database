New forms of carbon nanomaterials for energy storage application are always at a focal point. This review is envisaged the soot derived-carbon nanoparticles (SCNs), which are relatively newer candidates for energy storage applications. These carbon nanoparticles are interlinked and highly ordered with the particle size of nearly 10-50 nm. Due to their nano size, high electrochemically accessible surface area, and excellent electrical conductivity they are used for energy storage applications. From the electrochemical aspect, SCNs offers fast charge-discharge electrode kinetics with desirable specific power in supercapacitor and high capacity at high current densities in the lithium ion battery. In addition, they can be utilized as conductive additives for activated carbon, nucleation and conductive support for redox additives. This review provides an elaborate account of the potential of SCNs as electrode materials with emphasis on physical and electrochemical properties which are important for energy storage systems, in particular, lithium ion batteries and supercapacitors.
