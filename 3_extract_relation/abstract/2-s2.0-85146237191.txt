The hierarchical porous activated carbon nanofiber has been prepared and characterized from the biomass based of lemongrass leave waste (LG). The preparation process used a simple technique through impregnation of ZnCl2 with low concentrations (0.5, 0.7 and 0.9) mol/L. These three concentrations were chosen to maximize the potential of LG to produce carbon nanoporous structures with high surface area. The preparation of activated carbon is performed by a one-step technique, including carbonization and physical activation at a temperature of 800 °C in N2/CO2 atmosphere. The three sample variations resulted in a very good amorphous structure according to the XRD pattern. The sample LG-0.7 has been known to have the best physical and electrochemical properties with an SSA reaching 1694 m2 g−1 with a carbon content of 90.38%. Uniquely, the LG-0.7 sample has a combined morphological appearance of hierarchical pores such as sponges and nanofiber pores. This combined pore strongly supports the electrochemical properties of the carbon electrode with 256 F g−1, a specific energy of 35.6 Wh kg−1 and a power density of 128.3 W kg−1 obtained using the GCD method. Electrochemical testing was carried out at a low potential of 0–1 V with a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 under the influence of an aqueous electrolyte of 1 M H2SO4. These results demonstrate the tremendous potential of lemongrass leaf waste as a raw material for the produce of porous carbon electrodes for high-performance supercapacitors.
