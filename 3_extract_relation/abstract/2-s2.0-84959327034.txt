Capacitors are ubiquitous in signal processing circuits. Dielectric capacitors based on metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) and metal-insulator-metal (MIM) designs are currently the industry standard for on-chip charge storage. By comparison, electric double-layer capacitors (EDLC), or supercapacitors, offer capacitances that are orders of magnitude higher than dielectric capacitors. In this paper we present some early work in fabricating solid-state, on-chip EDLC.
