Petal like MnO2 formed by self-assembly of nanosheets was prepared by controlling the temperature through a facile hydrothermal method, which has suitable size and pore structure. The influence of different hydrothermal temperature on the morphology and performance of the material were also investigated. The prepared nanoflower-like MnO2 was used as supercapacitor electrodes and their electrochemical performance was tested. The results showed that nanoflower like MnO2 prepared at hydrothermal temperature of 60â„ƒ had excellent electrochemical performance in 6 mol/L KOH electrolyte. It showed a high specific capacitance of 355.7 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g and a cycling stability of 95.5% capacitance retention after 1 000 cycles at 10 A/g.
