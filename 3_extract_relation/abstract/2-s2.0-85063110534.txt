The search for Earth-abundant and efficient electrode materials is significant for advanced supercapacitors. Here we introduce a facile strategy for one-step synthesis of Ni 0.85 Se nanowires via a composite alkali salt method. When used as an electrode material in supercapacitors, the as-prepared Ni 0.85 Se nanowires exhibit a high specific capacitance of 1354 F g −1 at a current density of 1 A g −1 , and still retain 671 F g −1 at 30 A g −1 . The superior electrochemical performance of the Ni 0.85 Se electrode can be attributed to the metallic conductivity of nickel selenides and fast electrical transport along the axial direction due to the nanowire morphology. For practical applications, an asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled by using Ni 0.85 Se and activated carbon, which delivered a high energy density of 40.7 W h kg −1 at a power density of 800 W kg −1 and 12.1 W h kg −1 at 16 kW kg −1 . Moreover, the device retained 92.4% specific capacitance after 20 000 cycles at a high current density of 5 A g −1 , showing its promising application prospects.
