Pure SnO and Mn doped SnO (Mn:SnO) nanoparticles have been successfully prepared by simplest route of the hydrothermal method. Prepared nanoparticles have been characterized by various analyses to understand structural, optical, morphological, elemental composition, Photoluminescence and electrochemical behaviours. The powder X-ray diffraction pattern analysis confirms the formation of crystalline nature of pure and Mn:SnO and its tetragonal structure. Functional group and elemental composition of prepared nanoparticles are confirmed using FTIR and EDX. The electrochemical performances of the prepared materials as working electrodes are analyzed by electrochemical workstation, analyzed parameters such as cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge. From this study, maximum specific capacitance (Csp) is 246.5 F g − 1 at 5 mA cm−2 is obtained. The optical energy band gap is found to be 3.17 and 2.61 eV for SnO and Mn:SnO nanoparticles, respectively.
