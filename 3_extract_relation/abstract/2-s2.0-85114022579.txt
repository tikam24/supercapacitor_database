In this study, a thin and flexible planar supercapacitor (PSC) was fabricated by coating polyaniline (PANI) on a screen-printed carbon electrode. Carbon ink was coated onto the flexible polyethylene terephthalate using a screen-printing method; sub-sequently, a thin film of PANI was coated onto the carbon surface using a dilute polymerization method. A thin flexible PANI electrode in an interdigitated structure was assembled with a polymer gel electrolyte that resulted in planar-shaped su-percapacitor (PSC) devices. The as-obtained PANI/PSC was very thin and flexible, exhibiting a high areal capacitance of 409 µF/cm was obtained at a rate of 10 mV/s. This capacitance retains 46% of its original value at 500 mV/s. The flexible PANI/PSC exhibited an excellent capacitance retention of 82% even under bent states of 180° and 100 repetitive bent cycles.
