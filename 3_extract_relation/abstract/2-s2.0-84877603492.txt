This paper focuses on the use of model and simulation one of renewable energy. In this paper the results of simulation models by Matlab-Simulink for an urban-metro railcar and some newer methods for reducing the need value of capacitance for energy storage in cooperation by a Li-ion battery are presented. In this research was been investigated the Li-ion battery and the supercapacitor as hybrid energy storing device for the same task and its effectivness under operation of a suitable energy control system. The available decreasing ratio of the needed energy storage at case SCAP is 25 % to 40 % with this improved energy control method, which are significant values as decreasing in volume, mass and price. Mass reduction of our hybrid storage system is significant, about 60%.
