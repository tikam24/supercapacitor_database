This paper is presented in regard to the interesting continuous interest attributed to photovoltaic energy systems (PESs). To this aim, a study of an isolated photovoltaic system with hybrid storage (HS) is presented. Supercapacitors (SCs) are typically used because of their high specific power density.. Combining batteries and supercapacitors is a solution to maximize their benefits. In this work, the HS is a combinaison of batteries and supercapacitors. The goal of this work is to build a new management algorithm. This aforementioned technique will ensure the control of energy flow between system power sources. Furthermore, it will regulate the charge/discharge cycles of the proposed HS by maintaining their state of charge (SOC) between a desired minimum and maximum values. The proposed method is simple, efficient and it is not computationally heavy. The obtained simulation results are satisfactory and show the interest and effectiveness of the proposed management strategy.
