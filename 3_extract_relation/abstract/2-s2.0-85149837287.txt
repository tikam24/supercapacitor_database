Polyaniline (PANI) is one of the most utilized conducting polymers for energy storage applications due to its ease of processing, flexibility, environmental friendliness and high theoretical pseudocapacitance. However, the major limitation to the use of the PANI material for energy storage and conversion purposes has been its poor cyclability and poor capacity retention, which normally results during the chargeâ€“discharge process of the electrode. The introduction of dopants and reinforcing materials are valid ways of solving these challenges. This review study focusses on PANI and its composites as energy storage materials, and the work done so far to improve their mechanical, thermal and electrochemical performance. Emphasis will be given on PANI-carbon composite, PANI-acid-doped and other nanocomposites of PANI with carbon materials and metal compounds. The review also includes the effects of concentration and processing techniques on the properties and performance of the PANI composite supercapacitor electrodes. Finally, the authors end the review with advances in the performance of PANI composites as energy storage material, challenges and recommendations for future improvement.
