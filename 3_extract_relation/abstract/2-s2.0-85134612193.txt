We have fabricated a flexible fibre supercapacitor having twisted architecture incorporating synthesized carbonaceous electrode materials from widely available inexpensive biomass (banana peel) for energy storage which can be utilized for powering emerging wearable electronic textiles and devices. Activated carbon and few-layer graphene were synthesized by carbonizing KOH impregnated and ethanol/acetone washed banana peels, respectively, at high temperature under inert atmosphere. The synthesized carbonaceous electrode materials along with TiO2 nanopowder were deposited on conductive carbon fibre followed by dip coating with gel electrolyte and twisting to develop the supercapacitor. The fabricated fibre supercapacitor demonstrated high specific capacitance of 15.45 F/g and volumetric capacitance of 1.77 F/cm3 at 10 mV/s scan rate. The developed supercapacitor retained ~92% of capacitance upon bending. The fibre supercapacitor can be fabricated on large scale using simple methods and inexpensive biomass for powering wearable electronic applications.
