Sulfur doped three-dimensional porous carbon materials with specific surface area as high as 2277.79 m2 g-1 are prepared by the carbonization of KOH-pretreated egg yolks and employed as electrode materials for supercapacitor application. The material carbonized at 800Â°C exhibits maximum specific capacitance of 287.66 F g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1 and still retains a capacitance of 220.37 F g-1 at the high current density of 20 A g-1. This material also shows excellent capacity retention of 97.7% after 2000 cycles at a current density of 2 A g-1. These results indicate that the surface area, pore volume and heteroatom doping could combine together to affect the electrocapacitive performances of the obtained materials as electrodes.
