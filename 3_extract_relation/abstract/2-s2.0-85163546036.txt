Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have gains particular consideration as electrode material in supercapacitors owing to their porous nature, tunable structure, and occurrence of many active sites. However, some pristine MOFs' poor electrical conductivity and stability confine their potential application in supercapacitors. In this work, a new type of Nickel-MOF-based tin sulfide composite (Ni-MOF/SnS) is prepared using the simple hydrothermal route and studied its applicability in supercapacitors. The physicochemical characterizations of the as-prepared Ni-MOF/SnS composite confirm the perfect synthesis and formation of porous 3Dimensional (3D) flower-like SnS particles anchored Ni-MOF hexagonal rods-like morphology. The existing porous structure and SnS particles in the Ni-MOF/SnS composite deliver many active sites to perform the electrochemical reactions, achieving an excellent specific capacity value of 1440 C/g at 1 A/g. Also, Ni-MOF/SnS composite electrode maintains 95 % of its specific capacity value up to 8000 charge-discharge cycles at 3 A/g. Furthermore, the as-fabricated Ni-MOF/SnS//Activated carbon asymmetric device delivers the specific capacity of 228 F/g at 1 A/g, revealing a high energy and power density of 81.06 Wh/kg and 1823.8 W/kg, respectively. These findings demonstrate that the Ni-MOF/SnS composite represents a suitable electrode material for the next generation of supercapacitors.
