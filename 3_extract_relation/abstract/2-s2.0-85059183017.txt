Due to slow response of conventional micro gas turbine(MGT) generator system, pulse power load(PPL) will cause large voltage sags and overshoot of direct current(DC) bus voltage, and even lead to instability. In this paper, super capacitor(SC) energy storage system(ESS) is applied to MGT to form a hybrid power generation system. Then the two cooperative control methods of hybrid generation system are proposed. One is the PI-based control algorithm, and the other is the fast power coordinated control method through MGT output power forecast. The fast power dynamic response of SC ESS can compensate for low dynamic response of MGT, which makes the hybrid generation system in equilibrium state of transient power in real time. Voltage of DC bus is smooth, and adaptability of MGT to PPL is enhanced. The second control algorithm is proposed according to power output characteristics of MGT, and has the advantages of fast and balanced power distribution. The algorithm of fast charging and exiting of SC ESS is proposed based on load conditions, and the charging process will not cause any impact. Finally, simulation model is established to verify the effectiveness of the two control algorithms, and the results are compared.
