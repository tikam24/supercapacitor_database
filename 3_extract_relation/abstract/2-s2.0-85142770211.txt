Carbon/graphene quantum dots are 0D fluorescent carbon materials with sizes ranging from 2 nm to around 50 nm, with some attractive properties and diverse applications. Different synthesis routes, bandgap variation, higher stability, low toxicity with tunable emission, and the variation of physical and chemical properties with change in size have drawn immense attention to its potential application in different optoelectronics-based materials, especially advanced light-emitting diodes and energy storage devices. WLEDs are a strong candidate for the future of solid-state lighting due to their higher luminance and luminous efficiency. High-performance batteries play an important part in terms of energy saving and storage. In this review article, the authors provide a comparative analysis of recent and ongoing advances in synthesis (top-down and bottom-up), properties, and wide applications in different kinds of next-generation light-emitting diodes such as WLEDs, and energy storage devices such as batteries (Li-B, Na-B) and supercapacitors. Furthermore, they discuss the potential applications and progress of carbon dots in battery applications such as electrode materials. The authors also summarise the developmental stages and challenges in the existing field, the state-of-the-art of carbon/graphene quantum dots, and the potential and possible solutions for the same.
