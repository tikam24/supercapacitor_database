High-performance ternary cobalt-based metal oxides, especially ZnCo2O4, have attracted increasing attention as promising electrode materials for supercapacitors. However, there are still great challenges for the as-reported ZnCo2O4 materials, such as self-aggregation during repeated discharging-charging process and low packing density. To tackle the above issues, it is envisaged as an efficient strategy to combine the advantages of both hierarchical porous micro/nanostructures and self-supporting electrode to fabricate a free-standing hierarchical micro/nanostructured ZnCo2O4 electrode. Herein we propose an efficient and simple synthetic strategy for the controllable synthesis of self-supporting hierarchical porous cactus-like ZnCo2O4 material directly grown on Ni-foam using a facile hydrothermal method with post-calcination treatment. Furthermore, a growth mechanism is also proposed. The as-prepared cactus-like ZnCo2O4 material possesses unique structural merits, such as hierarchical porous structures, large specific surface area, robust structural stability, and strong connections between the substrate and the ZnCo2O4 active material. The unique cactus-like ZnCo2O4 film electrode displayed excellent electrochemical performance, including a high specific capacity of 1115.7 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and remarkable long cycle stability with 80.8% capacity retention after 30,000 cycles. A practical asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device was assembled using cactus-like ZnCo2O4 and active carbon, which showed an excellent energy density of 35.4 Wh kg−1 at high power density of 160.1 W kg−1 and superior cycle stability (62.5% capacity retention after 30,000 cycles at 1 A g−1). All these results show that such hierarchical porous ZnCo2O4 micro/nanostructured films are a promising candidate for high-performance supercapacitors for energy storage application.
