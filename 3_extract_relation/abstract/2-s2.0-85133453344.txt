Ordered polymerization of polyaniline (PANI) on porous carbon (PC) was achieved using cyclodextrin polymer (CDP)-functionalization (CDP/PC) on PC. PANI can be polymerized on PC surface through host–guest interactions between aniline monomers and the CDP to form the CDP-PANI/PC composite. CD modification induced the ordered polymerization of aniline monomers. So CDP-PANI/PC exhibited remarkable specific capacitance (739.2 F·g−1 at 1 A·g−1) and high rate capability (516 F·g−1 at 10 A·g−1, retaining 69.8% of its original capacitance) in a three-electrode system. A symmetrical supercapacitor device assembled from CDP-PANI/PC electrodes retained over 81 % of its initial capacitance after 5000 cycles at 5 A·g−1.
