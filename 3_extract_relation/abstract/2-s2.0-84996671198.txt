Simple hydrothermal method was adopted to synthesize zero dimensional 14-facets (6 squares and 8 cuboids) NiCo2S4 cubohexa-octahedral (NCS-COH) shaped nanostructures for high performance supercapacitor properties. The as-prepared nanostructures were characterized using X-ray powder diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. A plausible formation mechanism was also proposed along with crystal structure of NCS-COH. The exceptional architectures fashioned an ultrafast electron transfer during electrochemical reaction. The NCS-COH electrode exhibited a high specific capacitance of 835 at 1 A/g and capacitance retention of 92.7% at 10 A/g after 5000 cycles.
