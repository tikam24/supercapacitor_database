In recent years, extensive investigations have focused on the study and improvement of supercapacitor electrode materials. The electric devices produced with these materials are used to store energy over time periods ranging from seconds to several days. The main factor that determines the energy storage period of a supercapacitor is its self-discharge rate, i.e., the gradual decrease in electric potential that occurs when the supercapacitor terminals are not connected to either a charging circuit or electric load. Self-discharge is attenuated at lower temperatures, resulting in an increased energy storage period. This paper addresses the temperature-dependence of self-discharge via a systematic study of supercapacitors with nominal capacitances of 1.0 and 10.0 F at DC potentials of 5.5 and 2.7 V, respectively. The specific capacitances, internal resistances, and self-discharge characteristics of commercial activated carbon electrode supercapacitors were investigated. Using cyclic voltammetry, the specific capacitances were determined to be 44.4 and 66.7 Fgâˆ’1 for distinct carbon electrode supercapacitors. The self-discharge characteristics were investigated at both room temperature and close to the freezing point. The internal resistances of the supercapacitors were calculated using the discharge curves at room temperature. The microstructures of the electrode materials were determined using scanning electron microscopy.
