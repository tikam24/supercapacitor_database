In this work, we reported an asymmetric supercapacitor in which active carbon (AC) was used as a positive electrode and carbon-coated LiTi2(PO4)3 as a negative electrode in 1 M Li2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. The LiTi2(PO4)3/AC hybrid supercapacitor showed a sloping voltage profile from 0.3 to 1.5 V, at an average voltage near 0.9 V, and delivered a capacity of 30 mAh g-1 and an energy density of 27 Wh kg-1 based on the total weight of the active electrode materials. It exhibited a desirable profile and maintained over 85% of its initial energy density after 1000 cycles. The hybrid supercapacitor also exhibited an excellent rate capability, even at a power density of 1000 W kg-1, it had a specific energy 15 Wh kg-1 compared with 24 Wh kg-1 at the power density about 200 W kg-1.
