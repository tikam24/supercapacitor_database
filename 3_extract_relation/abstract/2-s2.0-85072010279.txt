The paper describes the design of a 100-kW three-phase interleaved DC/DC power converter for a hybrid energy storage system based on lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors. A description of the design and technical solutions of the converter is presented. The design has a minimum length of the connections between elements for lower bulk inductances. The converter uses the SEMIKRON SKiiP IGBT power module with liquid cooling. The control circuit of the converter is shown. The converter operates in buck and boost modes. The results of the simulation of device operation modes are given. The three-phase control scheme allows reducing input current ripple and obtaining the required power.
