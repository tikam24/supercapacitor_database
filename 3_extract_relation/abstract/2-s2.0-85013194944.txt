The feasibility of perovskite-type La0.8Na0.2Fe0.8Mn0.2O3 for structural, electrical, and electrochemical property for high rate capability in supercapacitor has been explored at room temperature. Nanocrystalline La0.8Na0.2Fe0.8Mn0.2O3 was prepared via a modified Pechini route. Structural and surface morphology was done by X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy, respectively. Optical band gap was evaluated to be ∼1.59 eV. The bulk conductivity of the electrode under study was found to be ∼4.54 × 10−7S cm−1. Specific surface area was found to be ∼8.16 m2 g−1. The electrode property has been studied via cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and charge-discharge analysis. The presence of a redox peak in cyclic voltammetry reveals typical pseudocapacitor behavior and recorded in the potential window −0.35 to 1 V. Faradic charge transfer resistance (Rct) was found to be ∼53.85 Ω (Rs = 2.03 Ω) from EIS, and the charge-discharge characteristic for a hundred cycles shows an initial capacity fading up to 25 cycles, beyond which it becomes stable at ∼6.2 Fg−1.
