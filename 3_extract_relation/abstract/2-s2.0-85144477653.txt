Heterostructures based on different materials can not only take full advantage of each material and overcome their limitations but also produce special effects for different applications. Here, a facile co-thermal decomposition strategy to engineer hierarchical 3D porous Ti3C2Tx/MoS2 heterostructure is presented for improved energy storage performance. The specific Ti3C2Tx/MoS2 heterostructure promotes the fast transportation of electrons and ions and fast redox reaction kinetics due to the 3D interconnected porous channels and thin exposed electroactive S-Mo-S edges. As a result, the 3D porous Ti3C2Tx/MoS2 heterostructure exhibits a specific capacitance of 439 F g-1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, a satisfactory capacitance of 169 F g-1 (about 30 % of initial capacitance) under an ultra-high scan rate of 10,000 mV s−1 and long cycle stability. Moreover, ultrahigh power energy of 30,000 W kg−1 with a high energy density of 6.3 Wh kg−1 with superior cyclic stability (91 % of initial capacitance after 10,000 cycles) has been achieved from the Ti3C2Tx/MoS2-based symmetric supercapacitor. This work provides an archetype for designing and preparing hierarchical 3D porous heterostructure electrodes for the next-generation supercapacitor with the high power density and rate performances.
