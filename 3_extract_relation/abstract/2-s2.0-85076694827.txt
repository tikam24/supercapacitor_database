Herein, we report bi-metal heterostructured cobalt-tin sulfides (h-CTS) via combination of layered structures of tin sulfides (TS) and cobalt sulfides (CS) by using selective ion layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. 2 dimensional (2D) h-CTS (SnS2@Co3S4) exhibits the highest specific capacitance of 1580 Fg−1 at 1 mVs−1 and retain outstanding and improved cyclic stability of 94.8% after 3000 cycles. Excellent capacitive performance of bi-layered h-CTS material via simple and effective binder-free method make it suitable candidate for next generation electronic system.
