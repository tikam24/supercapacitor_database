Polyaniline hollow microspheres were synthesized via self-assembly method in a poly (2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid) (PAMPS) aqueous solution. A comparison of TEM and SEM images found that uniform hollow microspheres can be obtained by controlling the dosage of PAMPS. The diameter and shell thickness of uniform hollow microspheres of polyaniline are approximately 410 nm and 72 nm, respectively. Meanwhile, the conductivity of these microspheres can achieve as high as 8.95 S/cm. A distinct improvement has been made in the controlling of the size and conductivity of uniform hollow microsphere of polyaniline. Hollow microspheres of polyaniline prepared via this method have promising applications in supercapacitor, electrodes, electrorheological materials and drug release, etc.
