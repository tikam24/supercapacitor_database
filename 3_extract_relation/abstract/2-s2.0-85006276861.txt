A novel three-dimensional (3D) structure of reduced graphene oxide/polyaniline (rGO/PANI) hybrid films has been demonstrated for high-performance supercapacitors. Steamed water in closed vessels with high pressure and moderately high temperature is applied to facilely construct this structure. The as-designed rGO/PANI hybrid films exhibit a highest gravimetric specific capacitance of 1182 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in the three-electrode test. The assembled symmetric device based on this structure shows both a high capacitance of 808 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and a high gravimetric energy density (28.06 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 0.25 kW kg−1). Above all, this novel 3D structure constructed by steamed water regulation techniques shows excellent capacitance performance and holds a great promise for high-performance energy storage applications.
