Porous carbon (PC) derived from the petroleum pitch via the template-guidance coupled with activation methodology, possesses hierarchical pore structure in view of micropore and mesopore. As the electrode material for electrochemical double-layer capacitor, PC electrode not only possesses the good adaptability to aqueous and organic electrolytes, but also delivers the superior capacitive behavior with respect to capacitance and rate capability over those of counterparts (activation-derived carbon and commercial activated carbon). Furthermore, relatively high values of gravimetric and areal capacitances (247F g−1 and 2470 mF cm−2) can be guaranteed simultaneously for PC electrode even at the commercial-level mass loading of 10 mg cm−2, demonstrating the good compatibility to gravimetric and areal capacitances. The satisfactory capacitive storage behavior of PC is ascribed to the synergistic effect of hierarchical pore structure and extraordinary structural integrity. Besides, this work also presents a high value-added utilization strategy to prepare the high-performance porous carbon-based electrode material for capacitive energy storage.
