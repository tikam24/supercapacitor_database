A birnessite-type manganese oxide (MnO2) with a lamellar structure was synthesized by a one-step chemical precipitation progress, using Na2O2 not only as the oxidizing reagent, but also as the source of the OH- ions. The prepared MnO2 was successfully employed as an active electrode material for a supercapacitor and displayed high specific capacitance, superior cycling performance and excellent rate capability. These results show that the prepared MnO2 nanostructure can be recognized as a promising candidate for supercapacitor applications.
