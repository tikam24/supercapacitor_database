Flexible energy storage devices play significant role in wearable and portable electronics. Herein, a cobalt-nickel phosphate (CoNiP2O7) composite was synthesized on conductive carbon nanotubes (CNTs) substrate by facile one-step electrochemical deposition method, forming a binder-free CoNiP2O7@CNTs positive electrode for microsupercapacitors (MSCs). Combined with a CNTs substrate on the opposite side of interdigitated electrodes, a CoNiP2O7@CNTs//CNTs hybrid MSC device was assembled. It displayed good electrochemical performance with a largest areal capacitance of 20.9 mF·cm−2 at 0.08 mA·cm−2 and an energy density of 2.9 μWh·cm−2. To construct a self-powered solar cell energy storage system, the proposed MSC device was utilized for energy storage and further provided power for red light-emitting diode (LED), forming natural energy collection-conversion-storage-utilization system. The results of this study offer a simple design route for flexible energy storage devices.
