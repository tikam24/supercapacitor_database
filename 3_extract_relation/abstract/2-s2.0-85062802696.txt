Considering the excellent electrical, optical and mechanical properties, ternary boron carbonitride (BCN) have attracted widespread attentions. Herein, we report an effective strategy for synthesis of nanoporous BCN. The morphology, structure and composition, as well as the electrochemical properties were systematically studied. It was found that the nanoporous BCN prepared at 800 Â°C showed the highest specific capacitance (475 F/g) and excellent cycle stability (97.7%) over 3000 cycles. This is mainly due to the larger specific surface area (506.9 m 2 /g) of the product, which can provide more contact area and active site between the electrode material and electrolyte. Compared with pseudocapacitor, the electrode material has better cycle stability and potential application in supercapacitor, which is the typical electric double layer capacitor.
