The demand for better “true performance” of supercapacitors, which is defined as the energy density based on the packaged cell with high active mass loading, is spurred by the ever-increasing energy storage market. The true performance of present supercapacitors is unsatisfactory, greatly limited by the currently used current collectors. Here, we develop a through-pore structured nickel current collector with excellent flexibility by electrodepositing nickel on laser-drilled stainless steel sheets filled with epoxy resin. Based on the new current collector, the electrodes possess higher performance than those fabricated by employing conventional current collectors. At a high active mass loading, the assembled supercapacitors show superior flexibility and high energy densities of 50.4 W hr L−1 and 30.1 W hr kg−1, respectively, based on the packaged cell, outperforming the present supercapacitors. Our strategy provides a new opportunity for promoting the further development of supercapacitors by enhancing the true performance. Materials Science; Energy Materials; Porous Material
