In this article, we demonstrate the fabrication of binder-free nanostructured Ni(OH)2 electrode for supercapacitor by the chemical bath deposition method in addition to modeling of cyclic voltammetry using artificial neural network. The prepared material acted as binder-free electrode that facilitated increase in the capacitance value. The electrochemical study demonstrated the maximum specific capacitance of 958 F·g−1. Further, cyclic behavior of the prepared material was investigated by modeling via artificial neural network, which is based on the multilayer perception concept. It is observed that results obtained from artificial neural network analysis is analogous to the experimental value with an error rate of 0.14%.
