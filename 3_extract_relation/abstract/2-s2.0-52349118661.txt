The use of Fuel Cells as main source of energy is being extended to automobile applications, due to their good performance. However, Fuel Cells cannot fulfil with strong load requirements produced during the vehicle operation. So, a secondary energy source must be used in order to provide fast changes in the current load, and to store the reverse current generated by the load, if regenerative braking is intended. This work compares two different electric power distribution architectures which share a double objective. On the one hand, the regenerative energy produced during the brake has to be stored and on the other hand, the DC Bus voltage that is applied to the electric engine, in order to move the vehicle wheels, has to be controlled and regulated. The difference between the two studied architectures is related to the secondary source of energy used in order to fulfil the goals of the system. The secondary energy source can be either Batteries or Supercapacitors. As a result of the behaviour comparison of both architectures, the best application field for each one is determined, as well as their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, this paper analyzes the influence that the kind of urban profile applied and the possibility of regenerative braking have over the whole system. Â©2008 IEEE.
