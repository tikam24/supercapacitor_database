Coal-based activated carbon (CBAC) is prepared from lignite as raw material by the potassium-catalyzed steam activation method. The effect of various process variables like activation temperature, activation time, immersion time and the mass ratio of activator to coal on the electrochemical performance are optimized according to the Box–Behnken design and analyzed using response surface methodology (RSM). The optimization synthesis of CBAC is determined by the conditions of the activation temperature of 758.0 °C, the immersion time of 23.9 h, the activation time of 1.9 h, the mass ratio of activator to coal as 5.1:1. The optimal product (CBAC-2) obtain by the above procedure displays a high specific surface area (2380.4 m2 g−1) and a large pore volume (1.1 cm3 g−1). The supercapacitor of CBAC-2 presents a high specific capacitance of 374.1 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and excellent capacity retention of 93.3 % after 10,000 cycles at 10 A g−1 in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. Therefore, the developed RSM is accurate and precise for regulating the pore size distribution of CBAC. The optimal synthesis of supercapacitor electrodes with the extract from lignite can expand our horizons for utilising low-rank coal.
