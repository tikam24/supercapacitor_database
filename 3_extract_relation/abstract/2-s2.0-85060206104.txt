The report provides a preliminary assessment of the charge storage prerogatives of MoS2-Graphene composite electrodes interfaced with a novel formulation of aqueous electrolyte. The aqueous alkaline electrolyte based on KOH consisted of ferromagnetic nanoparticle additives. This has been demonstrated to be a feasible approach for developing pseudocapacitor electrodes of high specific capacitance and rate capability. The electrodes exhibited a specific capacitance as high as 1556 Fg−1 as calculated from Cyclic Voltammetry curves with a cyclic stability of ∼94% at the end of 5000 charge–discharge cycles. This approach can be extended to different electrochemical systems based on electrode architecture as well as active materials. Moreover, various structural modifications like core/shell ferromagnetic nanoparticles can be used to improve the performance of selected electrode materials.
