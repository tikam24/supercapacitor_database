Energy storage systems based on supercapacitors have become attractive solutions for improving elevator efficiency. Electrical energy is stored while the elevator drive is running in generator mode and used when needed. The energy storage system can also be charged in standby mode and used to reduce power peaks during start-up. Therefore, the energy storage system should be appropriately sized, which is not trivial since elevator usage is stochastic in nature. In this paper, the effect of energy storage system size on the efficiency of regenerative energy reuse is analyzed based on a measurement study. Measurements were performed for one week on faculty elevators under real conditions. The data obtained from the measurements were analyzed, and the results of the analysis of energy consumption, elevator starts, and potential energy savings were presented for all three elevators and the group. The elevator energy storage system was emulated in MATLAB with and without energy consumption balancing which is used to reduce peak power. The efficiency of regenerative energy reuse is calculated for a wide range of energy storage sizes, both with and without energy consumption balancing, for all individual elevators and the group.
