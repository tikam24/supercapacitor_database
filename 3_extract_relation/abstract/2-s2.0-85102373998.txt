An eco-friendly and facile in-situ polymerization method was used to develop template free acid-etched graphitic carbon nitride (TGCN) nanosheets with optimized PANI nanofibers. PANI nanofibers grown on TGCN nanosheets offer large surface area, high porosity and unique charge transfer properties. The rapid agglomeration of TGCN nanosheets throughout electrochemical measurements lowers the specific capacitance due to its reduced shelf life which was overcome by the incorporation of a suitable polymer (PANI) as a spacer. Herein, We report the comparative electrochemical performance of TGCN/PANI nanocomposites as a function of morphology, composition, surface area and pore size study was obtained using X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) N2 adsorption-desorption. Herein, we prepared TGCN/PANI nanocomposites, which are also optimized to act as a highly efficient electrode nanocomposite for high-performance supercapacitor applications. The optimized TGCN/PANI (TCP50) nanocomposite showed a high specific capacitance of 298.31 F/g at a scan rate of 0.02 V s-1 and long cycling stability with low capacitance loss after 5000 cycles as well as low leakage current and self-discharge. At a power density of 400 W/kg, TCP50 electrode exhibits superior energy density of 33.57 Wh/kg.
