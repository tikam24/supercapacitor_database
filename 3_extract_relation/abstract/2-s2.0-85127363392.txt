In the present study, we report the liquid exfoliation method to prepare few-layer MoSe2 nanosheets for electrochemical energy storage application. As an electrode for supercapacitor MoSe2 nanosheets manifests specific capacitance of 15F/g at a constant current density of 0.1 Agâˆ’1 and retains the efficiency of 95% over the twelve cycles which is due to the sheet-like morphology that offers maximum electrolyte accessible surface area.
