A novel, efficient and cost-effective sandwich-like Ni(OH)2/MoS2 nanocomposites (NMCs) is designed and fabricated as an anode for supercapacitors, where a MoS2 nanoplate grows on the two sides of porous Ni(OH)2 nanosheets. The NMCs samples exhibited high electrochemical performance in aqueous electrolyte due to the synergistic effect between porous Ni(OH)2 nanosheets and MoS2 nanoplates. Compared with pure Ni(OH)2 and MoS2, the optimum NMC8 (the mass ratio of Ni(OH)2 and MoS2 is 8:1) electrode materials displays a 28.12% and 396.30% improved specific capacitance and enhanced long-cycle stability respectively for electrochemical energy storage. The optimum NMC8 shows high specific capacitance of 201 mA h g−1 at the scan rate of 5 mV s−1 and with 83.21% retention after 3000 charge-discharge cycles at a high current density of 20 A g−1, indicating a superior rate capability and outstanding properties. Moreover, the assembled NMC8//graphene asymmetric two-electrode device shows a high energy density of 57.27 W h kg−1 at the power density of 750 W kg−1.
