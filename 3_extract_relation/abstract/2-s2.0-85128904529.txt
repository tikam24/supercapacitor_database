Zn metal has shown promise as an anode material for grid-level energy storage, yet is challenged by dendritic growth and low Coulombic efficiency. Herein, an ultrafast, stable, and high-loading polymer anode for aqueous Zn-ion batteries and capacitors (ZIBs and ZICs) is developed by engineering both the electrode and electrolyte. The anode polymer is rationally prepared to have a suitable electronic structure and a large π-conjugated structure, whereas the electrolyte is manufactured based on the superiority of triflate anions over sulfate anions, as analyzed and confirmed via experiments and simulations. This dual engineering results in an optimal polymer anode with a low discharge potential, near-theoretical capacity, ultrahigh-loading capability (≈50 mg cm−2), ultrafast rate (100 A g−1), and ultralong lifespan (one million cycles). Its mechanism involves reversible Zn2+/proton co-storage at the carbonyl site. When the polymer anode is coupled with cathodes for both ZIB and ZIC applications, the devices demonstrate ultrahigh power densities and ultralong lifespans, far surpassing those of corresponding Zn-metal-based devices.
