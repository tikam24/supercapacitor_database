In recent years, the interest in photovoltaic supercapacitors has been increasing in order to develop self-powered sensors for a sustainable system. Hence, significant research efforts are needed to enhance the photoelectric and electrochemical performances of hybrid devices. Herein, we have studied the effect of the porosity of different counter electrodes on the performance of the hybrid photovoltaic supercapacitors. The photovoltaic supercapacitors were fabricated in one package with a simple structure including a titanium dioxide (TiO2) coated on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass as a working electrode and polyaniline (PANI)-based gel electrolyte. The performance of the hybrid device was studied with four different counter electrodes: a multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) porous electrode, PEDOT:PSS coated on FTO glass, carbon monolithic electrode, and a carbon-based conductive fabric. The specific capacitance of the device with PEDOT:PSS coated FTO electrode was 255 mF/g in the dark and increased to be 274 mF/g under the light based on the mass of the gel. The hybrid device can be charged when the working electrode is illuminated. The variation in the open circuit voltage (DV) was reached 256 mV in 400 s under illumination, and the voltage drop was 4 mV (âˆ’4%) in 600 s of the dark. The current results of the hybrid photovoltaic supercapacitor, with a simple fabrication process and basic structure, are boosting the study for the electrode materials selection to enhance the performance of the hybrid device.
