A study on high-efficient unique electroactive sources for energy storage applications required a grouping of working electrodes with larger specific surfaces region, higher porosities, mechanical robustness, and structural conduciveness to conductivities. This literature describes and presents the developments of innovative and advanced nanoarchitectures by using the design of hierarchical MnFe2Ce4 (MFC) nanoflakes adheres to MnNiCe4 (MNC) nanosheet composites was developed for the first time via simple fabrication methods. The growth hierarchical MFC-MNC robust construction enhances the more active sites improves in electrochemical activities, excellent porosity, and specific surface region, which supplies reasonable cycle pathways for active electrolytes diffusions and make easier electron transportations. As an obtained results, the as-developed Ni foam-based MFC-MNC sample electrode exhibits superior specific capacities of 231.5 mA h g−1 (2465.3 F g−1) at 1 A g−1, with superior rate capabilities of 221.3 mA h g−1 at 8 A g−1 and noteworthy long-term cycle stabilities along with 97.6% capacity retention over 4000 GCD cyclings in aqueous 3 M KOH electrolyte. Based on the above energy storage electrochemical results suggest it to be a very favored electroactive source in the synthesis of supercapacitors.
