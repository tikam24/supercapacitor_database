In this research, carbon materials with high specific surface areas and hierarchical porous structures were prepared to improve the charge storage capacity of the electrode. Electrospinning technology was used to combine the cobalt metal organic framework materials (ZIF-67) with polyacrylonitrile (PAN)/polymethacrylate (PMMA) for fabricating the composite nanofiber membranes. Then the cobalt-based hierarchical porous composite carbon materials were obtained by high-temperature carbonization, and their characterization of structure and electrochemical performance were carried out. The effects of ZIF-67 loading amounts on the structure and performance of the electrode materials were explored. The results showed that the composite carbon materials loaded ZIF-67 had higher specific surface areas and richer mesoporous structures than a single carbon material. When the loading of ZIF-67 relative to PMMA was 10%, the specific surface area was 259.814 m2/g, the proportion of mesopores was 68.8%, and the specific capacitance could reach 151 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g, which was 3 times of the PAN/PMMA carbon material without ZIF-67. Moreover, its specific capacitance retention rate reached 84.8% after 2 000 cycles.
