NiO, conductive polymers have many important applications in supercapacitor, lithium-ion batteries, H2 production with photocatalysis, chemical sensors, biosensors, electrochromic, environmental fields, and so on. Due to P-type semiconductors of NiO and polyaniline, the NiO/Polyaniline (PANi) would be a new nanocomposite with synergistic behaviors or complementary properties. Different morphologies of NiO were synthesized with hydrothermal method. NiO nanosheets arrays on glass substrate were obtained with optimized condition. And the NiO nanosheets arrays were immersed in the solution of aniline accompanying chemical oxidation reaction. The results indicated that a very thin layer of NiO, Ni(OH)2 nanosheets arrays with organic functional modification of polyaniline were formed on glass substrate due to acid etching effects. The results of XRD showed that the presence of NiO and Ni(OH)2 in prepared film were observed. The FTIR results also confirmed that this very thin film contained the components of polyaniline. This method is very simple, which would be used in many film electrodes for photocatalysis fields, supercapacitor, sensors, et al.
