As the fossil fuel consumption and energy shortage crisis worsen, it is urgent to develop multi-functional and cost-effective energy storage devices. However, the sluggish electrochemical kinetics of electrode materials is the major drawback which hinders their practical application. Herein, a heteroatom doped MnO2 carbon-based flexible electrode has been proposed derived from Ni2+ doping Î±-MnO2 by a facile hydrothermal strategy. Surprisingly, the as-prepared composite electrodes exhibit decent bi-functionally electrochemical performance both in lithium-ion batteries and aqueous supercapacitors. The superior performance of composite electrode is ascribed to high electrical conductivity, fast ionic diffusion rate, and the reduction of work function after the incorporation of Ni2+ ions based on the electrochemical kinetics analysis and density functional theory calculation. In summary, this work puts forward a facile strategy to construct high electrochemical performance electrode for lithium-ion batteries and aqueous supercapacitors.
