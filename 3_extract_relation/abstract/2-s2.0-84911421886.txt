This paper presents the electrical and thermal behaviour of an advanced lithium-ion capacitor (LIC) based rechargeable energy storage systems. In the proposed study, an extended statistical analysis has been performed to evaluate the main electrical parameters such as resistance, power, capacitance, rate capabilities, variation between cells and thermal parameters. Based on the performed analysis, an electrical model has been developed for dimensioning and evaluation of various applications based on lithium-ion capacitor technology.
