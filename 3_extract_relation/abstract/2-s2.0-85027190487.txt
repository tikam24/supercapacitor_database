This chapter focuses on the description of basic parameters and nanoscale phenomena determining the performance of electrochemical capacitors or supercapacitors. The chapter is mainly devoted to electrode materials but also introduces electrolytes and configurations of supercapacitor cells. Particular attention is drawn to electrochemical characterization methods and practical interpretation of electrochemical data. A major emphasis is put on the interaction between electrolyte and nanoporous carbons on charging and discharging supercapacitors as well as on textural and electronic properties determining capacitance values. Another focus area is the effect of nanosizing on enhancing the electrochemical response of pseudocapacitive materials.
