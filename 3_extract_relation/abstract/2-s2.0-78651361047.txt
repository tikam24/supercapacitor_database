The output power from renewable energy sources fluctuates because of weather variations. This paper proposes an effective power quality control strategy of renewable energy sources connected to power system using photovoltaic (PV) array and supercapacitor. A supercapacitor is connected to the DC bus of PV power generation system for power quality control of the grid-connected renewable energy sources. The results of a power-hardware-in-the- loop simulation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method. The system not only enhances the reliability of renewable energy systems, but also improves the availability of PV systems.
