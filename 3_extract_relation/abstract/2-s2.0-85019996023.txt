Spherical composite of Ni(OH)2/GO was produced via a surfactant free solvothermal technique and tested as electrode materials for electrochemical capacitors. The structural and morphological analysis confirmed that deposition of Ni(OH)2 onto GO does not change the crystal structure of pure hexagonal α-Ni(OH)2. Electrode fabricated from the Ni(OH)2/GO composite demonstrates a superior electrochemical performance when compared to that of pure Ni(OH)2, GO, and Mix-Ni(OH)2/GO electrodes with Ni(OH)2/GO electrode exhibiting a specific capacity of ∼420 mA h g−1 which correspond to a specific capacitance of 3619 F g−1 at 2.5 A g−1, as well as a corresponding rate capability of 78% at 10 A g−1. The stability study of the Ni(OH)2/GO composite reveals a good capacity retention of ∼95% at a current density of 10 A g−1 after 3000 charge-discharge cycles.
