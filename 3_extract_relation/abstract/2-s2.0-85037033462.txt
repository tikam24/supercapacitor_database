The paper presents the properties of selected energy stores and the reasons for the progressively increasing popularity of supercapacitors. The selected method of supercapacitor modelling was characterized. The example of determining the parameters of a model based on the measurements was made. The results of simulation of pedestrian lighting system powered by photovoltaic module cooperating with supercapacitors was presented.
