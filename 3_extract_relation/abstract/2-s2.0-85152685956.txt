Ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs) are promising materials for cathode materials of a Zn ion hybrid capacitor (Zn HC) due to their high surface area and interconnected porous structure. Graphitization of the framework and nitrogen doping have been used to improve the energy storage performance of the OMCs by enhancing electrical conductivity, pseudocapacitive reaction sites, and surface affinity toward aqueous electrolytes. Thus, when both methods are simultaneously implemented to the OMCs, the Zn HC would have improved energy storage performance. Herein, we introduce a facile synthetic method for N-doped mesoporous graphitic carbon (N-mgc) by utilizing polystyrene-block-poly(2-vinlypyridine) copolymer (PS-b-P2VP) as both soft-template and carbon/nitrogen sources. Co-assembly of PS-b-P2VP with Ni precursors for graphitization formed a mesostructured composite, which was converted to N-doped graphitic carbon through catalytic pyrolysis. After selective removal of Ni, N-mgc was prepared. The obtained N-mgc exhibited interconnected mesoporous structure with high nitrogen content and high surface area. When N-mgc was employed as a cathode material in Zn ion HC, excellent energy storage performance was achieved: a high specific capacitance (43 F/g at 0.2 A/g), a high energy density of 19.4 Wh/kg at a power density of 180 W/kg, and reliable cycle stability (>3000 cycles).
