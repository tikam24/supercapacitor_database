Metalâ€“organic frameworks (MOFs) possess the advantages of tailorable porosity, adjustable composition, and tunable topologies and are considered promising precursors and self-templates for the synthesis of complex nanostructures as advanced electrode materials for energy storage. Among various strategies, wet-chemical method endows better control over topological evolution and compositional transformation of MOF crystals. Herein, the authors comprehensively review the recent achievements on wet-chemical derivation of MOF via etching, ion-exchange, hydrolysis, and chemical transformation, underscore the corresponding mechanisms, and highlight their important applications in supercapacitors and secondary batteries.
