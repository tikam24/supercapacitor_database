Constructing electrode materials with high energy densities are the effective way to develop asymmetric supercapacitor devices. Therefore, the inlay of conductive materials into pseudocapacitive constituents is a practical approach to increase the performance of supercapacitor electrodes. Herein, we declare a facile one-step as an economic strategy for tailoring carbon spheres (CSs) impregnated by CoFe2O4 to form a CoFe2O4@CSs composite. The CoFe2O4@CSs composite was fully characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which evidenced that CoFe2O4 nanoparticles were densely cored inside the carbon spheres. Moreover, the electrochemical characterization of the CoFe2O4@CSs composite was manifested high specific capacitance of (600 F/g) at a current density (1 A/g), high performance rate, and cycling stability. CoFe2O4@CSs has achieved capacitance retention of 94.1 % after 5000 charge/discharge cycles at a current density of 20 mA/g. The device-based asymmetric supercapacitors were found to improve the energy density to 27.08 Wh/kg at a power density of 750 W/kg with 99 % capacitance retention, which is higher than the values previously reported. The exceptional performance of CoFe2O4@CSs composites gives high priority for such materials in variant electrochemical fields, owing to the harmony between CoFe2O4 nanoparticles and carbon spheres.
