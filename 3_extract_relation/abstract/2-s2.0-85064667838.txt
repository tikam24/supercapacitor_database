Although transition metal sulfides have gotten extensive attention due to their high electrical conductivity, fast charge transfer kinetics, outstanding mechanical stability, the performances of them applied separately to supercapacitors are not satisfactory, and one solution is to hybridize with other metal sulfide materials. Therefore, in the study, the flower-like structure Cu-Mn bimetallic sulfide on Ni-foam (CuS/MnS@NF)was firstly synthesized by a hierarchical two-step solvothermal reaction to our knowledge, which was directly utilized as electrodes without binders or conductive agents. The CuS/MnS@NF electrode possesses flower-like morphology, superior electrical conductivity, and there are the synergistic effect and intense interaction between CuS and MnS. They can display higher specific capacitance of 1517.07 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and excellent cyclic stability with specific capacity retention of 115.6% at 10 A g−1 after 3000 cycles, which is more admirable than their individual metal sulfide electrodes (CuS@NF and MnS@NF)and other recently reported metal-based electrodes. In short, the CuS/MnS@NF electrodes are promising candidate when used in battery-type supercapacitors.
