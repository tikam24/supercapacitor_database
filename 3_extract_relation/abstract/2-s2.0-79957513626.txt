Nickel-manganese oxides/multiwalled carbon nanotubes/poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (NMO/MWCNTs/PEDOT) nanocomposite was prepared by in chemical oxidation method and served as electrode material in supercapacitor. Binary nanocomposites of NMO/MWCNTs and pure MWCNTs electrodes were also prepared for comparative purpose, their physical and electrochemical performances were investigated. Well encapsulation of NMO nanoparticles inside cavities of MWCNTs and uniform coating of NMO/MWCNTs with PEDOT were observed with Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDAX). The electrochemical properties were determined by Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and Charge-discharge (CD) tests in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolytes. The Specific Capacitance (SC) value of the NMO/MWCNTs/PEDOT was significantly resulted larger than NMO/MWCNTs and Pure MWCNTs. Â© 2011 Asian Network for Scientific Information.
