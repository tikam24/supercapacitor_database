Ternary layered double-hydroxide-based active compounds are regarded as ideal electrode materials for supercapacitors because of their unique structural characteristics and excellent electrochemical properties. Herein, an NiCeCo-layered double hydroxide with a core-shell structure grown on copper bromide nanowire arrays (CuBr2@NCC-LDH/CF) has been synthesized through a hydrothermal strategy and calcination process and utilized to fabricate a binder-free electrode. Due to the unique top-tangled structure and the complex assembly of different active components, the prepared hierarchical CuBr2@NCC-LDH/CF binder-free electrode exhibits an outstanding electrochemical performance, including a remarkable areal capacitance of 5460 mF cm-2at 2 mA cm-2and a capacitance retention of 88% at 50 mA cm-2as well as a low internal resistance of 0.163 Ï‰. Moreover, an all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) installed with CuBr2@NCC-LDH/CF and activated carbon electrodes shows a high energy density of 118 Wh kg-1at a power density of 1013 W kg-1. Three assembled ASCs connected in series can operate a multifunctional display for over three and a half hours. Therefore, this innovative work provides new inspiration for the preparation of electrode materials for supercapacitors.
