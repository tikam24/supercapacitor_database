Herein, we have prepared reduced graphene oxide-multi-walled carbon nanotubes-RuO2 (RGO-MWCNT-RuO2) for supercapacitor applications. For reaching to this purpose, graphene oxide (GO) was reduced with the help of NaBH4 and MWCNT was added to it. Then, RuO2 nanoparticles were decorated on the surfaces of RGO-MWCNT. Different techniques such as field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) have been used to characterize the as-prepared sample. Electrochemical performance of the electrodes was studied in 1 M H2SO4 with different electrochemical techniques such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), charge–discharge (CD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). RGO-MWCNT-RuO2 electrode showed high specific capacitance of 1846.3 F g−1 at 10 mV s−1. Meanwhile, this electrode exhibits excellent long cycle life of 98.3% initial specific capacitance retained after 500 cycles of charge–discharge at 100 A g−1. These excellent properties make this nanocomposite as a good candidate for supercapacitor electrodes.
