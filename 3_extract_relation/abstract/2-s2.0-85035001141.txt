State of charge (SOC) estimation of hybrid supercapacitor is very important for large-scale energy storage application. The paper proposed a SOC estimation method based on dynamic capacitance correction. Firstly, a set of charging and discharging tests under different working conditions were designed and carried out for supercapacitor characterization. Secondly, real-time electromotive force (EMF) and dynamic capacitance of supercapacitor were identified. Thirdly, the prediction model of dynamic capacitance correction factor under full working conditions were built to correct the error of SOC estimation caused by EMF uniformization and charge redistribution. Through random variable discharging current experiment, the estimation result was proved to be effective.
