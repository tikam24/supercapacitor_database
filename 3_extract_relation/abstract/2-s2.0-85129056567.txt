The mismatch of capacity and electrochemical reaction kinetics between capacitor-type and battery-type electrodes caused by the charge-storage mechanism hinders the development of lithium-ion capacitors (LICs). To relieve the above contradiction, a 3D interconnected nitrogen-doped ultrathin carbon (3DNC) framework encapsulated with Fe2O3 (3DNC@Fe2O3-700) was prepared and applied as the anode and cathode to fabricate symmetric LICs. The 3DNC framework can provide a stable structure, short electron transport length, and abundant active sites. Besides, the encapsulated nanoparticles (NPs) can enhance the capacity of the anode and, meanwhile, maintain the excellent cycling performance owing to the relatively strong interaction and abundant interface between 3DNC and Fe2O3 NPs. Benefiting from the unique properties, 3DNC@Fe2O3-700 anode exhibits a capacity of 946.6 mA h g-1 and a retention rate of 106.5% after 5000 cycles. 3DNC@Fe2O3-700 cathode displays a capacity of 82.1 mA h g-1 and a retention rate of 100% after 5000 cycles. 3DNC@Fe2O3-700//3DNC@Fe2O3-700 LICs show a superior performance of high energy density of 206 W h kg-1 at 226 W kg-1 and a capacity retention of 118.2% after 5000 cycles at 1 A g-1. This work may provide a route to relieve the mismatch between the anode and cathode for high-performance symmetric LICs.
