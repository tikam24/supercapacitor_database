The properties of conjugated and irradiated Co3O4-CuO-MnO2/GO nanostructured nanocomposites powder for possible applications in various sphere of life were studied in this research work. The hydrothermal technique was employed to the synthesis of high quality nanocomposite powder and dr. blades technique was employed to construct thin films known as electrodes. The properties of Co3O4-CuO-MnO2/GO nanostructured composite powder (electrodes) were evaluated using SEM, EDS, XRD, FTIR and DRS. The electrochemical properties were studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in a 1.0 M solution of Na2SO4 electrolytic solution with a triple electrodes arrangement. The electrode irradiated with 2.25 Ã— 1015 ions/cm2 offered the highest specific capacitance of 1590 F/g at a scan rate of 10 mV/s. The results of electrochemical studies indicate that the combination of three transition metal oxides with GO irradiated by moderate ions is a noble contender for electrode applications.
