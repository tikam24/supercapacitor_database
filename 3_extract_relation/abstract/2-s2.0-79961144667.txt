This paper presents simulation and experimental results of a quasi-Z-source inverter (qZSI) based bi-directional DC/DC converter for supercapacitor (SC) interfacing. The bidirectional capability provides both the charging and discharging of the SC. During the charging mode the converter operates as a conventional VSI performing the voltage buck function, but during the discharging mode the converter operates as a qZSI based step-up DC/DC converter performing the voltage boost function. The proposed converter discussed was tested in both operating modes SC charging and discharging. Theoretical assumptions are proved by the PSIM simulation results and verified experimentally on a 500 W laboratory prototype. The most important results obtained are outlined. Â© 2011 IEEE.
