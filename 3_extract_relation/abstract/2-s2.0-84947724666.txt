A simple and low-cost method to fabricate Bi2O3/active-carbon nanocomposites with high capacitive properties was explored. In particular, the composites synthesized at a bismuth nitrate/active carbon weight ratio of 2:1 exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 466 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 and retained up to 335 F g-1 even at a current density of 5 A g-1. In addition, these composites also showed good capacity over 3000 cycles. The excellent electrochemical properties could be due to their high specific surface area, abundant pore volume, and proper loading of Bi2O3 nanospheres.
