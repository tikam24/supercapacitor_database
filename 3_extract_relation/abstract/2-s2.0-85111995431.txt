The performance of supercapacitor electrode materials was greatly affected by the specific surface area. The urchin-like NiCo2O4 was transformed into porous NiCo2O4 (AA-NiCo2O4) using the acid-alkali treatment method. The specific surface area of AA-NiCo2O4 was 165.0660 m2/g, which was about three times larger than that of NiCo2O4. The specific capacitance of the AA-NiCo2O4 was enhanced significantly (1700 F/g at 1 A/g), and AA-NiCo2O4 possesses good rate capacitance (1277 F/g at 10 A/g). This is mainly attributed to the larger specific surface area, fast and convenient electron-ion transport and redox reaction. Therefore, AA-NiCo2O4 is a promising high-performance supercapacitor electrode material.
