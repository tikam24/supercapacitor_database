The performance of the latest conformal-coated tantalum capacitors is compared with the new supercapacitors in providing the energy storage required for GSM/GPRS transmission. The latest generation of supercapacitors can challenge tantalum capacitors on electron spin resonance (ESR). New proton polymer pulse supercapacitor technology such as AVX's BestCap series can offer a dc capacitance of 150 mF with a 4.5-V working voltage and just 65 mω of ESR in a 28-mm × 17-mm package. The parametric stability and reliability of pulse supercapacitors is significantly better than represented in the wireless modem. The ESR shift that can occur during the component's lifetime remains within the 3× limit at maximum-rated temperature, and is considerably less at card operating specifications. The performance superiority of pulse supercapacitors has become important as energy budgets increase, as required by the shifts from the GSM to GPRS 10 and 12 standards.
