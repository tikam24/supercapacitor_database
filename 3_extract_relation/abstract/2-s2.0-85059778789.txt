With the acceleration of the development process of hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (HFCEV), it has become very important to maximize the energy stored in the vehicle and to use the vehicle with high efficiency. This paper puts forward how to cooperate with a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) as the primary energy source, a lithium-ion battery (LiB) and a supercapacitor (SCAP) as the energy storage technology. Furthermore, this paper examines the effect of two new control strategies developed for HFCEV in different road models on the vehicle fuel economy and life cycle of the system components. Both control strategies applied to the system can be easily applied to the different HFCEVs with minor changes due to the simplicity of their structure and parameters. The simulation results of the study have indicated that the impact of control strategies created in different road conditions on the power of energy sources, the life cycle of system components, system efficiency and fuel economy parameters of HFCEV.
