Developing a facile assembly approach replacing the fussy St√ñber and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method to fabricate hollow carbon nanostructure would be a meaningful topic towards its wide applications. Herein, we developed a simple glyoxal mediated assembly approach using commercial magnesium oxide (MgO) as template and phenol ascarbonaceous material to fabricate the hollow carbon nanostructure. The fabricated carbon owns hollow cocoon-like morphology, high surface area of 1411 m2/g, large pore volume (3.46 cm3/g) and rich oxygenic functionalites (6.7 atom%). As electrode for symmetric supercapacitor, the GPC973 electrode shows a superior supercapacitor performances with large energy density of 30.7 Wh/kg@500 W/kg and high rate capability of 68% from 1.0 A/g to 20 A/g. The developed strategy offers an alternative way to fabricate carbon hollow nanostructure thus afford a promising application of these type material in many other areas.
