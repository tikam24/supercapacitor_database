Vertical copper oxide (CuO) nanoflakes have been formed by oxidation in NaOH solution. Their structural, surface morphology and oxidation states were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) respectively. Pseudocapacitive behavior of CuO nanoflakes was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and constant current charge-discharge test. CuO nanoflakes were vertically grown with high lateral aspect ratio and consist of monoclinic lattice as shown by the presence of two peaks close to 2θ = 35.6 o and 38.7o in the XRD. Charge-discharge test gave a capacitance value of 190 F g- 1 in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte at 2 mA cm- 2 current density. The cycling test showed 67% stability after 2000 cycles and reduced specific capacitance from 190 F g- 1 to 125 F g- 1. Specific capacitance of CuO nanoflakes is higher than 26.44 F g- 1 of globular CuO at 2 mA cm- 2 as reported in literature due to enhanced specific surface area.
