Fibrous energy storage devices, especially coaxial fibrous supercapacitors (FSCs), have extensive promising applications in new-generation wearable electronics. Nevertheless, few studies have been conducted concerning simultaneously achieving a high electrochemical performance, mechanical robustness, and convenient and efficient fabrication of coaxial FSCs. Here, a coaxial asymmetric FSC (CAFSC) prepared by a one-step braiding method is reported. Our high-speed braiding machine simultaneously combines and braids pre-prepared anodes, separator yarns, and cathodes of the CAFSC at high production rates. The CAFSC realizes a high energy density of 17.25-46.33 Î¼W h cm-2at a power density of 1.75-9.66 mW cm-2while maintaining outstanding mechanical properties (90.1% capacitance retention after 1500 bending cycles and ability to lift a weight of 200 g) and a long cycling life (91.6% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles), outperforming most of the reported FSCs. The flexible watchband weaved with two serially connected CAFSCs can power a commercial digital watch. This work presents a universal strategy to prepare high-performance CAFSCs for next-generation wearable electronics.
