The nickel cobalt/MWCNT composites with Ni/Co molar ratio of 1:2 showed excellent electrochemical performance in term of specific capacitance (∼800 F g −1 at current density of 2 A g −1 ), good rate capability and excellent stability, which may be attributed to the combined benefits of bi-metals and MWCNT and porous metal nanostructures, enhancing the kinetics of ions/electron transport at both electrode inside and electrode/electrolyte interface. Further, the nickel cobalt/MWCNT composite modified electrode as electro-catalyst for glucose electro-oxidation demonstrated high sensitivity, good linear range and detection limit, which hold great promise as advanced electrode materials for supercapacitor and glucose electro-oxidation applications.
