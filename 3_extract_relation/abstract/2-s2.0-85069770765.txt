The ternary transition metal oxide NiCo2O4 and graphene nanocomposite were synthesized by using fast and simple microwave irradiation method for energy storage application. The synthesized graphene-NiCo2O4 nanocomposite structure were characterized using X-ray diffraction(XRD), Raman spectroscopy and the uniform distribution of the NiCo2O4 nanoparticle on graphene oxide were employed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). In the present study, microwave energy plays a important role in the synthesis of nanoporous NiCo2O4 nanoparticles uniformly distributed on the graphene layer and also the graphene layers restacking was reduced. The synthesized graphene NiCo2O4 nanocomposite exhibit 1369 F g-1 for the current density of 1 A g-1. In addition, the capacity retention of 96.8 % was maintained after 1000 cycles, as suggested that graphene-NiCo2O4 nanocomposite is a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.
