Flexible electrode materials play an important role in flexible portable energy storage devices. Carbon-based nanofiber has attracted numerous attentions due to its advantages on flexibility, safety, and reliability. Herein, we reported a novel and simple method to fabricate nitrogen-boron co-doped hollow porous carbon nanofiber (HPCNF) membranes as flexible supercapacitor electrodes. The higher specific surface area (413.98 m2/g) of HPCNF and the co-doping of N and B resulted in a high specific capacitance of 200.2 F/g (0.1 A/g). After 3000 cycles, NB-HPCNF still maintained high capacitance retention (104.81%). This study provides a new idea for electrochemical energy storage, which is beneficial to the deeper development of portable flexible devices.
