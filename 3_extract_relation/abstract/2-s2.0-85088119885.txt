Zinc ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZISCs), as one of emerging energy storage devices, have gained numerous attentions due to their high safety, satisfied energy/power output, low-cost and long-term durability. To construct a satisfying ZISC with good charge storage behavior, well-developed electrode structures and optimized electrolytes by effective strategies are highly demanded. However, current basic research is relatively far from its practical application, which has greatly deferred the large-scale production of ZISC and has become a key issue. Here, recent advances towards the ZISCs have been systematically summarized to meet such challenges, with a focus on the charge storage mechanism. In addition, insights into the development of electrodes and electrolytes are presented. It is worth believing that this review could be a medium for attracting more efforts to the early rise of ZISCs in terms of the sustainable material preparations and the advanced technique inventions.
