In this review, the research on perovskite supercapacitors based on oxygen anion intercalation at home and abroad in recent years was generalized and summarized. The anion-intercalation mechanism and the influences on electrochemical performances were summarized through the analysis of the past perovskite supercapacitor researches. Meanwhile the direction of the research of perovskite materials was put forward by combining the practical conditions for the application of supercapacitor to the vehicle power source with the summarization of the previous experimental design ideas, which provided some ideas for the design of perovskite materials of supercapacitors for the vehicle power source.
