A novel family of multi-port converters with bidirectional energy flow has been investigated for low-voltage high-current automotive energy-net applications. An example is given of a three-port converter designed for the 14 V/42 V automotive energy net and providing the possibility to also connect a double-layer capacitor to relieve the battery from excessive current stress and to stabilize the energy net voltages. The proposed three-port converter requires only three MOSFETS as switching devices. Analyses have been performed to investigate the suitability of the multi-port converter for the given application and a prototype converter has been built and tested to prove theoretical predictions. Measurements are in good correlations with results from the analysis.
