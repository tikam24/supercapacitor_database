Aiming at solving starting-up failure and simple maintenance for heavy equipment in extreme condition, a multifunction electric power platform based on ultracapacitor technology was developed. In this paper, firstly, the characteristics of ultracapacitor were introduced and starting-up faults of heavy equipment in extreme condition are analyzed. Then, the function, principle and system scheme of multifunction electric power platform were designed. At last, the starting-up tests for heavy equipment were carried out, the results of which validate that the power and current of multifunction electric power platform could meet the requirement of heavy equipment.
