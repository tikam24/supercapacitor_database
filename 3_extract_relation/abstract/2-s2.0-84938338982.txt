This paper demonstrates how to design and construct an advanced aqueous sodium-ion supercapacitor by using manganous hexacyanoferrate (MnHCF) as the cathode material and Fe3O4/rGO nanocomposites as the anode material. The rational combination of these two materials with neutral aqueous electrolytes provides the devices with an extended voltage of 1.8 V, much higher power density (2183.5 W kg-1) and energy density (27.9 W h kg-1) compared with similar devices reported in the literature. The devices also have good cycling stability with 82.2% capacity retention even after 1000 cycles. More significantly, the supercapacitors are designed with low cost and environmentally benign materials and are more suitable for future large-scale practical applications.
