A novel two-dimensional (2D) free standing and flexible MnO2/graphene film (MGF) supercapacitor electrode is successfully fabricated by a spin-coating and hydrothermal process. The MnO2 nano-sheets are successfully aligned vertically only on one side of the graphene thin film. Raw amphiphilic graphene oxide film is helpful in effectively promoting the dispersion of well-defined MnO2 nanosheets, which can form a porous network and cover the film surface. The graphene film acts as a substrate where MnO2 nano-sheets grow in situ, and meanwhile it is used as a base current collector with a large accessible surface area and without binders for electrochemical testing. The MGF exhibits excellent electrochemical performance in a three electrode configuration, including a high specific capacitance of up to 280 F g-1 and outstanding cycle stability (no obvious decay after 10000 cycles). In addition, the symmetric MGF supercapacitor shows a specific capacitance of up to 77 F g-1 under a cell voltage of 1.0 V. After 10000 cycles, the capacity retention rate is 91% at a current density of 1 A g-1. At the same time, the symmetric supercapacitor also has a high energy density of 10.7 W h kg-1 at a power density of 500 W kg-1.
