This paper reports the interaction of 3d-4d transition metal mixed oxide as simultaneous existence of M(3d) and M(4d) expectedly enhance the electrochemical performance of the resulting composite. Electrochemical performance of MnO 2 -RuO 2 nanoflakes reduced graphene oxide nanoribbon composite (MnO 2 -RuO 2 @GNR) is intensively explored in symmetric and asymmetric supercapacitor assembly. In situ incorporation of graphene oxide nanoribbon (GONR) during synthesis provides efficient binding sites for growth of MnO 2 -RuO 2 nanoflakes via their surface functionalities. The interconnected MnO 2 -RuO 2 nanoflakes via GNR form a network with enhanced diffusion kinetics leading to efficient supercapacitor performance. Fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor reveals energy density 60 Wh kg −1 at power density 14 kW kg −1 . Based on the analysis of impedance data in terms of complex power, quick response time of supercapacitor reveals excellent power delivery of the device. Improved cycling stability after 7000 charge discharge cycles for symmetric and asymmetric supercapacitor highlights the buffering action of GNR and can be generalized for next generation high performance supercapacitor.
