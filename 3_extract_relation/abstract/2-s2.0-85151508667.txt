This research paper outlines the design of a self-powered smart wearable sensor, that utilizes a Nano particle based Thermoelectric generator as well as a graphite Nano particle Based super capacitor. Utilizing this combo this research aims to showcase the feasibility of the use for smart wearable sensor, in this case a glucose monitor serves as the sensor. Humans are under increasing strain in modern life, which has led to an increase in a variety of health conditions. Unfortunately, this consequence either lowers life quality or prematurely shortens it. Utilizing sensors to track various bodily activities and predict the risk of a disease at an early stage might be a solution to this issue.
