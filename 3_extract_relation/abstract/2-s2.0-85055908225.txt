To build a high-performance supercapacitor, chemical surface modification and hierarchically porous construction are two widely adopted routes for electrode materials design. Unfortunately, they are suffering from perplexing steps and low yield. Herein, we reported an in situ direct method to massively prepare hierarchically porous carbide-derived carbons with nitrogen and chlorine co-doping (CDCs-N/Cl) via etching TiC0.5N0.5 in chlorine-containing atmosphere. The as-prepared CDCs-N/Cl with high ratio of heteroatoms exhibited superhydrophilicity and delivered a maximum specific capacitance of 277.7 F g-1 in 6 M KOH, which is the highest value among all the reported CDC materials. Besides, the assembled asymmetrical supercapacitor shows remarkable specific capacitance of 233.4 F g-1, and 97% initial capacitance can be retained after 20,000 cycles at 2 A g-1, revealing excellent cycling stability. This work is expected to pave a new way for rapid and scalable supercapacitive electrode materials production.
