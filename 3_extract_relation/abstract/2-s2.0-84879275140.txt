Carbonated bacterial cellulose/grapheme (CBC/CCG)compositions were prepared by the ultrasonication and in situ reduced using hadrozine hydrate, with a mass ratio of graphene oxide (GO)/CBC, (7:3). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), dynamic force microscopy(DFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and laser Raman spectroscopy (Raman) were used to characterize the samples. The capacitive behaviors of the CCG/CBC composite and CCG as electrodes for supercapacitors were compared in terms of cyclic voltammograms, charge-discharge curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 6 mol/L aqueous KOH. The results show that the specific capacitance of CBC/CCG composites could be up to 168.99 F/g under the current density of 10 mA/cm2, which was superior to CCG of 87.79 F/g, indicating that CCG/CBC composites have good prospects for electrochemical applications.
