In this study, limited by the low capacitance of double layer electrode anode materials (especially, commercial activated carbon) in the application of asymmetric supercapacitors, uniform bismuth phosphate nanosheets (BPO) battery-type anode material were synthesized by using an easy polyol refluxing method, its higher capacity (324.50 C g−1 at 1 A g−1), excellent conductivity and cycling stability, earth-abundant raw material source show that BPO can be an excellent substitute for carbon materials in asymmetric supercapacitors.
