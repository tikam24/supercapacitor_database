Nowadays, the crises of fossil fuel, environmental pollution, nonrenewable energy scarcity, and rapidly expanding human energy consumption have highlighted the need for energy storage. Some of these problems can be solved with the help of supercapacitors due to their unique properties. In this investigation, the binder-free Sr-based electrode is synthesized with the hydrothermal route for pollution-free source of energy. The different instrumental tools were utilized to investigate the crystal structure, elemental composition, morphology and interfacial area of the SrAl2O4. The electrochemical analysis of the SrAl2O4 is performed with an electrochemical workstation of PG STAT-204 under 2.0 M alkaline KOH solution. The cyclic voltammogram displays the prominent redox property with large specific capacitance. The SrAl2O4 contains a large specific capacitance of 737 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. The Sr-based spinel displays long-term stability over 45 h without any change in the current density. Our finding suggests that the SrAl2O4 material is a potent electrocatalyst for energy conversion applications and it can further have employed to solve the various environmental crisis.
