Electrolytes in supercapacitors (SCs) play an important role on their energy storage capacity. The electrochemical stability of electrolytes defines the operating potential of the SCs and their viscosity defines a power density of the SCs. In the present work, a new method for composing an electrochemically stabile but high viscous ethylene glycol (EG) based electrolyte has been discussed. A viscosity of the EG then reduced by dissolving an inorganic lithium tetrafluoroborate (LiBF4) salt. The affect of the concentration of the salt on EG viscosity has been investigated. The best capacitive performance of activated carbon (AC) based electrodes with large operating potential (-1.7V to 1.7V) was found in 3M LiBF4/EG electrolyte.
