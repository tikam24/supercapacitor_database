The increasing energy crisis promotes the study on novel electrode materials with high performance for supercapacitive storage and energy conversion. Transition metal phosphates have been reported as a potential candidate due to the unique coordination and corresponding electronic structure. Herein, we adopted a facile method for preparing NaCoPO4@C derived from a metal organic framework (MOF) as a bifunctional electrode. ZIF-67 was synthesized before a refluxing process with Na2HPO4 to form a precursor, which is transformed into the final product via calcination in different atmospheres. Specifically, the resultant NaCoPO4@C exhibits a high specific capacitance of 1178.7Fg-1 at a current density of 1Ag-1 for a supercapacitor. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) assembled with active carbon displays a high capacitance of 163.7Fg-1 at 1Ag-1. In addition, as an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, the NaCoPO4@C electrode requires only 299mV to drive a current density of 10mAcm-2. These results suggest that the rational design of MOF-derived NaCoPO4@C provides a variety of practical applications in electrochemical energy conversion and storage.
