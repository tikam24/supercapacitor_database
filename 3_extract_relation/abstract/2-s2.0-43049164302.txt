Aligned carbon nanotube arrays (ACNTAs) with lengths up to 150 μm were fabricated on metallic alloy (Inconel 600) substrates by pyrolysis of iron (II) phthalocyanine (FePc) in the presence of ethylene (C2H4). The as-grown ACNTAs, formed by aligned multi-walled carbon nanotubes with high purity, were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and Raman spectroscopy techniques. The ACNTAs were used directly as electrode materials in supercapacitors with (Et)4NBF4 + propylene carbonate (PC) as electrolyte, and their electrochemical properties were investigated. A rectangular-shaped cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve was observed even at a sweep rate of 1000 mV s-1. The specific capacitance measured at 1000 mV s-1 was about 57 % (47 F g-1) of that obtained at 1 mV s-1 (83 F g-1), and an equivalent series resistance (ESR) of 0.55 Ω was measured for the ACNTA and activated carbon pair electrodes embedded in a coin cell. The results indicated that the ACNTAs could be a promising candidate as electrode materials in supercapacitors. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
