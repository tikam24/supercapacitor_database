One dimensional α-MnO2 nanostructures are obtained via a facile hydrothermal method without extra surfactants and additives with different morphologies by varying the hydrothermal temperature. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy confirmed the tetragonal α-MnO2 phase. FESEM analysis revealed the morphological variation from nanorods to nanofibres. Electrochemical characterizations like CV, GCD, and EIS were utilized to analyze the supercapacitive properties of the synthesized electrode material in a three-electrode cell using 1 M KNO3 electrolyte. The highest specific capacitance of 218.8 Fg−1 at 0.5 Ag−1 is obtained for sample M1, and GCD determines excellent cycle stability with 92% retention after 5000 cycles.
