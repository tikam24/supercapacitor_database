Electroactive materials have presented increasingly relevant application potentials as energy storage, because of the use of 5G technologies, artificial intelligence, IoT and batteries for electric vehicles. The objective of this work was to evaluate their electroactive properties in different potential applications and to test the electrode charge limit for energy storage devices. Structural carbon fiber composite materials coated by electrochemical synthesis of polyaniline with graphene oxide were obtained. The electrodes were characterized by GCD (with and without cutoff), FEG, FTIR, Raman, CV, EIS and 4 probes. The electrodes can be classified with supercapacitive properties according to the Ragone Diagram and applied to different potential variations reaching a charging limit (potential limit that stores the largest amount of charge). Mapping of specific power and energy during cycling reveals that the GO electrode confers structural stability to the PANI and maintains the material's electroactive properties elevated over 500 cycles.
