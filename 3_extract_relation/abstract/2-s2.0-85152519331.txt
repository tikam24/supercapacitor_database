With the increased usage of DER like solar and wind energies, power quality (PQ) has become serious concern, in distribution systems and industries. This study suggests utilizing an ultracapacitor (UCAP) at the DC link of the power conditioner employing a bidirectional DC-to-DC converter (BDC) to lessen a variety of power quality issues. The ultracapacitor will improve active power transfer capability and will also reduce the voltage sag and voltage swell problems. UCAP's low energy density, high power density, and quick charging and discharging rates will help to address distribution system power quality problems. The performance of ultracapacitor along with bidirectional DC-DC converter configuration is studied using MATLAB/SIMULINK software. The effectiveness of the UCAP using PID controller and fuzzy controller control (FLC) algorithm is compared.
