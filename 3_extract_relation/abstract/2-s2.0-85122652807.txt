In this paper, an efficient ionic liquid (IL) by using caffeine (Caff), trietahnolamine (TEA) and ZnBr2 ([Caff-TEA]+[ZnBr3]-) was used for supercapacitor applications. The supercapacitive properties of the electrode material were studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV), charge/discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The specific capacitance was obtained of 165.28 F/g at current density of 1 A/g. Moreover, it retained 80% of the initial capacitance after 20,000 cycles at current density of 3 A/g. These results shows that the ionic liquid electrode is a promising option for use in supercapacitors.
