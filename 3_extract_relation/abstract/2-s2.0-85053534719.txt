A polyaniline/molybdenum trioxide/activated carbon cloth (PANI/MoO3/ACC) composite was successfully synthesized via facile hydrothermal and in-situ polymerization reactions. The morphology and microstructure of the PANI/MoO3/ACC composite were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The electrochemical performance of the as-prepared electrode was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The coating PANI layer in PANI/MoO3/ACC increases the electrochemical activity of MoO3 and accelerates the ion diffusion and electron transfer. Due to synergistic effects between the components, PANI/MoO3/ACC exhibits a specific capacitance of 1050 F g−1, significantly higher than that of MoO3/ACC (296.7 F g−1) and PANI/CC (500.0 F g−1) at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 in 1 M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte, as well as good cycling stability for 2000 cycles with 71% retention. It also displays lower ion diffusion and charge transfer resistance, as evidenced by the electrochemical impedance data. PANI/MoO3/ACC exhibits excellent electrochemical performance and is thus a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.
