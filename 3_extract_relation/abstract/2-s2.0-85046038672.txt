A facile self-doping and self-templating strategy to prepare N, S co-doped hierarchical porous carbon nanorods (NSCs) via direct carbonization of an easy-synthesis protic salt is developed. The protic salt of 5-carboxybenzene-1,3-diamine sulfate [DABA][2HSO4] behaves as a multirole precursor, serving as the carbon source and heteroatom dopants as well as the pore-forming agent during carbonization. The pore structure parameters and chemical compositions of NSCs can be simply tuned by adjusting the carbonization temperature. The typical NSC carbonized at 900 °C (denoted as NSC-900) is endowed with large surface area of 1543 m2 g−1, nanorod morphology, unique hierarchical porosity (consisting of ultramicro-, supermicro- and mesopores), and high content of heteroatom functionalities (5.80 at.% N and 0.44 at.% S). As a result, the NSC-900 electrode exhibits excellent charge storage capacity with a high gravimetric capacitance of 282 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 and long-tem cycling life with 96.0% retention after 10000 cycles in KOH electrolyte. Besides, the assembled NSC-900/MnO2//NSC-900 asymmetric supercapacitor with a wide operating voltage of 1.8 V delivers a large energy density of 39.15 Wh Kg−1 with the corresponding power density of 901 W kg−1 in Na2SO4 electrolyte.
