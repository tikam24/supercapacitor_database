In this study, a CoMnFeO4/Polyaniline (S2) nanocomposite was prepared using the in-situ polymerization method of Polyaniline (PANI) in the presence of CoMnFeO4 (S1) nanoparticles as high-performance supercapacitor electrode materials. The high specific capacitance of 1610 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g and the capacitance retention of about 100 % at a current density of 20 A/g after 600 cycles indicate the relatively high efficiency of the S2 nanocomposite. In addition, the excellent electrochemical performance of the S2 nanocomposite results from the synergy between the good properties of PANI and the pseudo-capacitance properties of CoMnFeO4 nanoparticles. Hence, a new electrode material with superior performance and long-term stability has been developed for energy storage systems.
