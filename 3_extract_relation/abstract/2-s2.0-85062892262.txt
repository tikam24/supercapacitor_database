The present study illustrates an approach for the synthesis of nanoparticle doped polyaniline (PANI) nanocomposites by in-situ oxidative polymerization technique in devising electrode material for high performance supercapacitors for energy storage. A simple, facile technique to designed low cost materials based on conducting polymers for an efficient hybrid supercapacitor was discussed briefly in this article. The nanocomposites fabrication into electrodes was then discussed for the analysis of the electrochemical efficiencies employing cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The electrochemical investigations as reported by previous researchers revealed an excellence electrochemical performance of the conducting polymer-based nanocomposites leading to enhanced capacitive nature. The conducting polymer-based nanocomposite also presented an improved life cycle capacitance retention. Thus, conducting polymer-based nanocomposites demonstrates excellent efficiency and can be explored as economic alternatives to tackle the issue of energy storage.
