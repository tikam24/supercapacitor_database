The objective of this paper is to discuss the compact hardware developed for energy systems with small footprint and high efficiency for the microcontroller based applications. This incorporates designing of the super capacitor based power supply that can be deployed at remote area to acquire physical phenomenon. The system, a combination of solar panel and super capacitor, ensures continuous supply of energy for the load. To build a lab based model and to prove the competency, a multichannel, reconfigurable data acquisition system in LabVIEW has been developed. Logging the data for longer period of time as well as plotting, processing and analyzing the data is possible using the above mentioned software platform. The developed system overcome limitations of conventional rechargeable and non-rechargeable batteries in such scenario and is contributing to the green solutions.
