Handset designers have addressed the challenges to deliver high-intensity flash driver ICs, which are aimed to redefine xenon versus LED lighting technology in terms of voltage, light output, and compact handsets. The designers are aimed to drive flash LEDs at peak currents of 2 A, to match the photo quality of high-resolution DSCs. Power semiconductor manufacturers have developed new high-efficiency, high-current step-up converters, optimized to work with a supercapacitor and addressing the power limitation problems. Designers have also aimed to use a flash driver IC along with a boost converter and capacitor to drive the LED, so that low-voltage and battery protection circuit shutdown is prevented. A supercapacitor offering high levels of capacitance allows designers to deliver the high current needed for short flash events.
