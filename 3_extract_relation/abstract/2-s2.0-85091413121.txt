Perovskite oxides, as a kind of functional materials, have been widely studied in recent years due to its unique physical, chemical, and electrical properties. Here, we successfully prepared perovskite-type LaCoO3 (LCOs) nanomaterials via an improved sol-gel method followed by calcination, and investigated the influence of calcination temperature and time on the morphology, structure, and electrochemical properties of LaCoO3 nanomaterials. Then, based on the optimal electrochemical performance of LCO-700-4 electrode sample, the newly synthesized nanocomposites of Sr-doping (LSCO-0.2) and rGO-compounding (rGO@LCO) through rational design exhibited a 1.45-fold and 2.03-fold enhancement in its specific capacitance (specific capacity). The rGO@LCO electrode with better electrochemical performances was further explored by assembling rGO@LCO//rGO asymmetric supercapacitor system (ASS) with aqueous electrolyte. The result showed that the ASS delivers a high energy density of 17.62 W h kgâˆ’1 and an excellent cyclic stability with 94.48% of initial capacitance after 10,000 cycles, which are good electrochemical performances among aqueous electrolytes for green and new efficient energy storage devices.
