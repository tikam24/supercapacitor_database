The methods for optimization of energy exchange between the linear and nonlinear capacitors are proposed. As an example we consider the equivalent circuit of the supercapacitor, electric capacity of which changes proportionally to the voltage on its plates. It is shown that the electric power losses in the energy exchange depend on the ratio of the value of capacitors and the initial voltage of their plates.
