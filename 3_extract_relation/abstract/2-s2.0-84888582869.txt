The complex hierarchical CuO nanostructures (woolen clumps, stacked nanosheets and nanobuds) have been developed through a chemical bath deposition method using surfactant assisted approach. The morphology of CuO nanostructures can be easily tuned using different surfactants as a soft chemical template. Nanobuds clusters deliver a superior 3D conductive framework, which allows well electrolytic accessible surface area and provides a shortest path for ions. The porous and well defined nanostructure renders a high contact surface area for the intercalation/deintercalation of ions into/out of active materials and reduces the path length for electrolyte ion transport. The maximum specific capacitance of 396 Fg-1 at 5 mV s-1 is calculated for CuO nanobuds structured electrode. Moreover, all the CuO nanostructures reveal better power performance, excellent rate as well as long term cycling stability. Such a study will encourage for the preparation of 3D nanostructures framework of the other materials using surfactant assisted approach. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
