Conducting polymers rise among some of the most promising transparent supercapacitor electrode materials due to high conductivity, environmental stability, light weight, and ease of synthesis. A major challenge for depositing conducting polymers on a glass substrate is the lack of molecular interactions between organic and inorganic moieties resulting in poor adhesion and low cycling stability of the electrode. We present a synthetic approach by covalently linking poly(3,4-ethylyenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and glass through Friedel-Crafts alkylation on a self-assembled diphenyldimethoxysilane monolayer. This method obviates the need for a conductive FTO or ITO coating, enabling the fabrication of current collector-free planar supercapacitor electrodes on any glass surface. The electrode produced from our vapor-phase synthesis is coated with a highly conductive nanofibrillar PEDOT film (sheet resistance 2.1 Ï‰/ ) possessing a gravimetric capacitance of 200 F/g. Our PEDOT planar supercapacitor possesses outstanding stability (86% capacitance retention after 50,000 cycles). We also fabricate a proof-of-concept transparent tandem supercapacitor on PEDOT-coated glass using 3D-printed frames that supplies enough voltage and current to light up a blue light-emitting diode (LED).
