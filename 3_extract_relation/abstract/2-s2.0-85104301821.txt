The composition and structure are very critical to the property of electrode materials in supercapacitors. Herein, a core/shell polypyrrole@manganese dioxide (PPy@MnO2) composite is prepared by a simple strategy. The electrode delivers the Cs value of 614.7F·g−1 at 1.0 A·g−1, and exhibits outstanding rate performance in a three-electrode system. Moreover, asymmetric device (PPy@MnO2//AC) has been designed and possessed extraordinary rate performance, remarkable cycle stability, and the high energy density of 34.0 Wh·kg−1 at 317.6 W·kg−1. The core/shell structured PPy@MnO2 delivers the excellent electrochemical performance, indicating its great application potential in supercapacitors.
