Three-dimensional (3D) needle-like nickel carbon nanofibers (Ni/CNFs) were successfully fabricated as bifunctional materials by controlling the conditions in the preparation process. The effects such as different molar ratio, carbonization temperature and carbonization time of nanofibers morphology structures were investigated in the experiments. 3D needle-like Ni/CNFs materials as catalyst were applied in Heck reaction which exhibited a certain catalytic activity. Furthermore, this material was oxidized into the nickel and nickel oxidized (Ni/NiO) carbon nanofibers in the air atmosphere, forming electrode material. The electrochemical tests were carried out in electrolyte of 4 M KOH, and it was demonstrated that Ni/NiO-5 was the best electrode material with a high specific capacitance of 676 F g −1 at the current density of 0.5 A g −1 . Cycling performance as an index of evaluation material was also investigated and the capacitance retention kept of 108% after 5000 cycles, which exhibited the excellent stability. Furthermore, the Ni/NiO-5 as the positive electrode and CNFs as negative electrode were assembled into the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) in 4 M KOH solution. The resulting Ni/NiO-5//CNFs device represented maximum energy density of 90.9 Wh kg −1 at the power density of 1350 W kg −1 . Bifunctional materials could not only be utilized in catalytic field, but also be applied as electrode materials for the supercapacitor. This work offers a novel 3D needle-like structure for improving the potential of metal oxides for energy storage applications and this material also can be used as catalyst in Heck reaction, which displayed widely prospects applications as bifunctional materials.
