Inexpensive fabrication with the scalable design of environmentally friendly supercapacitors is highly desirable for portable and wearable electronics. In this context, the role of an electrolyte on two-dimensional (2D) materials such as WS2 nanosheet-based electrodes is important for the rational design of an efficient, stable, and environmentally friendly supercapacitor. In this paper, high-quality and ultrathin 2D WS2 nanosheets are synthesized by an easy, fast, and scalable LiI-assisted liquid phase exfoliation method. The synthesized WS2 nanosheets are then employed as an electrode material in combination with 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (BMIC) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) gel electrolyte to fabricate a solid-state supercapacitor. The effect of different concentrations of BMIC on the 2D WS2 nanosheet-based electrodes is investigated in a symmetric supercapacitor. An optimum concentration of BMIC in PVA gel provides the best performance due to the low viscosity and high conductivity of the gel electrolyte, resulting from the H bonding alteration inside the PVA matrix. High voltage supercapacitors with a large electrochemically stable window (up to ±4 V), and higher capacitance (5 F g−1) and specific energy density are fabricated using 0.5 M BMIC in the PVA gel electrolyte. The fabricated solid-state devices show 100% specific capacitance retention up to 8000 cyclic charge-discharge cycles. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy are employed to investigate the enhanced performance and stability of 0.5 M BMIC in PVA gel electrolyte in combination with a WS2-based electrode.
