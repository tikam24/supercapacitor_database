This work is focused on a step-down switched-inductor hybrid dc-dc converter (SIHDC) integrated in a small power wind energy conversion system (WECS). The converter has two roles, to maintain the wind turbine at the maximum power point by controlling the electric generator loading, and to charge a high power density supercapacitor, which is part of a hybrid storage unit that also contains rechargeable batteries. The paper points out the steady-state analysis of the converter in continuous and discontinuous current modes, specific for this application. The stability investigation is presented in detail, including the influence of the electrical generator. The parameterized small-signal transfer function of the control variable derived in this paper can be used to quickly obtain the information needed to evaluate the stability of any similar WECS. A current controller was designed to achieve a stable operation in continuous current mode, and afterwards the stability was checked for discontinuous current mode. A 5kW step-down SIHDC prototype was built and extensively tested, both in laboratory, by using a wind turbine emulator, and in a small power (5kW) WECS industrial platform. Experimental results obtained under real operating conditions confirm the theoretical analysis and laboratory tests, showing that SIHDC converter is a valid solution for low power wind energy conversion systems.
