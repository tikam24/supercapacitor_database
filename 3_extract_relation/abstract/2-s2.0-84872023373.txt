Supercapacitors, due to their capability to deliver high specific power during a few seconds or more, are presently considered as the electrical storage devices of choice for smoothing the strong and short-time power solicitations required in transportation and domestic applications powered by fuel cells or batteries, as well as for energy storage substations for voltage compensation in distributed networks. In 2005, the European Union (EU) awarded a new project, named ILHYPOS {Ionic Liquid-based Hybrid Power Supercapacitors), with the scope to research and investigate novel cost-effective and more environmentally clean SCs based on new materials. This 3-year research and development project is mainly focused on SCs utilizing primarily ionic liquids, a novel green component for a variety of applications, such as fuel cells, electrochemical capacitors, dye-sensitive solar cells, electrochemical device and batteries. The ILHYPOS project has very challenging scientific and technological targets and aims at developing a new class of SCs with very high power (in excess of 7 kW/kg) and energy (about 15 Wh/kg) capability and stability in a wide range of temperature, still maintaining the long life expectation of more conventional SCs. This paper will describe the overall ILHYPOS project structure, the key role and activities of the participants and will highlight the major achievements in the first period of activities.
