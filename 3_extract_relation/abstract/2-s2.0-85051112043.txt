Hybrid supercapacitors that combine the advantages of supercapacitors (high power density and long cycle life) and batteries (high energy density) have been studied. In this paper, we fabricate the hybrid supercapacitors using LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 (NMC) cathode and activated carbon (AC) anode and investigate the electrochemical performances. The NMC/AC hybrid supercapacitors delivers a discharge capacitance of 66.2 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 with satisfactory cycling stability (97.7% capacity retention after 14,000 cycles) and rate capability (89.9% retention at 5 A g−1). The combination of a NMC cathode and AC anode is proved to be applicable for high performance hybrid supercapacitors, benefiting from synergy effects from both NMC and AC. These results indicate that NMC/AC electrodes can be considered as an approach for future hybrid supercapacitors.
