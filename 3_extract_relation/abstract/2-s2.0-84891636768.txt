Graphene-containing carbon aerogel was prepared by a polycondensation of resorcinol with formaldehyde using chemically exfoliated graphene oxide in ambient conditions, and its electrochemical performance as an electrode for supercapacitor was examined. The effect of pH in the preparation of RFGO (resorcinol-formaldehyde and graphene oxide) solution on the physical and electrochemical properties of graphene-containing carbon aerogel was investigated. For comparison, graphene-free carbon aerogel was also prepared. Among the samples, graphene-containing carbon aerogel prepared at pH 6.5 showed the highest BET surface area (733 m2/g) and the largest pore volume (1.39 cm3/g) with well-developed porous structure. Electrochemical properties of graphene-containing carbon aerogel and graphene-free carbon aerogel electrodes were measured by cyclic voltammetry at a scan rate of 10 mV/sec and by charge/discharge test at constant current of 1 A/g in 6 M KOH electrolyte. From cyclic voltammetry measurements, it was found that graphene-containing carbon aerogel prepared at pH 6.5 showed higher specific capacitance than graphene-free carbon aerogel (63 F/g vs. 54 F/g). Specific capacitance calculated by charge/discharge test also revealed that graphene-containing carbon aerogel prepared at pH 6.5 showed higher specific capacitance than graphene-free carbon aerogel (85 F/g vs. 79 F/g). Thus, electrochemical performance of graphene-containing carbon aerogel prepared at pH 6.5 could be enhanced by adding graphene into carbon aerogel. Copyright Â© 2013 American Scientific Publishers.
