Nanofibers with hollow or porous network structure have numerous prospective realistic applications in electrode materials of a hybrid supercapacitor. Herein, La0.7Sr0.3CoO3/Co3O4 nanofibers (LSC/Co3O4 NFs) with hollow network porous structure where Co3O4 nanoparticles evenly distributed in the LSC single tube both sides of hollow are successfully prepared by one-step electrospinning. Electrochemical characteristics of LSC-doped composite electrode materials with different proportions have studied in detail. The result showed the LSC (20 wt%)/Co3O4 electrode material displayed the eminent specific capacity of 215 C g-1 (430 F g-1) at 1 A g-1. Furthermore, the LSC (20 wt%)/Co3O4//AC hybrid supercapacitor showed remarkable cyclic stability after 5000 cycles with a capacity retention of 86.3% and it showed a tremendous energy density of 21.9 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 358.4 W kg-1. Hence, the prepared LSC/Co3O4 NFs have promised a new type of electrode for hybrid supercapacitors.
