Three activators (KOH, ZnCl2, H3PO4) were respectively used to activate bagasse and three kinds of activated carbons, i.e., microporous activated carbon KAC, micro mesoporous activated carbon ZAC, and micro meso-macroporous activated carbon PAC were successfully prepared. The results showed that the abovementioned three activators were capable of regulating the pore structures of bagasse-based activated carbons. The chemical analysis showed that the as-prepared activated carbons mainly contained C, H, N, and O elements, and the contents of C and O were the largest. All of them contained different amounts of C=C, C-C, and C=O functional groups. Physical analysis presented that ZAC had the largest pore volume of 0.65 cm3/g and the highest graphitization degree among the three activated carbons. ZAC exhibited high specific capacitance (282 F/g), excellent rate performance (212 F/g, stablizing at 10 A/g) as well as good cycle stability (maintaining a specific capacitance of 98.5% during 1000 cycles) in a double-layer capacitor of the three-electrode system. The energy density of the double-assembled ZAC/ZAC symmetrical supercapacitor was 39.2 Wh/kg, higher than that of the general commercial electrodes (<10 Wh/kg), which endowed it great potential as a supercapacitor electrode material.
