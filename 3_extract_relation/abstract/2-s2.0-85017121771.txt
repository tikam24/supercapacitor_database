A Fe3O4 nanorods/graphitic C3N4 composite was synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method. The structure and morphology of the composite were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, FT-IR and so on. The specific capacitance of the composite as an electrode material is 4.3 times as that of pure graphitic C3N4 (g-C3N4) at the discharge current density of 1 A/g, showing enhanced electrochemical performance. The improved capacitive performance could be ascribed to the synergetic effect between Fe3O4 nanorods and g-C3N4. This work provides a new way to improve the electrochemical property of g-C3N4 and shows that the Fe3O4 nanorods/g-C3N4 composite is a potential electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.
