A novel ternary composite system (polyaniline-acetylene black-manganese cobaltite) was prepared and various analysis like XRD, FTIR, UV, SEM, EDS confirmed their successful formation. The EDLC nature of AB and pseudocapacitive nature of PANI and MC provide excellent electrochemical activity to the hybrid system. The calculated areal capacitance of ternary electrode at 1 mA/cm2 is 1.51 F/cm2. The areal capacitance of ternary composite based symmetric supercapacitor at 1 mA/cm2 is 0.35 F/cm2. Specific power and specific energy achieved by PAMC based symmetric supercapacitor are 2352 W/kg and 18.203 Wh/kg, respectively. Ternary electrode has the least charge transfer resistance i.e. 3.29 Î©. The promising results of ternary hybrid system make it a suitable candidate for supercapacitor applications.
