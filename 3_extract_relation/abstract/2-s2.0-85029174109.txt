In recent years, supercapacitors have been considered as one of the auspicious energy storage devices. In this work, two different kinds of mixed metal oxide NiMoO4 nanoflakes arrays were directly grown on 3D Ni foam. The electrode exhibited high specific capacitance of 2004 F/g at the current density of 2 A/g in 6 M KOH electrolyte. Additionally, it also exhibited low equivalent series resistance of 0.62 Î© and excellent cycling stability (80% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles). With these extraordinary electrochemical properties, the electrode material can be considered as potential candidate for supercapacitor applications.
