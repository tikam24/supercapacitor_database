The proceedings contain 40 papers. The topics discussed include: synthesis of nanostructured fine-particles for energy and resources saving; unusual large-pitch banding in poly(l-lactic acid): effects of composition and geometry confinement; quantum dot based memory devices: current status and future prospect by simulation perspective; modification of porous silicon rugate filters through thiol-yne photochemistry; fabrication of micro-hollow fiber by electrospinning process in near-critical carbon dioxide; fabrication of functional nanomaterials using flame assisted spray pyrolysis; modeling of the dependence of nanodroplet size on the parameters governing the dewetting process on square micropillar; nanoporous separators for supercapacitor using activated carbon monolith electrode from oil palm empty fruit bunches; and electrochemical synthesis of nanosized hydroxyapatite by pulsed direct current method.
