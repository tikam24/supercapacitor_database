This Letter proposed a new hardware approach based on the design of an intelligent system to manage energy storage sources in order to improve the battery life span. It is dedicated for the biomedical low power devices and specially an implantable biosensor since it consumes only 1.5mW. It involves three types of digital circuits based on the CMOS transistor which are: voltage comparator, analogue switches and OOK MICS transmitter. The proposed circuit manages the system supply and especially the supercapacitor charging. It enables the supercapacitor to supply the biosensor for 15 hours per 24 hours which presents 62% of the initial supply system life span. This would therefore prolong the battery life span, avoid the risk of the thermal leakage which is dangerous for the human body, and solve the problems of deep discharge and the decay of the discharge voltage for the supercapacitor.
