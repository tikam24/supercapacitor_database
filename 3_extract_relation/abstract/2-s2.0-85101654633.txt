The inferior energy density limits the practical application and sustainable development of supercapacitors. Excellent electrode materials can effectively improve the specific capacitance and operating potential window. Thus, we deposit brush-like nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4) nanosheets and CuCo2O4/CuO nanowire arrays to construct a binder-free electrode with tree-like CuCo2O4/CuO/NiFe2O4 arrays. The resulting CuCo2O4/CuO/NiFe2O4 electrode shows an outstanding specific capacitance (2067 F/g) and wide potential window (âˆ’0.1-0.6 V). The contribution rate of surface faradaic redox reaction is calculated to be 71% at 1 mV/s and assembled CuCo2O4/CuO/NiFe2O4//AC device realizes a remarkable energy density (77.1 Wh/kg at power density of 851.4 W/kg) and cyclic performance (92.9% of initial specific capacitance retained after 10,000 cycles). Apparently, the CuCo2O4/CuO/NiFe2O4 electrode as a novel binder-free electrode has great application potential and our work offers a novel idea to construct the arrays of multicomponent composite materials.
