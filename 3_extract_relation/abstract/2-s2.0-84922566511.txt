Graphene is very popular in recent years, due to its unique electrical, thermal, mechanical, optical and electrochemical properties. With these useful advantages, graphene has been used as a substance to incorporate various kinds of functional materials. Among them, graphene/conducting polymer composites have attracted a great deal of interest owing to their new properties or enhanced performance during the past few years, because conducting polymers have been widely used for electronic, optical and electrochemical applications thanks to their low cost, good environmental stability, interesting electroactivity, high pseudocapacitance and unusual doping/dedoping chemical characters. This review discusses the current development of graphene/conducting polymer composites. After introduction of the properties of graphene and conducting polymers. This review summarizes various methods to synthesize graphene/conducting polymer composites, as well as their enhanced properties. Finally, the applications of graphene/conducting polymer composites, such as supercapacitors, sensing platforms, fuel cells, solar cells, electrochromic devices, lithium ion batteries and so on,are also described.
