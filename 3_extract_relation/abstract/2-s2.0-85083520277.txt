Sulfur and nitrogen co-doped graphene quantum dots (S,N:GQDs) were prepared by a hydrothermal method. A series of polyaniline/S,N:G QDs nanocomposites (PGQDx where x is the mass of S,N:GQDs and equal to 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 mg) has been synthesized via chemical in situ polymerization process. The UV–vis and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra showed an extra-doping level in H2SO4-doped polyaniline (PANI) due to –COOH groups of GQDs. However, increasing of GQDs content enhanced the aggregation of GQDs and reduced the doping level. The surface morphologies of nanocomposites showed a mixed of nanofibers, granules, and flakes with highly porous structure and particle size varied from 50 to 70 nm. Electrochemical properties of PGQD nanocomposites cast onto nickel-foam substrate as a supercapacitor electrode were performed in 2 M KOH electrolyte using cyclic voltammetry, charge/discharge, and electrochemical impedance techniques. PGQD20 exhibited maximum specific capacitance of 2524 F/g at 2 A/g with an excellent cyclic stability of 100% after 1000 cycle at scan rate of 50 mV/s. GQDs with unique properties reduces the charge transfer resistances, and promotes the contact between polyaniline and electrolyte and the electrochemical performance.
