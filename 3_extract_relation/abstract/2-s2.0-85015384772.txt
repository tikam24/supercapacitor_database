Fuel cell (FC) application in vehicular technology has gained much popularity since the past few years. Typically, fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicle (FCHEV) consists of fuel cell, battery and/or ultracapacitor (UC) as the power sources. The power converter is integrated to the power sources to form the hybrid FC system. This helps to compensate the drawback of individual power sources. Apart from the technical efficiency of power sources itself, the performance of an FCHEV is governed by the efficiency of power electronics and associated controller. In this paper, a state-of-the-art of vehicle classification is reviewed, in which the focus is placed on the deployment of fuel cell, battery, ultracapacitor and flywheel. The configurations used in FCHEV, followed by the updated power converter topologies, are also discussed. The topologies are categorized and discussed according to the power stages and control techniques used in the configurations. Then, multiple stages conversion and single stage topologies are described chronologically. The advantages and disadvantages of each topology, safety standards, current situation and environmental impact of FCHEV are also discussed. In addition, the current development of FCHEV, challenges and future prospects are also elaborated. The rapid growth of FC based research and technology has paved great prospects for FCHEVs in the near future, with the prediction of the competitive cost of hydrogen as compared to gasoline.
