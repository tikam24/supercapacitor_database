In this work, 3D interconnected porous vanadium oxide network is prepared by a facile and effective method through controlling solution polarity at room temperature. The resulted samples were systemically characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM and electrochemical measurements to study the synthesis-structure- performance correlation and further used for the electrochemical capacitive energy storage. The experimental results indicate that the microstructure of the as-prepared samples can be effectively tailored by the polarity of reaction solution and the obtained 3D interconnected network delivers a high specific capacitance of 280 F g-1, providing promising potentials as an electrode material for high-performance supercapacitor.
