This paper reports the facile preparation of silver (Ag)-decorated, PEDOT:PSS-wrapped MnO2 nanowire ternary electrode materials for supercapacitor applications. Surface morphology of Ag–PEDOT:PSS–MnO2 material revealed the presence of Ag nanoparticles onto PEDOT:PSS wrapped MnO2 nanowires. This reduces the charge transfer resistance and improves charge transportation between the current collector and active material. The Ag–PEDOT:PSS–MnO2 electrode exhibited enhanced specific capacitance (838 Fg−1), energy density (0.486 kWh kg−1), and capacitance retention (86.8%). In addition, Ag–PEDOT:PSS–MnO2-based symmetric supercapacitor device exhibited ideal capacitive behavior. This study revealed a facile way to improve the electrochemical activity of MnO2 that can also be adopted for other metal oxides.
