This paper describes a simple and fast process for the fabrication of flexible and textile-based supercapacitors. Symmetric electrodes made up of binder-free ternary composites of manganese oxide (MnO2) nanoparticles, single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) and a conducting polymer (either polyaniline (PANI) or poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)) were layer-by-layer deposited onto cotton substrates by dip coating method. Solid-state supercapacitor devices were assembled using a gel electrolyte. Specific capacitances of 294F/g and 246F/g were obtained for MnO2/SWNT/PANI and MnO2/SWNT/PEDOT:PSS ternary nanocomposite supercapacitors, respectively. Power densities for these supercapacitors were 746.5W/kg and 640.5W/kg for MnO2/SWNT/PANI and MnO2/SWNT/PEDOT:PSS, respectively. Good capacity retention (more than 70%) upon cycling over 1000 times was achieved for both electrode compositions. Supercapacitors demonstrated in this work would be well suited as disposable power sources for wearable and intelligent textiles.
