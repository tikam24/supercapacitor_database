LPWAN systems and low power sensors are used nowadays in many applications where long-range communications at a low bit-rate are required. This paper presents a photovoltaic panel powered IoT multi sensor using LoRa technology for data transmission. This type of sensor is intended to be mounted in outside isolated areas and can transmit data once a day when the required power for the transmitter (in this case LoRaWAN module) is enough. Moreover, information can be obtained from surfaces that can cover areas of tens of square kilometers without human intervention. Given these conditions, the replacement of a conventional sensor battery may become a major or not even a feasible issue due to the high costs that can be more than the sensor itself. The experimental results show that using only a single photovoltaic panel, the node can communicate with the LoRaWAN Gateway without any issues.
