A facile synthesis strategy is developed for synthesizing nanohybrids of reduced graphene oxide/tungsten disulfide/tungsten oxide (G/TS/TO). The as-prepared nanohybrids can effectively combine the electrical double-layer capacitance and pseudo-capacitance when used as the working electrode of supercapacitor. The specific capacitance value of the G/TS/TO-based working electrode is 148.5 mF cm −2 at current density of 0.1 mA cm −2 in the three-electrode setup. Owing to the high electrical conductivity of tungsten oxide, large electrode/electrolyte interfaces of tungsten disulfide and facile electron transfer as well as high surface area of reduced graphene oxide, the G/TS/TO performs an excellent rate capability. A 90% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles of charge/discharge process is also obtained for the symmetrical all-solid-state supercapacitor device fabricated by G/TS/TO. This study provides a new research strategy for electrode materials based on tungsten-containing semiconductors in high rate capability supercapacitors.
