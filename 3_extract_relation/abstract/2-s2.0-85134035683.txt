Emerging demands to achieve zero carbon emissions and develop renewable energy resources necessitate the development of appropriate energy storage systems. To achieve this, several alternatives to conventional energy storage devices, such as Li-ion batteries or capacitors to more sustainable and scalable energy storage systems, are being explored. Supercapacitors, possess unique characteristics that include high power, long life, and environmental-friendly design. They may be used to bridge the energy-power gap between typical capacitors and fuel cells/batteries. Recently, structural supercapacitors being capable of storing electrochemical energy besides bearing mechanical load have caught the attention of researchers. As such, efforts have been made worldwide to study both the fundamental and applied aspects of structural supercapacitors. Further, the possibility of using construction materials for interdisciplinary applications is being studied because they are relatively cheap and easily available. Thus, construction materials can be considered as potential candidates for the development of structural supercapacitors. Herein an overview on the use of construction materials, such as Portland cement concrete, geopolymer concrete, and bricks, as a component of structural supercapacitors has been presented.
