Electrode materials with a high specific capacitance, outstanding reversibility and excellent cycle stability are constantly pursued for supercapacitors. In this paper, we present an approach to improve the electrochemical performance by combining the advantages of both inorganic and organic. Ni-MnO2/PANi-co-PPy composites are synthesized, with the copolymer of aniline/pyrrole being coated on the surface of Ni-doped manganese dioxide nanospheres. The inorganic-organic composite enables a substantial increase in its specific capacitance and cycle stability. When the mass ratio of Ni-MnO2 to aniline and pyrrole mixed monomer is 1:5, the composite delivers high specific capacitance of 445.49F/g at a scan rate of 2mV/s and excellent cycle stability of 61.65% retention after 5000 cycles. The results indicate that the Ni-MnO2/PANi-co-PPy composites are promising electrode materials for future supercapacitors application.
