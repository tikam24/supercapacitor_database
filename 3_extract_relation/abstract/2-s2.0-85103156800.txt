Hierarchical porous carbon materials with high surface area and large porosity derived from biomass are desired for the sustainable development of low-cost electrode materials for advanced energy storage devices. The electrochemical supercapacitance performance of washnut seed-derived nanoporous carbon materials in aqueous electrolyte (1M H2SO4) on a three-electrode system was investigated. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) activation of the pre-carbonized Washnut seed powder at high temperatures (800°C-1000°C) under nitrogen atmosphere yielded nanoporous carbons with hierarchical micro- and mesoporous structure with well-developed porosity. The surface areas and pore volumes were in the range of 2005 to 2185 sq m/g and 1.370 to 2.002 cu cm/g, respectively. The as-prepared materials showed outstanding electrochemical energy storage performance achieving a high specific capacitance of 288.7 F/g at a current density of 1A/g followed by a high rate capability sustaining 67.2% capacitance even at a high current density of 50 A/g with only a small capacity loss (<2%) after 10,000 charging/discharging cycles.
