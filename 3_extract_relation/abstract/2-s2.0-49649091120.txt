The supercapacitor is an emerging technology in the area of energy storage and is also a promising device for certain applications. The Supercapacitor is a very complex device that is best represented by a distributed parameter system. This paper proposes a new equivalent circuit of asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor(AHS). The asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor equivalent circuit consists of the battery equivalent circuit and the electric double layer capacitor equivalent circuit. A method to identify the circuit parameters, which is called two-electrode method, is presented. Measurements of asymmetric hybrid supercapacitors for power applications are presented, analyzed. At last, the results are compared between Matlab simulation results and experimental results. Â© 2008 DRPT.
