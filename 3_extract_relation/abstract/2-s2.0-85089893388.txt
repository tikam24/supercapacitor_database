Epoxy is a versatile resin for polymeric blend formation. Epoxy/polyaniline combinations have received increasing attention owing to exclusive structural features and outstanding physicochemical properties. Nanocarbon (carbon nanotube, graphene) and inorganic nanofillers have been reinforced in epoxy/polyaniline to further enhance electrical, mechanical, and thermal characteristics. This review is basically intended to promote understanding of properties, fabrication, and technical impact of epoxy/polyaniline nanocomposite. Brief prolog to epoxy, polyaniline, and epoxy/polyaniline along with up-to-date advancements in design and characteristics of epoxy/polyaniline nanocomposite have been presented here. A state-of-the-art demonstration of epoxy/polyaniline nanocomposite in anticorrosion, radiation shielding, supercapacitor, and antibacterial applications have also been stated.
