Alternative energy is the need of the hour in today's world. And when it comes to alternative energy sources, the world of science is trying to find ways to increase the efficiency of these sources as much as Is possible. After cost and efficiency, storage is the biggest obstacle preventing widespread use of renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. The ability to store energy when it is produced is an essential waypoint on the road to turning alternative energy into regular energy. This problem of storage can be solved by supercapacitors[1] as these can store more energy as compared to the conventional capacitors. The properties of supercapacitors are greatly affected by its internal materials and the procedure of construction [2]. This paper focuses on the effect of using different types of carbon for the making of the supercapacitor on the capacitance and its other properties. Also the effect on these properties was observed by applying different techniques during the construction of the electrolytes for the supercapacitor. The two techniques used for putting the overcoat (the second layer) of the metal oxide and activated were drop method and dip method. The change by varying the proportion of the active carbon and the metal oxide was also observed and studied. This paper gives an extensive analysis on the various ways of making a supercapacitor in a quest to find the most effective procedure, so that the supercapacitor with the best performance can be obtained.
