This chapter discusses the use of deep eutectic solvent-assisted syntheses which allow the preparation of both chemically and structurally modified carbon monoliths suitable as electrodes in supercapacitor cells. Either carbons or carbon-carbon nanocomposites exhibiting a hierarchical structure and a tailored composition (either nitrogen or phosphorus doped) could be attained by the use of different mixtures of deep eutectic solvents (DESs). Carbons prepared from DESs are also suitable for CO2 adsorption and CO2-N2 and/or CO2-CH4 separation processes. These features, besides the low-cost character of our carbons, open interesting perspectives for their application as sorbents in separation technologies for CO2 low-pressure post-combustion processes and natural gas upgrading.
