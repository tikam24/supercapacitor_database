Ordered mesoporous carbon nanospheres (OMCNS) were prepared through a facile soft-template method and used as electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors. The obtained OMCNS possesses a hierarchical porous structure and a relatively high mass density. And the OMCNS electrode exhibits both high gravimetric (173 F g- 1) and volumetric (107 F cm- 3) capacitances simultaneously, as well as a high rate capability and a long-term cycling stability.
