Different Bi2S3 nanoarchitectures (nanorods and nanobelts) were successfully synthesized with a facile solvothermal method at different temperature. The nanobelts transformed into nanorods when the temperature was 200 °C increased from 150 °C. The nanorod-morphology was kept even the temperature was further increased. The galvanostatic charge/discharge performance showed that the prepared Bi2S3 nanorods had good performance of discharge efficiency at current density from 1 A g−1 to 4 A g−1. The specific capacitance was 270 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. Furthermore, the nanorods were also used as the efficient UV-light photocatalysts for the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB), which showed almost complete degradation (∼87%) of RhB dye at 100 min.
