A facile one-step electrodeposition method to synthesis of ruthenium oxide/ graphene (ERG/RuO2) nano-composite has been developed. The SEM and TEM revealed the three-dimensional (3D) porous ERG decorated by RuO2 nanoparticle with the size of less than 5 nm. The electrochemical tests showed that the ERG/RuO2 nanocomposites exhibited distinct pseudocapacitive characteristic with a high specific capacitance and an outstanding rate capability, and even after 5000 cycles the capacity retention was still maintained at 80.2%. These results suggest that ERG/RuO2 electrode as electrode material of supercapacitor has great prospects.
