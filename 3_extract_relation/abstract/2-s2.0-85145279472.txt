Highly conductive and stretchable fibers are of great significance for wearable applications. Practical applications usually require high robustness and repeatability for these electronics under various mechanical deformations, which is a contradiction for most of existing strain-sensitive fibers conductors. In this work, core–shell hydrogel fiber with adjustable three-dimensional (3D) helical structure was fabricated, in which Ti3C2Tx (MXene)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) were modified onto the surface of helical sodium alginate/polyacrylic acid (SA/PAA) hydrogel fibers via the combination of in situ polymerization and electrostatic assembly. The hybrid fiber possess a insensitive conductance (<5% resistance change) under various deformation, including stretching (0–800 %), bending (0-180°), pressuring and twisting, attributed to both the double tortuous conductive network and pre-strain release from helical structure. Moreover, conductance-stable helical fibers could be appropriately assembled into coaxial energy fibers and integrated into fabric, both acting as strain-insensitive energy storage device and self-powered wearable sensor.
