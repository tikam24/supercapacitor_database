In this study, nickel sulfide (Ni3S2) thin film was electrodeposited on Ni foam substrate by using a facile potentiodynamic (PD) and pulse-reversal (PR) method, respectively. After optimization of deposition parameters, the optimized Ni3S2 electrode was prepared by using PR mode under -1 V pulse-on potential, 0 V pulse-reversal potential, duty cycle of 0.5 and pulse frequency of 0.1 Hz. It delivered an impressive specific capacity up to 179.5 mAh g-1 at current density of 2 A g-1.The hybrid supercapacitor (SC) was assembled by using the optimized Ni3S2 electrode as cathode and activated carbon fiber cloth (ACFC) as anode, respectively. The Ni3S2//ACFC hybrid SC exhibited a high specific capacity of 26.7 mAh g-1 at charge-discharge current density of 2 A g-1 and displayed a maximum energy density of 26.4 Wh kg-1 at 1978 W kg-1 based on the total mass of active material of 9.2 mg. Furthermore, the Ni3S2//ACFC hybrid SC showed an impressive excellent cycling performance in 1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte at current density of 2 A g0-1, with 97% specific capacitance retained after cycling of 400-5000 consecutive charge/discharge tests.
