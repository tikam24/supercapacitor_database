Mesoporous hybrid NiOx-MnOx nanoprisms have been successfully prepared in this work. The synthesis process involves a facile solvothermal method for preparation of Ni-Mn precursor particles and a subsequent annealing treatment. These mesoporous hybrid NiOx-MnOx nanoprisms have a high surface area of 101.6 m2 g-1. When evaluated as electrode materials in supercapacitors, the as-prepared mesoporous hybrid NiOx-MnOx nanoprisms deliver a specific capacitance of 1218 F g-1 at a current density of 2.0 A g-1. More importantly, the mesoporous hybrid NiOx-MnOx nanoprisms were successfully used to construct flexible solid-state asymmetric supercapacitors. The device shows a specific capacitance of 149.1 mF cm-2 at 2.0 mA cm-2, a good cycling stability with only 2.9% loss of capacitance after 5000 charge-discharge cycles, and good mechanical flexibility under different bending angles. These results support the promising application of mesoporous hybrid NiOx-MnOx nanoprisms as advanced supercapacitor materials.
