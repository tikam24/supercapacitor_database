Nanotechnology now offers great ability for storage of electrical energy. The energy storage capability of copper oxide/silver (CuO–Ag) nanocomposite has been investigated using supercapacitor studies. The observation of a peak at 309 nm confirmed the surface plasmon absorption bands in the ultraviolet region. The functional molecules present in the prepared sample were clearly classified by Fourier-transform infrared studies. The crystalline structure of the fabricated nanomaterials followed the monoclinic system. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy evidenced CuO nanomaterial with flake-like structure (∼ 380 nm in size) and Ag nanomaterial with spherical structure (∼ 200 nm in size). Energy-dispersive spectroscopy studies confirmed the purity of the sample by the absence of impurities. The CuO–Ag nanocomposite synthesized using a green method provided remarkable specific capacitance (594 F/g) and stable efficiency during continuous cycles. Electrochemical impedance studies revealed a remarkable improvement in the conductivity (Ret for CuO = 738 Ω, Ret for CuO–Ag = 721 Ω) of the prepared materials.
