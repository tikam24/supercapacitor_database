Carbon-nanotube (CNT)-based textile supercapacitors with MnO2 nanoparticles have excellent power and energy densities, but MnO2 nanoparticles can be delaminated during charge-discharge cycles, which results in significant degradation in capacitance. In this study, polypyrrole conductive polymer was coated on top of MnO2 nanoparticles that are deposited on CNT textile supercapacitor to prevent delamination of MnO2 nanoparticles. An increase of 38% in electrochemical energy capacity to 461 F/g was observed, while cyclic reliability also improved, as 93.8% of energy capacity was retained over 10 000 cycles. Energy density and power density were measured to be 31.1 Wh/kg and 22.1 kW/kg, respectively. An in situ electrochemical-mechanical study revealed that polypyrrole-MnO2-coated CNT textile supercapacitor can retain 98.5% of its initial energy capacity upon application of 21% tensile strain and showed no observable energy storage capacity change upon application of 13% bending strain. After imposing cyclic bending of 750 000 cycles, the capacitance was retained to 96.3%. Therefore, the results from this study confirmed for the first time that the polypyrrole-MnO2-coated CNT textile can reliably operate with high energy and power densities with in situ application of both tensile and bending strains.
