A series of CuCo 2 O 4 nanostructures with different morphologies were prepared by a hydrothermal method in combination with thermal treatment. The morphology, structure and composition were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. As the electrode materials for supercapacitors, CuCo 2 O 4 nanoneedles delivered the highest specific capacitance compared with other CuCo 2 O 4 nanostructures. Electrochemical performance measurements demonstrate that the carbon layer can improve the electrochemical stability of CuCo 2 O 4 nanoneedles. The CuCo 2 O 4 @C electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 1432.4 F g −1 at a current density of 1 A g −1 , with capacitance retention of 98.2% after 3000 circles. These characteristics of CuCo 2 O 4 @C composite are mainly due to the unique one dimensional needle-liked architecture and the conducting carbon, which provide a faster ion/electron transfer rate. These excellent performances of the CuCo 2 O 4 @C electrode confirmed the material as a positive electrode for hybrid supercapacitor application.
