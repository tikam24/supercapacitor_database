This paper presents a preliminary study about a battery ageing methodology of a storage system formed by supercapacitors and lead-acid battery. The design of the hybrid system, based on a simple power flow management - the battery current clipping - is briefly summarized in order to outline the main benefit of the hybridization: the reduction of losses within the battery. The experimental setup will allow quantifying the impact of the hybridization on the battery lifetime by means of energy exchange between two energy storages, the hybrid one and a battery.
