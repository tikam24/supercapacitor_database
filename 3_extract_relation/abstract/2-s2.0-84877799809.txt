High specific surface area (SSA ~2000m2/g) porous KOH-activated microwave exfoliated graphite oxide ('a-MEGO') electrodes have been tested in a eutectic mixture of ionic liquids (1:1 by weight or molar ratio N-methyl-N-propylpiperidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (PIP13-FSI) and N-butyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (PYR14-FSI)) as electrolyte for supercapacitor applications. By optimizing the carbon/electrolyte system, outstanding capacitive performance has been achieved with high capacitance (up to 180F/g) and wide electrochemical window (up to 3.5V) over a wide temperature range from -50°C to 80°C. This is the first demonstration of a carbon-ionic liquid system capable of delivering capacitance in excess of 100F/g below room temperature. The excellent electrochemical response of the proposed couple shows that optimization of the carbon/electrolyte interface is of great importance for improving capacitive energy storage. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
