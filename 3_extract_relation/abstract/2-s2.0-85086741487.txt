Nickel-manganese phosphate/graphene foam (GF) composite was successfully synthesized through a simple and direct hydrothermal approach, serving as highly efficient electrodes for hybrid device. Ni and Mn are both redox metals owing to their multiple oxidation states however, Ni-based materials possess higher capacity due to its strong faradic mechanism while Mn-based materials offer pseducapacitive nature and GF for its ability to improve the surface area as well as the electrical conductivity of the composite. Consequently, the prepared NiMn(PO4)2/GF composite achieved a maximum specific capacity of 97 mAh g − 1 at 0.5 A g − 1 in a 3-electrode configuration setup compared to 63 mAh g − 1 for the pristine material. Thus, NiMn(PO4)2/GF considered as a positive electrode in a hybrid device with carbon derived from Capsicum (bell pepper) seeds “peppered”-activated carbon (ppAC) as a negative electrode. The hybrid device reported a maximum energy density of 35.42 Wh kg−1 corresponding to a power density of 538 W kg−1 at 0.5 A g − 1. The NiMn(PO4)2/GF//ppAC hybrid device also showed high stability of 97.8% capacity retention over 10,000 cycles at 6 A g − 1, ∼93% float time efficiency after 120 h and could still preserve ∼1.17 V against its initial cell potential of 1.5 V after 60 h of self-discharge. The outstanding performance of NiMn(PO4)2/GF material in a half and full cell makes it a good candidate for supercapacitor application.
