The high degree of mechanical, electrical, and thermal conductivity of graphene enables its application in the renewable energy sector. Graphene plays a vital role in diodes, photovoltaic cells, supercapacitors, batteries, and full cells applications and it enhances the existing efficiency in a tremendous way. The addition of graphene can do tremendous effects on all kinds of inorganic and organic materials for solar cells. In the supercapacitor domain, graphene plays a vital role to provide a large surface which can be useful for energy storage applications. The hybrid supercapacitor and battery trends in research and technology have been discussed. The electrical vehicles and green applications need and accomplishments of graphene and its derivatives have also been described.
