The escalating power and energy need for upcoming portable and flexible electronics have triggered intense research on lightweight, flexible, and environmentally friendly energy storage systems. Supercapacitors offer immense promise as portable electronic device power sources, but their performance is heavily dependent on the quality of electrode materials. Many efforts have been made to produce electrode materials with improved electrochemical characteristics, which have emerged as a viable solution to the fundamental challenges of supercapacitors. Therefore, this work reviews nanomaterials using 2D nanosheets in supercapacitor applications. This review begins with different energy storage mechanisms and briefly describes how different materials can be designed and developed to achieve suitable electrodes without compromising their stability while pursuing high-energy density supercapacitor. Then, it focuses on varies electrode materials, which are carbon-based materials, metal oxides, conductive polymers, and metal organic frameworks. Discussion on the challenges and future potential of using nanosheets to develop high-performance supercapacitors. It is envisaged that these principles and methodologies may be applied to other nanomaterials and used as a starting point for future research in the disciplines of energy conversion, storage, and environmental protection.
