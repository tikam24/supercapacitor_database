Tin oxide/carbon nanocomposite (TOCNC) was synthesized using a liquid phase plasma method, to be used as the electrode of supercapacitor. Spherical tin oxide amorphous nanoparticles with the size of 5 nm were dispersed uniformly on activated carbon powder (ACP) surface. The quantity of tin oxide nanoparticle precipitate increased with increasing LPP duration and the specific capacitance of TOCNC increased with increasing LPP duration. The TOCNC prepared through the LPP process showed smaller resistances and larger initial resistance slopes than bare ACP and this effect was intensified by increasing the LPP process duration.
