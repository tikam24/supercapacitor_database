Whether or not specific ion effects determine the charge storage properties of aqueous graphene and graphite-based supercapacitors remains a highly debated topic. In this work we present a multiscale quantum mechanics â€“ classical molecular dynamics (QMMD) investigation of aqueous mono- and divalent salt electrolytes in contact with fully polarizable charged graphene sheets. By computing both the electrochemical double layer (EDL) and quantum capacitance we observe a constant electrode specific capacitance with cationic radii and charge. Counterintuitively, we determine that a switch in the cation adsorption mechanism from inner to outer Helmholtz layers leads to negligible changes to the EDL capacitance, this appears to be due to the robust electronic structure of the graphene electrodes. However, the ability of ions (such as K+) with a relatively low hydration free energy to penetrate the inner Helmholtz plane and adsorb directly on the electrode surface is found to slow their diffusion parallel to the interface. Ions in the outer Helmholtz layer are found to have higher diffusivity at the surface due to their position in ion channels between water layers. Our results show that surface effects such as the surface polarization and the partial dehydration and local structuring of ions on the surface underpin the behaviour of cations at the interface and add a vital new perspective on trends in ion mobilities seen under confinement.
