In this research, supercapacitor is used in the electric vehicle along with the battery. The electric vehicle performance is increased with the supercapacitor. The supercapacitor is switched on at the time of slope. The load on the battery at the time of slope is eliminated using the supercapacitor. The battery is protected from drawing the over current at the time of slope. The battery life is also increased with the use of supercapacitor. The switching of supercapacitor is done automatically.
