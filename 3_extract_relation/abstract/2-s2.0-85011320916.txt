The realization of high-power lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is heavily hampered by intrinsically slow lithium diffusion within solid electrodes. Capacitive-like lithium storage behavior observed in transition-metal oxide (TMO)-based anodes shed light on attaining battery-like capacity and supercapacitor-like rate performance simultaneously. Herein, “honeycomb”-like Mn2O3 films were successfully demonstrated as anodes for LIBs, in which the pseudocapacitive effect is strengthened upon cycling, resulting in a high-rate lithium storage capability. Such pseudocapacitance originates from the unique porous structure and cycle-induced microstructure evolution. The reticular Mn2O3 can reach 1584.9 mAh g−1 over 250 cycles at 1 A g−1, 1564.9 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at 5 A −1, and 475.6 mAh g−1 at 15 A g−1.
