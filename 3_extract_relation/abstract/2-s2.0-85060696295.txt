A microsphere discrete structure of CoNi2S4 was prepared through one-pot hydrothermal reaction and characterized by FTIR, XRD and SEM. The as-prepared CoNi2S4 served as a supercapacitor, showing a specific capacitance of 1129.5 F/g with over 99% coulombic efficiency at a current density of 4 A/g in 3 M KOH. And after 3000 cycles of charge and discharge tests, 92.3% of its initial capacitance can be still maintained. The results demonstrate that the material is promising as an electrode material for supercapacitors in energy storage.
