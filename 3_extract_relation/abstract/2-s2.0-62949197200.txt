Carbon materials enriched with nitrogen and oxygen surface functional groups were obtained by pyrolyzing strained beer yeast at 750 °C under an inert atmosphere. Physical and surface properties of the carbon obtained were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectrometry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Results show that the carbon possesses an amorphous structure, a spherical morphology, and a high density of surface functional groups. Electrochemical properties were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, a galvanostatic charge-discharge technique, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The carbon has 989.65 mAh•g -1 of initial discharge capacity and a stable cycle performance for a Li-C cell. A specific capacitance of 120 F•g -1 was obtained for a single carbon electrode and good cycle performance was achieved for a symmetrical supercapacitor fabricated using this carbon. These carbons derived from strained beer yeast have promising applications in energy storage and conversion systems. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.
