Electrode material of MnO2 hollow nanosphere was synthesized via a simple hydrothermal process in the presence of Ce ion. Ce ion played a crucial role in controlling the morphology and crystalline structure of MnO2. The hollow nanosphere consisted of nanorods, and Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) specific surface area of the hollow nanosphere was 315.2 m2·g-1. Electrochemical behavior of MnO2 electrode material was measured by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge. Better electrochemical properties of MnO2 electrode could be obtained when mole ratio of Ce to Mn was 0.2, and specific capacitance of as-prepared MnO2 electrode was 178.6 F·g-1, 2.6 times higher than MnO2 electrode without Ce ions. Moreover, MnO2 electrode exhibited remarkable cyclability, and specific capacitance retained 90.5% even after 1000 cycles. Ce ion was favorable for forming a hollow structure, and improved specific capacitance of MnO2 electrode.
