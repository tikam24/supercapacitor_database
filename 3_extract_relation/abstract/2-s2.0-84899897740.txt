This paper describes the propulsion modeling, systems design, and conversion of a General Motors EV1 electric vehicle into a series hybrid. The vehicle is refitted with a gasoline engine generator set and ultracapacitor-only electrical storage system. A detailed propulsion model was developed using the vehicular physical and electrical properties and the desired control characteristics. This model was refined through experimental road trials and generator set testing with electronic loads to determine the fuel consumption at various power levels, thereby predicting the vehicle fuel economy. The series hybrid design allows an excellent fuel economy to be attained for a variety of driving schedules, and ultracapacitors are shown to be an effective standalone electrical storage medium for hybrid vehicles designed to maximize the fuel economy rather than for the electric-only driving range.
