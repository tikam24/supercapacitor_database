The paper introduces a method for balancing the cell voltages of an energy storage device with super-capacitors (SuperCap) in vehicle drives, developed by the Voith Group. It is based on a consequent monitoring and control of each single cell. The balancing process takes place continuously during the driving operation. In this way all cells are balanced at the maximum charging voltage. This leads to a uniform ageing of all cells which prolongs the life of the energy storage.
