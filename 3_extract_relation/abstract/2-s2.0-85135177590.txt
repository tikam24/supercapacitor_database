In this study, a MnNiO3/Ni6MnO8 composite is synthesized under the hydrothermal condition of 120–160 ℃ through different growth time. The three-dimensional (3D) flower-like MnNiO3/Ni6MnO8 nanospheres are successfully obtained under the reaction condition of 140 ℃ for 10 h. The unique 3D spherical structure of MnNiO3/Ni6MnO8 with mesopores can facilitate the transport of electrolyte ions and generate more redox active sites. The specific capacity of MnNiO3/Ni6MnO8 can reach 70.6 mAh/g at 1 A/g, and reserve 70.1% even at 10 A/g. What's more, the MnNiO3/Ni6MnO8 composite displays excellent cycling stability that the capacity has almost no degradation after 6000 cycles at 3 A/g. In addition, the energy storage mechanism of MnNiO3/Ni6MnO8 is also studied and the results show that it is a battery type electrode material dominated by diffusion-controlled process. Moreover, the as-prepared MnNiO3/Ni6MnO8 nanospheres are further used to assemble a hybrid device. The device can provide a specific energy of 22.3 Wh/kg at a specific power of 1074.7 W/kg. The specific capacity of 122% is kept after 10000 cycles at 8 A/g, revealing its superior cycling stability. As expected, the commercial LEDs with different colors can be lit up by MnNiO3/Ni6MnO8//AC device, indicating that the as-prepared MnNiO3/Ni6MnO8 electrode has good application potential.
