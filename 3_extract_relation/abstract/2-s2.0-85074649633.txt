Graphene is a two-dimensional allotrope of the carbon element, which is one of the most powerful materials of the 21st century. In order to facilitate the processing of the graphene, solvent-supported methods such as rotation coating, layer by layer assembly, and filtration are used. Single layer graphene prevents agglomeration of the material while reducing reactions occur. According to the studies in the literature, the chemical functionalization of graphene is performed by covalent and non-covalent modification techniques on substrate like copper. Besides, graphene can be used in many material production areas, such as polymer nanocomposites, drug delivery system, supercapacitor devices, solar cells, biosensors, and memory devices.
