Nitrogen doped hierarchical activated carbons with high surface areas and different pore structures are prepared form polyacrylonitrile fibers through KOH activation by two steps. It is found that the specific surface area and porosity of the activated carbons depend strongly on the activation temperatures. The specific surface area increases from 607 m2 g-1 to 3797 m2 g-1 when the activation temperature increases from 600 °C to 800 °C, and then decreases to 3379 m2 g-1 at 900 °C. It shows that the hierarchical activated carbon prepared at a moderate activation temperature of 700 °C exhibits the largest CO2 capture amount, i.e., 5.25 and 3.63 mmol g-1 at 273 and 298 K, respectively, under the pressure of 1 bar. The excellent CO2 capture properties are due to the high specific surface area of 2146 m2 g-1 and high nitrogen content (5.2 wt%) of the obtained sample. On the other hand, when used as supercapacitor electrodes, the sample with the activation temperature at 800 °C shows the largest specific capacitance of 302 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte, with an excellent rate capability of 231 F g-1 at 10 A g-1. Furthermore, a nearly linear relationship between nitrogen content in the nitrogen doped activated carbons and specific CO2 uptake as well as the specific capacitance were first established, indicating nitrogen doping was playing key roles in improving CO2 adsorption and supercapacitor performance. The experimental results indicate that the thus obtained nitrogen doped hierarchical activated carbons are very promising for reducing CO2 green house gas by adsorption as well as storing energy as utilized in supercapacitors.
