Boron and nitrogen co-doped reduced graphene oxide (BN-rGO) materials were prepared via a facile dielectric barrier discharge plasma treatment method. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results demonstrated that the boron content in the boron-doped rGO (B-rGO) and BN-rGO is 1.21 at.% and 1.41 at.%, while the nitrogen content in the nitrogen-doped rGO (N-rGO) and BN-rGO is 2.12 at.% and 2.69 at.%, respectively. The doping of heteroatoms significantly improves the capacitance of the as-synthesized materials, giving BN-rGO a highly enhanced capacitance of 350 F g −1 at a current density of 0.5 A g −1 , which is 2.36, 1.46 and 1.21 times higher than that of rGO, B-rGO or N-rGO, respectively.
