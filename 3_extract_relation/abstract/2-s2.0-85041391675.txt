For flexible film supercapacitor, high areal capacitance is a main evaluating indicator. In this paper, bacterial cellulose (BC) with special three-dimensional structure was used as the natural flexible base material. Fe3O4 nanoparticles with average diameter of 20 nm were synthesized on the surface of BC fibers. The conductive path polypyrrole (PPy) was introduced as shell of BC/Fe3O4 fibers to further improve the pseudo capacitance in 1 mol/L H2SO4 solution. Besides, the BC/Fe3O4@PPy was used for supercapacitor application in acid electrolyte, and delivered higher areal capacitance compared to other Fe3O4 composites in previous reports. The obtained BC/Fe3O4@PPy film showed excellent mechanical strength (tensile strength reached 11 MPa), high areal specific capacitance (5.4 F cm−2 at active mass of 8.4 mg cm−2), and long cycle life (1.95 F cm−2 over 3500 cycles).
