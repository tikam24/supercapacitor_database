Supercapacitors can be classified into two categories, namely, electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) with carbon materials as electrodes and pseudocapacitors with transition metal oxides or conducting polymers as electrodes. However, one major limitation of carbon-based EDLCs is the lower specific energy density. Most of the commercial products available in the market have a specific energy density lower than 10 Whkg−1. This specific energy density value is still relatively lower than the lowest figures for batteries, that is, 35–40 Whkg−1 (lead acid battery). Metal oxides provide an alternative solution as an electrode material because of their high specific capacitance (SC; farad per gram) at low resistance, thereby making it easier to construct high energy and high power density supercapacitors. Several transition metal oxides with various oxidation states represent attractive materials for supercapacitor electrodes owing to their excellent structural stability and high SC. For the transition metal oxides, the reversible redox reactions are primarily responsible for the energy storage in addition to the electric double-layer storage. This makes metal oxides with pseudocapacitance a predominant part in charge storage process in supercapacitors. There have been plenty of researches on utilization of these metal oxides in different nanostructure forms to enhance the overall performance of the supercapacitors. The metal oxides that have been explored as supercapacitor electrodes, including RuO2, NiO, MnO2, Co2O3, IrO2, FeO, TiO2, SnO2, and V2O5, that exhibit high SC values.
