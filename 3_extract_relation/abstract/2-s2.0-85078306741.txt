Hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) that use the nickel hydroxide-graphene hybrid (NGH) as an anode material and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as a cathode material are a promising HSC structure. The NGH electrode is synthesized by one-step, binder-free deposition of a micro-size hydroxide powder and graphite powder mixture on nickel foam by the nanoparticle deposition system (NPDS). The NPDS is classified as a vacuum kinetic spraying approach. The electrochemical performance of the NGH-10 electrode in a 3-electrode cell demonstrates a specific capacitance of 3408 F/g at 1 A/g. The NGH-10//rGO HSC displays a specific capacitance of 180 F/g at 1 mA/cm2 in a high operating potential from 0 V to 1.6 V. The NGH-10//rGO HSC has an energy density of 64 Wh/kg @ 411 W/kg, and still 20 Wh/kg @ 8230 W/kg.
