In this paper, we synthesize a polyaniline (PANI) grafted with carbon fiber (CF) composite (PANI-g-CF) linked by amide group (–NH–C[dbnd]O) covalent bond for flexible supercapacitor (SC) electrode material. The –NH–C[dbnd]O covalent bond enhances the interaction between the PANI and CF, which is confirmed by infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectrum, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The PANI-g-CF also extends π-conjugated electrons from CF to PANI, which is revealed by Ultraviolet and visible spectrum and nuclearmagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Due to the strong interaction and π-conjugated electrons, the PANI-g-CF exhibits highly electronically conductivity and benefits rapid charge transfer for charge storage. As a SC electrode material, the PANI-g-CF exhibits specific capacitance of 441F g−1at 1 A g−1with rate capability of 75.43% from 1 A g−1 to 10 A g−1. Especially, PANI in PANI-g-CF possesses high specific capacitance of 1178 F g−1, suggesting the ultra-utilization of PANI for SCs. Due to the ultra-intimate contact of the PANI and CF, The assembled flexible SC using PANI-g-CF as electrode materials shows highly stability in long-term cycle with 88.80% and 92.9% of the initial capacitance after 10,000 cycles and mechanical folding 2000 times, respectively.
