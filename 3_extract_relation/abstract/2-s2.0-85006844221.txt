Metal oxides with hierachical three-dimensional (3D) superstructure, which integrate large surface area with high electrical conductivity, have been regarded as desirable and ideal electrode materials for supercapacitors. In this work, 3D hierarchical CoMoO4@C@MnO2 core-shell nanorod arrays (NRAs) on nickel foam were fabricated by a facile and stepwise hydrothermal approach. The morphologies of CoMoO4 and CoMoO4@C@MnO2 were explicitly investigated. The CoMoO4@C@MnO2 based electrodes exhibited excellent capacitive performances. In comparison to the specific capacitance of CoMoO4 (1080 F g−1 at a current density of 3 A g−1 and 82% retained capacitance over 5000 cycles) The CoMoO4@C@MnO2 based electrodes showed improved performance, delivering specific capacitance up to 1824 F g−1 at 3 A g−1 and 86% retained capacitance over 5000 cycles. The results establish that the binder-free CoMoO4@C@MnO2 is a promising candidate for high performance electrochemical supercapacitors.
