Hybrid CoMoO4 nanorods with carbon (C) and graphene oxide (rGO) are successfully synthesized via one-step hydrothermal process. Hybrid α-CoMoO4 nanorods have shown excellent electrochemical performances compared to pristine CoMoO4 in alkaline electrolyte. Specifically, CoMoO4/C nanorod exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 451.6 F g-1 at the current density of 1 A g-1, whereas CoMoO4/rGO shows high specific capacitance of 336.1 F g-1 at the same current density. Both the hybrid nanorods show good rate capability even at high current density of 20 A g-1 and long-term cyclic stability. The observed electrochemical features of the hybrid CoMoO4 nanostructure could be attributed to the presence of highly conductive carbonaceous material on unique one-dimensional nanorod microstructure which enhances the electrical conductivity of the nanorods thereby allowing faster electrolyte ion diffusion during the redox process. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
