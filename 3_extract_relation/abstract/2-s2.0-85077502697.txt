Prestanding of molybdenum oxides, carbides, oxycarbide, and hetero atoms doped hollow nanotubes are potential electrode materials in energy storage application. However, it has some drawbacks due to the volume changes and capacity loss during charge and discharge cycles when electrode particles are agglomerated. Herein, we have fabricated a nanohybrid of molybdenum oxycarbide (Mo2CxOy) nanoparticles dispersed on nitrogen-doped carbon hollow nanotubes (N-CHNTs) for enhancing the performance of supercapacitor application. The voids of obtained nitrogen doped hollow nanotubes (N-CHNTs) have been created in this Mo2CxOy/N-CHNTs hybrids by the anion exchange mechanism via heat treatment. After aqueous electrolyte optimization, the Mo2CxOy/N-CHNTs nanohybrid has delivered the maximum specific capacitance (810 Fg−1 at 1 Ag−1), excellent rate performance (460 Fg−1 at 10 Ag−1), and outstanding capacitance retention (85.2% for 10 mVs−1 and 81.3% for 1 Ag−1 after 5000 cycles) in 1 M H2SO4 solution. The specific architecture of Mo2CxOy/N-CHNTs nanohybrid would have the potential for the future design of electrode materials in supercapacitor application.
