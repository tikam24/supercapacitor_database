Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) belong to a novel class of materials with several advantages (e.g., ultrahigh porosity, tunable pore size distribution, convenience of synthesis, and structural tailor-ability). However, the insulating nature of MOFs is often recognized as a limiting factor in the extension of their applications, especially in electronic fields. In light of such limitations, various functional or conductive materials have been mixed/intercalated with MOFs to improve their potential for such applications (e.g., rechargeable batteries, optoelectronics, and supercapacitors). Lately, many of these composite materials have been recognized as next-generation electrodes for the development of efficient supercapacitors. In this review article, we have critically reviewed the recent advancements in supercapacitor applications of MOFs and their derived composite structures. Further, we have also discussed the application of various categories of electrolytes (e.g., aqueous, organic, ionic liquids, solid-state, and redox electrolytes) and their impacts on the development of MOF-based supercapacitors.
