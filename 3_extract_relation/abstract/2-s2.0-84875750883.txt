Nowadays the battery of choice for an electric vehicle (EV) is the Li-Ion. To match the range of an internal combustion powered vehicle, the EV needs a battery capable of delivering 30-50kWh (commonly the standard capacity is 15 to 20 kWh). The present paper represents a study on a proposed hybrid supercapacitor-battery electric system to control a reversible electric motor used in demanding application or in automotive applications. When an AC electric motor is used the deceleration energy (power generation control) is recovered and stored in a battery of supercapacitors. The designed method uses an electronic control module that has minimal electromagnetic interference due to switching of the power semiconductor device as it passes through zero voltage and filtering of conducted emissions. The supercapacitor battery allows rapid storage and release of energy of 300 - 400A if needed without using the energy stored in the battery system increasing its life cycle. Â© 2012 SPIE.
