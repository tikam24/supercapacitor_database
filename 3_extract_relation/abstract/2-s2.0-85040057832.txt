This paper describes the preparation and characteristics of a battery capacitor and module for solar power system. A cylindrical 30,000F battery capacitor (60 Ã— 138 mm) was assembled by using the LTO(Li4Ti5O12) electrode as an anode and NMC(LiNiMnCoO2)-LCO(LiCoO2) as a cathode. The battery capacitor has reduced energy density and power density under high CC(constant current) and CP(constant power) conditions. Battery capacitor module (16V, 11Ah) was fabricated using an asymmetric hybrid capacitor with a capacitance of 30,000F. In order to determine the characteristics of the battery capacitor Module for solar power system, battery capacitor cells were connected in series with active balancing circuit. As a result of measuring the 100w LED lamp, it was discharged at the voltage of 15V~10V, and the compensation time at discharge was measured to be about 4979s. Experimental results show that it can be applied to applications related to solar power system by applying battery capacitor module.
