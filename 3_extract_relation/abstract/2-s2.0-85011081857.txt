Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs), and titanium oxide (TiO2) were incorporated in polyaniline (PANI) to enhance the pseudocapacitance and cycle stability of PANI. PANI–MWNTs–TiO2, ternary composite was prepared by in-situ chemical polymerization of aniline in the presence of MWNTs and TiO2. Morphology analysis of ternary composite revealed the uniform covering of MWNTs by PANI nanofibers and TiO2 nanoparticles. The specific capacitance of PANI–MWNTs–TiO2 is 270 F g−1, much higher than that of MWNTs (30 F g−1) and PANI (210 F g−1) electrodes. PANI–MWNTs–TiO2 showed good rate capability with excellent cycling stability.
