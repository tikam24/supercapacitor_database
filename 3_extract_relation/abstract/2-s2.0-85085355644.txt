The controllable introduction of heteroatoms into electrode materials via doping is one of the most effective strategies to realize improved electrochemical reaction kinetics and then electrochemical energy storage properties. Herein, vanadium doped nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxide nanosheet arrays (NCV-LDH NSAs) were prepared via a one-step hydrothermal method and applied as a new class of efficient supercapacitor electrode. Benefiting from the exceptional porosities and abundant electroactive sites, the hierarchical NCV-LDH NSAs based electrodes reveal enhanced pseudocapacitive behaviors. Among all, the NCV-LDH-10 displays the highest performance with a specific capacitance of 2960 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and retains 762 F g−1 at a high current density of 50 A g−1. The asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled based on NCV-LDH-10 hybrid and activated carbon (AC). It achieves a high energy density of 31.95 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 356 W kg−1. It is worth noting that the integrated electrode exhibits remarkable long-term cycling stability at a current density of 10 A g−1 and preserves about 81.8% of its original capacitance after 10,000 continuous cycles. The outcomes achieved can provide a potential chance for practical application in sustainable energy storage systems.
