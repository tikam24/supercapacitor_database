The rapid advancement in electronic devices, electric vehicles, and grid storage stations have lead to a high demand for energy storage devices with enhanced power and energy densities as well as extended lifespans. Lithium ion hybrid capacitors are constructed with battery-type anodes and capacitor-type cathodes, which enables the direct integration of the high energy from lithium ion batteries and high power and long lifetime from supercapacitors, making lithium ion hybrid capacitor one of the most promising energy storage devices. In the past two decades, tremendous efforts have been put into the search for suitable battery-type anode materials with improved Faradaic reaction kinetics so that it can match with the fast non-Faradaic charging rate of the capacitive cathodes. This review aims to provide an up-to-date and comprehensive summary of the battery-type anode materials for high-performance lithium ion hybrid capacitors. To date, a large variety of battery-type anode materials have been explored with smart material design strategies, such as carbonaceous materials, metal oxides, alloys, sulfides, nitirdes, and Mxenes, etc., which will be discussed in detail. A perspective to the challenges and future developing trends of lithium ion hybrid capacitors is proposed to close.
