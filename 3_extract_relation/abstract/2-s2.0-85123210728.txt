In this paper the techniques for measuring capacity and ESR in supercapacitor banks are presented. Modelling and simulations in LTSpice environment were performed. The effect of the sampling frequency, discharge current, electronic load used for ESR measurement is analyzed and an algorithm is proposed to improve the accuracy of the measurements. The measurement errors calculated show the effect of parameters on the measurement results.
