This paper reports the synthesis of lanthanum oxide/hydroxide nanoparticle (LaNPs)-doped rGO nanosheets. The uniform distribution of LaNPs on the rGO nanosheets was confirmed by FESEM, TEM, and elemental analysis. A dramatic change in electrochemical behavior was observed by adjusting the concentration of LaNPs in rGO (LaG ratio = 1:2, 1:1 and 2:1). The LaG 12 showed a better areal capacitance of 889.29 F cm−2 than LaG 11 (428.58 F cm−2) and LaG 21 (260.72 F cm−2). Further, improved cycle stability (84% after 1000 cycles) with good impedance behavior confirms LaG 12 is a suitable electrode material for high-performance supercapacitor fabrication.
