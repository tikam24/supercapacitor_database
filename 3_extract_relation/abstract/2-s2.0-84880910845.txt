The objective of this work to develop nonlinear controller of hybrid energy storage system for electric vehicle. The storage system consists on fuel cell (FC) as a main power source and a supercapacitor (SC) as an auxiliary power source. The power stage of energy conversion consists on a boost converter connected with the main source and a buck-boost converter connected with the auxiliary source. The aim is controlling power converters in order to satisfy the following requirements: i) tight dc bus voltage regulations, ii) perfect tracking of SC current to its reference, and iii) asymptotic stability of the closed loop system. Based on the whole nonlinear system model, a nonlinear controller is then designed using sliding mode technique. It is clearly shown, using formal analysis and simulations that the designed controller meets all the objectives.
