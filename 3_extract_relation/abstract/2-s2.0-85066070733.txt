Supercapacitor has gained significant attention due to its fast charging/discharging speed, high power density and long-term cycling stability in contrast to traditional batteries. In this review, state-of-the-art achievements on supercapacitor electrode based on carbon materials is summarized. In all-carbon composite materials part, various carbon materials including graphene, carbon nanotube, carbon foam and carbon cloth are composited to fabricate larger specific surface area and higher electrical conductivity electrodes. However, obstacles of low power density as well as low cycling life still remain to be addressed. In metal-oxide composites part, carbon nanotube, graphene, carbon fiber fabric and hollow carbon nanofibers combine with MnO2 respectively, which significantly address drawbacks of all-carbon material electrodes. Additionally, TiO2 is incorporated into graphene electrode to overcome the low mechanical flexibility of graphene. In organic active compounds part, conducting polymers are employed to combinate with carbon materials to fabricate high specific capacitance, long-term thermal stability and outstanding electroconductivity flexible textile supercapacitors. In each part, innovation, fabrication process and performance of the resulting composites are demonstrated. Finally, future directions that could enhance the performance of supercapacitors are discussed.
