The Mo2N is a promising candidate electrode material for supercapacitors. The molybdenum nitride nanoparticles embedded in N, O co-doped carbon sheets composite (Mo2NNPs/NOCS) is fabricated via Mo2N nanoparticles in situ growth on the surface of self- sacrifice C3N4. The results show that small size of Mo2N nanoparticles ranged from 1.2 to 1.5 nm are distributed uniformly and embedded in the surface of carbon nanosheet materials. The effects of temperature and ratio of ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate to C3N4 on electrochemical performance are investigated in detail. The maximum specific capacitance can achieve 294 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 after optimization. Further, the supercapacitor device is assembled with a commercial activated carbon YP50 as a positive electrode in an acid electrolyte, delivering a high energy density of 13.6 Wh kg−1.
