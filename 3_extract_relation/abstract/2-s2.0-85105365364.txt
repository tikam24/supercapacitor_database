MOFs have various chemical components and structures, a high-specific surface area, potential redox sites and other significant advantages, which give them broad application prospects in the field of material synthesis as precursors. In this paper, MOF materials were synthesized by the solvent method, and MOF-derived nitrogen self-doped porous carbon materials were prepared by a one-step carbonization method. The effects of carbonization temperature and time on the structure and electrochemical properties of MOF-derived nitrogen self-doped porous carbon materials were investigated. The results show that MOF-derived nitrogen-doped porous carbon has an amorphous graphite carbon structure with a large specific surface area and various pore structures. In a 6 M KOH electrolyte solution, when the current density was 1 A g−1, the MOF-derived nitrogen-doped porous carbon material exhibited a specific capacitance of 219.4 F g−1; after 5000 cycles of constant current charging and discharging, the capacitance retention rate was still 88.94%, showing excellent electrochemical performance and good cycling stability.
