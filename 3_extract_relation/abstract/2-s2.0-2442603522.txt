The use of ionic liquids based on 1-buthyl-3-methyl-imidazolium as electrolytes in an activated carbon//poly(3-methylthiophene) hybrid supercapacitor was investigated. Preliminary results of the electrochemical characterization of electrodes sized for practical use in the supercapacitor and of a laboratory scale cell are reported and compared to those with propylene carbonate-tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate as electrolyte.
