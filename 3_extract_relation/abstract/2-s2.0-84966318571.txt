Graphite oxide (GO) was prepared by a modified Hummer method, and three-dimensional redox graphene oxide-Ag/nickel foam (rGO-Ag/NF) composite prepared by dry immersion method. Its crystalline phase, morphology and composition were characterized, and electrochemical properties analyzed, such as galvanostatic charge-discharge and cyclic voltammogram. The results showed that rGO-Ag/NF composite had a porous structure in which the diameter of Ag particles was 200 nm. At the current density of 5 mA/cm2, its specific capacitance was estimated as 1.59 F/cm2. The composite also had a retention rate of 70% of its initial capacitance after 1000 cycles, indicating excellent recycling stability.
