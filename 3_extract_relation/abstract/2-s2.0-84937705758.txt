This paper presents the establishment of a small DC microgrid incorporating with electric vehicle (EV) as a movable energy storage source. The developed micro-grid consists of wind permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) and photovoltaic (PV) source, battery/super-capacitor/flywheel hybrid energy storage system and grid-connected single-phase three-wire load inverter. Through properly design and control, good operation performances are preserved. And the microgrid-to-grid (M2G) and G2M can be successfully conducted with good power quality. As to the developed EV interior permanent-magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) drive, the super-capacitor (SC) auxiliary storage is equipped to assist the battery source in intermittent energy conversion. Satisfactory acceleration/deceleration/reversible and regenerative braking operation characteristics are obtained, and the successful microgrid-to-vehicle (M2V) and V2M interconnected operations of the EV and micro-grid are achieved.
