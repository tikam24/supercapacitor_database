The NiS nanosheets were fabricated using one-step microwave approach with the microwave radiation of 800 W for 1.5 min. Impressively, the NiS nanosheets revealed praiseworthy electrochemical performance, with a capacitance value of 1082.8 F · g-1 at 1 A · g-1 and 77.8% retention over 5000 cycles at 5 A · g-1. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled with NiS as the positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as the negative electrode. It shows 80.42% capacity retention after 8000 cycles and an energy density of 19.45 W · h · kg-1 at a power density of 801.05 W · kg-1.
