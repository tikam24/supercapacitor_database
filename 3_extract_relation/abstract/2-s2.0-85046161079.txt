A novel manganese hexacyanoferrate/multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MnHCF/MWCNTs) nanocomposite was fabricated by mild chemical precipitation method at room temperature and further investigated as electrode materials for supercapacitors. The physical properties of as-fabricated materials were characterized by XRD, FTIR and FE-SEM techniques. Integrating these nanostructures resulted in a strong synergistic effect between the two materials, consequently leading to robust and superior composite materials with higher capacity compared with pure MnHCF and MWCNTs. Specific capacities of 370.4, 200.1 and 45.8 C g−1 were acquired for MnHCF/MWCNTs nanocomposite, MnHCF and MWCNTs, respectively. Most importantly, as-fabricated MnHCF/MWCNTs nanocomposite exhibited favorable rate capability (370.4 C g−1 and 270.6 C g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 and 6.0 A g−1, respectively) and excellent cycling stability (87.4% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles at 1.0 A g−1). The simple synthesis and excellent electrochemical properties made as-fabricated nanocomposite an attractive candidate in the fields of supercapacitors and new emerging areas.
