In this paper, inorganic/graphene and polymer/graphene composites are mainly introduced. Compared to single component, the inorganic or polymer additions have great improvement on the electrochemical performance and provide the possibility of their application in supercapacitor. The latest application of graphene based composites in supercapacitor is overviewed as well. Â© (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
