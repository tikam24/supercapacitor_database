In recent decades, research into energy storage systems has increased in order to make these technologies more competitive. The objective is to create an energy storage system that allows power to be stored and supplied more cheaply during off-peak hours. Supercapacitors, for example, are energy storage and delivery devices capable of storing and transferring large quantities of energy in a short amount of time. The Nippon supercapacitor's self-discharging behaviour, as well as that of many other supercapacitors, was investigated using data analytic techniques based on this supercapacitor property in order to make it more sustainable. The leaking parallel resistance of a Nippon Supercapacitor as a function of the voltage applied across the capacitor terminal was first calculated and tested. To explain such behaviour, the “Drude free-electron model” was utilised, which states that the electron density in any EDLC (electric double layer capacitance) is proportional to the value of the electric field across the capacitors. Based on this premise, we developed a technique for calculating the capacitance value of supercapacitors using self-discharge data as a function of the voltage applied. Only the self-discharge data of EDLC supercapacitors were used for such a high value of capacitance and voltage-dependent leakage resistance.
