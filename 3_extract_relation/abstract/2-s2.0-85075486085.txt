An eco-friendly method for the preparation of porous carbon monoliths (PCMs) with a high surface area and excellent electrochemical performance was demonstrated. Porous carboxymethyl cellulose monoliths (CMCMs) were prepared by ice-templating technique. PCMs were fabricated by the carbonization of ice-templated porous CMCMs. The prepared PCMs exhibited a high specific surface area of 724.35 m2 g–1 with multi-modal pore structures. The PCM-based electrode showed a high specific capacitance of 210 F g–1 at 1 A g–1 in a 6.0 M KOH electrolyte, and an excellent cycle stability of almost 100% at 10 A g–1 after 10,000 cycles. Therefore, the PCMs prepared in this study are a promising electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.
