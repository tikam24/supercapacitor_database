The publication examines the behavior of supercapacitors when discharging with high pulse currents with a duration of less than 10ms. The declared values of supercapacitor electrical parameters from the manufacturers cannot be applied and are not valid in the tested pulse modes. The study presents the behavior of a supercapacitor when a pulsed current flows through it by estimating the equivalent distributed resistance parameter - EDR. A method for its experimental determination by using a current pulse with a strictly linear leading edge and a constant plateau is proposed. Results from the application of the methodology are presented in the current paper.
