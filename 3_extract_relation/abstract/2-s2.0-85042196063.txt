Mesoporous architectures are remarkable electrode materials for energy storage system due to their large number of active sites and high surface area. Here we report, mesoporous MoS2 particles (pore diameter 34.04 nm) well attached to the surface of thin layered reduced graphene oxide (rGO) via an ultrasonic chemical method for supercapacitor applications. The rGO not only increases the conductivity of MoS2 but also provides a substrate for the attachment of MoS2 with low aggregation. The porous MoS2 provides a large surface area and sufficient way for the fast transport of electrolyte ions toward electrode materials. As a result, the synthesized MoS2/rGO composites exhibited excellent electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance 314.5 F/g in 2M KOH aqueous solution at a scan rate of 10 mV/s and excellent specific capacitance retention (80.02%) after 1000 cycles in a three electrode system for energy storage applications.
