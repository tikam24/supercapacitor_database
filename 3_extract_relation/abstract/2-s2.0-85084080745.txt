With the development of the technology of energy storage system (ESS), the supercapacitors (SCs) are more widely used. The research focusing on the control technology of the state of health (SOH) and the state of charge (SOC) of SCs occupies a critical position. The definition of SOH and SOC and the functional relationship between SOH and SOC are described in this paper. Two commonly used control methods are listed. Then, the SOH control methods and the SOC control strategy of SCs in the last three years are cited and the characteristics of them are explained. At the end of the article, the future control methods of SOH and SOC for SCs are proposed.
