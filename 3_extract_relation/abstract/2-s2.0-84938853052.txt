In this paper, polyaniline (PANI) film was prepared on the surface of commercially available activated carbon (AC) to from AC–PANI electrode by Electrochemical method. Compared with each individual component the synthesized electrode shows higher electrochemical capacitance as well as excellent cycling stability. The specific capacitance can achieve a maximum of 240 F/g at a charge–discharge density of 0.2 A/g and still exhibits as high as 157 F/g at 10 A/g. Moreover, the composites retain about 83% at a current density of 2 A/g after 500 cycles, indicating excellent stability of that electrode. As a result, the low-cost AC–PANI electrode material indicates great potential for commercial application.
