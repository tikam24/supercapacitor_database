N, O self-doped hierarchical porous carbon has been successfully synthesized through a facile chemical activation method using corn silk as raw material, where the texture properties of the samples can be tailored via changing the quantity of the Na2CO3 activator. The optimal sample with a BET surface area of 1269.79 m2 g−1 and a nitrogen content of 2.48 at% exhibited the highest specific capacitance of 158.2 F g−1 and 196.3 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in basic and acidic solution, respectively. In addition, the high capacitance contributions (86.2% in basic solution and 72.6% in acidic solution at 10 mV s−1) imply a capacitive controlled mechanism. These results indicate that the synthesis of heteroatom-doped porous carbon from biomass can be a potential approach for developing effective materials in supercapacitors.
