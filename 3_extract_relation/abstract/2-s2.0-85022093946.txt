Careful design and planning is essential for successful integration of energy storage system (ESS) in a shipboard dc hybrid power system. An optimization model for resiliency enhancement and total cost reduction is proposed in this paper. The resilience of a shipboard power system with and without ESS are evaluated by means of resiliency index values under fault conditions. Furthermore, the influence of ESS on total cost is analyzed quantitatively. A detailed design of ESS is carried out, and optimal ESS configurations with different device combinations for various requirements are determined. Both single-node static and dynamic planning strategies are evaluated and the principles of planning strategy selection are discussed. Several key results are presented from the optimization model, built on General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) platform. Simulation results show significant improvement from the proposed design and planning of ESS on shipboard dc hybrid power system.
