The development of simple and lightweight supercapacitors is considered to be an important part of next-generation energy storage applications due to low cost which shows high performance. The composites related to transition metal oxide with graphene quantum dots are considered to be suitable materials to make an improvement for the electrochemical properties in order to eliminate the constraint for energy storage applications. Here we present, a facile hydrothermal method was used to prepare MnCo2O4 nano-composites decorated on fragments of graphene or GQDs with enhanced conductivity which is supposed to be an efficient electrode material to attain high energy density. The characterization of synthesized materials was done by High-Resolution “Transmission Electron Microscope (HRTEM), Powdered X-Ray diffraction (PXRD), and BET”. The observed specific capacitance for the synthesized composite MnCo2O4-GQDs is found to be higher than GQDs due to increased conductivity and faster ions diffusion between electrodes and electrolyte (0.1 M KOH). These results exhibit distinctive features of nano-composites for efficient electrode material for future energy storage applications.
