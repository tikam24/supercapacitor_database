Monolith solid porous carbon approach was prepared from biomass based from Garcinia Xanthochymus by using a high-temperature pyrolysis both of carbonization and physical activation in one stage integrated stage. Effect of the chemical impregnated of the activated carbon was studied. The N2 gas environment was used as inert gas of carbonization, and the CO2 gas was used as a physical activation atmosphere. The dimension of solid coin porous carbon was evaluated in the before and after high-temperature pyrolysis based on reduction of mass, diameter, and thickness. Furthermore, the porous carbon obtained also reviewed microstructure properties by using X-ray diffraction technique. Moreover, the electrode materials were evaluated their electrochemical performances at cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) in different scanning rate of 1, 2, 5, and 10 mV s-1, at window voltage of 0.0-1.0V and current density of 1.0 A g-1. The optimum capacitive properties were found as high as 159 F g-1 at aqueous electrolyte of 1 M H2SO4. The energy density was reviewed of 9.91 Wh kg-1 at optimum power density of 97.17 W kg-1
