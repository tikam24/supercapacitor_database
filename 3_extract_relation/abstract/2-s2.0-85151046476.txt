Construction of gamma-phase transition metal oxyhydroxides for electrode materials is an effective strategy for improving electrochemical properties. However, the preparation of gamma-phase transition metal oxyhydroxides with various defects remains an arduous challenge. Herein, gamma-phase Ni-Co oxyhydroxides with cationic vacancy defects and crystalline-amorphous interfaces are synthesized successfully via electrochemical reconstruction to achieve an ultrahigh mass/areal/volumetric energy density, flexible all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC). The Ni-Co oxyhydroxides consist of γ-NiOOH, γ-CoOOH and NiOOH phases; the γ-NiOOH and γ-CoOOH phases can effectively improve electronic conductivity and theoretical capacitance due to the abundant Ni4+/Co4+. The cationic vacancy defects and crystalline-amorphous interfaces not only endow the gamma-phase Ni-Co oxyhydroxides with abundant electrochemical active sites, but also enable fast electron transfer between the electrode and electrolyte. Therefore, the as-obtained gamma-phase Ni-Co oxyhydroxides display a high capacitance of 20.9 F cm−2 at 4 mA cm−2 and 3483 F g−1 at 0.67 A g−1, as well as excellent rate characteristics (90.5% capacitance retention at a high current density of 240 mA cm−2 and 40 A g−1). Density functional theory calculations reveal that Ni-Co oxyhydroxides with cationic vacancies can increase the adsorption energy of H2O, which is beneficial for the capture of H2O to occur for subsequent charge storage reactions. Furthermore, the assembled Ni-Co oxyhydroxides//active carbon all-solid-state ASC shows ultrahigh mass/areal/volumetric energy density of 92.6 W h kg−1/3.3 mW h cm−2/19.5 mW h cm−3 (at 1156 W kg−1/34.6 mW cm−2/204.1 mW cm−3) and possesses excellent electrochemical stability with 91% retention after 7000 cycles.
