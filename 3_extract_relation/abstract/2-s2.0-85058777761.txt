Graphene-based 3D functional materials hold promise as electrode materials for high performance supercapacitors due to their unique porous network structure, large specific surface area and excellent electrical and thermal properties. The coal-based graphene oxide (CGO) was prepared from Taixi anthracite by catalytic heat treatment and modified Hummers method. With polyaniline (PANI) and CGO as the starting materials, 3D PANI/coal-based graphene composites (3D-PCG) were further prepared by the hydrothermal method. The morphology and structure of the as-made materials were examined by the techniques including FT-IR, XRD, Raman, SEM, and TEM, with a focus on the interaction of polyaniline with the graphene. The electrochemical performance of 3D-PCG as electrode materials for supercapacitors was evaluated by electrochemical test methods. The results show that rod-like PANI is uniformly embedded into the network structure of 3D coal-based graphene (3D-CG), yielding 3D-PCG that has the highest specific capacitance in comparison with PANI and 3D-CG, and a specific capacitance of 663 FÂ·g-1 can be delivered in the case of 3D-PCG made at 1:2 mass ratio of PANI and CGO.
