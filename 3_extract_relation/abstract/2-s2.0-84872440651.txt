Recently, carbon nanomaterials have received great interest because of their unique mechanical, electrical, and chemical properties. Especially, some kinds of novel carbon materials including carbon nanofibers, carbon nanotubes, and graphene with large specific area, high conductivity, and good biocompatibility become research focus. These novel carbon nanomaterials have been applied in many fields due to their unique physical and chemical properties. Especially, carbon nanomaterials have shown their unique advantages in electrochemical field. This paper mainly review the application of carbon nanomaterials to electrochemistry including biosensor, supercapacitor, and fuel cell. Carbon nanomaterials have an important role in bioelectrochemical catalytic reaction due to that carbon nanomaterials have high specific area and excellent biocompatibility. Therefore, it can improve the electron transfer rate of enzyme. The biosensors based carbon nanomaterials have high sensitivity, broad linear range, and good stability and reproducibility. Carbon nanomaterial is the earlist and the best one in the supercapacitor electrode materials. The supercapacitor prepared by carbon nanomaterials has good cycle stability. The specific capacitance can be enhanced through the combination of carbon nanomaterials and pseudo-capacitors electrode materials. Carbon nanomaterials can act as the catalysts of fuel cell as well. It can improve the energy density, fuel utilization, and the ability to resist poisoning.
