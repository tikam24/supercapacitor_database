Supercapacitors have attracted significant attention in the last few years as they have the capability to fulfill the demand for both power and energy density in many energy storage applications. In this study, an in situ carbon-supported titanium oxide (ICS-TiO2) electrode has been prepared using sucrose and TiO2 powder. The ICS-TiO2 powder was prepared by slipcasting, followed by the annealing of the TiO2 slurry. Sucrose was added to the TiO2 slurry as a soluble carbon source, and was converted into carbon at 600 Â°C then coated on the TiO2 particles. The morphological and structural evolution of the electrode was investigated by FEG-SEM, FEG-TEM, XRD, BET, FTIR, XPS and Raman spectroscopy. The electrochemical characterization of ICS-TiO2 demonstrated that this material exhibits an efficient value of specific capacitance (277.72 F g-1 at 25 mV s-1) for charge storage. ISC-TiO2 also exhibits a specific capacitance of 180 F g-1 at 2 A g-1 in a 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. The results suggest that ICS-TiO2 can be utilized as a high-performance electrode material for supercapacitors with desirable electrochemical properties. This journal is
