In DC microgrid, most of tightly regulated converters can be regarded as constant power loads (CPLs), and may cause negative incremental impedance instability problem. The hybrid energy storage system (HESS) plays an important role in suppressing power fluctuations and voltage instability. This paper proposes a control strategy for HESS consist of super capacitors and batteries, and the effects of CPLs are considered. A high-pass filter is utilized to distribute power for super capacitors and batteries, separately. During identifying power fluctuations procedure, the power frequency and the negative incremental impedance of CPLs are both considered. Based on the Takagi-Sugeno (T -S) fuzzy model, the large signal model of DC microgrid is established. Then the stability constraints are deduced by Lyapunov theorem, and are taken into HESS control strategies. The proposed control strategy could fully exploit the advantages of large power density of super capacitor and high energy density of battery, and simultaneously could stabilize the voltage. Simulation results verify the validity of the control strategy.
