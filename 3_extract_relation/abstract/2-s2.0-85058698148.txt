The performance of tin-dioxide in the rutile structure doped lithium was investigated by first-principles calculations, including energy and geometric optimisation and electronic structures of LixSn alloy as nodes in supercapacitor. In particular, this work aimed at crystalline SnO2 to calculate total energy, average potential drop, DOS and PDOS and charge density. Additionally, the convergence test of Ecutâ€“off and band gap via GGA and the extra Coulomb potential U improved the correct description of the mixture parameters. The result showed crystalline LixSn gradually exhibits excellent metallic conductivity during increasing concentration of Li-doped, and accompanies the phase transformation of crystalline Sn into LixSn alloy. Moreover, the fluctuant electronic values near the Fermi level showed the performance of electric conductivity changes with different concentration of Li-doped, which due to differences form hybrid orbital of various LixSn structures. Note that indicated the primary mechanism of the SEI layer and volume expansion affecting on the structural damage and reversible capacity of conductor, and the predict SnO2-based nodes should become the ideal candidate for next generation anode materials in supercapacitor.
