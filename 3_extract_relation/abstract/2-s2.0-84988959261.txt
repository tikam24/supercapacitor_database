In this work, MnO2/C composites with hovenia-acerba-like hierarchical morphologies were prepared on a stable and interconnected three-dimensional (3D) porous carbon framework by controlling the additive amount of concentrated H2SO4in the precursor solution. The carbon framework was facilely fabricated by a simple and green method, in which polyvinyl alcohol was used as a carbon precursor and NaCl as a template. The structural and electrochemical characterizations were performed with the purpose of the prepared composites being used in supercapacitor as an electrode material. Benefiting from the stable 3D framework structure of carbon and nano-petal morphology of MnO2, the representative electrode delivered a high specific capacitance of 132 F/g at 0.5 A/g and tended to be stable at 116 F/g after 1000 cycles at 2 A/g.
