Thick carbon nanofiber (CNF) films were uniformly grown on metal wires with the assistance of pre-deposited NiO nanowalls. The as-prepared wire-shaped composites that integrate the capacitance of CNFs and Ni particles were directly used as electrodes to construct high capacitive fiber supercapacitors for micro-power supplies.
