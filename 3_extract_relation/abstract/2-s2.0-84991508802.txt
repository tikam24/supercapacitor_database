With the continuous development of electric vehicles, the demand for electric vehicle power supply is becoming more and more urgent. In order to meet the needs of both energy and power, the hybrid power supply of aluminum air fuel cell and the supercapacitor is studied in this paper, and the matching parameters are analyzed and calculated. Then the hybrid power energy allocation strategy including the logic threshold control strategy and the fuzzy logic control strategy are provided. Finally, the power performance simulation is carried out under the actual conditions according to the two different strategies. It is shown that the fuzzy logic control strategy is superior to the logic threshold control strategy in the aspect of energy distribution.
