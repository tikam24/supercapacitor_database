A hierarchical structure of TiO2 nanorod/MnO2 ultrathin nanosheet core/shell nanocomposite arrays on a conductive substrate has been prepared by two facile steps of hydrothermal reaction and annealing progress, which serving as electrodes present great potential application for high-performance supercapacitors. By adjusting the concentration of precursor aqueous solution, it can be found that the thickness of the MnO2 shell in the as-designed hierarchical electrode material can be facilely controlled. By comparison, the obtained TiO2 nanorod/MnO2 ultrathin nanosheet as an electrode material can achieve the best electrochemical performance in terms of the area-specific capacitance up to 34.79 mF/cm2 from the cyclic voltammetry (CV) test at the scan rate of 5 mV/s. Furthermore, the composited electrode has also demonstrated good stability, with the capacitance retention rate of about 91% through the cycle experiment test after 1000 cycles.
