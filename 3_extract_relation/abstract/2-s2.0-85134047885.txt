A composite of (Ni)MOF sheets penetrated by MnO2 nano-nanothorns anchored on porous carbon cloth has been fabricated by a two-step hydrothermal method and been explored as self-standing electrode for high-performance supercapacitors. The composite deliveres a high specific capacitance of 1780 mF cm- 2 at 4 mA cm-2 (376 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 specific capacitance) and exhibits a capacitance retention of 93.4% at 15 mA cm-2 after 5000 cycles. It reaches 71.6% of the original capacitance when the current density switches in between 4 and 15 mA cm-2, indicating an excellent rate capability. These results open up new avenues for the development of high-performance electrode materials and the application of advanced energy storage devices.
