In this study, flexible asymmetric supercapacitors are assembled with positive LiMn2O4/carbon cloth (CC) electrode and negative NaTi2(PO4)3/CC electrode. With the development of light-weight and flexible electronic devices, nowadays, solid-state supercapacitive devices have attracted great attention, in which the classic polymeric electrolytes such as polyvinyl alcohol and polyethylene oxide copolymers are widely used. To replace the non-ionic polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) gel and decrease internal resistance, a high conductive crosslinked polyacrylate (cPA) gel containing double ions is prepared. The structure of as-obtained LiMn2O4/CC, NaTi2(PO4)3/CC and cPA is thoroughly investigated. At current density of 0.2 mA/cm2, the flexible supercapacitor of LiMn2O4/CC = |cPA||NaTi2(PO4)3/CC shows a maximum capacitance of 84.80 mF per cm2, with a remarkable stability of 93.07% retention after 5000 charging and discharging cycles. Under the synergistic effects from the low-resistance cPA and the grouped NaTi2(PO4)3/LiMn2O4 in double-ion electrolyte, the fabricated solid supercapacitor displays a power density high as 249.96 Wh/kg (0.122 mW/cm2) at 0.4 A/g (0.2 mA/cm2) with the energy output of 36.80 Wh/kg (0.018 mWh/cm2).
