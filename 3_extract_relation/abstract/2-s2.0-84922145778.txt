This paper gives a thorough insight on this relatively revolutionizing and satisfying solution of energy storage through paper batteries and provides an indepth analysis of the same. A paper battery is a flexible, ultra-thin energy storage and production device formed by combining carbon nanotubes with a conventional sheet of cellulose-based paper [1]. A paper battery can function both as a highenergy battery and supercapacitor, combining two discrete components that are separate in traditional electronics. This combination allows the battery to provide both long-term steady power production and bursts of energy. Being biodegradable, lightweight, and non-toxic, flexible paper batteries have potential adaptability to power the next generation of electronics, medical devices, and hybrid vehicles, allowing for radical new designs and medical technologies. The paper is aimed at understanding and analyzing the properties and characteristics of paper batteries, to study its advantages, potential applications, limitations, and disadvantages. This paper also aims at highlighting the construction and various methods of production of paper battery and looks for alternative means of mass production.
