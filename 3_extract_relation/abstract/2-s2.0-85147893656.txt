We synthesized two hybrid organic–inorganic porous polymers (HPP) through the Heck reaction of 9,10 dibromoanthracene (A-Br2) or 1,3,6,8-tetrabromopyrene (P-Br4)/A-Br2 as co-monomers with octavinylsilsesquioxane (OVS), in order to afford OVS-A HPP and OVS-P-A HPP, respectively. The chemical structures of these two hybrid porous polymers were validated through FTIR and solid-state 13C and 29Si NMR spectroscopy. The thermal stability and porosity of these materials were measured by TGA and N2 adsorption/desorption analyses, demonstrating that OVS-A HPP has higher thermal stability (Td10: 579 °C) and surface area (433 m2 g−1) than OVS-P-A HPP (Td10: 377 °C and 98 m2 g−1) due to its higher cross-linking density. Furthermore, the electrochemical analysis showed that OVS-P-A HPP has a higher specific capacitance (177 F g −1 at 0.5 A F g−1) when compared to OVS-A HPP (120 F g −1 at 0.5 A F g−1). The electron-rich phenyl rings and Faradaic reaction between the π-conjugated network and anthracene moiety may be attributed to their excellent electrochemical performance of OVS-P-A HPP.
