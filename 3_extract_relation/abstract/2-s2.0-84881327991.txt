Electrospinning is an effective technology for preparing free-standing fiber mats with ultrathin fiber diameter. In this review, the electrospinning technology for application in supercapacitors is discussed. Electrode materials assembled by electrospinning and other post-treatment and chemical modification for electrical double-layer capacitors and pseudocapacitors are summarized. Meanwhile, the electrospun nanofiber mats for separator in supercapacitor is also highlighted. Â© 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.
