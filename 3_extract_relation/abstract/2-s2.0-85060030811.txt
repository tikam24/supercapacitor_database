Composites with thin layers of polyaniline (PANI) draped on the surface of a hybrid carbon (HC) array or assemblage were prepared by the oxidative polymerization route. The carbon array substrate is a consistent network architecture of carbon nanotubes and graphene, with the benefit of elevated conductivity and surface area of the carbon components. The exceptional improved electrochemical performances of PANI enfolded HC array electrodes are due to the synergistic effect of the pseudocapacitance of PANI and the electric double layer capacitance of the carbon array. The supercapacitive characteristics of composite materials were inspected by using cyclic voltammetry, the galvanostatic charge-discharge test and electrochemical impedance analysis. The 025PANI-HC composite sample revealed a maximum specific capacitance of 1397.82 F g -1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s -1 and 1430 F g -1 at 1 A g -1 from galvanostatic charge-discharge data, respectively, in 1 m H 2 SO 4. The composites exhibited a much larger specific capacitance value than pristine PANI. Also, the 025PANI-HC electrode had an unwavering operation and its specific capacitance retention was 89%, even after 5000 charge-discharge cycles at 1 A g -1 .
