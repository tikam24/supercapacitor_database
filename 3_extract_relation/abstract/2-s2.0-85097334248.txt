In this process, we dissolved tungsten ions in water and mixed with catalase and invertase enzymes, then coated the substrates with this mixture. In this paper, we produced tungsten oxide thin films by a method different than the ones in the literature and we investigated their characteristics. Surface analysis was performed by Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-Ray Diffraction was used to examine structural properties and current/voltage measurements. Capacitance of the film produced with invertase were calculated as 588-296-208-150 F/g, whereas capacitance of the film produced with catalase were 670-330-227-164 F/g at 5-10-15-20 mV/s scan rates, respectively. Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis showed around 9% tungsten, evenly distributed on the surface of the films.
