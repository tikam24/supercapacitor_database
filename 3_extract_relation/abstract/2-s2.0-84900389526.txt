A novel 3D hierarchical porous nickel oxide (NiO) was fabricated by a facile biotemplate assisted method. Physicochemical characterizations indicate that the as prepared hierarchical porous NiO is assembled by multiple-layered porous nanosheets, of which the pore structure is highly ordered. The electrochemical performance of the as prepared hierarchical porous NiO was carried out in 6 M KOH, exhibited relatively high specific capacitance value of 493 F g-1 at a current density of 0.3 A g-1, good rate performance (~93% capacity retention from 0.3 A g-1 to 10 A g -1), as well as good cycling stability (~96% retention upon 2000 charge/discharge cycles at 10 A g-1).
