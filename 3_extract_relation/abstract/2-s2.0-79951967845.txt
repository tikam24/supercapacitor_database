Hybrid materials based heteropolyacids, silicotungstic acid (H4 Si W12 O40 n H2 O) or phosphomolybdic acid (H3 P Mo12 O40 n H2 O), and a room temperature ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([BMIM] [B F4]) were synthesized. Carbon analysis showed that 1 mol of [Si W12 O40] 4- reacts with 4 mol of [BMIM]+ and 1 mol of [P Mo12 O40] 3- reacts with 3 mol of [BMIM]+. Fourier transform infrared spectra showed the presence of both 1-butyl-3- methylimidazolium cations and the Keggin anion. Cyclic voltammetry illustrated that the reduction peak potentials of the Keggin anion in the hybrid materials shift toward negative values. The hybrid materials can be suspended in ultrapure water to form true suspensions. Alternating current electrophoretic deposition was used to obtain thick homogeneous films of the hybrid materials in few minutes over stainless steel (SS) wires from aqueous suspensions at 30 Hz and 200 Vp-p. [BMIM]4 Si W12 O40 /SS and [BMIM]3 P Mo 12 O40 /SS previously treated at 370°C for 15 min were subjected to cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling in 0.5 M Na2 S O4 (pH 7) and observed to exhibit capacitance behavior between 0 and -0.6 V vs AgCl/Ag. In 0.5 M Na2 S O 4 (pH 7) and in this range of potentials, the hybrid [BMIM]4 Si W12 O40 material had an ideal behavior with a stable specific capacitance close to 172 F g-1 and good cyclability at 7 mA/ cm 2 over 1100 cycles. © 2010 The Electrochemical Society.
