Composites of LiFePO 4 and activated carbon (LFP-AC) were prepared by a ball milling method. Their morphologies were investigated by scanning electronic microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. Hybrid supercapacitors were assembled using the LFP-AC composites as the positive electrode and Li 4Ti 5O 12 as the negative electrode (LFP-AC/Li 4Ti 5O 12). Effects of the positive electrode composition (ratio of LiFePO 4 to AC) on the performance of LFP-AC/Li 4Ti 5O 12 were investigated via constant current charge-discharge tests. The results demonstrated that the specific capacity and the specific power of the LFP-AC/Li 4Ti 5O 12 hybrid supercapacitor significantly depend upon the content of LiFePO 4 in the LFP-AC positive electrode. At 0.5 A g -1 charge-discharge current, the specific capacity of the LFP-AC/Li 4Ti 5O 12 with 30 wt. LiFePO 4 and 70 wt. AC in the positive electrode is 42 higher than that of AC/Li 4Ti 5O 12, and the two supercapacitors have the same specific power. After 500 charge-discharge cycles at 1.0 A g -1, the specific capacity of the LFP-AC/Li 4Ti 5O 12 with 80 wt. LiFePO 4 and 20 wt. AC in the positive electrode is 53 higher than that of AC/Li 4Ti 5O 12. The hybrid device stores electric energy via both the double-layer electrostatic adsorption and the intercalation/deintercalation of lithium ions. Â© 2012 American Institute of Physics.
