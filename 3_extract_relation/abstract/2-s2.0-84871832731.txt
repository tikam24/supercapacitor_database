In low frequency applications, a large inductance is needed for directly matching the piezoelectric transducer impedance in the power supply management circuit. This paper designs a self-powered piezoelectric energy harvesting circuit using frequency conversion. The principle of frequency conversion is analyzed. Because the low frequency can be converted to a higher frequency by using a small matching inductance, the size of the power supply management circuit is very small. The circuit can realize the matching for the piezoelectric transducer in a wide range of frequency bandwidth. The experiment results show that the frequency of the transducer can be converted, and the matching inductance and the management circuit size can be decreased. The maximum harvesting power of the management circuit is 0.182 mW, and the energy harvesting efficiency can reach 44.8%. When the voltage of the supercapacitor reaches 1.13 V, the circuit can drive a wireless sensor node with a power consumption of 110 mW at 620 ms.
