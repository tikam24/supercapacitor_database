In this work, the flexible electrospun carbon nanofiber substrates fixed with Ag nanoparticles and graphene oxide have been prepared by combination of electrospinning and carbonization treatments. And then growth of NiCo2S4 nanotube on carbon nanofibers to form hybrid carbon nanofibers was prepared by a hydrothermal method. The composition and microstructures of resultant composites were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffractometer (XRD). The obtained hybrid carbon nanofibers exhibited excellent property of suppleness. The electrochemical activity and stability of hybrid carbon nanofibers were investigated by electrochemical measurement and it exhibited an excellent specific capacity of 360 F·g− 1 at 0.3 A·g− 1. Notably, the specific capacity of hybrid carbon nanofibers also exhibited a remarkable cycling stability (90.0% retention after 2000 cycles). The assembled symmetric hybrid carbon nanofibers-based supercapacitor also exhibited excellent flexible, include bendable, foldable and even twistable property.
