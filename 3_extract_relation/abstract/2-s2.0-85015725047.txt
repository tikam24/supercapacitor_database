A 1000V, high-voltage planar micro-supercapacitor directly fabricated on a flexible polymer substrate has been demonstrated to successfully power an electrostatic cantilever microresonator for more than 1 minute. Direct-write laser engraving of Kapton tape (polyimide) was used to fabricate each 200V micro-supercapacitor rapidly in a single step at ambient condition for the first time. To actuate the microresonator, five 200V micro-supercapacitors were connected in series to attain a 1000V output in a stable and safe manner. We demonstrated that laser engraving is a highly feasible and cost-effective technique for fabricating very high-voltage energy storage devices that are portable, flexible, and lightweight.
