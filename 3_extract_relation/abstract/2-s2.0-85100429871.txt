In this work, using NaBH4 as a dopant to modify the surface of the carbon material, making it have a higher B/O content; furthermore, p-aminophenol (PAP) as an additive is introduced into 1 M H2SO4 or 6 M KOH electrolyte, producing cooperative effect between them. As a result, the boron content of these samples is more than 1%, and the oxygen content is more than 10%. Furthermore, experiments show that when the mass ratio of activated carbon to NaBH4 is 1:4, the structure and performance of the obtained sample is the optimum, and its electrical conductivity and hydrophilicity are greatly enhanced. With the cooperative effect of B/O doping and PAP additives, the specific capacitance of the sample can reach up to 367 at 1 A g−1 and the energy density of 12.7 Wh kg−1 at 0.5 kW kg−1 in 1 M H2SO4. What's more, it reveals that the kinetic mode of PAP in 6 M KOH is surface control, while that in 1 M H2SO4 is diffusion control. In short, based on the co-doping of B/O on the surface of carbon materials and the combined effect of electrolyte additives, the structure of supercapacitors can be effectively changed and performance improved.
