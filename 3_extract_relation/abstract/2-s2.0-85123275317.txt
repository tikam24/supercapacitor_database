Supercapacitor is a kind of effective energy storage device with merits such as high power density, long cycling life and so on, but their application is limited nowadays compared to the application of batteries. One important restriction is because of the serious self-discharge in supercapacitors, and how to conquer the self-discharge problem is an important issue. In this article we propose an effective way to reduce self-discharge of the supercapacitor by carefully designing of activated carbon (ACs) electrodes and water-in salt electrolyte. The electrochemical characterization shows that our supercapacitor can have the ability to reduce self-discharge.
