A series of switched-capacitor (SC) cell balancing circuits is proposed for rechargeable energy storage devices like battery and supercapacitor strings in this paper. Taking a basic SC-based cell balancing unit as an equivalent resistor, the behavioral models of the proposed cell balancing circuits are developed to evaluate their balancing performance. Comparing with existing SC-based cell balancing circuits, the main advantage of the proposed circuits is that their balancing speed is independent of both of the number of battery cells and initial mismatch distribution of cell voltages. In order to improve the operation performance of SC-based cell balancing circuits in the respect of minimizing the equivalent resistance, optimizing methodologies of circuit parameters are introduced by referring the concepts of slow switching limit and fast switching limit as well as inductive switching limit of SC power converters. Simulation and experimental results are provided to verify the feasibility of the proposed cell balancing circuits.
