Energy conservation running for vehicle has been a promising research hotspot in the many universities and research institutions. In order to improve the energy utilization rate in the vehicle running process, an optimization method of the energy consumption and recycle based on fuel cell (FC)/supercapacitor (SC) hybrid tram is proposed in this paper. In the method, a tram operation energy management strategy based on Pontriagin's minimum principle (PMP) can effectively was proposed what adjusts the output power of FC and SC and decreases hydrogen consumption. In addition, a tram breaking velocity curve with maximum energy recovery and the allocation strategy between regenerative force and mechanical braking force be also studied in this paper. According to the simulation results, it could be obtained that the Energy conservation rate is about 5% higher than the un-optimized, it will effectively decrease hydrogen consumption.
