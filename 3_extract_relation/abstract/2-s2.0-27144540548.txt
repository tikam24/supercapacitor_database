In this paper, brown-millerite type SrCoO2.5 ultrafine powders were prepared and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The electrochemical capacitance of SrCoO2.5 electrode was examined by cyclic voltammetry, impedance and galvanostatic charge- discharge measurements. The specific capacitance of 168.5 F g-1 for SrCoO2.5 could be obtained in the range of 0.1-0.7 V. Â© 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
