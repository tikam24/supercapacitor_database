Titanium-based oxides including TiO2 and M-Ti-O compounds (M = Li, Nb, Na, etc.) family, exhibit advantageous structural dynamics (2D ion diffusion path, open and stable structure for ion accommodations) for practical applications in energy storage systems, such as lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and hybrid pseudocapacitors. Further, Ti-based oxides show high operating voltage relative to the deposition of alkali metal, ensuring full safety by avoiding the formation of lithium and sodium dendrites. On the other hand, high working potential prevents the decomposition of electrolyte, delivering excellent rate capability through the unique pseudocapacitive kinetics. Nevertheless, the intrinsic poor electrical conductivity and reaction dynamics limit further applications in energy storage devices. Recently, various work and in-depth understanding on the morphologies control, surface engineering, bulk-phase doping of Ti-based oxides, have been promoted to overcome these issues. Inspired by that, in this review, the authors summarize the fundamental issues, challenges and advances of Ti-based oxides in the applications of advanced electrochemical energy storage. Particularly, the authors focus on the progresses on the working mechanism and device applications from lithium-ion batteries to sodium-ion batteries, and then the hybrid pseudocapacitors. In addition, future perspectives for fundamental research and practical applications are discussed.
