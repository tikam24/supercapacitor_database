In this work, Co(OH)2 nanosheets were successfully deposited on the hydrothermally prepared MnCo2O4.5 nanowires by the electrodeposition method to obtain the composite material MnCo2O4.5@Co(OH)2 on Ni foam. Through comparison, it is found that the performance of the composite material is obviously superior to that of single MnCo2O4.5. Thanks to the special ribbon-like structure of the composite material and the synergistic effect of the two materials, the composite material not only improves the problem of insufficient electrical conductivity but also greatly enhances the energy storage capacity. Compared with the highest specific capacity of 375.9 C·g−1 (1 A·g−1) of MnCo2O4.5 on nickel foam, the highest specific capacity of MnCo2O4.5@Co(OH)2 can reach 902.52 C·g−1 (1 A·g−1). When forming an asymmetric supercapacitor with activated carbon electrodes, the maximum energy density can reach 55.42 Wh·kg−1 (the power density is about 800.0 W·kg−1).
