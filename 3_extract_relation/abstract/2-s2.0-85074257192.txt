The evolution of eco-friendly and cost efficient energy storage devices is eminent because of depletion of ozone layer and environmental issues. Biopolymer nanocomposites are the most auspicious aspirant to intercept hazardous situations. Chemical functionalization of graphene oxide (GO) is an essential component to avoid agglomeration of nanoparticles and it also helps in end-use applications. Poly(vinyl alcohol) and chitosan biocomposite is prepared by magnetic stirring method followed by dispersion of nanofiller by ultrasonication process. The aim is to emphasize on usage of metal-free material that is bionanocomposite, to exploit and enhance electrical properties of resultant product. The major drawback of chitosan is its low mechanical strength which can be overcome by employing GO and poly(vinyl alcohol). Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy studies examined the uniform distribution of GO nanoparticles and functionalization improved the dispersion by creating nitrogen and hydroxyl moieties, this increases the intermolecular interactions between nanofiller and biopolymer matrix. The investigation of thermal analysis revealed the improved thermal stability and lower weight reduction on incorporation of GO and chemically functionalized GO. Â© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J.
