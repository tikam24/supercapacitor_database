Herein, we propose a new concept of energy storage system composed of a nonpolarized electrode and a polarized electrode (PPE) with an impressive energy density. It offered nearly 4 times higher energy density than that of carbon-based supercapacitor. Among the suggested potential PPE system, we introduced an electrodeposited nanozinc on the copper foam as the nearly nonpolarized electrode and a Zn-2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid (DHTA) metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived activated porous carbon as a nearly polarized electrode in KOH-ZnO electrolyte to constitute the C|Zn PPE system prototype. The C|Zn system achieved an impressive energy density of 84.5 Wh kg-1 at 1000 W kg-1, 4 times higher than that of the C|C supercapacitor. It also shows a high capacitance retention rate of 94.5% at 10 A g-1 after 10 Â»000 cycles. Therefore, the amazing results indicate that the PPE energy system integrates the advantages of supercapacitors and secondary batteries. It will be a promising and effective energy device for higher-performance electric vehicles.
