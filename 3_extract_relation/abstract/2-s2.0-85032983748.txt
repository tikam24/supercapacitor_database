The paper describes the results of studies on the realization of fractional-order elements using active electronic system - the generalized impedance converter (GIC). At least one original fractional-order element is required for this realization, eg. a supercapacitor. The proposed system is described by a fractional-order impedance, which impedance exponent can obtain arbitrary value. The results of simulation as well as experimental studies have been compared for the considered system. Studies included the determination of the frequency characteristics of the fractional-order system. The measuring system used for the determination of the frequency characteristics has been described too. For the chosen GIC system configuration, a measuring position has been developed and experimental studies were performed. The frequency characteristics of the new fractional-order input impedance have been compared.
