Potassium-ion hybrid capacitors (PIHCs) have received extensive attention due to the high-rate energy density and long-life cycling capability. However, PIHCs still suffer from structural instability and low power density. Outstanding dimensional engineering can solve the above problems to improve the performance of PIHC anode materials. Here, we systematically summarize the new strategies of preparing dimensionally-oriented materials for high performance PIHCs anode. To realize the influence of dimensions on high performance PIHC anode materials, we summarize the mechanisms in PIHC anode from one-dimension, two-dimension, and three-dimension, and analyze the problems encountered in improving the performance of PIHC anode materials of different dimensions. Then we make appropriate recommendations on the issues raised, and present future opportunities and challenges for PIHCs. This work can open up new perspectives for developing high performance PIHCs.
