A modification of the surface morphology of activated carbon using a unique ellipsoidal/strobili-fiber structure is successfully synthesized from cocoa shell waste through one-stage pyrolysis and zinc chlo-ride impregnation. The porous carbon maintained a monolith form without the addition of adhesive materials. According to this method, the unique combination of ellipsoidal, strobili-fiber, and rod-like structures provided the highest specific surface area and abundant micropores and mesopores. In combination with the high carbon content of 92.71% and specific surface area of 619.717 m2/g−1, the mesoporous activated carbon 0.5 (MAC-0.5) samples exhibited a high specific capacitance of 210 F/g−1 per 1 M of sulfuric acid electrolytes. Furthermore, the energy density of the assembled sym-metrical supercapacitor was as high as 29.16 (W·h)/kg−1 with a power density of 105.08 W/kg−1 in the two-electrode system. Therefore, these results indicate that due to the electrochemical properties of activated carbon, cocoa shell waste can be highly recommended as a potential material for use energy storage applications.
