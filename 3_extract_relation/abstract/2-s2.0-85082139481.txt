New attractive advances in electrode preparation for supercapacitor applications with rGO based composite materials are eye-catching attention of researchers. Cobalt oxide is considered as an effective electrode for full cell fabrication due to its high specific capacitance. Cost effective solvothermal method was used to prepare pristine Co3O4 nanorods, NiCo2O4 nanorods and NiCo2O4/rGO urchin like nanocilia structure composite materials. The complete electrochemical studies were used to check the obtained product electrochemical activity. The high specific capacitance values are obtained for NiCo2O4/rGO urchin like nanocilia composite electrode material which leads to design a full cell and make use as practical applications with illuminating red, green, blue LED source. The capacitive retention of 92.28% even after 5000 cycles achieved in GCD cyclic performance at a high current density implies its excellent stability.
