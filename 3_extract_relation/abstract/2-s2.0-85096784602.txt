Pseudocapacitive behavior and ion hybrid capacitors can improve the energy density of supercapacitors, but research has only considered the reaction of cations during the electrochemical process, leading to a flawed mechanistic understanding. Here, the effects of various anions carriers on the electrochemical behaviors of titanium nitride-based zinc ion capacitor (Zn-TiN capacitor) were explored. DFT calculations revealed the stable structure of TiN-SO4 after adsorbed process, enabling SO42− participate in the electrochemical process and construct a two-step adsorption and intercalation energy storage mechanism, improving the capacitance and anti-self-discharge ability of the Zn-TiN capacitor, which delivered an ultrahigh capacitance of 489.8 F g−1 and retained 83.92 % of capacitance even after 500 h resting time. An energy storage system involving anions in the electrochemical process can improve capacitance and anti-self-discharge ability of ion hybrid capacitors.
