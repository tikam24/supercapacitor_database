In this work, NiCo2S4 nanoparticles were anchored on the surface of nitrogen doped activated carbon modified graphene (GNAC) by simple electrodeposition to prepare GNAC/NiCo2S4-15 composite electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors. The insertion of nitrogen-doped activated carbon between graphene sheets effectively prevented the self-accumulation of graphene layers and provided a large number of active sites for a uniform growth of NiCo2S4 nanoparticles. Due to the synergistic effect between NiCo2S4 and graphene nanosheets, the GNAC/NiCo2S4-15 electrode showed a high specific capacitance (1495 mF cm−2 at a current density of 1 mA cm−2) and excellent cycling performance (the area ratio capacitance retained 88% after 3000 cycles). In addition, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was assembled with GNAC/NiCo2S4-15 and GNAC as positive and negative electrodes, respectively. At a power density of 3.834 mW cm−3, the prepared ASC provides a significant energy density of 0.613 mW h cm−3, which offers great prospects for the application of supercapacitors.
