Transparent and stretchable Ag-Ni and Ag-Fe core-shell nanowire networks were fabricated as a cathode and anode, respectively, for asymmetric supercapacitors. Both electrodes showed a reversible stretchability at up to 100% strain and exhibited high electrochemical stability and specific capacitances of âˆ¼3 mF cm-2 with 50% optical transmittance. The asymmetric device assembled with a PVA/KOH electrolyte demonstrated a high operating voltage of 1.6 V and an excellent capacitance retention (92%) over 5000 cycles even after stretching to 35% strain.
