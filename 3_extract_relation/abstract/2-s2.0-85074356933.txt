In the present work, we have fabricated a flexible and efficient micro-supercapacitor for future advanced electronic applications. A simple time saving, eco-friendly electrodeposition method was employed for nanostructured thin film materials formation on a micro-pattern flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate, and the resulting outcome shows that its promising applications in miniaturized power electronics devices. The nanostructures-based flexible micro-supercapacitor can deliver areal capacitance of 0.253 mF/cm2 at a current density of 0.03 mA/cm2. The maximum power and energy densities of the fabricated flexible asymmetric micro-supercapacitor are estimated to be 30 mW/cm2 and 0.056 mWh/cm2, respectively.
