A unique “integrated hard-templating strategy” is described for facile synthesis of a carbonaceous material with a novel three-dimensional (3D) branched hollow architecture. A set of steps, including template formation, surface coating and template removal, all occur in a spontaneous and orderly manner in the one-pot hydrothermal process. Investigations on structural evolution during the process reveal that pre-synthesized zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) nanoparticles are first dissociated and then self-assembled into 3D branched superstructures of ZnO as templates. Initial self-assembly is followed by coating of the glucose-derived carbonaceous materials and etching of interior ZnO by organic acids released in situ by hydrolysis of glucose. The 3D-branched hollow architecture is shown to greatly enhance supercapacitor performance. The research described here provides guidance into the development of strategies for complex hollow carbonaceous architectures for a variety of potential applications.
