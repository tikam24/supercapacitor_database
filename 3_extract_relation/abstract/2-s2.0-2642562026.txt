Polypyrrole (PPY) composite powders doped with RuCl3· x H2O of variable mass were prepared by a way of in situ chemical polymerization. Their electrochemical properties were investigated with cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge tests and ac impedance spectroscopy in 1 M NaNO3. Morphology and crystalline structure of these Ru-doped PPY powders were examined by transmission electron microscopic (TEM). The PPY/Ru composite electrodes show much higher specific capacitance than pure PPY electrode so that they are more promising for application in supercapacitor. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.
