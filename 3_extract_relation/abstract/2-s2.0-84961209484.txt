In recent years, two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides, such as MoS2 and WS2, have raised a lot of concern due to their graphene-like structure and great performance in many fields. In this work, monolayer WS2 nanosheets were exfoliated with the thickness less than 1 nm by combination of ball-milling and sonication. A facial strategy for the hierarchical self-assembly of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on WS2 nanosheets was then developed to fabricate 0D/2D nanocomposites. AgNPs are uniformly dispersed on WS2 nanosheets and the particle size of AgNPs is about 20 nm. The nanocomposite shows strong enhancements of Raman affect and electrochemical behaviors, which will have great prospects for the development of supercapacitor.
