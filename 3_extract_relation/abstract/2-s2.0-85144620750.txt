A significant advancement in designing bimetallic oxides with favorable architecture is governed by a homogeneously dispersed copper in MgCo2O4 nanosheet grown on three-dimensional nickel foam substrate. Rational design of electrode material for supercapacitor using metal having superior electrochemical performances such as high conductivity, low cost and abundant nature is required for commercialization. In this, belief, we have proposed an optimized concentration of copper in MgCo2O4 with the synergistic activity of copper and magnesium to enhance the bulk electrochemical properties of electrode material. The resultant materials provide high specific capacitance 885Fg−1 at 2Ag−1 current density with excellent cyclic stability of 6000 cycles with 80.5 % capacitance retention. Further, the fabricated device also achieved excellent specific capacitance of 304 Fg−1 at 0.5Ag−1 current density. It also demonstrates high energy density of 42.22 Whkg−1 at power density of 1000 Wkg−1 and larger cyclic stability of 25 K cycles with 83.33 % capacitance retention. An optimum performance of device shows a progressive composition of material for high performance supercapacitors.
