Ni nanorods prepared by electrochemical growth through an anodized aluminium oxide membrane were used as substrate for the electrodeposition of MnO2 either in potentiostatic mode or by a pulsed method. Electrochemical deposition parameters were chosen for an homogeneous deposit onto Ni nanorods. Resulting Ni supported MnO2 electrodes were tested for electrochemical performances as nanostructured negative electrodes for supercapacitors. They exhibited initial capacitances up to 190 F/g and remarkable performances at high charge/discharge rates. Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
