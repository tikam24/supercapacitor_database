In the last few decades, energy storage systems (ESS) have become a major research area in electric, hybrid-electric, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (EVs, HEVs, and PHEVs) [1]. ESS mainly consists of a battery and ultra-capacitor (UC) connected together to build a system with high energy and power that can provide a high speed and acceleration for EVs. Major characteristics of ESS systems are the energy density, that a battery should provide, and the power rate which an ultra-capacitor can provide. In this paper, the focus will be on developing a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) to improve characteristics of the advanced energy storage system (AESS) in order to achieve a quick and accurate response to the output speed which enhance the system performance.
