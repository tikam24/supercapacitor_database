Supercapacitor, a new energy storage device, which possesses higher energy density than electrostatic capacitor and higher power density than battery holds the upper hand when applied as pulse power sources. Composite power source consisted of supercapacitor and battery is presented and its performance is studied. The results show that current of load is supplied by battery and supercapacitor simultaneously when circuit is turned on and supercapacitor is charged by battery when circuit is turned off. Supercapacitor can compensate current of battery and decrease drop of battery voltage, thus lead to extension of life of battery. These effects on battery are related to pulse duty ratio, period of pulsed current, internal resistance of battery and supercapacitor, capacitance and number of supercapacitor. When pulse duty ratio increases, drop of battery voltage increases and current supplied by supercapacitor decreases which augment duty of battery. The batterry voltage drop, however, will decrease more if more supercapacitors are connected to the batteries in parallel due to much current is supplied by the supercapacitors.
