The construction of cost-effective, efficient, and sustainable energy storage systems is extremely important for future fuels globally. Nickel borates display important characteristics in electrochemical catalytic applications, whereas few reports have focused on their energy storage properties in supercapacitors. Herein, Ni3(BO3)2 nanospheres (NSs) are fabricated on titanium (Ti) mesh to afford Ni3(BO3)2NSs@Ti using a simple and scalable electrodeposition technique, whose electrochemical performance is carefully studied. The Ni3(BO3)2NSs@Ti obtained at 1.2 V (Ni3(BO3)2 NSs-1.2V) exhibits a higher specific capacitance of 663 F g−1 with a current density of 0.5 A g−1. Furthermore, by directly employing Ni3(BO3)2 NSs-1.2V as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device can be fabricated and displays the energy density up to 30.6 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 400 W kg−1. Hence, the facile electrodeposited Ni3(BO3)2 NSs can be a potential platform for energy storage applications.
