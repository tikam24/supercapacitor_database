This paper presents a capacitor-clamped three-level inverter-based supercapacitor direct integration scheme for wind energy conversion systems. The idea is to increase the capacitance of clamping capacitors with the use of supercapacitors and allow their voltage to vary within a defined range. Even though this unique approach eliminates the need of interfacing dc-dc converters for supercapacitors, the variable voltage operation brings about several challenges. The uneven distribution of space vectors is the major modulation challenge. A space vector modulation method is proposed in this paper to address this issue and to generate undistorted currents even in the presence of dynamic changes in supercapacitor voltages. A supercapacitor voltage equalization algorithm is also presented. Moreover, control strategies of the proposed system are discussed in detail. Simulation and experimental results are presented to verify the efficacy of the proposed system in suppressing short-term wind power fluctuations. Â© 1982-2012 IEEE.
