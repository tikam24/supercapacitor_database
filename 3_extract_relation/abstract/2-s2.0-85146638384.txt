This paper presents a study of the effect of a battery/supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system (HESS) on battery voltage of an off-road electric vehicle. After modeling, a rule-based filtering strategy is built for a current split of the HESS. The performance of the HESS is assessed under four cases involved in the different selections of the cut-off frequency of a low-pass filter and the size of the supercapacitor bank. In simulations, not only the magnitude/fluctuation of current, but the voltage drops, and voltage fluctuation of the battery are also taken as the criteria for the evaluation. The results demonstrate that when the SCs is designed to be large enough and a proper cut-off frequency is selected, the HESS can significantly improve the battery current/voltage in both root mean square and peak eliminations during an on-road cycle.
