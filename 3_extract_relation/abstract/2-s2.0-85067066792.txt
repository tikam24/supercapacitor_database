To achieve higher collision rate of particle beams, CERN Large Hadron Collider requires new superconducting magnets and associated power supplies at the interaction points for its High-Luminosity upgrade. A new family of two-quadrant converters with integrated energy storage is studied in order to increase the system availability and energy efficiency. This paper describes topological implementation with an energy storage solution based on supercapacitor, considering real operating cycle and superconducting magnet parameters. Power supply control and energy management considerations are presented and verified through simulations of a complete system, providing insight for the future design of the system.
