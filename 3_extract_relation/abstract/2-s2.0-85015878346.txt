This paper proposes a novel bidirectional DC-DC power converter topology to interface a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) to a dc micro grid for the purpose of voltage regulation. The converter topology is based on standard single phase inverter module. HESS constitutes of battery-super capacitor (SC) combined storage which have the virtues of high energy and power densities respectively. The inherent problem of slow dynamics of battery is overcome by diverting fast acting dynamics to the SC system which also improves life span of battery and reduce current stresses. Control strategy is validated on the designed micro grid for different load conditions.
