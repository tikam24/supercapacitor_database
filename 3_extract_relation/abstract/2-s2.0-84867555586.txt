Polypyrrole (PPy) nanowires were prepared by in situ polymerization of pyrrole in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide stabilized graphene (GCR). PPy nanowire/GCR composites with different loading ratios were tested as supercapacitor electrode materials in both 1 M H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> (aq) and 1 M KCl (aq) electrolytes, and different electrochemical behaviors were observed. The incorporation of GCR nanosheets into the PPy nanowire matrix obviously improved the electrochemical performance of PPy and a high specific capacitance of 492 F g<sup>-1</sup> can be obtained for PPyGCR91 in 1 M H <inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> at a current density of 0.2 A g<sup>-1</sup> with good cycling stability.
