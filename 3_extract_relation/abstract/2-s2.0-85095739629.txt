The electric vehicle is one of the best solutions in the fight against pollution, but they need certain energy management strategies to improve their features. The purpose of our research is to identify, trough different types of bibliographic maps (maps based on network data, maps based on bibliographic data or maps based on text data), the optimal energy management strategy that could be used on electric vehicles.The essential element among this paper are the energy management strategies that we selected from articles identified in the database of Web of Science and, with VOSviewer, we build bibliometric analysis from various perspectives. We have made the analyze on strategies like reducing emissions, fuel economy, performance, etc. and we can observe that there are appearing different strategies that are using combinations, positions and algorithms for the component elements. There for, the energy management strategies are taking care to put in the balance all the important elements. In the results, we can see that one of the most used elements are the fuel cell, supercapacitor, the battery, the algorithm that we use and the control strategies that we choose.We have exported various maps, based on the next subjects: the occurrence of the topics and the strengths of his connections and geographic distribution and made a classification of the strategies that can be used to improve different factors.
