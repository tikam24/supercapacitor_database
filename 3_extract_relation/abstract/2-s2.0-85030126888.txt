Porous carbons with nitrogen-doped (N-doped) structures are promising materials for advanced energy conversion and storage applications, including supercapacitors and fuel cell catalysts. In this study, microporous N-doped carbon was successfully fabricated through carbonization of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with an azine-linked two-dimensional molecular network (ACOF1). In the carbonized ACOF1, micropores with diameters smaller than 1 nm are selectively formed, and a high specific surface area (1596 cm2 gâˆ’1) is achieved. In addition, the highly porous structure with N-doped sites results in enhancement of the electrochemical capacitance. Detailed investigation for the micropore-forming process reveals that the formation of nitrogen gas during the thermal degradation of the azine bond contributes to the microporous structure formation. Therefore, the present direct carbonization approach using COFs allows the fabrication of microporous heteroatom-doped carbons, based on molecularly designed COFs, toward future electrochemical and energy applications.
