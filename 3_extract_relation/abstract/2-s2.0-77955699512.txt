Activated nitrogen-enriched carbon/carbon aerogel nanocomposites (ANC/ACA) were prepared by synthesis of melamine resin/carbon aerogel composites, carbonization and KOH activation. Novel asymmetric supercapacitors consisting of Ni(OH)2/Co(OH)2 as anode and ANC/ACA with different composite ratios as cathode were assembled. The influence of composite ratio on electrochemical performances of materials was detected by cycle voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge methods. The results of XPS and SEM show that N atoms exist in the ANC/ACA and ANC/ACA shows nanometer and honeycomb structure with more pores. When the composite ratio of ANC/ACA is 12:1, the ANC/ACA shows the highest Cp1 (312.8 F/g) vs 103.4 F/g of ACA and 230.1 F/g of ANC. And the optimal asymmetric supercapacitor with the ANC/ACA as cathode also shows the best electrochemical performances. The optimal supercapacitor is stable over 100 cycles. When the current density is 50 mA/cm2, the Cp2, Ep and P of the optimal supercapacitor are still 57.3 F/g, 9.0 W·h/g and 1 302.1W/kg, respectively. © 2009 The Nonferrous Metals Society of China.
