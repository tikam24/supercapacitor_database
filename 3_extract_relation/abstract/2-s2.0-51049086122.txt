In this paper, the research and test platform for hybrid electric vehicle has been presented, which comprises power supply system, super capacitor based energy storage, traction system and the simulated load of vehicle. The strategies of energy sources control and management have been tested and verified in the standard speed cycle. The results show that the current of the power supply system (e.g. fuel cell) can be directly or indirectly controlled to be continuously changing. This feature can ensure good operating condition of power supply system. The test platform presented in this paper can be used for the further system test and optimization.
