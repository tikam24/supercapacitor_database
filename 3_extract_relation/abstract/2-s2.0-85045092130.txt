A solution strategy performed at room temperature was presented for the in situ synthesis of SnO nanoparticles. SnO nanoparticles were prepared through the following sequent procedure: (1) preparation of rod-like Cd(OH)Cl utilizing the reaction between Cd2+ ions and epoxide; (2) production of Sn21Cl16(OH)14O6 template through the cation exchange reaction between Cd(OH)Cl and Sn2+ ions; (3) formation of SnO nanoparticles on nickel foam by the in situ reaction in strong alkaline electrolyte solution before electrochemical measurement. The as-prepared SnO had very small particle size and ordered nanostructure of particulate sheet, therefore resulting in its excellent electrochemical performance including high specific capacitance and high electrochemical stability for the charge-discharge cycle. Hence, the SnO nanoparticles synthesized in this work could be considered as one promising metal oxide for the utilization as electrode material in supercapacitor.
