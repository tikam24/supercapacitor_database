Two-dimensional manganese sulphide (MnS) nanosheets have been successfully synthesised by a facile, fast, moderate (< 200Â°C) hydrothermal method. Through the examination of X-ray powder diffraction method, the crystal structure of the sample is proved to be cubic crystal system and the polymorph is alpha-MnS. Through scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope (TEM), the morphology is observed to be nanosheet with the thickness of 15-30 nm. The alpha-MnS nanosheets electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance for supercapacitor. The supercapacitor shows a high specific capacity of 667.40 F g-1 at a scan rate 1 mV s-1, 344.51 F g-1 at current density of 0.5 A g-1 and a high capacitance retention about 93% after 5000 charge-discharge cycles.
