To prevent restacking of the Ti3C2Tx layers, the Ti3C2Tx-foam has been successfully synthesized through thermal treatment of Ti3C2Tx-film with the hydrazine monohydrate. The interconnected porous structure of Ti3C2Tx-foam could effectively reduce the restacking of the Ti3C2Tx sheets and shorten the diffusion path of ions and accelerate the intercalation/de-intercalation of ions. The Ti3C2Tx-foam-80 used as free-standing electrode achieves a high areal capacitance of 271.2 mF/cm2 (122.7 F/g) at a scan rate of 5 mV/s in 1 M KOH electrolyte. It also exhibited a high capability rate of 65.5% from 5 mV/s to 100 mV/s and good cycle life with 88.7% retention of its initial after 10,000 cycles at a scan rate of 50 mV/s.
