In the paper, dynamic behavior of the ultracapacitors is investigated and analyzed. The ultracapacitors are represented by equivalent electrical circuit models and mathematically described by fractional-order differential equations. The identification procedure is proposed to identify the parameters of the models. The results of numerical simulations are compared with the results measured experimentally in the physical system.
