N-doped hierarchical porous carbon with an open-ended nanostructures were prepared through activating hollow carbon spheres (HCS), which were synthesized by using the selfassembled amphiphilic block copolymer polystyrene-b-poly(4- vinyl pyridine) (PS-b-P4VP) as template and pyrrole as carbon and nitrogen source. Through chemical activation with KOH, the original close-ended HCS became open-ended nanostructures (denoted as A-HCS). This unique structure possesses several important properties as electrode for application in supercapacitors: (a) large surface area (1583 m2/g) and pore volume (3.82 cm3/g), (b) hierarchical porous carbon with small size (<100 nm) and thin curved walls (thickness <20 nm), (c) high N content (6.73 at%). Compared with the close-ended HCS, the open-ended A-HCS exhibits better performance. The A-HCS electrode presents a high specific capacitance (284 F/g at 0.2 A/ g), good rate capability (70% retention as the current density increased from 0.2 to 30 A/g), and superior cycling stability (96% retention after 5000 cycles at 10 A/g). These results demonstrate that the N-doped hierarchical porous carbon material with open-ended nanostructure represents an alternative promising candidate as an efficient electrode material for supercapacitors.
