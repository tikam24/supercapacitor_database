Massive advancements in the energy storage devices has urged scientist to remediate physically/chemically electroactive methods for excellent supercapacitor applications. The use of binders in energy storing devices obstacles their charge carrier in redox kinetics and high internal resistances results in low electrochemical performances. Herein, we successfully decorated gravel-like NiMoO4 nanoparticles arrays onto a carbon cloth (NMO@CC) which is used as binder-free electrode for electrochemical supercapacitor measurements. The NMO@CC electrode unveils a noticeable specific capacitance of 970 F/g 2.5 A/g of current density, exceptional stability and retention of 91.34% after 5000 cycles. The outstanding electrochemical properties of NMO@CC are credited to the conductive nature of double-metal (Niâ€“Mo) ions and binder-free electrode that facilities rapid redox reactions and designate it as a promising pseudocapacitor in industrial applications.
