This paper proposes an adaptive power management strategy with reduced sensor requirement for grid connected hybrid microgrid system under faulty conditions which occur in grid tied converters. Generally parallel combination of grid tied converters (GTCs) are used as an interface between microgrid and grid, which are responsible for power transfer among renewable energy sources (RES), hybrid energy storage system (HESS), grid and loads. Hence they are very essential parts of microgrid systems but easily prone to faults due to semiconductor switch failures. This in turn effects the operation and reliability of microgrid. To overcome these drawbacks a new power management algorithm is proposed which takes into account converter faults, renewable power availability and state of charge limits of HESS to effectively manage power between different sources and sinks. In this work instantaneous symmetrical component theory (ISCT) is used for power sharing and limiting among grid tied converters, without measuring GTCs powers using control parameters. Apart from ensuring stable microgrid operation, power quality aspects such as harmonic mitigation, reactive power support and unity power factor are achieved. The effectiveness of the proposed system and algorithm is tested and validated using MATLAB based simulink environment.
