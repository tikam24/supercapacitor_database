A new micro-supercapacitor, as a promising energy-storage device for MEMS, was developed. Si substrate 3D microelectrode arrays were fabricated by MEMS technologies including Lithography, Inductively Coupled Plasma Etching (ICP), and RF magnetron sputtering, and a RuO 2 functional film was prepared on the surface of the arrays by cathodic deposition. The electrochemical performance of the 3D microelectrodes were investigated by Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and the results were compared with planar microelectrodes deeply. The experimental results show that the specific capacitance of 3D microelectrodes amounts to 1.57 F路cm -2. In addition, the micro-supercapacitor was also assembled with 3D microelectrodes. A maximum specific capacitance of 0.73 F路cm -2, a maximum power density of 0.50 mW路cm -2 and a maximum energy density of 0.36 J路cm -2 were obtained based on the results of galvanostatic charge/discharge measurement.
