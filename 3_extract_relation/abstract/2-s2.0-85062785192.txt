Electrochemical energy storage is of extraordinary importance for fulfilling the utilization of renewable and sustainable energy sources. There is an increasing demand for energy storage devices with high energy and power densities, prolonged stability, safety, and low cost. In the past decade, numerous research efforts have been devoted to achieving these requirements, especially in the design of advanced electrode materials. Hollow carbon spheres (HCS) derived nanomaterials combining the advantages of 3D HCS and porous structures have been considered as alternative electrode materials for advanced energy storage applications, due to their unique features such as high surface-to-volume ratios, encapsulation capability, together with outstanding chemical and thermal stability. In this review, the authors first present a comprehensive overview of the synthetic strategies of HCS, and elucidate the design and synthesis of HCS-derived nanomaterials including various types of HCS and their nanohybrids. Additionally, their significant roles as electrode materials for supercapacitors, lithium-ion or sodium-ion batteries, and sulfur hosts for lithium sulfur batteries are highlighted. Finally, current challenges in the synthesis of HCS and future directions in HCS-derived nanomaterials for energy storage applications are proposed.
