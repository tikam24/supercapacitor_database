Nitrogen doping is an effective way to tailor the properties of graphene-based materials. Current synthetic methods for nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) are limited by poor selectivity on nitrogen bonding configurations in the NG materials. Herein, we report the chemoselective synthesis of Pyrazolic-structure-rich Nitrogen-doped Graphene (PNG) in water solutions. PNG exhibits outstanding capacitive and electrocatalytic activities. The PNG supercapacitor with acidic hydrogel electrolytes provides a specific capacitance of 226 F g−1, an energy density of 30.3 Wh kg−1 and great durability, outperforming most of previous carbon materials-based supercapacitors. With neutral hydrogel electrolytes, the PNG supercapacitor can be operated at higher voltages up to 1.4 V, providing an enhanced energy density of 35.8 Wh kg−1. As an electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solutions, PNG needs a low overpotential of 394 mV to drive 20 mA cm−2 current density and retains its activity for 16 h without any decay. The activity and durability of PNG are superior to that of noble-metal-based OER catalyst IrO2. Our results demonstrate a facile and scalable chemoselective synthesis of high-performance bifunctional NG for supercapacitors and electrocatalysis.
