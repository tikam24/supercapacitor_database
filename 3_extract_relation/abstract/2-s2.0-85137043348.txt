The 3D N, S, P-doped C-metal-silicates (C-MSi, M = Ni, Co and Ni/Co) are derived from green algaes (GAs) calcined by N2. Then the alkali etching technique is used to treat the as-synthesized C-MSi by 3 M NaOH aqueous solution for 12 h (e-C-MSi). The electrochemical performance can be significantly improved due to the acquisition of the more hierarchical pores and larger specific surface area by alkali etching. In detail, the e-C-NiSi-3, e-C-CoSi-3 and e-C-NiCoSi-3 show higher specific capacitances and cycling performances than those of C-MSi in the three-electrode system. The solid-state hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) devices (C-MSi//AC and e-C-MSi//AC, M = Ni, Co and Ni/Co) are fabricated by the metal-silicates and activated carbon (AC). The e-C-MSi//AC HSC devices exhibit better electrochemical properties than those of C-MSi//AC in the two-electrode system: higher specific capacitances, larger energy densities and better cycle performance. For instance, e-C-NiCoSi-3//AC HSC device (479 mF cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2, 3.97 W h m−2 at 2.31 W m−2, 92 % after 5000 cycles) is superior to C-NiCoSi-3//AC HSC device (432 mF cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2, 3.15 W h m−2 at 2.14 W m−2, 87 % after 5000 cycles). These results demonstrate that the high-performance supercapacitors can be prepared by the natural GAs using simple method. Alkali etching technique can be used as a conventional and positive method to improve the electrochemical performance of metal-silicates, and can provide electrodes for applying to high-performance SCs.
