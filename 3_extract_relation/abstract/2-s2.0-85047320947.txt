Facile and economically viable one step hydrothermal route was adapted to synthesis SnO2/α-Fe2O3 nanocomposite with and without hexamine (HMT) as surfactant successfully. The formation of SnO2/α-Fe2O3 nanocomposite was confirmed through XRD, Raman, PL and FTIR studies. The presence of well defined XRD diffraction peaks of both SnO2 and α-Fe2O3 revealed the formation SnO2/α-Fe2O3 nanocomposite. The obtained characteristic Raman active (Eg+Eg+Eu+A2u) mode of vibrations confirmed the formation of SnO2/α-Fe2O3 nanocomposite. Photoluminescence study revealed the emission behavior of the product. Metal oxygen vibrations of Fe-O in both octahedral, tetrahedral sites and Sn-O were confirmed by the bands located at 466, 580 and 673cm-1 respectively through FTIR. The spherical morphology of the product synthesized with and without the surfactant HMT has been revealed by SEM images. The electrochemical behavior of the product was investigated through CV and EIS studies in 1M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution and obtained the highest specific capacitance of 211.25 F/g at 5mV for the surfactant assisted product.
