The development of implantable and wearable electronics and the concept of the internet of things proved a recent burgeoning growth with different applications. However, the integration of electrically driven devices depends on hard components that must be conveniently substituted by flexible and more efficient devices. Herein, the development of a simple and low-cost all-in-one flexible system based on triboelectric generators that harvest energy from the skin contact with the device is proposed and makes possible the storage of this energy in a supercapacitor prepared with the same support applied as collectors of triboelectric nanogenerators (eggshell membranes modified with graphene nanoplatelets and polypyrrole). This integrated prototype for the energy harvesting/storage device with the characteristic flexibility of natural eggshell membranes introduces promising properties of an autonomous device able to drive electronic devices integrated into flexible substrates.
