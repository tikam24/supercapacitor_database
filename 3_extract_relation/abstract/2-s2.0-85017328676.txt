Graphite oxide (GO) is thermally reduced in three different conditions (800 °C and 400 °C with ramping rates of 10 °C.min-1 and 400 °C with a ramping rate of 50 °C.min-1). In this study, Go produce during the three conditions were characterized for supercapacitor applications. The thermal reduction of Go at high temperature is known to be very efficient. However, the results of our research demonstrates that the thermal reduction at low temperature with a fast ramping rate (50C min1) is more effective. Electrochemical results for the reduced GO at low temperature with a higher ramping rate are superior to these for reduced GO at high temperature, proving that the fast ramping rate at low temperature is likely to provide economical and effective thermal reduction of GO.
