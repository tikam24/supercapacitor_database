Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) with unique metalloid features have been promised great application potential in developing high-efficiency electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage. Nevertheless, sluggish ion transportation and poor cycling stability are the critical hurdles limiting their application prospects. Herein, we presented the metal-organic framework-mediated construction of ultrafine Ni2P immobilized in reduced graphene oxide (rGO). Nano-porous two-dimensional (2D) Ni-metal-organic framework (Ni-MOF) was grown on holey graphene oxide (Ni(BDC)-HGO), followed by MOF-mediated tandem pyrolysis (carbonization and phosphidation; Ni(BDC)-HGO-X-P, X denoted carbonization temperature and P represented phosphidation). Structural analysis revealed that the open-framework structure in Ni(BDC)-HGO-X-Ps had endowed them with excellent ion conductivity. The Ni2P wrapped by carbon shells and the P[sbnd]O bonds linking between Ni2P and rGO ensured the better structural stability of Ni(BDC)-HGO-X-Ps. The resulting Ni(BDC)-HGO-400-P delivered a capacitance of 2333.3 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in a 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. More importantly, Ni(BDC)-HGO-400-P//activated carbon, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor with an energy density of 64.5 Wh kg−1 and a power density of 31.7 kW kg−1, almost maintained its initial capacitance after 10,000 cycles. Furthermore, in situ electrochemical-Raman measurements were exploited to demonstrate the electrochemical changes of Ni(BDC)-HGO-400-P throughout the charging and discharging processes. This study has further shed light on the design rationality of TMPs for optimizing supercapacitor performance.
