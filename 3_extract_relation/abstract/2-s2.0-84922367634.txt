Rod like and beam-shaped mesoporous carbons were prepared through an atmospheric pressure impregnation method at ambient temperature with attapulgite and fructose as template and carbon source. The influences of calcination temperature, calcination time, and carbon source concentration on the electrochemical performance of the resultant carbons were investigated and optimized. The resulting carbon possesses a maximum specific surface area and total pore volume of 1225 m2/g and 1.577 cm3/g, respectively. Electrochemical measurement showed excellent energy storage capacity of it. The electrode kept excellent stability after 5000 galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles, and no significant attenuation of specific capacitance was detected.
