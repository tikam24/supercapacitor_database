The hydrothermal synthesis and optimization of carbon supported vanadium disulphide nanocomposites which could potentially be utilized as electrodes in supercapacitors is hereby reported. The superior electrical conductivity of multi walled carbon nanotubes coupled with the modest electrocatalytic capability of vanadium disulphide creates a synergy that enhances effective redox charge transfer leading to greater capacitance. Minimum charge transfer resistance and peak to peak potential difference for the optimum electrode, measured at 0.32 Ω and 0.15 mV respectively signified relatively higher charge transfer which was attributed to the greater electrical conductivity shored up by the increased carbon content. Thus, the optimum electrode was determined to have a specific capacitance of 33F∙g−1at 1 mA current density. The results obtained show that the carbon supported vanadium disulphide electrodes could potentially be used in supercapacitors.
