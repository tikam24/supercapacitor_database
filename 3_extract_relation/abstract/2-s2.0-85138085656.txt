Energy is one the most fundamental necessities in daily life which is fulfilled from non-renewable and non-ecofriendly resources that are not only expensive in terms of costs but also depleting with time and causingenvironmental pollution. The quest for the renewable, eco-friendly and economic energy resources is in progression tomitigate the energy demands. In this context, cogent energy alternatives are under investigations to develop innovative strategies based on renewable, affordable and widely available resources. In these perspectives, Metal Sulfides (MS) and their derivatives are sensible, operative and eco-friendly electrocatalysts with ultramodern physiognomies because of extensive durability, porous topography, high surface area, extensive varieties, cost effectiveness, simplicity and chemical functionality. Various synthetic strategies such as hydrothermal, solvothermal and other miscellaneous techniques have been followed to design metal sulfides and their derivatives of countless compositions. The synthesized metal sulfides and their derivatives are favored for electrocatalytic solicitations with characteristic synergetic and plasmonic effects in order to explorehydrogen evolutionreaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), overall water splitting (OWS), carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR), and super capacitance. Appraising these synthetic strategies and electrocatalytic features, metal sulfides could be influential to attempt new, renewable and eco-friendly energy resources.
