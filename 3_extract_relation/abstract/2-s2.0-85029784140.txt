RuO2 samples were deposited on stainless steel at 723 K by an ultrasonic spray pyrolysis technique using 0.005 M RuCl3.nH2O as a precursor solution. XRD analysis confirms the amorphous nature of the deposited samples. Raman studies confirm the formation of RuO2 phase. SEM, AFM and HRTEM morphologies illustrate uniform spherical granular type morphology of hydrophilic nature. BET study confirms mesoporous nature. RuO2 phase formation is also confirmed by using XPS analysis. All electrochemical characterizations of the as deposited electrodes were carried out in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. Optimized electrode shows maximum specific capacitance 2192 F/g at 2 mV/sec. The achieved maximum values of specific energy (SE) specific power (SP) and columbic efficiency (Î·) calculated by using galvanostatic charge-discharge method are 61.12 Wh/Kg, 114.94 kW/Kg and 72.34% respectively. The obtained corrosion rate is ~ 0.1171(mm/year) which is very less than reported values.
