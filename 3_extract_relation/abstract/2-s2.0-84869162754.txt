This study includes nanomaterials and nanocomposites for the fabrication of supercapacitor cells aiming at both high power and high energy densities. Activated carbon powder, multi-wall carbon nanotubes and graphene are considered as electrode materials. Electrochemical double layer supercapacitor cells (EDLCs) have been fabricated and tested to a maximum voltage of 3 V, where TEABF4 solution has been used as the organic electrolyte. The supercapacitors are proposed for applications of personal electronics, EV and HEV, and displays, depending on their maximum frequency of operation. Â© 2012 IEEE.
