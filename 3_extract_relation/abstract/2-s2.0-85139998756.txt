Despite the ever-increasing demand for transparent power sources in wireless optoelectronics, most of them have still relied on synthetic chemicals, thus limiting their versatile applications. Here, a class of transparent nanocellulose paper microsupercapacitors (TNP-MSCs) as a beyond-synthetic-material strategy is demonstrated. Onto semi-interpenetrating polymer network-structured, thiol-modified transparent nanocellulose paper, a thin layer of silver nanowire and a conducting polymer (chosen as a pseudocapacitive electrode material) are consecutively introduced through microscale-patterned masks (which are fabricated by electrohydrodynamic jet printing) to produce a transparent conductive electrode (TNP-TCE) with planar interdigitated structure. This TNP-TCE, in combination with solid-state gel electrolytes, enables on-demand (in-series/in-parallel) cell configurations in a single body of TNP-MSC. Driven by this structural uniqueness and scalable microfabrication, the TNP-MSC exhibits improvements in optical transparency (T = 85%), areal capacitance (0.24 mF cmâˆ’2), controllable voltage (7.2 V per cell), and mechanical flexibility (origami airplane), which exceed those of previously reported transparent MSCs based on synthetic chemicals.
