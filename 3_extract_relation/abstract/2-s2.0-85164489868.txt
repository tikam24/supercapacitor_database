As a potential clarification of the burgeoning global need for impactful energy storage, supercapacitors have shown a great deal of promise. Transition metal oxides play an important role in a environmental sociability, and abundance. Various weight percentages (2%, 4%, and 6%) of copper-incorporated Manganese dioxide (Cu-doped α-MnO2) are prepared by a hydrothermal method that resembles the sea urchin structure to augment the electrochemical performance for energy storage applications. The samples are characterized for their structure, morphology, and elemental composition by various analytical tools. The super-capacitive nature of the materials is further investigated as electrodes for an asymmetric hybrid capacitor with 6 M KOH. Among them, the 2% Cu-doped α-MnO2 exhibits the best electrocapacitive output by virtue of its low resistance along with large surface area. This electrode achieves a specific capacitance (258.99 F/g) at 1 A/g with a maximum energy density (35.97 W kg−1) and power density (357.13 W h/kg).
