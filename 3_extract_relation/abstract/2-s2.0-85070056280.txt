The activated carbon paper (ACP) has been designed as the active electrode material of supercapacitor to improve its capacitive performance. ACP is prepared by electrochemical nitrate ion-assisted exfoliation, sulfate ion-assisted exfoliation, and subsequent hydrothermal reduction processes. The as-prepared ACP shows obviously rougher surface along with the expanded layer distance. ACP exhibits higher specific capacitance of 380 mF/cm2 at 1 mA/cm2 than that of 21 mF/cm2 for carbon paper. ACP electrode shows the cycling capacitance retention of 98% after 5000 cycles at 10 mA/cm2. The symmetric ACP supercapacitor is constructed using ACP electrode and H2SO4 involved polyvinyl alcohol gel electrolyte. ACP supercapacitor presents the specific capacitance of 97 mF/cm2, the energy density of 0.343 mW h/cm3, and the output voltage of 1.6 V at 1 mA/cm2. ACP with high capacitance performance presents the promising supercapacitor application for the electrochemical energy storage.
