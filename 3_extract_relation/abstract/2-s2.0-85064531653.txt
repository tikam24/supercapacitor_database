In this paper, two-component nanocages containing CoSx and nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxides (Ni-Co LDH) were facilely synthesized via a multistep transformation approach. The zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) nanocrystals were firstly synthesized, and then after partial sulfuration, the CoSx/Ni-Co LDH nanocages were achieved by adding nickel ions for etching and precipitation. The prepared CoSx/Ni-Co LDH nanocages consisted of the hollow rhombic dodecahedral morphology with many nanosheets arrays on the shell. When used as electrode materials for electrochemical capacitors, this CoSx/Ni-Co LDH nanocages deliver a specific capacitance of 1562 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. In addition, an asymmetric supercapacitor assembled with CoSx/Ni-Co LDH as cathode and active carbon (AC) as anode shows a high energy density of 35.8 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 800 W kg−1 and has an excellent cycling performance with the retention rate of 94.56% after 10,000 cycles, suggesting their potential application in high-performance electrochemical capacitors. These exceptional electrochemical properties can be attributed to the unique structure and synergistic effects between the metal sulfide and the bimetallic hydroxide, which also indicate the potential application of CoSx/Ni-Co LDH nanocages in high-performance supercapacitors.
