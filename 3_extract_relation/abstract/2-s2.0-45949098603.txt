In this paper, carbon aerogel was synthesized by ambient pressure drying. The electrochemical properties of carbon aerogel ware studied. The results showed that carbon aerogel electrodes exhibited excellent electrochemical behavior. Compared to the commercial super activated carbon imported from Japan, carbon aerogels had better mass specific capacitance at high sweep rate (100 mV/s) and electric double layer (EDL) specific capacitance (89 F/g and 21 Î¼F/cm2 respectively).
