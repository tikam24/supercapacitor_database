Self-discharge is one of the most important considerations in manufacturing supercapacitors. This paper discussed two dynamic mathematical models of self-discharge behavior of supercapacitor from the concept of regular capacitor mechanisms and impedance of an R-C circuit, and constant phase elements (CPE), impedance of R-CPE, and fractional-order derivatives. The mathematical model was derived from each other to show their equality and relationships.
