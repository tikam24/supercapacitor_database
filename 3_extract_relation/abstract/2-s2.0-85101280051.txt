The increasing global energy demand requires the coordinated development of energy conversion and energy storage materials. Metal halide perovskites have emerged as strong semiconductor candidates for both applications. While metal halide perovskites have received much attention for a range of energy conversion devices, there is a limited use of these materials in energy storage devices. This review summarizes the current status of metal halide perovskites for Li-ion battery and supercapacitor applications while mainly focusing on the device architecture, synthesis method, and material properties. Special attention is placed on the impact of the morphology, defect density and doping of the perovskite active layer on the performance of these devices. Finally, perspectives for the further development of this field are proposed.
