Metal-organic frameworks are a class of functional porous materials. In recent years, metal-organic frameworks have become a hot research topic in the field of electrochemistry because of their controllable morphology, abundant pores, high specific surface area and versatility. Herein, we summarize the latest developments of metal-organic frameworks and metal-organic framework composites as electrode materials or catalysts for electrochemical applications such as batteries, supercapacitors, electrocatalysts and electrochemical sensors. The morphological and electrochemical properties of these promising metal-organic framework materials for their future development are discussed. Finally, based on the reported literature, we propose the future direction of metal-organic frameworks and metal-organic framework composites in the field of electrochemistry.
