Supercapacitors are a type of commercialized energy storage device that can reserve energy but also show the characteristic of fast charging and discharging speed. The design and construction of all-solid-state flexible asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) are promising for wearable electronic devices, while the rational design of electrode materials is one of the most essential parts of this procedure. This work demonstrates a facile hybridization of Bi2O2Se nanosheets (NS) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The obtained Bi2O2Se NS/rGO composites show enhanced capacity and stability compared with the singular component of Bi2O2Se NS. Employing the Bi2O2Se NS/rGO composites on carbon cloth (CC) as an anode and a Ni(OH)2/rGO@CC electrode as a cathode, and solid electrolyte PVA-KOH gel as both of the electrolyte and the separator, the fabricated all-solid-state flexible ASC can exhibit a specific capacity of 52.4 mAh g−1 at the current density of 1 ​A ​g−1, and a maximum energy density of 57.9 ​Wh kg−1 ​at a power density of 1.10 ​kW ​kg−1. Meanwhile, the ASC device reveals excellent flexibility and cycling stability, with more than 92% capacity retention after 2000 cycles.
