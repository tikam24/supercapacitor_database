Carbon microcoils (CMCs) were prepared by CVD, and then were purified and activated with nitric acid and KOH. The morphology of CMC samples with their catalyzer were characterized by means of scanning electron microscope, optical microscope and X-ray spectrometer, respectively. CMCs supercapacitors were characterized by charge-discharge, cyclic voltammetry(CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy(EIS). The results show that in the current density of 50 mA · g -1, the electrochemical capacity of no-disposed CMCs, purification CMCs and activation CMCs are 12.7 F · g -1, 41.4 F · g -1 and 111.1 F · g -1 (about 8.75 times before the disposed), respectively. It can be concluded that the capacity of CMCs supercapacitors can be improved by purification and activation. © Right.
