In general, the train has consumed energy from the traction substation via the conductor during acceleration or motoring mode. This mode consumes most of the energy. However, during deceleration or braking mode, energy can be returned to the power terminal by regenerative braking management. This paper presents the energy loss reduction in the conductor transmission system and energy distribution mitigation from the traction substations by using the on-board supercapacitor, which is a storage device for storing regenerative braking energy. The results include the first case without a supercapacitor and the second case with supercapacitor operated on piece-wise linear state of charge (SOC) control. They are obtained by the single-train simulation on MATLAB and the power flow calculation by current injection method (CIM) on the peak time of the DC Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) Purple Line in Bangkok, Thailand. This research can effectively save energy distribution, energy loss and energy waste by approximately 3.5 %, 10 % and 20 % respectively
