Presented here is a sol-gel route for the fabrication of TiO2/ZnS electrodes with various amounts of ZnS for supercapacitor applications. This study used various dosages of zinc and sulfide precursors. We evaluated the electrochemical properties of the electrodes through cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic chargeâ€“discharge (GCD), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and cycle life test. From the investigated composites, the electrode with 0.25 M of zinc and 0.5 M of sulfide possesses a large capacitance regardless of the scan rate owing to its increased surface area and a low charge transfer resistance (Rct). Finally, an asymmetric capacitor (ASC) was designed utilizing the prepared electrode. We conducted the cycle stability test of the ASC to recognize the stability of the fabricated device. The ASC reveals only a 5% dip in capacitance retention over the course of 2000 cycles.
