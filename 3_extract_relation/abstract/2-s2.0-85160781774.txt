As cathode materials for supercapacitors, metallic oxide composites have high theoretical capacities, which have received widespread attentions. However, due to the rapid capacity degradation，it remains a challenge to the development of metallic oxides. A composite electrode material for supercapacitors scheme is proposed in this paper, which is constructed by novel hybrid ZnO-SnO2 nanoparticles, annealed from hollow nanospheres ZnSn(OH)6, and is well encapsulated within a three-dimensional reduced graphene oxide (RGO). The RGO@ZnO-SnO2 electrodes show excellent performances with high initial coulomb efficiency of 98.9 %, high reversible capacities (581.8 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1), enhanced long-term cycling with capacity retention rate of 98 % and fantastic rate capability (440.9 F g−1 at 5A g−1) after 1000 cycles. When assembled with AC cathodes, the full supercapacitors exhibit excellent electrochemical performances (26 Wh·kg−1 at 0.75 kW·kg−1, 8.2 W·kg−1 at 9.87 kW·kg−1). This method also provides a new idea for the preparation of other bimetallic selenides, oxides, sulfides or phosphides with improved electrochemical properties.
