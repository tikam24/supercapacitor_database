Numerous studies have focused on the development of energy-storage devices, such as batteries and supercapacitors (SCs). As molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and graphene have complementary physical properties and similar layered structures, they can be combined in specific ways to create heterostructures. This capability alleviates the weaknesses of the individual counterparts and optimizes their performance. Recent advances have revealed that the unique structure and morphology, as well as the continuous conductive channels of MoS2/graphene (MoS2/G) composites, provide more active sites, improve the conductivity, and accelerate the charge transport and electrolyte diffusion of the material. Thus, MoS2/G composites could provide new opportunities for energy-storage technologies. In this review, we summarize and discuss recent advances and potential applications of MoS2/G composites in energy-storage devices. More importantly, we expound the improvement in the electrochemical performance of composites with functional materials and via heteroatom-doping. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and opportunities for the future direction of MoS2/G composites.
