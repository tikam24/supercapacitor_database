Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide nanosheet is attracting increasing attention in energy storage due to unique nanoconstruction and electronic properties. In this work, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheet was prepared by a simple hydrothermal method, and its properties were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The electrochemical performances of the product were evaluated by cyclic voltammogram, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The MoS2 nanosheet showed a specific capacitance of 129.2 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1. In addition, the MoS2 nanosheet electrode showed good cycle property as an excellent electrode material for electrochemical capacitors and the specific capacitance had only a slight decrease after 500 cycles (retention of 85.1%). The excellent electrochemical performance was attributed to the unique morphology of MoS2 nanosheets, which possessed large specific surface area, unique 2D nanostructures and low equivalent series resistance.
