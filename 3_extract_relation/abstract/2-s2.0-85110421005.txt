Supercapacitor (SC) technology has been considered as one of the most emerging and efficient technologies for the next-generation energy storage devices. SCs are one of the elite classes of those energy storage devices, which have the ability to store electrical charge in an electric double layer at the interface of electrode and electrolyte. For the past few decades, carbon materials with high surface area have been widely investigated as effective electrode materials for SCs. Recently, biomass materials are broadly explored as a source of advanced carbons because of their high abundance, renewable nature, low cost, and eco-friendly properties. This chapter deals with the principle of SC technology, brief overview of SC electrodes, advantages and disadvantages of different forms of carbon-based electrodes, and different types of carbon-based composite electrodes. Furthermore, the chapter focuses on the utilization of different biomass-derived precursors for the synthesis of carbonaceous materials to design advanced electric double-layer capacitors and hybrid capacitors. Recent trends on the utilization of biomass-derived carbon for SCs will also be covered in this chapter.
