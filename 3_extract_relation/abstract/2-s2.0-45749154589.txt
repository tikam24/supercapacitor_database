We present the structural, magnetic and electrochemical properties of the pyrophosphate LiFe1.5P2O7 synthesized by sol-gel method. The structure was determined by X-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, Raman scattering, and magnetometry. Electrochemical properties of LiFe1.5P 2O7 were carried out in lithium cells with LiPF 6-EC-DEC electrolyte at 25Â°C copyright The Electrochemical Society.
