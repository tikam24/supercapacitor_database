Flexible Carbonized MXene/Cotton fabric is prepared by dipping cotton fabric into Ti3C2Tx suspension and carbonizing the composite fabric. Cotton fabric, embedded by Ti3C2Tx flakes without the assistance of crosslinkers and binders, is the most used precursor of all carbon sources. In this work, Ti3C2Tx flakes with different concentrations ranging from 2 to 8 wt% are loaded on cotton fabric and carbonized subsequently under the temperature from 800 to 1200 °C. The highest areal capacitance dramatically reaches to 794.2 mF cm−2 (233.6 F g−1) at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 with 6 wt% Ti3C2Tx at 1000 °C, which shows a 74% improvement compared to the carbonized cotton cloth dipped into the Ti3C2Tx dispersions under same condition. Also, the assembled all-solid-state flexible supercapacitor remains 74% of capacitance even after 10,000 charge and discharge cycles showing a stable rechargeable ability. From a variety of cellulosic materials, the method can be used to produce Ti3C2Tx composite fabrics which are promising candidates of energy storage, electromagnetic shielding, sensing, absorbing, electrocatalysis, etc.
