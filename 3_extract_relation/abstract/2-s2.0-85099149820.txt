In this study, Ti3C2TX@PEDOT composite is synthesized using multilayer Ti3C2TX and conductive polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) by a simple in-situ polymerization method. The PEDOT component effectively solves the problem of Ti3C2TX layers stacking and further improves the specific surface area of Ti3C2TX. Besides, additional pseudocapacitance is also provided by the added PEDOT component. In 1 M H2SO4, the Ti3C2TX @PEDOT (1:10) composite exhibits a higher capacitance (564 F g−1) at the current density of 1 A g−1 compared to the original Ti3C2TX material, and excellent cycling performance with a capacitance retention of 96.5% after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles at a current density of 10 A g−1. The Ti3C2Tx@PEDOT(1:10)-based symmetric supercapacitor shows a specific capacitance of 100 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1, and an energy density of 6.34 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 4077 W kg−1. The enhanced electrochemical performance and stability are due to the surface redox process and synergistic effects of the Ti3C2TX@PEDOT.
