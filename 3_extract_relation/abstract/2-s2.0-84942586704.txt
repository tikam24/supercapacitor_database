One-dimensional (1D)-structured nanomaterials represent one of the most attractive candidates for energy-storage systems due to their contribution to design simplicity, fast charge-transportation network, and their allowance for more accessible ion diffusion. In particular, 1D-structured nanomaterials with a highly complex inner-pore configuration enhance functionality by taking advantage of both the hollow and 1D structures. In this study, we report a MnO2 nanohair-decorated, hybrid multichannel carbon nanofiber (Mn-MCNF) fabricated via single-nozzle co-electrospinning of two immiscible polymer solutions, followed by carbonization and redox reactions. With improved ion accessibility, the optimized Mn-MCNF sample (Mn-MCNF-60 corresponding to a reaction duration time of 60 min for optimal MnO2 nanohair growth) exhibited a high specific capacitance of 855 F g-1 and excellent cycling performance with âˆ¼87.3% capacitance retention over 5000 cycles.
