In this investigation, several nanocomposites with varying amounts of Mn and Ti oxides were prepared using surfactant assisted sol-gel method. To prepare these nanocomposites, sol-A with Ti precursor and sol-B containing Mn precursor were separately prepared using the required precursor amounts in ethanol and 5-30 wt.% pluronic 123 surfactant. Gelation was accomplished by the addition of DI water and catalyzed by HCl. The gels were aged for 24 hrs, dried at 80°C for 12 hrs and calcined'at 500°-1000°C for 5 hrs. These powdered electrode materials were analyzed by x-ray diffraction and BET surface area analysis. For the nanocomposite prepared with Mn:Ti at 65:35 wt.% and calcined at 500°C, both anatase and rutile phases alongwith MruOi were observed. As calcination temperature increased to 1000°C, rutile and Mn2O3 phases were decreased with the formation of MnTiCb. BET SSA of 30.6 m2/g was observed for the powdered material calcined at 500°C with avg. pore diameter of 7.5 nm. Supercapacitors were fabricated using these nanocomposites and cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed to infer specific capacitance. Higher specific capacitance of 125 F.g"1 was observed for the supercapacitor fabricated with the Mn:Ti nanocomposite calcined at lower temperature of 500°C.
