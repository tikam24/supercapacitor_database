The Co3O4@N-MWCNT composite was synthesized by a sonication-supported thermal reduction process for supercapacitor applications. The structural and morphological properties of the materials were characterized via Raman, XRD, XPS, SEMâ€“EDX, and FE-TEM analysis. The composite electrode was constructed into a three-electrode configuration and examined by using CV, GCD and EIS analysis. The demonstrated electrochemical value of ~ 225 F/g at 0.5 A/g by the electrode made it appropriate for potential use in supercapacitor applications.
