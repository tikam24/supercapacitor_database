Poly(3-oligo(ethylene oxide))thiophene (PD2ET) with an ethanolamine terminal in the side chain was covalently grafted onto the surface of single-walled carbon nanotube bundles (PD2ET-g-SWCNTs) by using an esterification reaction. The chemical bond between PD2ET and the SWCNTs is confirmed by using various techniques, such as Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The microstructural and morphological investigation revealed a good distribution of PD2ET on the surface of the SWCNTs, with a thickness of about 2â€“3 nm. As an electroactive material, the fabricated PD2ET-g-SWCNTs electrode demonstrated high capacitive performance in electrochemical tests, in which an efficient specific capacitance of 399 F/g at 1 A/g was obtained from galvanostatic charge/discharge techniques. Furthermore, the long-term stability investigation of PD2ET-g-SWCNTs electrode showed that over 91 % capacitance retention could be retained after 8000 successive charge/discharge cycles. The integrated two-electrode supercapacitor based on the PD2ET-g-SWCNTs hybrid exhibited a high energy density of 22.5 Wh/kg and a power density of 500 W/kg at 0.625 A/g. The enhanced electrochemical behavior of the PD2ET-g-SWCNTs hybrid can be ascribed to the contribution of oligo(ethylene oxide), which facilitates ion diffusion and enables a faster charge process, thus rendering high efficiency in supercapacitors.
