Owing to the need for portable and sustainable energy sources and the development trend for microminiaturization and multifunctionalization in the electronic components, the study of integrated self-charging power packs has attracted increasing attention. A new self-charging power pack consisting of a silicon nanowire array/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) hybrid solar cell and a laser-scribed graphene (LSG) supercapacitor has been fabricated. The Si nanowire array/PEDOT:PSS hybrid solar cell structure exhibited a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.37%. The LSG demonstrated excellent energy storage capability for the power pack, with high current density, energy density, and cyclic stability when compared to other supercapacitor electrodes such as active carbon and conducting polymers. The overall efficiency of the power unit is 2.92%.
