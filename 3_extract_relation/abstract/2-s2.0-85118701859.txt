Symmetric supercapacitor devices were fabricated from MoS2 incorporated carbon allotropes such as activated carbon (AC)/MoS2, graphene/MoS2 and MWCNT/MoS2. The device performance was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The electrochemical properties of the devices fabricated from carbon allotropes (activated carbon, graphene, MWCNT) were remarkably enhanced to above 50% by the incorporation MoS2 phases. Out of the three fabricated devices, electrochemical performance of AC/MoS2 as found to be superior. The specific capacitance and energy density of this device is 216 ​F/g and 6.2 ​Wh/Kg respectively with excellent higher rate capability and longer cyclic durability. The devices fabricated from graphene/MoS2 and MWCNT/MoS2 has exhibited a specific capacitance value of 202 ​F/g and 161 ​F/g with an energy density value of 5.68 ​Wh/Kg and 3.95 ​Wh/Kg respectively.
