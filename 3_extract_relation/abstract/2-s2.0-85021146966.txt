In this study, we investigated the influence of the reduction temperature on graphene oxide. After performing the thermal reduction at specific temperatures (200, 600, and 1000 °C), the morphological and crystallographic changes were investigated by several analysis methods. The reduced graphene oxides were used as supercapacitor electrodes and analyzed with various electrochemical techniques. The capacitance exhibited an increase up to 600 °C before decreasing abruptly at 1000 °C. This behavior was ascribed to the limited ionic accessibility into the compact graphene layer.[Figure not available: see fulltext.].
