In order to correctly implement an energy management strategy for a multi-source system, the output currents of different sources should be regulated to the desired references precisely and rapidly. In this paper, the underlying control of hybrid energy storage system composed by battery and supercapacitor is presented. Three current tracking controllers, PID, sliding mode, and fuzzy logic, are designed for the proposed system. Then, the control performances of the three controllers are compared according to the control precision, feasible control parameter range, and robustness to input voltage variation. The comparison is realized by carrying out a series of simulations.
