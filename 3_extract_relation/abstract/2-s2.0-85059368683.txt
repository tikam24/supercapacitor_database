With the growing demands for energy storage, it is urgent to develop high-performance supercapacitors through a cost-effective and sustainable strategy. Herein, the pseudocapacitive performances of Ni-Al-layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets are significantly improved after introducing carbon fibers (CFs) as the conductive matrix, which can not only prevent aggregation of Ni-Al-LDH nanosheets but also enhance the electrical conductivity of the nanocomposite. The CFs are derived from cotton stalks, which are a common agricultural waste, therefore turning waste to treasure. The obtained CF@Ni-Al-LDH exhibits high specific capacitance (1214.9 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 ), great rate capability (917.0 F g −1 at 10 A g −1 ), and good cyclability (528 F g −1 after 1000 cycles at 20 A g −1 ). Using this nanocomposite as the cathode material, an aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is assembled, and delivers acceptable specific energy of 20.1 Wh kg −1 at 932 W kg −1 . The fabrication strategy in this report manifests great potential for developing next-generation pseudocapacitive materials.
