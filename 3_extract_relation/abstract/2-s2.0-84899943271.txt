Supercapacitor, known as an important energy storage device, is also a critical component for next generation of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. In this study, we report a novel route for synthesis of three-dimensional Ni(OH) 2/graphene/nickel foam electrode by electrochemical depositing Ni(OH)2 nanoflakes on graphene network grown on nickel foam current collector and explore its applications in supercapacitors. The resulting binder-free Ni(OH)2/graphene/nickel foam electrode exhibits excellent supercapacitor performance with a specific capacitance of 2161 F/g at a current density of 3 A/g. Even as the current density reaches up to 60 A/g, it still remains a high capacitance of 1520 F/g, which is much higher than that of Ni(OH)2/nickel foam electrode. The enhanced rate capability performance of Ni(OH)2/graphene/nickel foam electrode is closely related to the presence of highly conductive graphene layer on nickel foam, which can remarkably boost the charge-transfer process at electrolyte-electrode interface. The three-dimensional graphene/nickel foam substrate also significantly improves the electrochemical cycling stability of the electrodeposited Ni(OH)2 film because of the strong adhesion between graphene film and electrodeposited Ni(OH)2 nanoflakes. Results of this study provide an alternative pathway to improve the rate capability and cycling stability of Ni(OH)2 nanostructure electrode and offer a great promise for its applications in supercapacitors.
