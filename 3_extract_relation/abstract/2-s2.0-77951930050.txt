The application of composite power in hybrid electric vehicles was studied. The structure of composite power for a certain parallel hybrid electric vehicle was designed and its efficiency characteristic was researched. The strategy for control of power distribution of composite power and the strategy for the batteries to charge the supercapacitor were established. The model of a composite energy storage system was established in MATALAB/Simulink. Then, the simulation model was embedded in the ADVISOR software and was simulated on the UDDS driving cycle. The simulation results show that the supercapacitor and batteries can give full play to their respective advantages when the control strategy of composite power is adopted, so the efficiency of the vehicle energy storage system can be enhanced and a higher efficiency of the braking energy recovery can be obtained.
