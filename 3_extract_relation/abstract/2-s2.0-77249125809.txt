Fuzzy nanofibrous network of polyaniline electrode is successfully electrosynthesized for supercapacitor application. The nanofibre network of polyaniline electrode is characterized using Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and optical absorption studies. Network of polyaniline is highly porous with interconnected fuzzy nanofibres having diameter typically between 120 and 125 nm. The supercapacitive performance of polyaniline electrode is tested using cyclic voltammetry (C-V) technique in H2SO4 electrolyte within potential range of -100 to 800 mV. The effect of scan rate on the capacitance of polyaniline electrode is studied. The highest specific capacitance of 839 F g-1 at the voltage scan rate of 10 mV s-1 is achieved. Additionally stability and charging-discharging of polyaniline electrode are studied. Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
