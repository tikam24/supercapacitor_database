Rational design and structural regulation of hybrid nanomaterials with superior electrochemical performance are crucial for developing sustainable energy storage platforms. Among these materials, NiCo-layered double hydroxides (NiCo-LDHs) demonstrate an exceptional charge storage capabilities owing to their tunable 2D lamellar structure, large interlayer spacing, and rich redox electrochemically active sites. However, NiCo-LDHs still suffer from sever agglomeration of their particles with limited charge transfer rates, resulting in an inadequate rate capability. In this study, bimetallic ZnCo-metal organic framework (MOF) tripods were grown on the surface of NiCo-LDH nanowires, which significantly reduced the self-agglomeration and stacking of the NiCo-LDH nanowire arrays, offering more accessible active sites for charge transfer and shortening the path for ion diffusion. The fabricated hybrid ZnCo-MOF@NiCo-LDH and its individual counterparts were tested as supercapacitor electrodes. The ZnCo-MOF@NiCo-LDH electrode demonstrated a remarkable specific capacitance of 1611 F g-1 at 2 A g-1 with an enhanced rate capability of 66% from 2 to 20 A g-1. Moreover, an asymmetric all solid-state supercapacitor device was constructed using ZnCo-MOF@NiCo-LDH and palm tree-derived activated carbon (P-AC) as positive and negative poles, respectively. The constructed device can store a high specific energy of 44.5 Wh Kg-1 and deliver a specific power of 876.7 W Kg-1 with outstanding Columbic efficiency over 10,000 charging/discharging cycles at 15 A g-1
