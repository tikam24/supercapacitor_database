Generally adopted strategies to improve capacitance of the electrode materials are tuning various properties of the electrode material or increasing the cell voltage. While tuning the properties of the electrode material is tedious, increasing the cell voltage is restricted by the stability of the electrolyte. Herein, we report a facile approach to improve the capacitance of MnCO3 by the influence of SiOx nanofluid in the electrolyte. The capacitance properties of MnCO3 are studied in 0.1 M Mg(ClO4)2 electrolyte in the presence and in the absence of SiOx nanofluid. The presence of small amount of SiOx nanofluid in the electrolyte provides higher diffusivity and more conductive percolation paths for ions and thus decreases internal resistance and increases ionic conductivity of the electrolyte. As a result, 60% enhancement in the capacitance is witnessed for MnCO3. Further, nanofluid containing electrolyte is found to be stable over a month.
