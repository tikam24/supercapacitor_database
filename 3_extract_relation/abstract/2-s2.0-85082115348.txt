A simplified mathematical model of supercapacitor-battery hybrid energy storage in voltage analysis was established. Make full use of the battery's high energy density, low cost and high power density of the supercapacitor, and the advantages of long cycle time complement the power supply, greatly improving the performance of the system to improve the voltage. A new balanced charging and discharging topology and control strategy are proposed to enhance the performance and extend the service life of the battery pack. On the Matlab platform, the simulation calculations are given for the given examples. The simulation results show that the grid connection of the hybrid energy storage device can effectively improve the voltage stability of the system.
