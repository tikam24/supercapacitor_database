Electrode materials with a three-dimensional network structure and high conductivity are crucial for the development of robust high-performance supercapacitors. We report the development of a facile method for the covalent intercalation of graphene oxide (GO) with bacterial cellulose (BC) fibres via a one-step esterification to construct a three-dimensional cross-linked structural scaffold. The as-prepared composite had a tensile strength of 18.48 MPa and an elongation at breakage of 24%. With an outstanding electrical conductivity of 171 S m-1, the composite electrode demonstrates a good mass-specific capacitance of 160 F g-1 at a current density of 0.4 A g-1. A robust supercapacitor was demonstrated with an outstanding capacitance retention of 90.3% over 2000 recycles. The impressive mechanical and electrochemical properties of this covalently intercalated BC/GO composite may open new avenues in developing cross-linked GO nanocomposites for stretchable electronics.
