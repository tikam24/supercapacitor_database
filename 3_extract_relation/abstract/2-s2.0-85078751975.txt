Energy management plays a significant role in a dual-mode locomotive with multiple power sources. According to the energy cost analysis for different power sources, a cost-oriented control strategy (COCS) is proposed to allocate the power and manage the energy for a dual-mode locomotive with multiple sources, including a DC overhead line, a fuel cell (FC), a battery (BAT), and a supercapacitor (SC). The COCS won the second-place prize in the IEEE Vehicular Technology Society (VTS) Motor Vehicle Challenge 2019 with a total operational cost of 6.06 âe for the scoring cycle. Based on the COCS, an improved strategy COCS+ is developed after the challenge to further decrease the global cost. Simulation results show that the COCS+ performs better than the COCS in reducing the DC line electricity costs and the lifetime costs of the FC, BAT, and SC. The global cost is drastically reduced to -4.69 âe when using the COCS+.
