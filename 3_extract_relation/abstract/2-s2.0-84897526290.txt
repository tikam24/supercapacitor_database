This paper describes an approach for efficiently storing the harvested energy from a thermoelectric module for powering autonomous wireless sensor nodes in aircraft health monitoring applications. Thermoelectric devices are the preferred option due to the widespread availability of significant levels of energy from the temperature gradients or variations at the aircraft, such as the cabin, the engine compartment, the fuel tanks or the inner and outer frame of the fuselage. Batteries and supercapacitors are popular choices of storage device, but neither represents the ideal solution, with, supercapacitors possessing low energy densities while batteries have low power density. When using a battery-only solution for storage, the runtime of a typical sensor node is typically reduced by the battery's relatively high internal impedance and thermal loss. Supercapacitors can overcome some of these problems, but generally do not provide sufficient long-term energy to allow aircraft health monitoring applications to be operated over an extended period. A hybrid energy storage solution can provide both energy and power density to a wireless sensor node simultaneously. Techniques such as acoustic-ultrasonic, acoustic-emission, strain and crack wire sensors require storage approaches that can provide immediate energy on demand, usually in short, high intensity bursts, and that can be sustained over long periods of time, storing up to 40-50 J of energy. This application requirement is considered as a significant constraint when working with battery-only and supercapacitor-only solutions. The hybrid system described here provides an alternate viable solution. Â© 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
