TiO2 nanowire arrays prepared on Ti alloy substrate as electrode materials for supercapacitors have rarely been reported. Here, we prepared TiO2 nanowire arrays on Ti-4Al-0.005B (TA5) alloy substrate by in-situ hydrothermal treatment of TA5 alloy and the subsequent ion-exchange process, as well as the final annealing. The formation process of nanowires on TA5 alloy during hydrothermal process was studied for the first time. The synthesized TiO2 nanowire arrays exhibited an excellent specific capacitance of 60.2 mF cmâˆ’2 and a capacitance retention of 97% after 3000 cycles, making it potentially attractive materials for supercapacitor applications.
