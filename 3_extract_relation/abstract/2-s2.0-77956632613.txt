(Figure Presented) Synergistic graphenes: The chemical and electrical synergies between graphene derivatives enable a simple, cost-effective and environmentally friendly strategy for solution-phase processing of graphene oxide (GO) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The new nanohybrid exhibits high performance when used as electrodes for supercapacitors (see figure; ER=electrochemically reduced, CCG = chemically converted graphene).
