The aim of this paper is to report on the fabrication of a stretchable array of high-performance solid-state micro-supercapacitors (MSCs), which can be charged with integrated, commercial Si-based solar cells (SCs). This would facilitate the powering of an integrated strain sensor. The planar MSCs comprised electrodes of potentiostatically deposited polypyrrole, on spray-coated multi-walled carbon nanotube film, and a gel-type electrolyte of LiCl/polyvinyl alcohol with a redox additive of 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide. The fabricated MSC achieved an areal capacitance of 5.17 mF cmâˆ’2. After 5000 charge/discharge cycles, the MSC retained 80% of their initial capacitance. A strain sensor was fabricated utilizing a composite film of fragmentized graphene foam and polydimethylsiloxane. Such fabricated twelve parallel connected MSCs, a strain sensor, and SCs were integrated on a single deformable polymer substrate with embedded stiff platforms of negative epoxy series resist (SU-8) via long serpentine interconnections of polyimide encapsulated Ti/Pt metal film for mechanical stability under stretching. After 1000 repetitive biaxial stretching/releasing cycles by 30%, no noticeable change was observed in the charge/discharge behavior of the MSC array. Furthermore, both the photo-charge/discharge characteristics and electrochemical performance remained stable. When the whole integrated system was attached to the wrist, the integrated strain sensor could detect both externally applied strain and the arterial pulse using the energy stored in the MSCs from the SCs.
