In this work, three-dimensional Ni3S2/MnS2 composite is prepared by in-situ vulcanization using hydrothermal method and applies to supercapacitor. The as-prepared Ni3S2/MnS2 composite shows good specific capacity (383.4 mAh/g at 1 A/g) and high cycle retention of 90.6% after 10,000 cycles at 5 A/g. The specific energy of assembled hybrid supercapacitor can reach 52.7 Wh/kg at the specific power of 849.3 W/kg. The results indicate that the Ni3S2/MnS2 composite obtained in this work has good application potential in energy storage.
