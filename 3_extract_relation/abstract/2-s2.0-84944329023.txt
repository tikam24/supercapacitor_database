Nickel oxide/Ni foam composite was studied as an electrode for electrochemical capacitors. The material has been processed by a simple, green and cost-effective electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method directly from the post-reaction medium in an one-pot synthesis and its later heat treatment. NiO films were obtained after calcination (325 and 450°C) of ß-Ni(OH)2 deposits. ß-Ni(OH)2 nanoplatelets were produced by chemical precipitation of Ni precursors and the aid of ultrasound, free of modifiers. The stabilization of the hydroxide powder in suspension in different mixtures of Ethanol:Water (4:1, 9:1 and 19:1) and the optimization of the EPD parameters allowed coating the commercial Ni foams via colloidal processing. Electrochemical properties of the electrodes were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) showing significant differences in terms of specific capacitance of 192 and 79 F/g for the electrodes calcined at 325 and 450°C, respectively.
