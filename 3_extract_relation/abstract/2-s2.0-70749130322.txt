Carbon aerogels (CAs) are novel non-crystalline carbon materials with low-density and nano-porous structure that can be controlled and tailored on a nanometer scale. The preparation technology of CAs is introduced briefly, and the research development of CAs as electrode materials used in electrochemical supercapacitor, fuel cell and lithium ion battery is reviewed in detail in this paper.
