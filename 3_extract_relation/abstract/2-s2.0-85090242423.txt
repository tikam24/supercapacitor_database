Herein, we report 3D broccoli-like nanoflowers of SnS on Ni foam (SnS/NF) using an easy chemical method and explore their use as binder free electrode in supercapacitor. As-synthesized electrode material was characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD), Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). As-fabricated SnS/NF electrode exhibited redox behavior with excellent specific capacitance of 1102 F g−1 at a current density of 5 A cm−2 as well as high rate capability of 61.7% up to 30 A cm−2. These findings make SnS/NF a better alternative source for energy storage devices.
