Temperature characteristic is one of the important properties for an electric double layer capacitor (EDLC), and the reversible and irreversible heat are combined with the charging and discharging for an EDLC. In this study, the numerical simulation of heat transfer, conducted with the finite element technology, and temperature measurement inside and outside EDLC were performed during galvanostatic cycling with different current densities. The heat transfer characteristics and temperature distribution were analyzed by the comparison between the simulated and measured temperatures. And then, the variation and the influencing factors of reversible heat and temperature oscillation during galvanostatic cycling were discussed. Meanwhile, the EDLCs need to be cooled during charging and discharging cycles with great current according to the measured results.
