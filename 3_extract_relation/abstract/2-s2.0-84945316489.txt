It is shown that the electric characterisation of supercapacitors cannot simply be performed by standard LCR meters, as these devices do not account for the fractional capacitance behaviour. The accurate modelling of their frequency-dependent impedance requires direct impedance measurement using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. A very simple and cost-effective alternative using a single operational amplifier-based circuit to extract the parameters of a supercapacitor without requiring the use of an expensive electrochemical station or a post-processing data fitting algorithm is presented.
