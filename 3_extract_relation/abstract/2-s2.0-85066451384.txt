The authors have proposed a cell voltage equalizer with an LC series circuit in a previous work. The proposed circuit, however, has the disadvantage that the equalization time tends to be longer than that of other conventional equalizers. Therefore, the authors have studied some control methods to reduce the equalization time. This paper proposes a novel equalization time reduction method using the magnitude relation of each cell voltage estimated from the equalization current for the proposed equalizer. The proposed method can reduce the equalization time without an additional voltage sensor, so the size of the equalizer is not changed and the cost is not higher than an equalizer using the conventional control method. In addition, the characteristics and the effectiveness of the proposed method were verified by the simulations and the experiments. It was confirmed that the proposed method could reduce the equalization time to about 67.7% of that of the conventional control method by the experiments.
