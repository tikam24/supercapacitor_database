The parameters influencing the lyophilicity of activated carbons (AC) of certain grades in nonaqueous electrolyte solutions used in supercapacitors were determined. Specifically, the integral heat of wetting, electrokinetic potential, and content of functional groups on the AC surface were evaluated. A procedure based on comparison of the calculated integral heats of wetting and the composition of oxygen-containing functional groups was suggested for estimating the thermal effect in wetting of carbon materials with specific oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface. Criteria for choosing a supercapacitor electrode material for a specific electrolyte based on the information on lyophilic properties of the material and on the method for activation of its surface were developed. Principles for choosing an electrodeâ€“electrolyte pair for a symmetrical supercapacitor with definite functional properties, maximal capacitance and maximal pulse power, were formulated on the basis of the experimental data obtained.
