Nickel cobalt sulfidenanospheres was synthesized by facile solvothermal synthesis method. The properties of the as-prepared Ni-Co sulfide powders were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge measurement were also employed to test the electrochemical performances of nickel cobalt sulfide as electrode material of supercapacitor. The mass specific capacitance and the area specific capacitance of the electrode prepared under 160â„ƒ was 1 298 F/g and 1.13 F/cm2 respectively at charge and discharge current density of 2 mA/cm2. After a 10 000 cycle test at current density of 10 mA/cm2, the specific capacitance retains 70.8% of its initial capacitance. In addition, the influence of reaction temperature on the performance of the supercapacitor was studied by controlling the reaction temperature. The results show that the reaction temperature have little influence on its morphologies, but a certain impact on electrochemical performance.
