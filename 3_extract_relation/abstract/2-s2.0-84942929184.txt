Graphene-polyaniline-MnO2 (G-P-Mn) hybrids were synthesized via a facile approach that includes the reduction of graphene oxide (GO) to graphene (G) by aniline and then followed by oil-water interfacial polymerization of aniline to polyaniline (PANI) using a binary oxidant of KMnO4 and (NH4)2S2O8. PANI was orderly nanofibered and MnO2-doped due to interfacial polymerization and the use of binary oxidant. The hybrids conclude electrical double layer capacitance of G and pseudo capacitance of PANI and MnO2, showing enhanced specific capacitance of 800.1 F g-1 at 0.4 A g-1 with good cycling stability.
