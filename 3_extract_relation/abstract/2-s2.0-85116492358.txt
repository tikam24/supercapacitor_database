An interfacial polymerization-based green approach was developed for the synthesis of polyaniline-graphene oxide (PANI-GO) nanocomposites. Instead of the commonly used organic solvents such as CHCl3, CCl4, hexane and toluene, vegetable oil was used here as the organic phase. Thus, the prepared nanocomposite was characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), UV-visible spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) techniques. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examinations revealed the formation of a uniform coating of PANI fibers on the surface of GO sheets. The PANI-GO composite showed pseudocapacitive behavior with a high specific capacitance of 510 F g−1at a current density of 1 A g−1. The specific energy and specific power of the PANI-GO electrode material were calculated to be 45.3 W h kg−1and 407.9 W kg−1, respectively, which maintained 92% stability even after completing 1000 cycles at a current density of 30 A g−1. Furthermore, the solid-state symmetric supercapacitor of the PANI-GO nanocomposite yielded an areal capacitance of 143.6 mF cm−2at a current density of 1 mA cm−2. The symmetric supercapacitor maintains 76% of its initial areal capacitance after 4000 cycles. The PANI-GO nanocomposite was also explored for the fabrication of enzymatic glucose sensors. The amperometric response of PANI-GO indicates that the enzyme-loaded electrode material exhibited good catalytic activity towards the oxidation of glucose in the linear range of 20-80 μM. The limit of detection was found to be 12 μM with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 (S/N = 3).
