The assembly of transition metal (TM) complexes/tetranuclear units into arsenotungstate nanostructures generates three polyoxometalate (POM)-based hybrid derivatives, [Co(phen)3]2[AsW12O40]·2H2O (1), (Hbipy)2 [Mn(bipy)3]2[As2W18O62] (2), and (H2bib)5[Co4(H2O)2(AsW9O34)2]·2H2O (3), by a one-step hydrothermal synthesis. Compounds 1-3 are Keggin, Dawson, and a sandwich arsentungstate supramolecular hybrid net with different topology and periodically arranged 1D tunnels, respectively, which exhibit better capacitive performance and electrocatalytic activity due to their structural advantages. In particular, compound 3 shows a higher specific capacitance (Cs), excellent rate capability (Cs of 749.2 F/g at 15 A/g), and capacitance retention rate (95.6% after 5000 cycles), which outdo most pseudocapacitive materials reported so far. In addition, the nickel electrode of 3 has higher catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The overpotential is 78 mV, and the Tafel slope is 79.3 mV dec-1 at the current density of 10 mA cm-2 in alkali solution. The i-t curve test at 170 mV for 24 h did not decrease significantly, revealing its good durability. The excellent capacitive and catalytic behaviors of 3 are ascribed to the insertion of tetranuclear cobalt units, a stable sandwich POM skeleton, and the abundant hydrogen bonding, which provide more redox centers and higher ion/electron transfer efficiency.
