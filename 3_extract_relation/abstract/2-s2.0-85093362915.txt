Biomass-based activated porous carbon (PC) with large porosity and high surface area has been considered as potential electrode material for supercapacitors. The spongy-like porous-activated carbon (SPAC) was prepared from millfeed by one-step carbonization/activation with KOH treatment. It shows three-dimensional (3D) spongy-like structure and high specific surface area (1535m2g-1). The SPAC electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance (237.9Fg-1 at a current density of 0.5Ag-1) and a superior cycle stability (the capacitance retention of 95% after 10000 cycles at 2Ag-1) in 2M KOH electrolyte, while the SPAC reveals a high specific capacitance of 157Fg-1 at 0.5Ag-1, good electrochemical stability with 93% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles in ionic liquids. Furthermore, the specific capacitance of SPAC//SPAC supercapacitor reaches 82.1Fg-1 at a current density of 0.5Ag-1 and achieves a high capacitance retention of 75% when the charging current increases to 10Ag-1 in 2M KOH electrolyte. The SPAC//SPAC supercapacitor possesses a high specific capacitance of 29.6Fg-1 at 0.5Ag-1 and a preeminent energy density of 27.8Whkg-1 (at a power density of 640Wkg-1) in ionic liquids. This paper provides a convenient approach to synthesize low-cost biomass-based carbon material for supercapacitor applications.
