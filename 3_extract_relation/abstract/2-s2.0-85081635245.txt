Poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVdF-HFP) doped with zinc acetate polymer electrolytes have been prepared for electrochemical devices. Electrical conductivity (σ) obtained from impedance analysis shows a maximum (σ = 4.83 × 10–4 S cm−1) for 25 wt% of salt concentration, while Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirms the formation of composite electrolyte and information on the interaction of polymer matrix with the salt. Polarized optical microscopy shows the reduction in the crystallinity of polymer host due to salt doping which is also evidenced in the X-ray diffraction analysis of the samples. A sandwiched structure laboratory-scale supercapacitor has been fabricated using the highest conductivity polymer electrolyte film and activated graphene oxide electrode shows promising results.
