This paper considers a peak current control system for a battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system (HESS) utilized in power supplies of resistance micro-welding equipment. The proposed HESS is designed based on the battery semi-active topology. Auxiliary SEPIC converter is used for power distribution between energy cells. The control-to-output transfer function is derived based on the SEPIC mathematical model which also accounts for components' parasitic parameters. In addition, the system is verified by means simulations using LT spice software. Simulation traces of voltage and current of energy storage cells for three characteristic shapes of abrupt (pulsed) load indicate that the designed peak current control system effectively suppresses the high amplitude load perturbations.
