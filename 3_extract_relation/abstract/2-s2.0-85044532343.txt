Three-dimensional poly(aniline-co-pyrrole)/thermally reduced graphene oxide (PAP/TRGO) composites with different amounts of TRGO have been fabricated via an oxidative polymerization method. The three-dimensional composite containing 20 wt% TRGO exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance as an electrode active material in supercapacitors in terms of its high specific capacitance value (287 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1) and good rate capability (205 F g−1 at 20 A g−1). The assembled symmetric supercapacitor based on the PAP/TRGO20 composite shows excellent cyclic stability with a capacitance retention of 103% after 10,000 charge-discharge cycles. These results represent a significant progress in the design of suitable binder-free electrode materials as electrochemical energy storage devices.
