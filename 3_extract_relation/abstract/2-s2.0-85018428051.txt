One-pot procedure is introduced to prepare effective and highly stable graphene electrode for acidic electrolyte supercapacitors. Calcination of commercial sugar and ammonium acetate solid mixture at 1100 Â°C under argon atmosphere leads to produce few layers graphene sheets. The utilized characterizations conform formation of few layers graphene. The electrochemical measurements indicated that the sugar/ammonium acetate weight ratio should be optimized to get the best results. Typically, the estimated specific capacitances were 371, 111 and 82 F/g for the graphene obtained from ammonium acetate/sugar solid mixtures having weight ratios of 1:1, 1:0.5 and 1:2, respectively. Moreover, determining the specific capacitance from charge/discharge test indicated that the proposed electrode exhibits high specific capacitance of 453.2 F/g at 1 A/g and excellent cycle life. The curves of the galvanostatic charge-discharge were almost triangular shapes, reflecting an excellent charge/discharge capacitive performance.
