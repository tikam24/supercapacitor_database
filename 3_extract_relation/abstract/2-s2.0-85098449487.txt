Abstract: The development of hybrid technologies for traction rolling stock manufactured for mainline, urban, and industrial railroad transport is a trend capable of improving the energy efficiency of transportation much better than any new conventional projects. The integrated and detailed study of the joint operation of main energy sources (catenary system, diesel generator outfits) and onboard energy storage systems as part of a single energy network on advanced-type traction rolling stock is of major importance to the broad and successful adoption of hybrid locomotives with a combined power plant. The highest efficiency in accumulating and utilizing electrical braking energy is attained in energy storage systems based on electrochemical current sources (electric batteries) and high-capacity supercapacitor batteries. This article considers the issue of mathematically modeling these onboard energy storage systems and the features of controlling a hybrid traction electric drive on rolling stock.
