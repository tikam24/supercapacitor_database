Carbon based supercapacitors (CSCs), with high output power and long lifespan, are considered as promising power sources for modern electronic devices. The rush to find new approaches for optimizing their electrochemical behaviors is still vibrant, and particularly, widespread enthusiasm was focused on improving the energy density of CSCs through improving the specific capacitance and expanding the operating voltage. In this regard, this article provides a brief review about recent progress and new understanding about the assembly of CSCs with high energy density. Novel applied strategies were highlighted and discussed from the aspects of electrolyte, electrodes, and device modulation. Dynamic and mechanism factors associated with the energy storage process of CSCs are particularly emphasized. Finally, the opportunities and challenges are elaborated in the hope of guiding the promising direction for the design of high-energy CSCs.
