PVdF-based separators are very promising materials in electrochemical energy storage systems but theysuffer from fairly poor mechanical properties. To overcome this drawback, composite PVdF separatorswere fabricated and characterized in electrolytes of Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors. MacroporousPVdF composite separators were prepared by phase inversion method using PA and PET, and non-woven cellulose as support layers. Ionic conductivity and thermomechanical analyses were performedusing electrolytes of Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors. The composite approach allowed a tremen-dous increase of the mechanical performances of the separator (between 340 and 750 MPa) comparedto the unreinforced PVdF separator (56 MPa), without compromising the ionic conductivities (up to15.6 mS cm-1).
