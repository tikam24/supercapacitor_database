Owing to their favorable chemical stabilities and electronic conductivities, transition metal nitrides (TMNs) have been targeted as the potential electrode materials for the supercapacitors. Herein, 3D CrN@nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheet arrays (NCs) were successfully deposited on carbon paper (CP) by reactive magnetron sputtering method. The CrN@NCs@CP electrode exhibited satisfactory electrochemical properties: initially, the electrode showed a 132.1 mF cm-2 specific capacitance at 1.0 mA cm-2 current density; subsequently, the electrode demonstrated a 95.9% capacitance retention after 20 000 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles at 5.0 mA cm-2 current density. The specific capacitance of the CrN@NCs@CP electrode was significantly higher than that of the CrN@CP electrode (4.1 mF cm-2 at 1.0 mA cm-2). Furthermore, the symmetric supercapacitor that incorporated two CrN@NCs@CP electrodes demonstrated 5.28 Î¼Wh cm-2 (2.7 Wh kg-1) energy density at 0.41 mW cm-2 power density. These findings exemplify the suitability of the 3D composite electrodes of TMNs for energy storage application.
