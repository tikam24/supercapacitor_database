A hierarchical MoO2/Au/MnO2 heterostructure was prepared by a two-step electrodeposition method. The ion-diffusion and charge-collection capacity improved after spraying a Au layer. Electrochemical tests show that the areal specific capacitance for MoO2/Au/MnO2 is up to 112 mFcm-2 at a scan rate of 5 mVs-1. Furthermore, the obtained MoO2/Au/MnO2 heterostructure also displays an excellent rate capability and remarkable cycling stability. A hierarchical MoO2/Au/MnO2 heterostructure was fabricated by a two-step electrodeposition method. It displayed excellent long-term cycling stability and high rate capability for application as supercapacitor.
