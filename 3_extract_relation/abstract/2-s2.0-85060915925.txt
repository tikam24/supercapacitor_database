Carbon nanomaterials have received much attention due to their good electrochemical performance as electrode materials and as substrates for pseudocapacitive materials. Herein, the graphene-carbon nanotube aerogel (GCA) has been constructed by direct cryodesiccation from the aqueous dispersion of a graphene oxide-carbon nanotube hybrid, the so-called "sol-cryo" method, followed by high-temperature carbonization. The as-obtained GCA with a unique sheet-scroll conjoined architecture not only displays an excellent electrical double-layer capacitive performance but also performs as an ideal three-dimensional template for the perpendicular immobilization of Ni(OH)2 nanosheets. The capacitance of Ni(OH)2@GCA is 1208 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 with 88% retention after 2000 cycles. The Ni(OH)2@GCA//GCA asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits a high energy density of 30 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 820 W kg-1. In addition, this template-free sol-cryo method possesses simplicity and large-scale availability, which provides a novel approach for fabricating macroscopic electrode materials for supercapacitors.
