Self-grown nickel-chalcogenides viz., sulphide (NiS), selenide (NiSe), and sulfoselenide (NiSSe) nanostructures of aligned nanorod, nanosheet, and nanobud-type morphologies have successfully been synthesized through one-pot hydrothermal synthesis chemical method on 3-D nickel-foam (NiF). The precursors of sulfur and selenium break down into S2− and Se2− ions, which on reacting with oxidized Ni2+ ions on the surface of phase-pure NiF produce NiS, NiSe, and NiSSe superstructures. The structural, morphological, and chemical states of the as-grown Ni-based electrodes are monitored through various measurement tools. The as-obtained Ni-based NiS, NiSe and NiSSe electrode materials of various morphologies endow specific capacitances and specific capacities, at 3 A g−1 current density, of 1683.5 F g−1, 1563.6 F g−1, and 3314.9 Fg−1 and 187.05, 173.86, and 368.32 mAh g−1, respectively in a three-electrode system containing 1.0 M KOH electrolyte solution. The NiSSe electrode demonstrates the highest specific capacitance and outstanding chemical stability compared to other electrode materials which is attributed to the synergistic effect of two separate metal chalcogenides. In addition, the NiSSe electrode is chemically stable and mechanically robust as it doesn't detach from the conductive NiF substrate even at a high current density. Consequently, the as-designed NiSSe//NiSSe symmetric supercapacitor assembly divulges 1658.6 Wkg−1 power density and 19.21 Whkg−1energy density with the cycling stability of 93.48%. Connecting two cells in a series, a panel “CNED” composed of nearly forty-two LEDs has been ignited with high light intensity, adducing the practical importance of mixed metal chalcogenide electrode material in the energy storage sector.
