N-doped mesoporous carbon tubes have been widely used in application of supercapacitor, catalysis and absorption and energy storage/conversion due to their hollow structure, large aspect ratio, rich porous structure and excellent conductivity. Herein, a method of exhaust directional deposition was employed to prepare N-doped mesoporous thin carbon tube (N-MCT). The exhaust gases derived from pyrolysis of metal organic framework can be directional deposited on the natural tubular halloysite due to its porosity and surface activity. Consequently, the prepared N-MCT with thin shell and partial graphitization completely replicate the morphology of halloysite. The mesopores may be caused by the non-uniform deposition of exhaust gases. The N-containing precursor in the exhaust gas also causes doping of nitrogen on the carbon framework. As electrode material for supercapacitors, N-MCT exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with high capacitance 349F g−1 at current density of 0.5 A g−1, demonstrating its potential for application in supercapacitors.
