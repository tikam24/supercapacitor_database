Hollow NiO nanostructures were fabricated by calcining Ni(OH) 2 precursors built on the basis of Cu 2 O templates. The structures and morphology of the products were characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. As the temperature rose from 250 to 550 °C, the products showed stable cubic structures with the lengths about 600 nm of a side at first, then some products deformed into cylinders and debris is generated, and the NiO nanostructures collapsed at 550 °C. Electrochemical test results from cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and galvanostatic charging–discharging demonstrated that the sample synthesized at 450 °C showed better electrochemical properties. The hollow NiO nanostructures obtained at 450 °C delivered a capacitance of 1200 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 and displayed good rate capability with a large capacitance of 1010 F g −1 at 5 A g −1 . After improving the cycle stability, it will exhibit a more admirable prospect of application.
