MXenes, such as Ti3 C2 Tx, are promising materials for electrodes of supercapacitors (SCs). Colloidal techniques have potential for the fabrication of advanced Ti3 C2 Tx composites with high areal capacitance (CS ). This paper reports the fabrication of Ti3 C2 TX-Fe3 O4-multiwalled carbon nanotube (CNT) electrodes, which show CS of 5.52 F cm−2 in the negative potential range in 0.5 M Na2 SO4 electrolyte. Good capacitive performance is achieved at a mass loading of 35 mg cm−2 due to the use of Celestine blue (CB) as a co-dispersant for individual materials. The mechanisms of CB adsorption on Ti3 C2 TX, Fe3 O4, and CNTs and their electrostatic co-dispersion are discussed. The comparison of the capacitive behavior of Ti3 C2 TX-Fe3 O4-CNT electrodes with Ti3 C2 TX-CNT and Fe3 O4-CNT electrodes for the same active mass, electrode thickness and CNT content reveals a synergistic effect of the individual capacitive materials, which is observed due to the use of CB. The high CS of Ti3 C2 TX-Fe3 O4-CNT composites makes them promising materials for application in negative electrodes of asymmetric SC devices.
