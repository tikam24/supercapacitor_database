Novel fiber capacitor electrodes presented in this work are produced via a wet spinning technique. The new fiber electrodes consist of polyaniline (PAni)-metal oxide nanocomposite and multi-wall carbon nanotube. Metal oxide nanoparticles such as SnO 2, Fe 3O 4 and TiO 2 are incorporated into PAni matrix during in situ chemical oxidative polymerization for improving the capacitance performance of polyaniline. The polyaniline-metal oxide nanocomposites are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical properties of fibers are investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge techniques in various acidic media. The results of EIS clearly reveal the effects of size and charge of anions on the capacitive response of the fibers. A specific capacitance of 29.7 F cm -2 based on PAni-SnO 2-MWCNT is obtained in 1 M HCl solution compared to 24.1 F cm -2 for PAni-Fe 3O 4-MWCNT, 14.2 F cm -2 for PAni-TiO 2-MWCNT, 12.1 F cm -2 for PAni-MWCNT and 9.8 F cm -2 for pure PAni fibers. These results make the polyaniline nanocomposite fibers as promising electrode candidates for the supercapacitor applications. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
