Composites of micro- and mesoporous SiC flakes (SiCF) and ferroferric oxide (Fe3O4), SiCF/Fe3O4, were prepared via the chemical deposition of Fe3O4 on SiCF by the chemical reduction of an Fe precursor. The SiCF/Fe3O4 electrodes were fabricated at different Fe3O4 feeding ratios to determine the optimal Fe3O4 content that can maintain a high total surface area of SiCF/Fe3O4 composites as well as cause a vigorous redox reaction, thereby maximizing the synergistic effect between the electric double-layer capacitive effects of SiCF and the pseudo-capacitive effects of Fe3O4. The SiCF/Fe3O4 electrode fabricated with a Fe3O4/SiCF feeding ratio of 1.5:1 (SiCF/Fe3O4(1.5)) exhibited the highest charge storage capacity, showing a specific capacitance of 423.2 F g-1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1 with a rate performance of 81.8% from 5 to 500 mV s-1 in an aqueous 1 M KOH electrolyte. The outstanding capacitive performance of the SiCF/Fe3O4(1.5) electrode could be attributed to the harmonious synergistic effect between the electric double-layer capacitive contribution of the SiCF and the pseudocapacitive contribution of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles introduced on the SiCF surface. These encouraging results demonstrate that the SiCF/Fe3O4(1.5) electrode is a promising high-performance electrode material for use in supercapacitors.
