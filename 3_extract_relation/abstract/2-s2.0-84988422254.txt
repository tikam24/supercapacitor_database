In this work, a simple, cost-effective, binder-free, and wet chemical successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method is developed for the growth of ZnFe2O4 thin films on stainless steel substrate. The thin films were characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, BET surface area analyzer, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electrochemical analyzer. The synthesized ZnFe2O4 thin films show excellent electrochemical properties by delivering maximum specific capacitance of 615 F g−1 at 3 mA cm−2 current density. The porous ZnFe2O4 thin film (SS/ZnFe2O4) is used as a negative electrode in combination with Mn3O4 (Mn3O4/SS, SILAR, positive electrode) for the fabrication of asymmetric supercapacitor device (SS/ZnFe2O4//Mn3O4/SS). The device shows maximum specific capacitance of 81 F g−1 and delivers a maximum energy density of 28 Wh kg−1 at 7.97 kW kg−1 power density with comparable cycle stability showing 74 % capacitance retention over 3000 cycles.
