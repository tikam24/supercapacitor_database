Supercapacitors (SCs) emerge as effective energy storage technologies with a short charge / discharge time, long life cycle, and good temperature behavior, yet still have a low energy density compared to batteries. In electrochemical supercapacitors (ESCs), due to its physical and chemical properties, the electrolyte is the influencing element that determines the performance of the devices in terms of capacity, power density, energy density, speed performance, stability and safety. The current state of understanding of the electrode-electrolyte interaction in ESCs is at the core of this topic. There are numerous types of electrolytes, including aqueous, organic, ionic liquids, solid or quasi-solid electrolytes, and redox active electrolytes. The latest types of electrolytes for SCs are discussed here. This study also suggests a greater understanding of the unborn evolution of this field.
