A metal-organic framework (MOF), namely SCNU-Z3, based on an imidazole-tetrazole tripodal ligand and Mn(ii), has been constructed. It exhibits a porous 3D framework composed of truncated octahedron cage subunits. Unexpected ligand-induced missing metal-ion defects were observed in the framework. In addition, the application of SCNU-Z3 in a supercapacitor was performed.
