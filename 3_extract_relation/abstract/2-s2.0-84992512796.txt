This paper presents an optimization problem for sizing and energy management of a hybrid electric vehicle including a fuel cell system and supercapacitors pack. From a predefined cycle and including ageing and thermal models of supercapacitors, the objective is to minimize the total cost of ownership of the hybrid power supply system. The ageing model is based on Eyring law and a thermal model of supercapacitor pack. This problem is solved using a Branch and Cut algorithm with an iterative strategy. Some results are presented and the impact of ageing model is discussed.
