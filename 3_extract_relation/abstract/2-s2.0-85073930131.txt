The rapid development in wearable electronics has spurred a great deal of interest in flexible energy storage devices, particularly fiber-shaped energy storage devices (FSESDs), such as fiber-shaped supercapacitors (FSSCs) and fiber-shaped batteries (FSBs). Depending on their electrode configurations, FSESDs can contain five differently structured electrodes, including parallel fiber electrodes (PFEs), twisted fiber electrodes (TFDs), wrapped fiber electrodes (WFEs), coaxial fiber devices (CFEs), and rolled electrodes (REs). Various rational methods have been devised to incorporate these fiber-shaped electrodes into multifunctional FSESDs, including fiber-shaped supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries, lithium–sulfur batteries, lithium–air batteries, zinc–air batteries, and aluminum–air batteries. Although significant progress has been made in FSESDs, it remains a major challenge to make high-performance fiber-shaped devices at low cost. A focused and critical review of the recent advancements in fiber-shaped supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries is provided here. The pros and cons for each of the aforementioned electrode configurations and FSESDs are discussed, along with current challenges and future opportunities for FSESDs.
