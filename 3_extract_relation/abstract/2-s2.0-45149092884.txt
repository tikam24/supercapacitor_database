This paper presents the supercapacitor characterization for hybrid vehicle applications. This characterization takes into account frequency, voltage and temperature variations. The frequencies dependence is mainly caused by the dynamics of the ions in the electrolyte. With high frequencies, the ions do not have time to reach the surfaces not easily accessible, located deeply in the pores which causes a reduction of the capacitance and equivalent series resistance with the frequency. To take in to account these effects in supercapacitor modeling, it is necessary to characterize them in experiments according to the electric, thermal and frequency constraints. Â© 2006 IEEE.
