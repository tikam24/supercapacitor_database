In an electric vehicle (EV), using more than one energy source often provides a safe ride without concerns about range. EVs are powered by photovoltaic (PV), battery, and ultracapacitor (UC) systems. The overall results of this arrangement are an increase in travel distance; a reduction in battery size; improved reaction, especially under overload; and an extension of battery life. Improved results allow the energy to be used efficiently, provide a comfortable ride, and require fewer energy sources. In this research, energy management between the PV system and the hybrid energy storage system (HESS), including the battery, and UC are discussed. The energy management control algorithms called Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Aquila Optimizer Algorithm (AOA) are proposed. The proposed combined ANN–AOA approach takes full advantage of UC while limiting the battery discharge current, since it also mitigates high-speed dynamic battery charging and discharging currents. The responses’ behaviors are depicted and viewed in the MATLAB simulation environment to represent load variations and various road conditions. We also discuss the management among the PV system, battery, and UC to achieve the higher speed of 91 km/h when compared with existing Modified Harmony Search (MHS) and Genetic Algorithm-based Proportional Integral Derivative (GA-PID). The outcomes of this study could aid researchers and professionals from the automotive industry as well as various third parties involved in designing, maintaining, and evaluating a variety of energy sources and storage systems, especially renewable ones.
