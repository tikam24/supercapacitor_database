Two-dimensional Ti3C2Tx decorated with Ag nanoparticles (NPs) has been rationally designed and successfully fabricated by filtering the mixture of Ti3C2Tx nanosheet and Ag NP aqueous dispersion solution. The Ti3C2Tx/Ag NP hybrid film electrode exhibits a high specific surface area (107 m2 g-1), high areal capacitance (332.2 mF cm-2 at 2 mV s-1), good rate performance (63.2% of its initial value at 2 mV s-1 as the scan rate increases to 100 mV s-1), and long-term cycling stability (87% capacitance retention over 10.000 cycles). Furthermore, even when the mass loading is as high as 15.0 mg cm-2, a high areal capacitance of 1173 mF cm-2 can be obtained. In addition, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) has been assembled on the basis of a Ti3C2Tx/Ag NP negative electrode and MnO2/ESCNF positive electrode using 1 M Na2SO4 as electrolyte. The integrated device not only delivers excellent capacitive performance (246.2 mF cm-2 at 2 mA cm-2, 69.4% capacitance retention at 20 mA cm-2, and 82% capacitance retention over 10.000 cycles), but also exhibits the maximum energy density of 121.4 μW h cm-2 and maximum power density of 17.395 μW cm-2. A red light-emitting diode is lighted by the ASC, suggesting the ability of its practical application.
