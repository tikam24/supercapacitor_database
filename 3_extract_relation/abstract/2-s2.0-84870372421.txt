This study was interested in a renewable distributed generator (RDG) made up of a wind turbine used as a principal source and a supercapacitor (SC) considered as a storage system. The studied RDG is associated with loads to constitute a micro-grid (MG) which can operate in grid connected mode, stand alone mode or synchronization mode. The objective of this work is to investigate a novel control scheme for MG integrated into power electrical system in order to maintain the voltage and the frequency of the grid in an allowable range and to ensure the continuity of power supply in case of grid failure. This control strategy made up of two parts: the first one is the power management algorithm used to detect islanding in case of defect and to monitor the RDG into seven operating modes. The second one is the droop control used to control the exported or imported active and reactive powers transferred with the grid ensuring its stability by adjusting the frequency and amplitude of its output voltage. The system is simulated using MATLAB software and results are provided in order to show the feasibility of this control strategy. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
