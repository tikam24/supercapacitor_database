In this study, we explored the facile and quick dry transfer method to fabricate a paper-based electrode for flexible printed energy storage system. The conventional Ag nanoparticle suspension with high solid contents above ~50 wt% was confirmed to be deposited on a super hydrophobic polyethylene terephthalate (SHP-PET) substrate without a special ink formulation or surface treatment of substrate. The silver nanoparticle (AgNP) layer on the SHP-PET was able to be transferred only onto the toner-printed region of the paper substrate during a simple lamination process, thereby realizing the patterned AgNP conductive lines on the paper substrates. The AgNP/toner/paper electrodes were highly robust, showing no deterioration in conductivity after taping for 100 times. Moreover, the AgNP/toner/paper electrodes successfully functioned as flexible electrodes; thus, light emitting diodes connected to the AgNP/paper electrodes could be operated under folding deformation without significant loss of brightness. As a potential application in flexible energy storage systems, a flexible supercapacitor based on the AgNP/toner/paper electrodes as the current collector was also demonstrated; it showed an excellent power density of 10.79–16.64 kW/kg and energy density of 1.85–4.65 Wh/kg.
