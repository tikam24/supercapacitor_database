A 3D CNT/few layered graphene construct (CNT−FLG) with mesopore structure was fabricated and applied in supercapacitors. The structure was acquired through a two-step method. Firstly, commercial multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MCNTs) were oxidized in a mixed solution of concentrated acid and modified with a couple of long-chain organic ions. Second, the above resultant product was carbonized at a high temperature. The achieved structure offers a 3D interconnected electrically conductive network as well as mesopore structure. It also significantly improves the specific surface area of MCNTs. Result of BET tests showed that the specific surface area of CNT−FLG reached to 2235 m2/g. When acted as electrode materials in a supercapacitor structure, specific capacitance was approximately 531.2 F/g at a current density of 0.8 A/g. At current density of 50 A/g, specific capacitance remained 204.4 F/g. Besides, the capacitance retention was as high as 96.18 % after 10000 cycles at the current density of 5 A/g.
