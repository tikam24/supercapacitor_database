Low plasma treatment has been demonstrated to be an efficient approach to introduce defects and to dope graphene. In this study, nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide with a high pyrrolic nitrogen ratio (92.75%) was simply prepared by employing a radio frequency inductively coupled plasma with urea as nitrogen sources (UR-NG). The obtained UR-NG exhibited high specific capacitance, excellent rate performance, and long cycle stability both in the KOH solution and EMIMBF4 ionic liquid due to its high pyrrolic N ratio and large specific surface area. The study results demonstrate that radio frequency inductively coupled plasma can efficiently regulate the doping configuration of nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide.
