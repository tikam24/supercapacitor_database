The risk of environmental pollution is a consequence of every kind of energy, including fossil fuels, nuclear power plants, and thermoelectric power plants. For the purpose of reducing the use ratio of such energy, research on eco-friendly energy is being actively carried out, and has shown that among all kinds of energy, solar energy has an advantage: it can supply us with inexhaustible clean energy. However, since solar energy depends on sunlight, the output may be unstable as it is influenced by weather or surrounding structures. In this paper, there is presented a control system which transmits power to a storage device, in a specific state, after the energy of the low-illumination section is charged in a supercapacitor using the accumulation-type controller by use of a supercapacitor. Feedback from the power output of photovoltaic panels (PVs) demonstrates that the power of the low-illumination section can be charged without being discarded. The charging rate was compared with other solar controllers being sold on the market, and the comparison was made through state of charge (SOC) measurements after the battery had been charged by photovoltaic panels for a whole day. It was confirmed that the solar controller, by use of supercapacitor integrator proposed in this paper, stored higher levels of energy than the existing solar controllers over the same hours and under the same conditions.
