Ti3C2Tx is promising negative electrode materials for asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC). The Ti3C2Tx sheets are obtained by etching Ti3AlC2 powders in the mixture solution of HCl and LiF, then vacuum filtrated to achieve a free-standing Ti3C2Tx-paper. The electrochemical performance of Ti3C2Tx-paper was measured and a high volumetric capacitance of 295.4 F cm−3 was achieved. Meanwhile, it exhibited a high capability rate of 79.7% from 2 mV s−1 to 100 mV s−1 and long cycle life with 94.4% retention of its initial after charged and discharged for 15000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g−1. ASC devices were fabricated using Ti3C2Tx-paper as negative electrode and carbonized filter paper as positive electrode. The energy density and power density of ASC device are 4.5 Wh kg−1 and 1.3 kW kg−1, respectively. The application of the device has been demonstrated by lighting red light emitting diode, endowing prospect of the Ti3C2Tx-paper as negative electrode for supercapacitors.
