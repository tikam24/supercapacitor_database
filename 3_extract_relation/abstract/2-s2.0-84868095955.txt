Water-soluble poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) modified graphene (PSSS-GR) was successfully synthesized via covalently grafting poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSSS) on the surfaces of graphene (GR) nanosheets. The structure of PSSS-GR was investigated with Fourier transform infrared, x-ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, transmission and scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The PSSS chains made the GR nanosheets fully exfoliate into a single-layer structure, and the PSSS layer on GR reached 90wt%. PSSS chains displayed mutually repulsive effects on promoting GR sheets that were more stable in water. The performances of supercapacitors made of PSSS-GR and unmodified GR electrodes were compared using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge techniques. The results showed that PSSS is an effective binder for graphene sheets and can increase the specific capacitance of PSSS-GR based supercapacitors and improve their rate capability. The maximum specific capacitance of the PSSS-GR based supercapacitor was 210Fg 1 at 5Ag 1, which was 166% higher than for one made of unmodified graphene electrodes. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrated fast ion diffusion in the PSSS-GR electrode structure. PSSS-GR based supercapacitors can fulfil one of the essential requirements for potential electric energy storage applications. Â© 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.
