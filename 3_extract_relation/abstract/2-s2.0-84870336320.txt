[Co(bdc)(DMF)] (Co-MOF-71 bdc = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate DMF = N,N-dimethylformamide) has been previously reported to be a suitable supercapacitor material in spite of being electrically insulating and redox silent. The phenomenon can be explained due to a facile surface hydrolysis of Co-MOF-71 microcrystals in alkaline aqueous media via "conformal" transformation into a porous cobalt hydroxide. The resulting volume decrease during transformation of the MOF precursor (without a significant change in shape) is beneficial and ensures formation of a more active porous cobalt hydroxide product with high pseudo capacitance and electrocatalytic activity. The high "molecular scale porosity" of the MOF precursor offers benefits due to conformal transformation into products with high "nano-scale porosity". Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
