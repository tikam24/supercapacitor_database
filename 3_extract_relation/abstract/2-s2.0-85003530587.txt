The development of low cost supercapacitor cells with unique capacitive properties is essential for many domestic and industrial purposes. Here we report the first ever application of SnS2-reduced graphene oxide (SnS2/RGO) layered nanocomposite as a superior electrode material for symmetric aqueous hybrid supercapacitors. We synthesized SnS2/RGO nanocomposite comprised of nanosheets of SnS2 and graphene oxide via a one-pot hydrothermal approach. in situ as-synthesized SnS2/RGO is devised for the first time to give high specific capacitance 500 Fg-1, energy density 16.67 Wh kg-1 and power density 488 W kg-1. The cell retains 95% charge/discharge cycle stability up to 1000 cycles. In-short, the SnS2/RGO nanosheet composite presented is a novel and advanced material for application in high stability moderate value hybrid supercapacitors. All the currently available surveys in literature state the potential applicability of SnS2 as the anode material for reversible lithium/sodium ion batteries (LIBs/NIBs) but there is a lack of equivalent studies on electrochemical capacitors. We filled up this knowledge gap by the use of the same material in a cost-effective, highly active hybrid supercapacitor application by utilizing its pseudocapacitance property combined with the layered capacitance property of graphene sheets.
