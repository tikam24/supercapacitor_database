In this reported work, polypyrrole (PPy)@cobalt phosphide (CoP) core–shell heterogeneous nanostructures (CSHNs) are grown directly on the Ni foam using a two-step electrochemical synthesis method. The morphology and microstructure analysis reveal that PPy nanowires are uniformly wrapped by intercrossing CoP nanoflakes, which endows the CSHNs with abundant electroactive sites, high electrical conductivity, and good structural stability. Electrochemical studies show that the PPy@CoP CSHNs as supercapacitor (SC) electrodes demonstrate a higher specific capacity (443C g−1 at 1 A g−1) and better cycling performance (93% initial capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1) than the pure PPy and CoP electrodes. Besides, a hybrid supercapcitor (HSC) device with the PPy@CoP positive electrode yields a high energy density of 38.1 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 750 W kg−1. This work offer a new insight into the rational design of the heterostructures based on PPy and metal phosphides for application in high-performance SCs.
