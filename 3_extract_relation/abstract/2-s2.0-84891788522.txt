Sn-doped Mn3O4/C nanocomposite was synthesized using Pluronics P123 (EO20PO70EO20) as both structure-directing agent and carbon source. The phase and morphology was characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The electrochemical performance of the sample was tested in 6 M KOH A high specific capacitance of 216 F g-1 was achieved at current density of 5 A g-1, and 93% capacitance retention remained after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles.
