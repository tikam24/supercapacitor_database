The N-doped porous carbon (HPNCs) are prepared via facile carbonization of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-8) by controllable synthesis and appropriate temperature. In this work, we have discussed different preparation methods and conditions about HPNCs. The material which is carbonated at 800 °C and used zinc acetate during preparation process exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance of 245 F g− 1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte at a current density of 1 A g− 1 and low resistance. Moreover, the symmetric supercapacitor of HPNCs-C8//HPNCs-C8 exhibits a special energy density about 24.8 Wh kg1 at the power density of 0.79 kW kg− 1 in the wide voltage region of 0–1.8 V. Such outstanding electrochemical behavior shows that the HPNCs-C8//HPNCs-C8 symmetric supercapacitor is a promising practical energy-storage facility.
