Pyrolyzing carbon precursors will also lead to a large amount of exhaust gas, which is a waste of resources and a huge pollution. Therefore, realizing the full utilization of exhaust gas from carbon precursors is significant. Herein, cobalt (Co) modified hard templates with micropores or mesopores is used to prepare porous carbon for supercapacitors, in which Co species provide the active sites for the capture and deposition of exhaust gas derived from zeoliticimidazolate framework. Using N2 as protective and carrier gas, the whole process can be realized in a simple tubular furnace. The obtained PC can replicate the morphology and pore structure of the hard template with the characteristics of micropores or mesopores respectively. The microporous structure of PC gives it higher surface area and pore volume than PC with mesopores, which makes it have high capacitance of 445.7 F gâˆ’1 in supercapacitor.
