One of the major challenges of potassium-ion hybrid capacitors (PIHCs) is to explore favorable anode materials with fast reaction kinetics to match the cathodes. Here, an “inner-surface” controlled electrochemistry mechanism based on bismuth electrode is proposed and in-depth studied, which is different from the capacitive or diffusion controlled electrode. Such inner-surface controlled electrochemistry performance gives a high K ion diffusion ability under not only room temperature (RT) but also low temperature (LT). In this study, a kind of conjunct-like bismuth nanoparticle (CBN) is fabricated to model such an advantage. The CBN anode for PIBs displays ultra-long cycling stability and excellent rate capability, especially with a reversible capacity of 212.9 mAh g−1 at 30 A g−1 after 5000 cycles under RT. At −20 °C, the CBN anode achieves a capacity of 191.9 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1 after 10 000 cycles. Coupling with activate carbon cathode, the as-assembled PIHCs deliver high energy/power densities (111.8 Wh kg−1/412.8 W kg−1 and 29 Wh kg−1/14 312.6 W kg−1), which outperforms those of previously reported PIHCs and other hybrid capacitors. The study provides a new understanding of the energy storage mechanism for bismuth-based electrodes and accelerates the development of advancing potassium ion storage devices, especially at LT.
