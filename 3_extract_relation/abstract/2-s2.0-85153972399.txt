The key preponderance of supramolecular self-assembly strategy is its ability to precisely assemble various functional units at the molecular level through non-covalent bonds to form multifunctional materials. Supramolecular materials have the merits of diverse functional groups, flexible structure, and unique self-healing properties, which make them of great value in the field of energy storage. This paper reviews the latest research progress of the supramolecular self-assembly strategy for the advanced electrode materials and electrolytes for supercapacitors, including supramolecular self-assembly for the preparation of high-performance carbon materials, metal-based materials and conductive polymer materials, and its beneficial effects on the performance of supercapacitors. The preparation of high performance supramolecular polymer electrolytes and their application in flexible wearable devices and high energy density supercapacitors are also discussed in detail. In addition, at the end of this paper, the challenges of the supramolecular self-assembly strategy are summarized and the development of supramolecular-derived materials for supercapacitors is prospected.
