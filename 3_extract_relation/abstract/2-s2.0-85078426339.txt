In this paper, the different types and number of functional groups in porous carbon–carbon pore channels are discussed in the thinning mechanism of ionic solvent thin films, which has a significant impact on the absorption of H2SO4 electrolyte based Electric Double Layer Capacitors (EDLC). By exploring the binding energy of –OH, –COOH, –SO3H, –NO2 and other four functional groups with sulfuric acid and hexahydrate sulfuric acid of porous carbon channel and hexahydrate sulfuric acid, it was found that –OH had no repulsive effect on the cathode of the battery, and –COOH, –SO3H, –NO2 and other functional groups had obvious repulsive effect on the cathode of EDLC with the increase of the functional groups number, that is, there was an effect of increasing the capacitance of EDLC by increasing the number of sulfide molecular. This will excavate the potential electrode material in the practical application.
