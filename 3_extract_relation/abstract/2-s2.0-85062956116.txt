Vanadium oxides are anticipated as a high-performance energy storage electrode due to their coupled double layer and pseudo-capacitative charge storage mechanism. In the present work, we investigated the influence of different structural phases of as-grown VO 2 nanoporous structure and corresponding oxidation states on the supercapacitor performance. This nanoporous structure facilitates fast ion diffusion and transport. It is shown that stoichiometric monoclinic VO 2 , with V oxidation state of +4, provides superior charge storage capacity with a capacitance value of 33 mF/cm 2 , capacitance retention of 93.7% and Coulombic efficiency of 98.2%, to those for VO 2 structures with mixed oxidation states of V 5+ and V 4+ . A comparable high energy density is also recorded for the sample with all V 4+ . Scanning Kelvin probe microscopy results clarify further the formation of space charge region between VO 2 and carbon paper. These key findings indicate the potentiality of binder-free single phase monoclinic VO 2 porous structure towards the next-generation micro-supercapacitor application.
