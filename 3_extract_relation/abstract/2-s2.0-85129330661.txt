The flexible and multi-functional strain sensors have attracted extensive research attention due to their promising applications in various wearable electronics. However, it remains a huge challenge to design and fabricate the self-powered flexible sensing micro-system based on a single multifunctional material to relieve the dependence on external rigid and heavy battery. Herein, a self-powered and multi-mode flexible sensing system integrated with triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), flexible solid-state supercapacitors (FSSC) and strain sensor is developed based on thermoplastic polyurethane film with asymmetric and cross conductive networks through a facile screen printing process. The unique conductive network endows the prepared strain sensor with an independent anisotropic response to the strain applied in different directions. The TENG in single-electrode mode is presented to generate electricity from ubiquitously bio-mechanical energy and stored it in the FSSC immediately, realizing continuous green power supply for the sensor. As proof-of-concept, an all-in-one smart device consisting of energy supply and sensing module is constructed, demonstrating the great convenience and feasibility for practical application in sustainable wearable electronics. Benefiting from the excellent comprehensive sensing performance, the wireless wearable device assembled by the prepared sensor exhibits excellent detection and recognition for various human motion, expressions, phonation, and physiological signal, revealing the broad potential applications in rehabilitation training, human-machine interaction and medical diagnosis. This work proposes an innovative and scalable approach to manufacture multifunctional micro-systems, which will bring new vitality and more possibilities to a new generation of wearable electronics.
