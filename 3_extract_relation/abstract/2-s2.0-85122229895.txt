Heteroatom-doped activated carbons are ideal materials for energy storage devices. In this work, a series of nitrogen/oxygen codoped activated carbons with an inverse opal-like structure derived from cellulose diacetate are successfully synthesized through hydrothermal reaction and subsequent chemical activation during which the fluxing effect of KOH is discovered for the first time. The introduction of nitrogen and intrinsic oxygen (especially carbonyl and quinone groups) contributes to additional pseudocapacitance. The experimental results show that the obtained product delivers 400.3 F·g−1 at a current density of 1 A·g−1 in a three-electrode system and achieves extraordinary capacity retention of 90% after 10,000 charge-discharge cycles at 5 A·g−1. The energy density reaches as high as 8.8 Wh·kg−1 at a power density of 0.25 kW·kg−1 as symmetric supercapacitors, indicating a promising electrode material for high performance supercapacitors. The simple and cost-effective method requires no extra oxidation and excessive urea and thus provides new approaches for the future design of electrode materials.
