Ultra-short laser pulses possess many advantages for materials processing. Ultrafast laser has a significantly low thermal effect on the areas surrounding the focal point; therefore, it is a promising tool for micro- and submicro-sized precision processing. In addition, the nonlinear multiphoton absorption phenomenon of focused ultra-short pulses provides a promising method for the fabrication of various structures on transparent material, such as glass and transparent polymers. A laser direct writing process was applied in the fabrication of high-performance three-dimensional (3D) structured multilayer micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) on polymer substrates exhibiting a peak specific capacitance of 42.6 mF·cm−2 at a current density of 0.1 mA·cm−2. Furthermore, a flexible smart sensor array on a polymer substrate was fabricated for multi-flavor detection. Different surface treatments such as gold plating, reduced-graphene oxide (rGO) coating, and polyaniline (PANI) coating were accomplished for different measurement units. By applying principal component analysis (PCA), this sensing system showed a promising result for flavor detection. In addition, two-dimensional (2D) periodic metal nanostructures inside 3D glass microfluidic channels were developed by all-femtosecond-laser processing for real-time surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The processing mechanisms included laser ablation, laser reduction, and laser-induced surface nano-engineering. These works demonstrate the attractive potential of ultra-short pulsed laser for surface precision manufacturing.
