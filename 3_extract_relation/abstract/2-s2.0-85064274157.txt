As energy storage devices, lithium-ion hybrid capacitors (LIHCs) are currently favored by researchers, because they combine the high energy density of lithium-ion batteries and the high power density as well as the long cycle life of electric double-layer capacitors. However, the reason that LIHCs are problematic for researchers and cannot be applied practically is the slow dynamic behavior of the battery type anode that leads to low magnification and cycle performance of the anode, furthermore, causing a dynamic imbalance between the Faraday embedded electrode and the capacitive electrode. Hence, it is imperative to find an anode material that can quickly intercalate/de-intercalate lithium. In this study, a novel anode material, MoSe 2 nanoflowers, for LIHCs was incorporated through a facile solvothermal technique. The MoSe 2 nanoflowers with a small volume change after Li + insertion, conducive to a rapid kinetic layered heterostructure, result in extraordinary electrochemical performance. The prepared MoSe 2 nanoflowers exhibit very good invertible capacity (641.4 mA h g -1 at 0.1 A g -1 after 200 cycles), superior velocity performance (380.3 mA h g -1 at 5 A g -1 ) and long-term cycling stability (214.6 mA h g -1 even after 1000 cycles at 1 A g -1 ) as anode materials for LIHCs. Benefiting from the reasonable nanometer size effect, locally fine charge transfers and low energy diffusion barriers, MoSe 2 nanoflowers possess high rate pseudocapacitive behavior. In addition, the assembled MoSe 2 //AC (AC, activated carbon) LIHCs deliver a high energy density (78.75-39.1 W h kg -1 ) and high-power characteristic (150-3600 W kg -1 ). Besides, after 5000 cycles, the capacity retention rate is 70.28% under a broad potential window (0.5-3.5 V). This LIHC based on a transition metal selenide as an anode shows great potential for application in the fields of new energy electric vehicles and smart electronic products.
