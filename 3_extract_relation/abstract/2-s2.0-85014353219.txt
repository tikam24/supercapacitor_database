Ni-doped carbon aerogel was prepared by impregnation methods, physical structure, and electrochemical properties were investigated. Electrochemical properties of prepared Ni-doped carbon aerogel and carbon aerogel electrodes were measured by galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements. The results show Ni-doped carbon aerogels maintain the elementary structure of carbon aerogel, but they exhibited higher specific capacitance than carbon aerogel.
