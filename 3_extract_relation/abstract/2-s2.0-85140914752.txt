Growth of Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were obtained by Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) technique. Castor oil was vapourised above its boiling point and pyrolysis of oil was carried out by passing vapours over finely dispersed nickel metal at 650◦C. After characterization study of carbon material, scanning electron microscope (SEM) image revels that there is a growth of densely packed nanotubes with average diameter 30 – 40 nm. The XRD study of purified carbon nanotubes shows graphitic nature of carbon. Electrochemical application of CNTs obtained was studied in Supercapacitor. Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) was used to study the capacitive behaviour of carbon nanotubes in KOH electrolyte. A capacitance of 9.89 F/g (based on the weight of the carbon material) was obtained.
