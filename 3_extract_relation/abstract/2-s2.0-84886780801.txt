We explored supercapacitor devices by utilizing 3-D highly porous (with average pore size of ~80nm) carbon nanotube sponges as a conductive substrate for polyaniline deposition. The porous structure of the sponge is beneficial for precursor penetration and uniform deposition of polyaniline on to the nanotubes. The self-supported, free-standing and flexible carbon nanotube polyaniline composite structure does not require any conductive additives or mechanical binders and delivers excellent areal capacitance (1.85-1.62F/cm2 in the 4.9-49mA/cm2 current density range) coupled with high rate capability and cycle stability.
