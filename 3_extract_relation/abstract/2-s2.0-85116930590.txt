Kinetic problems restrict the applications of carbon-based materials in energy-storage systems at high currents. Herein, small carbon nanospheres (5 and 20 nm in average diameter) featured with high intra-sphere micro-/meso-porosity and inter-sphere meso-/macro-porosity are demonstrated as high-rate anode materials for lithium-ion batteries (capacity retention: 42.3 % at 1 A g−1 relative to 0.05 A g−1), enabling rapid lithium-ion diffusion with shortened diffusion lengths. Additionally, the rapid lithium-ion response is also verified with their superior capacitance retention at high currents as electrode materials for electrical double layer capacitors (capacitance retention: 69.2 % at 100 A g−1 relative to 0.5 A g−1). Our results confirm the optimum energy-storage performance of this class of nanocarbons with hierarchical micro-/meso-/macro-porous structures.
