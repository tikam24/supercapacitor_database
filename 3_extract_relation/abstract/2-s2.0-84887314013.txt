Several universities and colleges recently have offered courses and certificate programs for training students and returning engineers in advanced energy storage, particularly in electric energy storage technology. However, few integrated advanced energy storage laboratories have been established for educational purposes. This paper presents the design, development and implementation of an interactive and computer-controlled test system for four different electric energy storage devices (electro-mechanical flywheel, electrochemical batteries, supercapacitor and pumped hydroelectric) that serve as a teaching-aid. These units provide hands-on experience for students with multidisciplinary backgrounds who are enrolled in the advanced energy storage courses. The developed teaching-aid not only enhances the advanced energy storage training and education, but also inspires students' interest in the green movement of renewable energy.
