Herein, porousNiCo2S4/CNTs nanocompositeswere synthesized via a simple hydrothermal methodfollowed by the sulphurization process using different sulfide sources. By comparing two different sulfur sources, the samples using thioacetamide as sulfide source delivered more remarkable electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance of 1765 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and an admirable cycling stability with capacitance retention of 71.7% at a high current density of 10 A g-1 after 5000 cycles in 2 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device was successfully fabricated with the NiCo2S4/CNTs electrode as the positive electrode and graphene as the negative electrode. The device provided a maximum energy density of 29.44Wh kg-1 at a power density of 812Wkg-1. Even at a high power density of 8006Wkg-1, the energy density still reaches 16.68Wh kg-1. Moreover, the ASC presents 89.8% specific capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 5 A g-1. These results reveal its great potential for supercapacitors in electrochemical energy storage field.
