Spinel FeCo 2 S 4 nanoflower arrays grown on Ni foam (FeCo 2 S 4 @Ni) have been successfully fabricated via a facile hydrothermal sulfurization of the corresponding FeCo 2 O 4 precursor. The results of X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations affirm that partial Co 2+ /Co 3+ ions in Co 3 S 4 have been substituted by Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ ions to form FeCo 2 S 4 . The obtained FeCo 2 S 4 @Ni exhibits an ultrahigh specific capacitance (1644.07 mF cm −2 at 50 mA cm −2 ) and a supreme cycling stability (∼100% after 10,000 cycles at 50 mA cm −2 ) as binder-free electrodes for supercapacitors. The cycling stability of the fabricated product is the highest among the documented ternary metallic sulfides so far. The excellent supercapacitive performance of FeCo 2 S 4 @Ni emanates from the unique architectures of Fe 2 Co 2 S 4 nanoflower arrays constituted by ultrathin nanoflakes, three-dimensional porous and conductive Ni foam, and solid skeleton of Ni foam for robust connections to the Fe 2 Co 2 S 4 .
