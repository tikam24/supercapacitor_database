Supercapacitor (SCs) with excellent power and reasonably high energy densities are becoming a perfect solution towards the recent demand of various energy storage applications. Present review is focused on the synthetic methods used for spinel NiCo2O4 nanomaterials with different mysterious architectures for supercapacitor application. Synthesis of different nanostructures, hetero-structures, chemical modification and incorporation with high surface area conductive nanoarchitectures are the major strategies in the development of recent high-performance NiCo2O4-based electrodes for supercapacitors. This review runs through the creativity of current science when it comes to these nano-architectured electrodes. It is organized by techniques used for synthesis including chemical methods with and without templates along with their electrochemical supercapacitive properties. Plentiful works reviewed in this review shown enhanced electrochemical performance in the spinel NiCo2O4-based electrode materials. Finally, the future research directions and the remaining challenges toward the fabrication of different nanostructured NiCo2O4-based electrode materials for next-generation SCs are discussed (224 references).
