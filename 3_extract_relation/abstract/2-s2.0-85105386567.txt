Layered Co(OH)2 has been regarded as a potential candidate for pseudocapacitor electrode material, but it is limited by its poor conductivity and low surface area. Herein, carbonated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs-COOH) were used to improve the conductivity of α-Co(OH)2 nanocomposites. α-Co(OH)2 nanoflowers were successfully grown and tangled with MWCNTs-COOH to form a randomly oriented network structure mediated by ammonia using water-methanol as co-solvent at room temperature. The capacitance performances of the obtained α-Co(OH)2@MWCNT-COOH composites were investigated to find that MWCNT-COOH improved the specific capacitance efficiently. Especially, in the presence of 20% in mole of MWCNT-COOH, the composite gave rise to the high specific capacitance of 1027 F/g at the current density of 2 A/g with good cycle stability, whose specific capacitance remained 78% of its original even after 5000 cycles at 30 A/g current. The large surface area and strengthening the conductivity of the composites lead to the improvement of efficiency in charge/discharge process.
