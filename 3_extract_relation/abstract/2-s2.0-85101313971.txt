Dimensional transition metal carbides/nitrides (MXene) obtained by removing the MAX phase A layer by liquid phase etching and other methods is a new member of the two-dimensional material family. The unique two-dimensional structure and surface chemical composition make it show good metal conductivity, hydrophilicity, excellent flexibility and ion intercalability, which shows great potential in the research and application field of supercapacitors and has attracted wide attention. But MXene still has many problems. First, the flakes are easy to stack, which greatly reduces the effective contact area of the material and the electrolyte. During the etching process, the position where the chemical bond is broken has high activity and easily reacts to form surface groups, which has a greater influence on the electrochemical performance. The use of strong corrosive liquids in the synthesis process will also cause many problems such as safety and environment. In this article, the structure, properties and preparation methods of MXene were briefly summarized. The research progress and direction of MXene in the field of supercapacitors in recent years were reviewed. It aimed to find ideas to solve many problems of MXene, looking forward to providing references for the preparation of high-performance MXene supercapacitor electrode materials.
