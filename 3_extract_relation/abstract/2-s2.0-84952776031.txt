Supercapacitors with superb electrochemical characteristics are very promising energy storage devices. At present, the production of various supercapacitor components is mostly dependent on unsustainable fossil resources. The preferential sustainable production of these components can be achieved with more extensive utilization of abundant renewable resources instead of fossils. In this study, cellulose-derived electrodes and separators were synthesized and electrochemically evaluated in a supercapacitor device. This device showed the following results: aerial capacitance of 64 Î¼F cm-2, fast current-voltage response below 15s at current density of 2 A g-1 and capacitance retention of 97.9% after 2000 charge-discharge cycles.
