Graphene oxide (GO)/polyaniline (PANI) composite nanoflakes were fabricated by chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline onto GO nanoflakes. The electrochromic properties and the electrochemical capacitive behaviors of the GO/PANI composite nanoflake film were investigated. The GO/PANI nanocomposite film exhibits excellent electrochromic and supercapacitive performances. In comparison with neat PANI film, the GO/PANI composite nanoflake film shows larger optical modulation, faster response speed, larger coloration efficiency and better cycling stability. Moreover, an areal capacitance of (137 mF/cm2) is obtained for GO/PANI nanoflake film at a scanning rate of 5 mV/s, higher than that of neat PANI film (36 mF/cm2). The GO/PANI composite nanoflake film also shows enhanced electrochromic and supercapacitive durability. And the electrochromism also could be utilized as an indicator for the capacitance. The high-performance GO/PANI nanocomposite film shows promising features for multifunctional devices combining energy storage and electrochromism.
