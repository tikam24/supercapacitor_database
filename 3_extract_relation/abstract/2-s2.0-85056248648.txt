Inspired by steaming bread, a novel three dimensional N and S co-doped reduced graphene oxide (3D NS-rGO) foam is fabricated via a gas foaming method similar to steaming bread procedure, in which (NH4)2S2O3 is selected as the foaming agent as well as N and S source. Such cross-linked 3D structure not only has the high specific surface area also enable more transport channels for electrons/ions transport. Furthermore, introducing of N and S-containing functional groups creates lattice defects in graphene, which provides more active sites where the Faradaic pseudocapacitance occurs. Consequently, the electrochemical test of 3D NS-rGO sample in a three-electrode system demonstrates a high specific capacity of 306.3 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, two times higher than that of rGO prepared at the same temperature. Moreover, 3D NS-rGO sample reveals the superb cycling stability with less than 2% capacitance loss after 10,000 cycles and it exhibits potential application for high performance supercapacitors.
