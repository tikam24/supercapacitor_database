Nanosheet molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) electrode materials for supercapacitor were prepared by high-temperature solid-phase method combined with ball milling using sodium molybdate and thiourea in a Mo to S molar ratio of 1∶15 as raw materials. The thermal stability, phase structure and microstructure were characterized by thermogravimetric-differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The eletrochemical properties of the samples were tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/ discharge cycling (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results show that the number of MoS2 layers prepared by sintering at 750 ℃ and ball milling at 700 r·min - 1 for 10 h is 88. The specific capacitances of the samples are 82. 4 and 60. 9 F·g - 1 at the current density of 0. 5 and 1 A·g - 1, respectively (better than 54. 6 and 24. 0 F·g - 1 before ball milling). After 2 000 cycles, the specific capacitance retention rate is 92%.
