Past energy storage systems composed of super capacitors were not competitive with lithium ion batteries for energy and power density thereby making such systems economically unviable. Current research efforts are looking at new types of carbon based super capacitors to increase the performance metrics while simultaneously decreasing production costs. The main contribution of this paper is the methodology used for extracting the main parameters (capacitance, equivalent series resistance) of Carbon-ion (C-ion) cells, as well as the development of a MATLAB Simulink model of C-ion packs and module with its balancing circuit. The parameters of the cell model are derived from a stochastic model of individual cells defined by the data set comprised of a large number of cells empirically characterized. An active voltage balancing circuit provides a simple, open loop, non-dissipative method to maximize accessible energy at the system level.
