The increasing trend for portable and wearable electronic products requires the development of portable and flexible energy-storage systems, such as flexible supercapacitors. We have attached polypyrrole and carbon nanotubes to cotton fabrics as electrodes to prepare all-solid, flexible supercapacitors. Since the substrate is cotton, the supercapacitor is comfortable when worn and when in contact with the skin. Electrochemical measurements showed that the supercapacitor had a specific capacitance of 201.99 F g-1 at 1.8 A g-1. Its high capacitance, stability, flexibility, low-cost, and wearable comfort make this supercapacitor a good candidate as an energy-storage device for portable and wearable electronic products.
