Supercapacitor has imponderable advantages on the application of short and high power, and is very suitable for instantaneous power balance control in MicroGrid. In order to improve the utilization, the structure of supercapacitor bank, which is connected to the DC-bus of voltage source inverter (VSI) through Buck/Boost bi-directional converter, was presented in this paper. The DC-bus voltage of the VSI usually fluctuates with the change of the working state of the VSI, which may makes the unstable operation both of the Buck/Boost bi-directional converter and the VSI. The characteristic of complementary PWM control was analyzed and the mathematical model of complementary PWM controlled Buck/Boost bi-directional converter was established. Due to the fact that current and voltage dual-loop control cannot restrain DC-bus voltage fluctuation and improve the transient respond effectively, a power feed-forward compensator was added. Additionally, the beat observer was proposed instead of current sensor to improve load current measure accuracy Experimental and simulation studies were presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control.
