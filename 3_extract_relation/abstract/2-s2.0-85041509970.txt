V2O3@C core-shell structured nanorods (VCNR) were successfully prepared using V2O5 nanowires and glucose via a facile hydrothermal route combination of calcination. VCNR comprised of core-shell structures with V2O3 cores and amorphous carbon shells. Electrochemical properties of VCNR as supercapacitor electrodes were studied in Na2SO4 neutral electrolyte. Results demonstrated that VCNR featured capacitive behavior originating from pseudocapacitance. Specific capacitances of VCNR at 0.5, 1, 2, 5 and 10 A⋅g−1 were achieved to 219, 192, 148, 127 and 119 F⋅g−1, respectively, and VCNR displayed higher specific capacitance than the values of carbon spheres and V2O3 particles. Maximum specific capacitance of VCNR reached 219 F⋅g−1 at 0.5 A⋅g−1 in present study, which was superior to the reported values of V2O3-based materials and VO2-based materials. Capacitance retention of VCNR was 100% after 700 cycles and 66% after 1000 cycles. Findings in present study proved that VCNR could be promising candidate as an ideal material for supercapacitors’ electrode.
