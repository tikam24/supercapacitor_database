In the present work, amorphous manganese oxide nanomaterials have been synthesized by a common hydrothermal method based on the redox reaction between MnO- 4 and Fe 2+ under an acidic condition. The synthesized Mn0 2 samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and electrochemical studies. XRD results showed that amorphous manganese oxide phase was obtained. XPS quantitative analysis revealed that the atomic ratio of Mn to Fe was 3.5 in the Mn0 2 samples. TEM images showed the porous structure of the samples. Electrochemical properties of the Mn0 2 electrodes were studied using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling in M Na 2SO 4 aqueous electrolyte, which showed excellent pseudocapacitance properties. A specific capacitance of 192 Fg -1 at a current density of 0.5 Ag -1 was obtained at the potential window from -0.1 to 0.9 V (vs. SCE). Copyright Â© 2010 American Scientific Publishers.
