The electrochemical behavior of V2O5 spindle-like nanostructures synthesized through hydrothermal method is studied for supercapacitor applications. The electrochemical supercapacitive performance of the prepared electrode was investigated using cyclic voltammeters (CV), Chronopotentiometry (CP), and Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses. The crystallographic structure and phase purity of the V2O5 electrode is investigated by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. To further confirm the formation of V2O5, the Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and Fourier-transform Raman spectroscopy (FT-Raman) investigations were carried out. The formation of V2O5 is confirmed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) analyses. The electrode material delivered a high specific capacitance of 403F/g at 1A/g current density in the mixed electrolyte solution (1 M Na2SO4 + 0.5 M KOH). In this mixed electrolyte, V2O5 spindle-like electrode showed a good cyclic stability of 3000 cycles with better capacity retention of 85% at 10A/g.
