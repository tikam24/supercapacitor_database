The electrochemical properties of the layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are influenced by both composition and nanostructure to a great extent. In this work, a novel composite electrode material NiCoC/O-NiCoAl LDH was synthesized using a bimetallic NiCo-metal-organic framework (MOF) as the precursor. The composite electrode material NiCoC/O-NiCoAl LDH exhibited a three-dimensional (3D) nanoflower-like structure and multiple surface element state and was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The electrode material exhibited an outstanding specific capacitance of 2400 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1. The fabricated aqueous hybrid supercapacitor NiCoC/O-NiCoAl LDH//AC exhibited an energy density of 80 W h kg-1 at a power density of 750 W kg-1. In addition, the fabricated device exhibited excellent cycling stability and durability. The present work provides a suggestive contribution to the design and synthesis of 3D NiCoC/O-NiCoAl LDH as well as their potential applications in green energy storage.
