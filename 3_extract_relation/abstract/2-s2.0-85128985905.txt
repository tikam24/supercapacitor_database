Chemically preintercalated dopamine (DOPA) molecules were used as both a reducing agent and a carbon precursor to prepare δ-V2O5·nH2O/C, H2V3O8/C, VO2(B)/C, and V2O3/C nanocomposites via hydrothermal treatment or hydrothermal treatment followed by annealing under Ar flow. We found that the phase composition and morphology of the produced composites are influenced by the DOPA:V2O5 ratio used to synthesize (DOPA)xV2O5 precursors through DOPA diffusion into the interlayer region of the δ-V2O5·nH2O framework. The increase of DOPA concentration in the reaction mixture led to a more pronounced reduction of vanadium and a higher fraction of carbon in the composites’ structure, as evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy measurements. The electrochemical charge storage properties of the synthesized nanocomposites were evaluated in Li-ion cells with nonaqueous electrolytes. δ-V2O5·nH2O/C, H2V3O8/C, VO2(B)/C, and V2O3/C electrodes delivered high initial capacities of 214, 252, 279, and 637 mAh g–1, respectively. The insights provided by this investigation open up the possibility of creating new nanocomposite oxide/carbon electrodes for a variety of applications, such as energy storage, sensing, and electrochromic devices.
