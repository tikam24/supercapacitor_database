For a long time, the large-scale development and utilization of fossil energy has brought outstanding problems such as resource shortage, environmental pollution, climate change and so on. Driven by the goal of carbon neutrality, the pace of investment and construction of China's energy Internet is expected to accelerate. In this paper, an energy internet configuration method in the carbon neutral scenario is proposed, which establishes the smooth target of renewable energy output fluctuation and selects the filtering algorithm to stabilize the output of various new energy sources. Considering the state of charge of each energy storage element, it is proposed to use fuzzy control theory to change the average time constant, taking the power borne by hybrid energy storage and the state of charge of supercapacitor as the input of fuzzy controller, and filtering time constant correction parameters as the output of fuzzy controller. The corresponding model is built in Matlab for simulation, which verifies the reliability of the hybrid energy storage system, and the overall coordinated control performance of the hybrid energy storage device is further improved.
