The exploitation of hybrid supercapacitors with excellent electrochemical properties is of great significance for energy storage systems. Herein, a three-dimensional hierarchical flower-like architecture of nickel phosphide (Ni2P) decorated with nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots (N-CQDs) and cobalt oxide (Co3O4) is constructed by an effective two-step hydrothermal strategy followed by in situ phosphorization process. Introducing N-CQDs with superior electrochemical characteristics can not only induce the formation of N-CQDs deposited nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) flower-like architecture but also significantly enhance the electrochemical features of Ni(OH)2 nanosheets. After combination with Co3O4 nanoparticles and phosphorization treatment, an advanced cathode of Ni2P/Co3O4/N-CQDs with enriched surface phosphate ions is obtained, which possesses an ultra-high capacity of 1044 C g−1 (2088 F g−1) at 1 A g−1 with a splendid rate capacity of 876 C g−1 (1752 F g−1) at 20 A g−1. Moreover, a device assembled by Ni2P/Co3O4/N-CQDs hierarchical flower-like architecture and p-phenylenediamine functionalized reduced graphene oxide (PPD/rGO) nanosheets depicts a commendable energy density of 53.5 Wh kg−1 at 772.9 W kg−1. This work provides a novel hierarchical multi-component electrode material with decent electrochemical capacities for hybrid supercapacitors, which has a broad prospect in energy storage devices.
