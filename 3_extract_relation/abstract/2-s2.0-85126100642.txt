In the present work, we report a convenient method for preparing non-stoichiometric cobalt sulfide with one-pot solvothermal method. Different CoxSy nanomaterials are synthesized for supercapacitor application. This experiment explores the influence of ethanol and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) on the microstructure and properties of CoxSy. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy, and Brunner–Emmet–Teller (BET) measurements demonstrated that CoxSy(ethanol) and CoxSy(DMF) have different structures and morphologies. Electrochemical supercapacitor performance of CoxSy(ethanol) and CoxSy(DMF) is characterized via cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. These results show that CoxSy(DMF) has better electrochemical performance than CoxSy(ethanol), and its capacitance can reach 347.4 F/g at the current density of 0.5 A/g. Moreover, CoxSy(DMF) also delivers a better cycling stability of about 70.8% capacity retention after 3000 cycles at a current density of 4 A/g. In addition, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor of CoxSy(DMF)//active carbon shows an excellent energy density of 66.4 Wh/kg at a power density of 483.1 W/kg. These results indicate that CoxSy(DMF) has a good application prospect in the field of supercapacitor.
