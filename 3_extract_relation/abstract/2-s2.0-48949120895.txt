Chemical and electrical engineers at the University of Nottingham in UK are working on batteries for renewable energy sources such as solar panels and wind turbines. Use of renewable energy is growing in a bid to fight global warming. Yet a significant drawback of most renewable sources is their intermittency, solar panels only work when the sun is shining, and a wind turbine only turns when there is the right amount of wind. Better batteries, therefore, are crucial. Nottingham's two teams, led by George Chen in the University's School of Chemical and Environmental Engineering and Christian Klumpner in the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, are betting on a so-called "supercapattery", which combines the properties of both a supercapacitor and a battery, as the next big thing in energy storage technology. Constructed from carbon nanotubes and with a large dash of traditional battery materials, the supercapatteries are currently used for powering portable electrical devices such as laptops. The Nottingham team hopes to stack the devices for large-scale storage. The goal of the team is to develop something that will bring together the best of both worlds, the high electrical energy storage capacity of a battery and the fast charge/discharge rates of a supercapacitor. Eon is funding the research with a $2.2 million grant.
