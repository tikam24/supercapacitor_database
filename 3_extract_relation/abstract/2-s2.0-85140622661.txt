Global carbon reduction targets can be facilitated via energy storage enhancements. Energy derived from solar and wind sources requires effective storage to guarantee supply consistency due to the characteristic changeability of its sources. Supercapacitors (SCs), also known as electrochemical capacitors, have been identified as a key part of solving the problem. In addition, SCs can provide solutions to charging electric vehicles much faster than is possible using lithium-ion batteries. Nevertheless, further research into high-performance supercapacitor development is urgently needed to enable their use for effective large electricity storage. In general, energy utilization will subsequently depend on consumers/industries that are generating, storing and utilizing energy more effectively, with SCs being identified as one of the emerging technologies for intermittent energy storage, harvesting and high-power delivery. In this review, we have highlighted the historical information concerning the evolution of supercapacitor technology and its application as an energy storage device. A detailed account of the deviceâ€™s electrode materials/electrolytes, processes, designs, and various applications is discussed. The primary characteristics of the energy storage system, such as capacitance/capacity, operating temperature, energy/power density, operating potential, kinetic storage mechanism, cycling lifetime, self-discharge, voltage holding/floating test, and the makeup of the electrode materials, are also briefly discussed. In addition, based on the current research scenario, the potential, challenges, and development patterns for SCs are summarized.
