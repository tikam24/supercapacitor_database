Freestanding films with high strength and conductivity are critical for flexible electronics, such as supercapacitors. Herein, inspired from the natural leaf, a freestanding paper is constructed through fast vacuum filtration by “mesophylls-like” MXene (Ti3C2TX) nanosheets and “vein-like” cellulose filaments and silver nanowires (Ag NWs). The produced nanocomposite paper with 25 wt% Ti3C2TX and 8 wt% Ag NWs (PMxAg25-8) exhibits high conductivity (58 843 S m−1) and excellent mechanical properties (Tensile strength of 34 MPa and Young's modulus of 6 GPa), which arises from the synergistic effects of the interactions between cellulose and MXene and the three-dimensional interpenetrating frameworks. This interpenetrating framework can further benefit the electrochemical performance of the nanocomposite papers and the foldable paper electrode presents a high capacitance of 505 F g−1 with only 25 wt% MXene. This work paves the way for the fast fabrication of strong and multifunctional MXene macro-assembly for flexible electronics by conventional papermaking process. (Figure presented.).
