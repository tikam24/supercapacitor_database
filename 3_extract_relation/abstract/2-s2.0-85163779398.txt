Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), due to mechanical, electrical, and surface area properties and their ability to adapt to different nanocomposite structures, are very substantial in supercapacitor electrodes. In this review, we have summarized high-performance, flexible, and symmetry CNT supercapacitors based on the CNTs/graphene, CNTs/metal, and CNTs/polymer electrodes. To present recent developments in CNT supercapacitors, we discuss the performance of supercapacitors based on electrical properties such as specific capacitance (SC), power and energy densities, and capacitance retention (CR). The comparison of supercapacitor nanocomposite electrodes and their results are reported for future researchers.
