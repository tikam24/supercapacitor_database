With the decreasing energy resources and corresponding environmental concerns, research of new materials for energy storage devices is currently being explored that are easily available, environmentally friendly, and have good performance that fulfills the energy demand in the future. Carbon materials such as graphene, reduced graphene oxide, carbon nanotubes, activated carbon, etc. have shown the aforementioned credential because of their excellent properties like high porosity, surface area, electrical conductivity, chemical stability, mechanical and self-healing property. Here in this chapter, we have discussed the recent advances and challenges of carbon-based materials including graphene, carbon nanotube, reduced graphene oxide for supercapacitor applications.
