The rational treatment of hazardous textile sludge is critical and challenging for the environment and a sustainable future. Here, a water-soluble chitosan derivative was synthesized and used as an effective flocculant in removal of reactive dye from aqueous solution. Employing these chitosan-containing textile sludges as precursors, graphene-like carbon nanosheets were synthesized through simple one-step carbonization with the use of Fe (III) salt as graphitization catalyst. It was found that the resultant graphene-like carbon nanosheets material at thickness near 3.2 nm (NSC-Fe-2) showed a high graphitization degree, high specific surface area, and excellent bifunctional electrochemical performance. As-prepared NSC-Fe-2 catalyst exhibited excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity (onset potential 1.05 V) and a much better methanol tolerance than that of commercial Pt/C (onset potential 0.98 V) in an alkaline medium. Additionally, as electrode materials for supercapacitors, NSC-Fe-2 also displayed an outstanding specific capacitance of 195 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and superior cycling stability (loss of 3.4% after 2500 cycles). The good electrochemical properties of the as-prepared NSC-Fe materials could be attributed to the ultrathin graphene-like nanosheets structure and synergistic effects from codoping of iron and nitrogen. This work develops a simple but effective strategy for direct conversion of textile sewage sludge to value-added graphene-like carbon, which is considered as a promising alternative to fulfill the requirements of environment and energy.
