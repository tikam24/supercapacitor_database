In this study we synthesized two tetraphenyl-p-phenylenediamine-based covalent organic frameworks (TPPDA-TPPyr and TPPDA-TPTPE COFs) for potential use in high-performance electrochemical supercapacitors. This excellent performance arose from their structures containing redox-active triphenylamine derivatives and their high surface areas.
