A surface nanosculpturing is performed on twill wave carbon fibers patches by means of hydrogen plasma treatments in a dual-mode MW-RF CVD reactor. A tufts-like texture is realized on the surface of the single fibers of the patches that show an enhanced electrochemical reactivity and capacitive behavior with respect to the pristine material. The nanostructured carbon fiber fabrics are successfully used as support for the electrochemical growth of nickel species nanoflakes. The hybrid NiOx(OH)y-carbon fibers electrodes exhibit remarkable increases of both capacitive and pseudo-capacitive currents up to specific capacitance values of 1050 F gâˆ’1. Charge storage capability given by the coupling of Ni-species and etched carbon fibers is preserved after long time cycling and is also maintained after mechanical deformation, making such composite systems promising as suitable electrode materials for flexible energy storage devices.
