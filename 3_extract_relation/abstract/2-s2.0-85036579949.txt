In this study, we employed traditional method to synthesize zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 crystals (ZIF-8), one of the well-known metal organic frameworks (MOFs) with zeolite-like pore structure. Then, ZIF-8 crystal was served as a sacrificial template and carbon resource to prepare nanoporous carbons material (PCs) with high specific surface area (1230 m2 g−1) and abundant pore structure (average pore diameter is 2.8 nm). Finally, we used conventional reflux and subsequent thermal treatment to achieve composites, in which the PCs exploited as a substrate to grow ruthenium oxide (RuO2) nanoparticles on its surface. The resulting RuO2/PCs composite with 70.7 wt % RuO2 loading revealed excellent electrochemical performances in terms of high specific capacitance (539.6 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and good rate capability (capacitance retain 81.5% at 200 A g−1 as compared to that of 1 A g−1) in three electrode system. Furthermore, the symmetric supercapacitor based on RuO2/PCs electrodes delivered a high energy density of 23.38 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 600 W kg−1, indicating a potential application prospect.
