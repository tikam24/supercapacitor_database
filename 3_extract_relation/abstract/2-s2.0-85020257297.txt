The Ni/NiO nanocomposites were prepared by citrate-assisted humble sol-gel method with key variation of metal nitrate and citric acid. A series of samples were obtained and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and UV-VIS spectroscopy. All samples were tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge studies. Excitingly, the Ni/ NiO composite resulted from 1:1 ratio exhibited a highest specific capacitance of 350 F g-1 at 0.5 Ag-1 with excellent stability and coulombic efficiency. This investigation has opened a wide window for exploring other transition metal-oxides systems, such that potential nanocomposites can be generated for energy storage applications.
