Construction of heteroatoms modification of carbon nanotubes (CNT) is an attractive strategy to improve the stability and the energy density of advanced supercapacitors. Herein, the hierarchical phosphorus (P) -doped and ozonized CNT architectures (POCA) are prepared by the combination of simple ozonation, self-assembly and thermal activation approaches. The highly oxidative ozone gas would continuously etch unstable oxygen species and weaken the p-type effect of carbon nanotubes; while P atoms doping further modulates the electronic structure. As confirmed by spectroscopic and microscopic analysis, POCA exhibits a macroporous structure for fast ion diffusion and the formation of new functional groups (P–O, C–P) as the dominant active-sites for energy storage. The specific capacitance for POCA is reached up to 185.4 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in a three-electrode configuration, which is superior to other control samples due to the additionally pseudocapacitive contribution. Furthermore, the symmetric POCA//POCA supercapacitor yields a high energy density of 19.2 Wh kg−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 with a wide potential window of 1.8 V due to the synergistic effect of the hierarchical architecture and modulated surface chemistry.
