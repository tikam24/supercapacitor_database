The paper is concerned with the energy design of a fuel cell supply system for electric bicycle. A suitable architecture for the supply system is at first arranged. Besides the fuel cell, it includes an hydrogen tank and a supercapacitor bank directly connected to the dc link of the propulsion system. After selecting the fuel cell and illustrating its operation, the hydrogen tank and the supercapacitor bank are designed, respectively to meet the specifications for the range (100 km) of the bicycle and for the regulation of the dc link voltage. Then, the fuel cell supply system is set up, fitted up in a bicycle and tested. The test results corroborate the design procedure.
