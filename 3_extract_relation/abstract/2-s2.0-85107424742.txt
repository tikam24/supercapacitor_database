The development of high-performance supercapacitor electrode materials is imperative to alleviate the current energy crisis. The design and optimization of mixed transition metal oxides and the study of electrochemical performance and cycle life are essential for the practical application of supercapacitors. In the developed mixed transition metal oxides, the electroactive materials have poor conductivity and limited contact with the electrolyte, which greatly limits the electrochemical performance of the prepared electrodes. In this article, we synthesize graphene/CoMoO4 composite electrodes through chemical vapor deposition and hydrothermal growth. The uniform dispersion of active materials and the network structure of the current collector not only improve the utilization of active materials, but also increase the interface between electroactive materials and electrolyte. The presence of graphene significantly reduces the charge transfer resistance of the composite electrode, so that the three-dimensional composite electrode has excellent electrochemical performance, a relatively high area specific capacitance (2737 mF/cm2 at 1 mA/cm2) and excellent cycling Stability (after 4000 cycles at 10 mA/cm2, 81.76% of the original specific capacitance is retained). These excellent results show that the GF/CoMoO4 nanosheet composite material has great potential as an electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.
