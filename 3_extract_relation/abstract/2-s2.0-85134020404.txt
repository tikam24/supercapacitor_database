This study focused on the interface of highly porous activated carbon (AC) electrodes fabricated from banana leaves with a series of polymeric binders like polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), along with examining their suitability in AC-based supercapacitor applications. The SEM analysis demonstrated that the number of pores significantly increased after the activation of carbon materials. A greater CV curve area was exhibited during the study for the PVA binder than for PVDF and CMC. The specific capacitance values of the three binders were 170 Fg-1, 160 Fg-1, and 40 Fg-1, respectively, in GCD. Moreover, all of the binders' GCD curves were quasi-symmetrical. However, the PVA binder showed a better triangular shape and longer discharge time than CMC and PVDF. These results demonstrate that PVA can be a better choice as a polymer binder in AC-based supercapacitors.
