The metal oxide thin films have performed so greatly in semiconductor field because of excellent physical, optical and electric properties. These materials have attracted more and more interest, and could be used in solar cells, biosensors, biomedical, supercapacitor, photocatalysis, luminescent materials, and laser devices. Preparation of thin films have been reported by many researchers through various deposition methods. The characterization on the properties of films is very important to optimize its design of material. In this work, significantly focused on the development or improvement in thin film based solar cells, perovskite solar cells, and dye sensitized solar cell. The photovoltaic parameters (short-circuit current, open-circuit voltage, fill factor and efficiency) were studied in solar cell fabricated under different conditions. Experimental findings confirmed that metal oxide could be used as electron transport layer, electron conducting medium, anti-reflecting layer, and hole transport material.
