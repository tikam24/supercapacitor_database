MnO2/carbon composites with ultrathin MnO2 nanofibers (diameter of 5-10 nm) uniformly deposited on three dimensional ordered macroporous (3DOM) carbon frameworks were fabricated via a self-limiting redox process. The MnO2 nanofibers provide a large surface area for charge storage, whereas the 3DOM carbon serves as a desirable supporting material providing rapid ion and electron transport through the composite electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to characterize the capacitive performance of these composites. Optimization of the composition results in a composite with 57 wt% MnO2 content, which gives both a high specific capacitance (234 F g-1 at a discharge current of 0.1 A g-1) and good rate capability (52% retention of the capacitance at 5 A g-1). An asymmetric supercapacitor was fabricated by assembling the optimized MnO 2/carbon composite as the positive electrode and 3DOM carbon as the negative electrode. The asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits superior electrochemical performances, which can be reversibly charged and discharged at a maximum cell voltage of 2.0 V in 1.0 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte, delivering both high energy density (30.2 W h kg-1) and power density (14.5 kW kg-1). Additionally, the asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits an excellent cycle life, with 95% capacitance retained after 1000 cycles. Â© 2013 The Owner Societies.
