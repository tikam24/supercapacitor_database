Major obstacles associated with aqueous supercapacitor materials such as slower rate capability and shorter cyclic lives are commonly found in pure V2O5 electrodes, limiting their extensive applications. This study demonstrates the preparation of a novel V2O5 composite grown on a biodegradable ceramic material of three-dimensional (3D) vanadium aluminum carbide (V2O5@V2AlC) with a convenient thermal oxidation process to reinforce its structural stability for improved electrochemical performance. The physicochemical properties of the composite were investigated using X-ray diffraction for phase analysis, scanning electron microscopy for surface morphology, energy dispersive X-ray for elemental composition, and Brunauer–Emmet–Teller analysis for specific surface area measurements. When investigated as supercapacitor electrodes in three different aqueous electrolytic media such as acidic (1 M H2SO4), neutral (0.5 M K2SO4), and alkaline (1 M KOH) solution, the composite exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance in the neutral solution. The maximum specific areal capacitance of 680 mF cm−2 at 5 mVs −1 and 740 mF cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2 was obtained and with improved cyclic stability. The enhanced capacitance properties and extended cyclic life along with the lower charge transfer resistance of the 3D-V2O5@V2AlC composite can be attributed to the strong mechanical properties of the material with an excellent capacitive contribution.
