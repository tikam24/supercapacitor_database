We successfully synthesized two different kinds of hyper-crosslinked porous organic polymers (CPOPs) based on tetraphenylanthraquinone units by a reaction of 9,10-bis(diphenylmethylene)- 9,10-dihydroanthracene (An-4Ph) as the building unit with formaldehyde dimethyl acetal and 2,4,6-trichloro-1,3,5-triazine as two external crosslinkers by using a simple and friendly one-step Friedel−Crafts polymerization in the presence anhydrous FeCl3 as a catalyst to afford An-CPOP-1 and An-CPOP-2 as a black solid with high yield, respectively. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and NMR spectroscopy were confirmed the chemical structures of the synthesized monomers and the corresponding polymers. Both An-CPOP-1 and An-CPOP-2 showed amorphous character, outstanding thermal stability, and high BET surface area (up to 1000 m2/g) with microporosity and mesoporosity architectures based on XRD, TGA analyses and N2 adsorption/desorption measurements. Interestingly, TEM and SEM images revealed that An-CPOP-1 had regular tubular nanotubes structure without using template or surfactant or carbonization at the elevated temperature. The as-prepared An-CPOP-2 exhibited a high specific capacitance of 98.4 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and excellent cycling stability (95.3% capacitance retention over 2000 cycles), which could be used as good material for energy storage application.
