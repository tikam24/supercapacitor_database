The porous materials of SnO2@NGO composite was synthesized by thermal reduction process at 550 Â°C in presence ammonia and urea as catalyst. In this process, the higher electrostatic attraction between the SnO2@NGO nanoparticles were anchored via thermal reduction reaction. These synthesized SnO2@ NGO composites were confirmed by Raman, XRD, XPS, HR-TEM, and EDX results. The SnO2 nanoparticles were anchored in the NGO composite in the controlled nanometer scale proved by FE-TEM and BET analysis. The SnO2@NGO composite was used to study the electrochemical properties of CV, GCD, and EIS analysis for supercapacitor application. The electrochemical properties of SnO2@NGO exhibited the specific capacitance (~378 F/g at a current density of 4 A/g) and increasing the cycle stability up to 5000 cycles. Therefore, the electrochemical results of SnO2@NGO composite could be promising for high-performance supercapacitor applications.
