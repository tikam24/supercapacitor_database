Electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) featuring low-cost and solution-processable electrode materials have attracted significant research interest for their green and economical applications in energy harvesting and storage devices. Here, we demonstrate a novel synthetic route for films of an underexplored 3-D hexagonal bismuth chalcohalide, Bi 13 S 18 I 2 , and investigate its potential as the active electrode material in EDLC-type supercapacitors. The synthetic procedure has been optimised and comprises the lowest annealing temperature (150 Â°C) and the shortest processing time (1 h) currently reported. When integrated in a symmetrical EDLC with an aqueous NaClO 4 electrolyte, the Bi 13 S 18 I 2 -based device achieves a remarkable areal capacitance of 210.68 mF cm -2 with 99.7% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles. Both the Bi 13 S 18 I 2 powder and thin-film electrodes have been characterized through XRD, XPS, Raman spectroscopy, and SEM. The superior stability, low-cost, and facile synthesis of Bi 13 S 18 I 2 proves its promising potential for supercapacitor applications.
