Herein, we demonstrate the fabrication of Ti 3 C 2 T x electrodes using solution processing. Two-dimensional (2D) nanometer Ti 3 C 2 T x flakes are site-aggregated on copper and nickel foam papers with a reconstituted three-dimensional (3D) structure consisting of overlapping and open-pore 2D flakes. When Ti 3 C 2 T x was used as electrochemical capacitor electrodes in 1 M Na 2 SO 4 solution, the capacitances were comparable to literature values. There is a quantitative linear relationship between the capacitance and foam thicknesses. Given the process scalability and the morphological control that is possible, these results provide a promising road map for convenient and economical supercapacitors.
