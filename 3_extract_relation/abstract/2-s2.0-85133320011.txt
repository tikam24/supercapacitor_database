ZnO nanospheres wrapped with reduced graphene oxide sheets were successfully synthesized using an in-situ technique, and their structural, morphological, optical, and electrochemical properties were characterized. The hexagonal wurtzite phase of the nanoparticles was confirmed by XRD analysis. Ultraviolet–Visible Absorption Spectroscopy showed a decrease in the band gap energy values of the composite in comparison to pure ZnO. The photoluminescence study reveals that the ultraviolet emission of the ZnO@rGO composite was significantly increased whereas the defect-related visible emission was quenched compared to pure ZnO, which is thought to be due to the reduction of defect states and possible electron transfer between reduced graphene oxide and ZnO. Then the synthesized samples were utilized for electrochemical performance. The electrochemical tests reveal the ZnO@rGO composite shows a high specific capacitance of 846F/g, which is nearly 2.3 times higher than that of ZnO. Furthermore, this supercapacitor electrode exhibits excellent cycle life with a specific capacitance ∼96% of the initial value after 1000 cycles. According to the findings, the hybrid material is an attractive electrode material for high-performance supercapacitor applications.
