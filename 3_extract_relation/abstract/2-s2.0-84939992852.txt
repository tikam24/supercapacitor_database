Tungstic oxide (WO3) thin films have been synthesized by wet chemical method, i.e., successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. These films are characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical absorption techniques. The XRD pattern revealed the formation of polycrystalline WO3 films. Scanning electron micrographs demonstrate the three-dimensional aggregated irregular extended rod shaped morphology of WO3 thin films. The WO3 film showed a direct band gap of 2.5 eV. The WO3 film exhibited specific capacitance of 266 F·g−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte at the scan rate of 10 mVs−1.
