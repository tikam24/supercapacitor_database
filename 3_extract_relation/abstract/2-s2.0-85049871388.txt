A super-capacitor/battery hybrid energy storage system for wind/solar generation system is presented, which has advantages of ultra capacitor and battery and overcome their shortcomings. Then, the structure of the hybrid energy system is given and its equivalent circuit model is set up. And model of the system is built. Synergetic control methods for the system are designed, then control rules are obtained.
