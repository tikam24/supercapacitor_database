In this paper, it is demonstrated that an ultracapacitor exhibits a non-linear behaviour with respect to the operating voltage. For charge current sequences inducing low level voltage variations compared with the bias voltage accross its terminals, the analysis of the porous part the ultracapacitor impedance shows that the charge process can be modeled with the help of a continuous fractional model made of a classical integrator connected in parallel with a fractional integrator of order 1/2, whose action is blocked outside a limited spectral band. Furthermore, the investigated fractional model is able to provide an accurate estimation of the low frequency capacitance and high frequency internal resistance. In order to explicitly take into account the dependence of the system dynamics on the operating voltage, a fractional continuous LPV model is used and determined thanks to a local approach composed of two steps. First, the local LTI fractional model parameters are estimated thanks to an output-error technique at different bias voltages. Secondly, the parameter estimates dependence with respect to the operating voltage is obtained by using cubic spline interpolation. The resulting LPV fractional model is validated on an experimental ultracapacitor bench. Â© 2012 IFAC.
