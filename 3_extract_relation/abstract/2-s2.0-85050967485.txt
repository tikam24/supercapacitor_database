The power design circuit and simulation to maintain constant the voltage (48V) and power (1kW) parameters for one hour used for the operation of a permanent magnet DC motor with a backup of the energy of a supercapacitors module was presented. The elements used in a bidirectional DC-DC converter were designed and selected to meet the proposed requirements. A PID control system are proposed, which will be able to control the PWM for the correct operation of the power switches. Tests were performed to validate the circuit in relation to the results obtained. The N-channel mosfet was selected from different types of switches because its characteristics conform to the established parameters. The design specifies the type and value of each of the components, as well as the equations and methods used to obtain the output values.
