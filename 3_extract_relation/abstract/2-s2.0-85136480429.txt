The present work explores the 1 T Metallic Vanadium disulfide/MXene/functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (1 T-VS2-MX-CNT) ternary hybrid prepared by a facile hydrothermal method for high-performance asymmetric supercapacitor applications. The systematic studies of the VS2-MX-CNT ternary hybrid structure reveal an increase in interlayer spacing from 13.45 to 13.81 Å obtained from the x-ray diffraction patterns, depending on the ratio of precursors used for the synthesis. Furthermore, The optimized 1 T Metallic Vanadium disulfide/MXene/functionalized MWCNTs with 50 mg (VS2-MX-CNT-50) ternary hybrid attained the maximum specific capacitance of 505 F/g at 0.2 A/g. The VS2 nanosheets not only restrict the MXene layers from re-stacking but also act as a pore space for electron transfer. The electrochemical properties of the VS2-MX-CNT ternary hybrid was enhanced even further by depositing functionalized MWCNTs which helps to make a conductive channel for better ion transport. The detailed analysis demonstrates that capacitive contributions dominate diffusive contributions in the overall collective charge storage for the best performing VS2-MX-CNT-50 ternary hybrid material. Furthermore, the VS2-MX-CNT-50 // functionalized MWCNT (MWCNT) asymmetric supercapacitor cell was also designed to achieve an extraordinary energy density of 59.85 Wh kg−1 and maximum power density of 7303.72 W kg−1 along with a wide 1.7 V potential window. Hence, VS2-MX-CNT-50 // MWCNT-based asymmetric supercapacitor devices emerge as high power density energy storage devices for flexible and wearable device applications.
