A lithium ion hybrid supercapacitor system with battery and supercapacitor characteristics has the potential to meet the increasing demand for an energy storage device with both high energy and power densities. In this work, orthorhombic Nb2O5 (T-Nb2O5) with three-dimensional (3D) flower-like structures was synthesized by a facile hydrothermal reaction and an annealing process. A lithium ion hybrid supercapacitor was constructed by using T-Nb2O5 as an anode and commercial activated carbon (AC) as a cathode. The electrochemical performance of these T-Nb2O5/AC hybrid capacitors was measured by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests. The results showed that the working voltage of the hybrid supercapacitor could reach 3.0 V in the organic carbonate electrolyte system. The as-assembled device showed impressive power density of 294 W·kg−1 and energy density of 53.79 W·h·kg−1 at a current density of 100 mA·g-1 with a voltage range of 0.5–3.5 V. Moreover, it also showed excellent cycling stability with a retention of 73% after 1000 cycles at 200 mA·g−1. These results demonstrate that this novel lithium ion hybrid supercapacitor based on T-Nb2O5 with 3D flower-like structures and AC is a promising candidate for high power density energy storage applications.
