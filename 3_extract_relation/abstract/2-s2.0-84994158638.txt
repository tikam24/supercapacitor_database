Carbon supported cobalt oxide nanoparticles (Co3O4@C NPs) were synthesized by simple thermolysis of cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate and Terminalia chebula (T. chebula) fruit. The synthesized Co3O4@C NPs were characterized using attenuated total reflection conjunction with Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) techniques. The specific surface area of Co3O4@C NPs was measured by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm. The ATR-FTIR analysis revealed that the phytoconstituents of T. chebula were carbonized and supports the Co3O4 NPs. The synthesized Co3O4@C NPs were highly crystalline with carbon support, exposed by the XRD patterns. As inferred from microscopic images, the particle size of Co3O4@C NPs is in the range of 15–25 nm with distorted spherical shape. The EDS results confirmed the presence of three major elements such as Co, O and C in the synthesized Co3O4@C NPs. The calculated specific surface area of Co3O4 NPs is 22 m2/g. The supercapacitor performance of synthesized Co3O4@C NPs in 2 M aqueous KOH was analyzed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) methods. The Co3O4@C NPs showed a maximum specific capacitance of about 642 F/g at 1 A/g of discharging current density between 0 and 0.50 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The high specific capacitance of Co3O4@C NPs could be attributed to the combination of both double layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance.
