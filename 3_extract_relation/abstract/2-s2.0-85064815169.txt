A rapid one-step flame combustion deposition method was developed to fabricate the mesoporous metal sulfides directly on nickel foam without binder and template. The first-row transition metal sulfides, Co9S8, Ni3S4, NiCo2S4, and FeS, were successfully synthesized with three-dimensional architecture, large specific surface area (around 110 m2 g-1), and interconnected pore networks. The binary meso-NiCo2S4 exhibited a high specific capacitance (1350 F g-1 at 10 A g-1), excellent rate capability, and robust cycling stability in both three-electrode half-cells and asymmetric supercapacitor. This study demonstrated a new scalable strategy to obtain mesoporous metal sulfides with high electrochemical performance.
