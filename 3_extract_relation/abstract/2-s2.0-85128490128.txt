To resolve the energy storage challenges in portable electronic devices, flexible and solid-state supercapacitor are need of the hour. These devices are appealing as replacements to conventional lithium-ion batteries due to their high power density, long cycle life, chemical stability, and safety. We have synthesized sp2 hybridized porous carbon nanostructure using poly-paraphenylenediamine (PpPD) as a polymer and activated the prepared material via chemical activation for supercapacitor application. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the demonstration of poly-paraphenylenediamine (PpPD) derived N-enriched porous activated carbon (PNAC) electrode with PVA/H2SO4 electrolyte for solid-state supercapacitor (SSC) device with high energy density and excellent cyclic stability. PNAC electrodes-based SSC electrochemical studies exhibit a high specific capacitance value of 39 F g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 current density. The solid-state supercapacitor attained energy density of 21.66 Wh kg-1 at power density of 199 W kg-1 and 0.2 A g-1 current density. The symmetric solid-state supercapacitor displays an outstanding cyclic stability up to 10,000 galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) cycles. High energy density and stability of the prepared device suggests it utility in portable energy storage application.
