Supercapacitors are promising energy storage devices for flexible electronics because of their integration of lightweight, tiny volume and high flexibility. Here, a facile yet effective method was developed to synthesize Cu2O, by oxidation-assisted dealloying and subsequent electrochemical strategies. The assembled asymmetric supercapacitor device, using Cu2O as the positive electrode and active carbon as the negative electrode could be operated with high voltage region of 1.65 V and exhibited a high energy density of 20.04 Wh kgâˆ’1. Additionally, our device had an excellent long-term cycling stability with more than 93.3% retention after 5000 cycles. To demonstrate potential application of our prepared flexible all-solid-state ASC device, four charged devices were constructed in series, they were able to illuminate 52 red colored LEDs.
