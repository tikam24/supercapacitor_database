Four energy management controllers for use in a fuel cell, supercapacitor hybrid vehicle and are compared in a Matlab Simulink simulation. The controllers are tested on a light delivery vehicle with a maximum laden weight of 1800kg. The benefit of over sizing the energy buffer is examined for each controller. The controllers with various supercapacitor buffer sizes are compared with respect to the peak fuel cell power demand, the rate of change of power demand and the operating time of the fuel cell in the inefficient region. The NYCC and LA4 driving cycles are used to test the robustness of the controllers, which are designed using the ECE15 driving cycle. A laboratory electrical vehicle emulation is constructed to allow practical testing of the energy management controllers and validation of the Simulink simulation. The emulation has an FPGA controlled DC motor to simulate the vehicle load, this is coupled to the electric vehicle traction drive. The fuel cell is interfaced via a dual interleaved boost converter and the supercapacitors are connected directly across the DC-link of the traction drive. The emulation is used to validate the Matlab model, testing the controllers on the LA4 and ECE15 driving cycles.
