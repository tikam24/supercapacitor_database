A miniature nonlinear piezoelectric energy harvester is developed to power state of the art leadless cardiac pacemakers from cardiac motions. The energy harvester is integrated in the leadless pacemaker and is connected to the myocardium. The energy harvester converts myocardial motions to electricity to power leadless pacemakers. The energy is stored in a battery or supercapacitor and is used for pacing. The device is composed of a bimorph piezoelectric beam confined in a gray iron frame. The system is assembled at high temperature and operated at the body temperature. The mismatch in the coefficients of thermal expansion of the beam and the frame causes the beam to buckle in body temperature. This intentional buckling makes the beam unstable and improves the power production and robustness of the device. Having high natural frequency is a major problem in microelectromechanical systems energy harvesters. Considering the small size of the energy harvester, 0:5 cm3, the natural frequency is expected to be high. In our design, the natural frequency is lowered significantly using a buckled beam and a proof mass. Since the beam is buckled, the design is bistable and nonlinear, which could increase the output power. In this article, the device is analytically modeled, and the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the energy harvester are analytically derived. The terms corresponding to geometric nonlinearities are included in the electromechanical coupled governing equations. The simulations show that the device generates sufficient electricity to power leadless pacemakers.
