Transition metal oxide aerogels are a fascinating class of compounds that have received considerable attention in the last decade owing to their unique and exceptional properties, including high porosity, large surface area, and ultralow density. In this study, α-Ni(OH)2 aerogels and annealed NiO/Ni aerogels were used to design and fabricate a two-electrode supercapacitor device. The physicochemical properties of the as-synthesized aerogels were characterized through X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller theory, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies. The annealed NiO/Ni aerogels showed a (specific capacitance of 1060 F/g) specific capacity of 422 C/g at 1 A/g current density and with good cycling stability (up to 10,000 cycles). The supercapacitor also demonstrated an energy density of 32.4 Wh/kg and power density of 1800 W/kg at a current density of 2 A/g. The specific capacitance of NiO/Ni aerogels was more than twice that of the α-Ni(OH)2 aerogels. The practical applications of the aerogel were demonstrated by fabricating a two-electrode device.
