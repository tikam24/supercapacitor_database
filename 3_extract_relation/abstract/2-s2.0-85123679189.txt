Herein, we report a comprehensive modification of porous carbon via simple carbonization with the aid of low dosage Mn(NO3)2. The resultant CMPCx exhibit significantly increased specific surface area compared to untreated porous carbon, with a maximum increment of 873 m2 g−1. Under a critical dosage of Mn(NO3)2, i.e., a mass ratio of Mn(NO3)2 solution to porous carbon of 0.2, the resultant CMPC2 has remarkably increased sp2 carbon content and appropriate MnO loading. Notably, CMPC2 delivers a high specific capacitance of 370 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 and superior rate performance (207 F g−1 at 100 A g−1) in three-electrode system using 6 M KOH electrolyte, with dramatically enhanced pseudocapacitive behavior. As symmetric supercapacitor electrode, CMPC2 has large specific capacitance of 309 and 227 F g−1 at 0.25 and 20 A g−1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte, respectively. And a capacitance retention of 94.87% can be retained after 10,000 cycles at 10 A g−1, demonstrating excellent cycle stability. Furthermore, CMPC2 based supercapacitor yields impressive energy densities of 31.9 and 8.3 W h kg−1 at the power densities of 492.3 W kg−1 and 9.6 kW kg−1 in 1 M Li2SO4 electrolyte, respectively.
