Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising electrode materials in supercapacitors (SCs). However, their insoluble powder-like nature, poor capacitive performance in pristine form, integrated with inferior electrochemical stability is a primary concern for their long-term use in electrochemical devices. Keeping this in perspective, herein we report a redox active and hydrogen bonded COF with ultrahigh stability in conc. H2SO4 (18 M), conc. HCl (12 M) and NaOH (9 M). The as-synthesized COF fabricated as thin sheets were efficiently employed as a free-standing supercapacitor electrode material using 3 M aq. H2SO4 as an electrolyte. Moreover, the pristine COF sheet showcased outstanding areal capacitance 1600 mF cm-2 (gravimetric 169 F g-1) and excellent cyclic stability (>100000) without compromising its capacitive performance or Coulombic efficiency. Moreover, as a proof-of-concept, a solid-state supercapacitor device was also assembled and subsequently tested.
