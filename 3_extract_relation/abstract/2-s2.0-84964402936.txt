3D CuxO-Cu nanostructures were synthesized through a simple chemical corrosion method and were employed as binder-free electrodes for supercapacitors. Owing to the direct growth of the active materials onto the Cu foam without any binders, and the 3D interconnected structure ensures a highly conductive network favorable for electron transfer, the as-prepared electrode exhibit a high specific capacitance of 111 mF cm-2 at 0.5 mA cm-2 and a better rate capability of 80 mF cm-2 at 10 mA cm-2. Besides, the CuxO-Cu//AC asymmetric supercapacitor can deliver a high energy density of 34.36 Î¼W h cm-2, thus showing great potential for supercapacitor applications.
