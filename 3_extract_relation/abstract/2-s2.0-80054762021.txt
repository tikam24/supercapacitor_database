A mixture of crystalline Co3O4/CoO nanorods with non-uniform dense distribution has been successfully synthesized by microwave hydrothermal technique. The synthesized nanorods have been characterized by several techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The results showed that the as synthesized specimens contained mixed crystalline Co3O 4/CoO nanorods with an average length of around 80 nm and an average diameter of 42 nm. UV-Vis spectrum of the nanorods exhibited a strong UV emission. The band energy gap of the product was 1.79 eV which lies between the energy gap of CoO and that for Co3O4. The obtained carrier concentration is of the order 4.32 × 1027 m-3 and the dielectric constant is found to be 4.89. The electrical conductivity increases with increasing temperature and behaves as a semiconducting material with an activation energy of a bout 0.26 eV. This makes the as synthesized mixed Co3O4/CoO nanorods very useful for supercapacitor devices application. Magnetic hysteresis loops at room temperature of the as synthesized mixed oxides (Co3O4/CoO) nanorods exhibit typical soft magnetic behavior. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
