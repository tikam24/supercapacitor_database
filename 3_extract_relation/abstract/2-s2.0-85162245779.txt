Transition metal oxide has been extensively investigated as a candidate for asymmetric supercapacitors based on their unique structural properties and elevated capacitance. However, the conductivity of materials such as NiCo2O4 is still not at the level of industrialization. In this work, we prepare a NiCo2-LDH-based heterostructure material via a one-step hydrothermal approach. As a result, the NiCo2-LDH/MoO2/Ti3C2 electrode material possesses a high specific capacitance (5282 mF cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2) with excellent cycling performance. Moreover, the assembled asymmetric device presents a cycling stability of 80.8% retention after 8000 cycles, and a high energy density of 5.31 Wh cm−2 as a power density of 54.0 W cm−2.
