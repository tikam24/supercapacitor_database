The new covalent organic framework material TDFP-1 was prepared through a solvothermal Schiff base condensation reaction of the monomers 1,3,5-tris-(4-aminophenyl)triazine and 2,6-diformyl-4-methylphenol. Owing to its high specific surface area of 651 m2 g−1, extended π conjugation, and inherent microporosity, TDFP-1 exhibited an excellent energy-storage capacity with a maximum specific capacitance of 354 F g−1 at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 and good cyclic stability with 95 % retention of its initial specific capacitance after 1000 cycles at 10 A g−1. The π-conjugated polymeric framework as well as ionic conductivity owing to the possibility of ion conduction inside the micropores of approximately 1.5 nm make polymeric TDFP-1 a favorable candidate as a supercapacitor electrode material. The electrochemical properties of this electrode material were measured through cyclic voltammetry, galvanic charge–discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and the results indicate its potential for application in energy-storage devices.
