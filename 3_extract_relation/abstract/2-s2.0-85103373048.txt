Carbon electrodes for aqueous supercapacitors should have extensive surface area for higher energy and surface morphology enabling electrolyte ions to access the entire surface. The multiple micropores below 2 nm enhance the specific surface area, while mesopores of 2-50 nm allow easy ion transport through porous structure. Here, we synthesize a hierarchical carbon via both a polyvinylidene fluoride precursor directly converting to microporous carbon during pyrolysis and a sol-gel templating route producing the mesopore. Polytetrafluoroethylene is added to induce mesopore by thermal decomposition. Both the fluorine-containing polymers autonomously remove the silica template using evolving HF and C2F4 gas during pyrolysis. The dimethylformamide polar solvent helps dissolve both polymers and form alkaline condition beneficial for sol-gel process. The sol-gel–processed carbon exhibits wide pore ranges of over 50 nm, leading to surface area of 1230 m2 g−1 with capacitance of 105 F g−1 in neutral Na2SO4. The sol-gel–route develops the hydrophilic surface, effectively reducing the electrode resistance in aqueous electrolyte and promoting porous surface utilization. The capacitance retention of 78% exhibits at 10-fold faster rate due to the hierarchically structured pore and hydrophilic surface. Both the energy and power densities are superior to commercial activated carbon with larger area.
