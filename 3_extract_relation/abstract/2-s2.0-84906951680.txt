A new pseudocapacitor anode, sulfur-doped V6O13-x, is reported. It achieves a benchmark capacitance of 1353 F/g (0.72 F/cm 2) at a current density of 1.9 A/g (1 mA/cm2) in 5 M LiCl solution. The charges are stored chemically in the electrode via reversible redox reactions that involve multiple oxidation states of vanadium (V 3+, V4+ and V5+). Â© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
