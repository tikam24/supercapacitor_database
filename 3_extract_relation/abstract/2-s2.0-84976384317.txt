To meet the ever-increasing need for high-efficiency energy storage in modern society, porous carbon materials with large surface areas are typically employed for electrical double-layer capacitors to achieve high gravimetric performances. However, their poor volumetric performances come from low packing density and/or high pore volume resulting in poor volumetric capacitance, which would limit their further applications. Here, a novel and one-step molten salt synthesis of a three-dimensional, densely nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NPC) material by using low-cost and eco-friendly tofu as the nitrogen-containing carbon source is proposed. Hierarchically porous carbon with a specific surface area of 1202 m2 g-1 and a high nitrogen content of 4.72 wt% and a bulk density of ∼0.84 g cm-3 is obtained at a carbonation temperature of 750 °C. As the electrode material for a supercapacitor, the NPC electrode shows both ultra-high specific volumetric and gravimetric capacitances of 360 F cm-3 and 418 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 (based on a three-electrode system), respectively, and excellent cycling stability without capacitance loss after 10 000 cycles at a high charge current of 10 A g-1 in KOH electrolyte. Moreover, the as-assembled symmetric supercapacitor exhibits not only an excellent cycling stability with 97% capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles, but also a high volumetric energy density up to 27.68 W h L-1 at a current density of 0.2 A g-1, making this new method highly promising for compact energy storage devices with simultaneous high volumetric/gravimetric energy and power densities.
