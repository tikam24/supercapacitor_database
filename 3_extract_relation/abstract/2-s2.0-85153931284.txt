Hybrid energy storage system (HESS), a combination of lithium battery (LIB) and supercapacitor (SC) in hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), can slow down the degradation of battery performance and improve the peak current characteristics by using an optimal energy management system (EMS). A fuzzy EMS controller is first designed to allocate the energy between LIB and SC, then an improved NSGA-III algorithm based on similarity and diversity selection (NSGA-III-SD) is proposed to reduce energy consumption, lithium battery output current, peak power and prolong the life of LIB as well as to meet the SOC of SC constraint by optimizing the parameters of the fuzzy rule base and membership functions (MFs). Four typical driving patterns including busy city, urban, suburban and highway are selected to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method. The experimental results indicate that the optimal fuzzy EMS exhibits good adaptive power distribution capability under all driving conditions.
