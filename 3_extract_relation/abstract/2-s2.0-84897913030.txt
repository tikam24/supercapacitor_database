Electrochemical deposition of MnO2 onto carbon nanotube (CNT) yarn gives a high-performance, flexible yarn supercapacitor. The hybrid yarn's blended structure, resulting from trapping of MnO2 in its internal pores, effectively enlarges electrochemical area and reduces charge diffusion length. Accordingly, the yarn supercapacitor exhibits high values of capacitance, energy density, and average power density. Applications in wearable electronics can be envisaged.
