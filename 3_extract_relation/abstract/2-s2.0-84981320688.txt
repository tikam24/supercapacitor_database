In the contribution, we explore an efficient synthetic platform to purposefully fabricate hollow mesoporous NiCo2S4 (HM-NCS) ellipsoids for advanced electrochemical supercapcitors (ECSs). Uniform hollow NiCo2O4 (NCO) as the intermidate is initially prepared by calcination, and subsequently chemically transformed into spinel HM-NCS ellipsoids through in situ anion-exchange reaction. Elaborate physicochemical and electrochemical investigations comparatively demonstrate that the resultant HM-NCS ellipsoids possess superior pseudo-capacitance of ∼495 F g−1 against its hollow NCO counterpart (∼185 F g−1) at the same rate of 10 A g−1, benefiting from its larger surface area, thinner porous shells, smaller internal and charge-transfer resistances, and higher-content Ni (II)/Co (II) species. Remarkably, an asymmetric supercapacitor assembled with HM-NCS ellipsoids obtains a high energy density of ∼28.9 Wh kg−1 at a power density of ∼187.5 Wh kg−1, and appealing cycle behaviors with a capacitance decay of ∼0.0058% per cycle over 5000 cycles at a high rate of 3 A g−1. It strongly highlights that the cost-effective HM-NCS ellipsoids would be a competitive pseudo-capacitive electrode candidate for advanced ECSs applications.
