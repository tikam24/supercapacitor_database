On the basis of the requirements for both biobased economy and energy storage materials, we are interested in using cellulose-based microporous film as a template for in situ synthesis of polyaniline (PANI). Multifunctional carbon nanotube (CNT)/cellulose composite films were also prepared from a CNT/cellulose suspension in a NaOH/urea aqueous system. Subsequently, PANI was synthesized in situ in the pores of cellulose and CNT/cellulose substrates to construct PANI/cellulose (PC) films and PANI/CNT/cellulose (PCC) films, respectively. Both PC and PCC films were flexible and exhibited a highly specific capacitance and good cycle stability. With the addition of CNTs, the specific capacitance of the PCC films as supercapacitor materials was significantly improved. Moreover, a homogeneous structure intertwined with the cellulose, CNTs and PANI appeared in the composite films, indicating good miscibility. This work has provided a new approach to the fabrication of flexible, lightweight, highly effective, and low-cost energy storage materials, broadening the applications of cellulose.
