Quantum dot-based nanocomposite materials have gained huge attention in electrochemical energy storage devices due to their extremely high surface-to-volume ratio and enhanced conductivity. In this work, nanocomposites of SnO2 quantum dots and Au nanoparticles (SQD-Au) has been prepared by an in-situ soft-chemical approach. The structural and charge storage properties of the prepared material were investigated. The prepared composite material coated on the nickel foam and used as working electrode for supercapacitor applications. Results show that the SQD-Au electrode material exhibits an excellent specific capacity of 87 mAh g−1 at the current density of 1A g−1. The columbic efficiency of the electrode was found be 98 % after 5000 GCD cycles. Some of the factors responsible for the observed superior charge storage properties of SQD-Au composite compared pristine SQDs are enhanced conductivity and fast electron transport.
