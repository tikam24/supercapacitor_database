In order to deeply analyze the dynamic characteristic of supercapacitors, a virtual test platform was designed to fulfill the functions of synchronized acquisition and data analysis of supercapacitor terminal voltage and charging/discharging current during the working process. The platform design is based on the virtual instrument and PXI-bus technologies. With respect to the hardware of the platform, the sensor type selection, the selection of the PXI-bus instruments and the design process of the signal conditioning circuit are discussed in detail. The LabVIEW is adopted to develop the human-machine interface, and realize the real time monitoring and data processing of the signals. Experiment results show that the virtual test platform can acquire the dynamic characteristic data of one or more cells of supercapacitors safely, accurately and synchronously, which sets a foundation for the analysis and modeling of supercapacitor dynamic characteristics.
