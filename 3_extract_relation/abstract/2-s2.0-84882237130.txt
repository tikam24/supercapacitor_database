Screen printing of graphene-based ink shows promise for the integration of graphene within supercapacitor electrodes. A series of graphene/polyaniline inks are formulated, and screen printing is used to produce thin-film electrodes from these inks. Using these electrodes, supercapacitors are fabricated that exhibit high capacity, flexibility, and stability. These results provide an important step towards the industrial development of printable supercapacitors. Copyright Â© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
