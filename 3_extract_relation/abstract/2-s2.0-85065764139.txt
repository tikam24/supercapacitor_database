Carbon materials display appealing physical, chemical, and mechanical properties and have been extensively studied as supercapacitor electrodes. The surface engineering further allows us to tune their capability of adsorption/desorption and catalysis. Therefore, a facile and inexpensive chemical-acid-etching approach has been developed to activate the carbon cloth as an electrode for supercapacitor. The capacitance of the acid-etched carbon cloth electrode can approach 5310 mF cm-2 at a current density of 5 mA cm-2 with remarkable recycling stability. The all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor delivered a high energy density of 4.27 mWh cm-3 at a power density of 1.32 W cm-3. Furthermore, this symmetric supercapacitor exhibited outstanding mechanical flexibility, and the capacity remained nearly unchanged after 1000 bending cycles.
