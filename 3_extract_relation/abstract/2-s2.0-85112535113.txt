Owing to the brisk development of flexible electronics and sensors, the introduction of miniaturized lightweight and portable smart electronic devices stimulate the interest in exploring and creating miniaturized energy storage systems such as interdigitated supercapacitor. In this regard, the design of such devices is an essential factor to offer flexibility, portability, and safety. This paper, therefore, aims to demonstrate the importance of optimizing the architecture of the interdigitated solid-state supercapacitor in order to provide good electrochemical performances. In this work, we propose a numerical approach to investigate the MSC structure based on low-cost and eco-friendly electrodes composed of carbon black and a biocompatible gel electrolyte based on polyvinyl alcohol. First, a 2D geometric model was studied with a fixed surface area and enumerated number of fingers then the width and the length of fingers are modified which was performed using a finite element method to optimize the best architecture in terms of performance. In the second part of this study, the electrochemical characteristics such as the specific capacitance and the energy density of the MSC have been calculated. The designed symmetric MSC device with 16, 6500 µm, 200 µm as the number of electrodes, length, and width, respectively, demonstrated the highest value of capacitance of about 1.3 mF/cm2 and highest energy density of about 0.22 mWh/cm2. All the results demonstrate that this kind of supercapacitor has versatile applications and can be used in reliable microelectronic devices.
