Developing suitable electrode material and electrolyte is critical for fabricating a flexible supercapacitor with large areal capacitance. Furthermore, the compatibility between electrode material and electrolyte is essential. Herein, a carbon cloth-carbon fiber-TiO2 (CC CF TiO2) based flexible electrode is designed and developed for the first time and tested electrochemically in various electrolytes. More importantly, the electrochemical studies performed in both half-cell and full-cell studies are discussed. The highest areal capacitance of 270 mF cm?2 is realized for CC CF TiO2 flexible electrode in 1 M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte at 10 mA cm?2 current density. Full-cell flexible supercapacitor fabricated with hydrogel polymer electrolyte demonstrates the maximum energy density and power density as 4.56 ?Wh cm?2 and 418.48 ?W cm?2 respectively. The attained values are highly encouraging in comparison to the old reports. The results obtained in this work demonstrate the potential of our fabricated flexible supercapacitor for next-generation wearable energy storage applications.
