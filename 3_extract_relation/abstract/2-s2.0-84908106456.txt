Energy storage devices have become more indispensable in our lives. Among various energy storage devices, supercapacitors have been considered as one of the most promising candidates. In terms of the components of supercapacitor, current collector plays a significant role in enhancing the performance of the supercapacitors. Here we report a novel current collector preparation method through depositing nickel nanocone arrays structure on stainless steel plates. The average height of the nanocones was âˆ¼800nm, and its aspect ratio was about 4, which greatly increased the surface area. Owing to its dislocation growth mechanism, the surface of nanocones was rough, which efficiently improved the adhesion with active materials. In order to demonstrate this novel current collector, manganese oxide (MnO2) was deposited on stainless steel with nickel nanocone arrays. Results showed that the specific capacitance of the nickel nanocone array supported MnO2 which was investigated in 0.5 M Na2SO4 was 351 F/g. It is worth mentioning that the preparation of the novel current collector can be fabricated in large-scale by roll-to-roll process, which greatly promotes the application of the novel current collector.
