This work presents the development of an electrolyte solution based on 1.2 M TEMA BF4 AN:EA (3:1) electrolyte mixture modified with diethyl ether (5–20 vol%), or toluene (5–20 vol%), or vinylene carbonate (0.5–5 vol%) ensuring stable operation of the supercapacitors (SC) in a wide temperature range from −68 °C to +60 °C. Supercapacitor cells with electrolytes of various volume ratios of components were investigated using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods. Specific conductivity values have been measured and compared with electrochemical impedance data. It was shown that the additives to the base electrolyte blend expand the operating temperature range of the SC cells by at least 7–8°, enabling its exploitation at lower temperatures (−68 °C). It has been established that the addition of 10 vol% of diethyl ether or toluene stabilizes the operation of the SC at −65 °C, demonstrating stability during long-term exposure. Vinylene carbonate additive most effectively stabilizes the work of the SC at high temperatures (+60 °C). Diethyl ether as an additive effectively promotes the operation of SC only at low temperatures (−68 °C), while at high temperatures, it leads to the degradation of SC.
