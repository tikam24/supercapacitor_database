The reasonable design of electrode materials with high electrochemical activity and stable structure after long cycles can effectively improve the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors. In this paper, Co-doped Ni3S2 supported on Ti3C2/Ni foam (Co-Ni3S2/Ti3C2/NF) composites were prepared using a feasible hydrothermal method. The composite materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results showed that the Co-Ni3S2/Ti3C2/NF materials had a three-dimensional network structure. Electrochemical performance tests were conducted for the Co-Ni3S2/Ti3C2/NF electrode. The prepared Co-Ni3S2/Ti3C2/NF electrode has good electrochemical performance with specific capacitance of 1457 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. At 10 A g−1, the specific capacity after 5000 cycles is 127.35% of the initial specific capacity. The asymmetric supercapacitor with Co-Ni3S2/Ti3C2/NF as the positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as the negative electrode has an energy density of 30.4 Wh kg−1 at power energy density of 0.8 kW kg−1. This strategy provides a useful method for the design of supercapacitor electrodes with excellent electrochemical performance coated with MXenes.
