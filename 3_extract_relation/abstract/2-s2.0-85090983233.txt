Non-noble-metal electrode materials with high durability and efficiency have become the frontiers of energy conversion and storage fields. However, conventional electrode materials often show high overpotential and low conductivity. To solve this problem, we fabricate a NiMoxCo2−x layered double hydroxide (LDH)/Ni foam (NF) product through a facile hydrothermal route. The as-prepared NiMo-Co-LDH/NF catalyst possesses an overpotential of 123 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at 10 mA cm−2 and 279 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 20 mA cm−2. The as obtained product exhibits excellent overall water splitting performances. Meanwhile, as the electrode material for supercapacitor, it delivers high specific capacitance and excellent cyclic performance. The asymmetric supercapacitor assembled with NiMoCo-LDH/NF//active carbon exhibits 93% of its initial capacity after 8000 cycles.
