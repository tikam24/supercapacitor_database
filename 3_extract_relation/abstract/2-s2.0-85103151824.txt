This paper presents a design scheme of distributed energy storage system (ESS) which is used to improve the automatic generation control. Based on the constraints of ESS and the manual of supercapacitor, the selection of supercapacitor methods are described in detail, and the common product combinations are listed. Because of the large number of energy storage units and output levels, half-bridge topology is advised which enables to save switching devices. Due to the high loss, insufficient advantages of carrier phase-shifting PWM and output distortion of nearest level modulation in ESS application, carrier disposition modulation is recommended and convenient to realize power-sharing under low switching loss. Based on carrier disposition modulation, voltage balance algorithm and grid-connected algorithm are designed, and detailed trigger block diagrams of each switch device are presented. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed design method is verified by Simulink simulation.
