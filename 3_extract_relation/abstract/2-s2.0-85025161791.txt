Conventional supercapacitors exhibit limitations that arise from various sources within the device such as the necessary incorporation of resistive additives to the electrode formulation. In the case of activated carbon (AC) electrodes, this constitutes the insulating binder, while for carbon nanotube (CNT) electrodes, the inclusion of appropriate surfactant is almost always necessary to promote stable dispersion for processing. This work discusses the use of surfactant-free and binder-free CNT electrodes for fabrication of supercapacitors. The performance characteristics from pouch cells containing such CNT electrodes in organic electrolytes were benchmarked against commercial-grade AC supercapacitor devices on both cell volume and cell weight bases. EDLC performance advantages realized from eliminating the additives of surfactant and binder were significantly lower a.c. impedance at low temperature operation (80% reduction at -30°C), higher capacitance retention after 100,000 cycles, and superior retention of capacitance at high temperature (95% of initial capacitance at 70°C) compared to commercial AC based EDLCs.
