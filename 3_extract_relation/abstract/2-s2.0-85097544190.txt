Double-shell NiCo2S4 were synthesized by self-template method using TAA and TU as sources, respectively. Among them, NiCo2S4 prepared by TAA delivers the highest specific capacitance (2064F/g, when the current density is 0.5A/g), better rate performance (1291F/g, when the current density is 20A/g) and good cycle stability. Further kinetic mechanism analysis shows that the surface-control and diffusion-control capacitance of NiCo2S4-TAA are both improved compared to NiCo2S4-TU. Through experimental analysis, NiCo2S4 synthesized by TAA is composed of smaller particles, which is beneficial to the diffusion of electrolyte ions in the electrochemical process. Since its good electrical conductivity and ion diffusion rate, NiCo2S4-TAA exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. Therefore, TAA is desirable sulfur source in this experiment condition.
