One of the main concerns when it comes to contributions to the carbon footprint is the consumption of fuel by vehicles, more specifically that of mining vehicles. One solution to this problem is replacing the combustion engine vehicles with electric vehicles. This also poses the problem of low power density. This paper proposes a solution of using supercapacitors and hybrid capacitors with the aim of investigating how they can affect the performance of electric vehicles. For this purpose, a background of fuel consumption and alternative solutions to the problem are discussed, a prototype was designed and built. It was found that when supercapacitors and hybrid capacitors were used in combination with the battery the system had a notably longer endurance.
