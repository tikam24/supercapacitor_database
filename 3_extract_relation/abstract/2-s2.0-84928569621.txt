Ordered mesoporous carbon film supporting vanadium oxide nanoparticles has been synthesized via ultrasound-assistant impregnation method with ordered mesoporous carbon C-FDU15 film as the host and V2O5 sol as the guest precursor. The hybrids exhibit type IV sorption isotherms with H2 hysteresis loop, indicating the well-retained characteristics of ordered mesoporous structure. The capacitance of the materials is enhanced with V2O5 loading. Particularly, the hybrids with 32.26 wt.% V2O5 loading yield an important capacitance of 128 F/g in 1 mol/L KNO3 electrolyte under a potential range from -0.6 V to 0.6 V. The improved specific capacitance of the hybrids is proposed to be the combination of the double-layer capacitance of ordered porous structure and the pseudocapacitance derived from V2O5.
