Multifunctional MoS2@PANI (polyaniline) pseudo-supercapacitor electrodes consisting of MoS2 thin nanosheets and PANI nanoarrays are fabricated via a large-scale approach. The superior capacitance retention is retained up to 91% after 4000 cycles and a high energy density of 106 Wh kg-1 is delivered at a power density of 106 kW kg-1.
