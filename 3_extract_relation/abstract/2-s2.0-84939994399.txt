The luminol-H2O2 system is widely applied in electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assays but has limited stability. We are presenting an alternative immunosensing strategy by making use of Au@Ag nanorods that mimic the enzyme peroxidase. It also makes use of the supercapacitive supporter NH4CoPO4 as a supporter substrate that facilitates ion movement due to its many nanogaps between the assembled nanoplates. It also plays a vital role for stabilizing the ECL signal of luminol. The immunosensor was constructed by first placing a chitosan film containing NH4CoPO4, Au@Ag and luminol on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE), and the immobilizing anti-CEA on its surface. ECL is generated via electrochemical reaction of luminol on the surface of the Au@Ag-luminol film in the presence of H2O2. The assay was evaluated with respect to effects of pH value, time and temperature of incubation, specificity, reproducibility, and stability in a lab setting. A linear relationship between ECL intensity and CEA concentration is found for the 0.1 pg · mL−1 to 380 ng · mL−1 range, and the lower detection limit is as low as 30 fg · mL−1. In our perception, this immunoassay has a large scope in that numerous other immunoassays will become feasible by using other antibodies and, possibly, aptamers. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
