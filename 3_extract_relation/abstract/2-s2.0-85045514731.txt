SnS2 is an emerging candidate for an electrode material because of the considerable interlayer spaces in its crystal structures and the large surface area. SnS2 as a photocatalyst and in lithium ion batteries has been reported. On the other hand, there are only a few reports of their supercapacitor applications. In this study, sheetlike SnS2 (SL-SnS2), flowerlike SnS2 (FL-SnS2), and ellipsoid-like SnS2 (EL-SnS2) were fabricated via a facile solvothermal route using different types of solvents. The results suggested that the FL-SnS2 exhibited better capacitive performance than the SL-SnS2 and EL-SnS2, which means that the morphology has a significant effect on the electrochemical reaction. The FL-SnS2 displayed higher supercapacitor performance with a high capacity of approximately âˆ¼431.82 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g. The remarkable electrochemical performance of the FL-SnS2 could be attributed to the large specific surface area and better average pore size. These results suggest that a suitable solvent is appropriate for the large-scale construction of SnS2 with different morphologies and also has huge potential in the practical applications of high-performance supercapacitors.
