A well⁃designed cobalt⁃based metal organic framework (Co⁃MOF) derived NiCo layered double hydroxides (NiCo⁃LDH) three⁃dimensional porous nanostructures has been fabricated on carbon cloth (CC) by the ion etching / exchange reaction method. The morphology and structure of the synthesized samples have been characterized by X⁃ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X⁃ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As an electrode, the optimal NiCo⁃LDH shows a high specific capacity of 226.3 mA·h / g at 1 A / g. The hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) based on NiCo⁃LDH electrode and activated carbon (AC) achieves a specific energy of 27.39 W·h / kg with excellent cycling stability (capacity retention of 93.5% after 5000 cycles).
