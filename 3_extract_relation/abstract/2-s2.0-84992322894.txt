Fe2O3 metal oxide nanoparticles are synthesized by electrodeposition method on stainless steel substrate. The crystal structure and surface morphological studies of the obtained metal oxide thin film are carried out by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) respectively. The electrochemical properties of Fe2O3 thin film like Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Galvonostatic Charge-Discharge (GCD) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) are studied in a bath of 0.5 M Na2SO4 as electrolyte. The observed specific capacitance shows improved values 135 Fg-1 at 5 mVs-1 scan rate. The electrochemical stability of Fe2O3 electrode is investigated using cyclic voltammetry for 1000 cycles at a scan rate 50 mVs-1. The Fe2O3 electrode exhibits superior cycling stability with only 4-5% capacitance loss after one thousand cycles. The values of specific power and specific energy of Fe2O3 electrode obtained from Galvonostatic charge discharge studies are 2250 W.kg-1 and 63.15 Wh.kg-1 respectively at current density 1 A/g. From all the electrochemical properties of Fe2O3 electrode, it indicates that it will be promising electrode material for supercapacitor application.
