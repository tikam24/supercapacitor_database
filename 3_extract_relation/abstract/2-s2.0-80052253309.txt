Clew-like α-MnO2 nanostructrues have been synthesized via a controlled crystallization growth method. The as-obtained samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy and N2 adsorption-desorption. Results show that the clew-like α-MnO2 exhibits a mesoporous characteristic and the morphologies of clew-like α-MnO2 are made up of interleaving nanoplates. The pore size distribution of the product is uniform. The electrochemical properties of the synthesized clew-like α-MnO2 shows 272.5 F g-1 specific capacitance in 1 mol L-1 Na2SO4 solution at 2mV s-1 scan rate and less 2% capacitance loss after 800cycles at 10 mV s-1 scan rate. The clew-like a-MnO2 with good electrochemical performance can be a promising candidate as supercapacitor materials. © 2011 IEEE.
