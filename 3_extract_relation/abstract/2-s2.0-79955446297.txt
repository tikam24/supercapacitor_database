In recent years, ionic liquids have attracted considerable interest in batteries because of their unusual properties, such as high thermal stability, high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical window, negligible vapor pressure and nonflammability, etc. In this paper, the recent research advances of key technologies on the application of ionic liquids in batteries are reviewed, especially on the results of our research team focus on ionic liquid-based functional electrolytes for lithium secondary battery, supercapacitor and fuel cell. Furthermore, the current problems as well as the corresponding research directions are discussed, and the possible application prospects are also proposed.
