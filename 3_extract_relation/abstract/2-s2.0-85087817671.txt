The state-of-the-art article presents concepts of nanobelt nanofiller, inimitable properties of derived polymeric nanocomposite, applications, and outlook on challenges to gain next generation high-performance materials. Nanobelt is a one-dimensional nanostructured nanomaterial. Owing to minuscule size and high surface area, nanobelt possesses unique structural, optical, electronic, mechanical, and thermal characteristics. Nanobelt exists in various forms such as carbon nanobelt, polymer nanobelt, and inorganic. These nanobelts have been used to develop polymer/nanobelt nanocomposites. Homogeneous dispersion of nanobelt in polymer matrices is desirable to enhance the characteristics of polymer/nanobelt nanocomposite. Consequently, innovations in design, fabrication, and properties of various polymer/nanobelt nanocomposite are summarized. Applications of polymer/nanobelt nanocomposite are reviewed for Li-ion battery, supercapacitor, sensor, membrane, and biomedical arenas.
