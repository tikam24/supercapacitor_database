Herein, a hydrothermal electrodeposition method was developed to synthesize MnO2 interlinked nanowires on carbon fabric (CF). Facile chemical vapour deposition (CVD)-polymerization was subsequently employed to deposit polypyrrole (PPy) films on MnO2 nanowires to construct a hierarchical PPy@MnO2 structure on CF (PPy@MnO2@CF). This unique 1D structure is beneficial due to its high electrical conductivity, structure stabilization and fast electrochemical kinetics. The PPy@MnO2@CF showed a maximum areal capacitance of 1.24 F cm−2 at a current density of 1 mA cm−2. A flexible solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (FSASC) was assembled using PPy@MnO2@CF and Fe2O3@CF as positive and negative electrodes, respectively. The FSASC delivered a maximal energy density of 1.93 mWh cm−3 at a power density of 9.8 mW cm−3 and a long term life with 92.6% of initial capacitance after 10,000 cycles. In addition, the device exhibited exceptional flexibility and excellent mechanical stability after a 200-bending-cycle test, suggesting that it is close to practical application in flexible electronics.
