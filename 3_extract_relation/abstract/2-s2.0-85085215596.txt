The application of regenerative braking energy storage system is one of the development directions of rail transit energy traction technology, which conforms to the concept of energy saving and environmental protection. In order to carry out relevant research and experiments, the electrical transformation of the rail transit test line of Tongji University was carried out. Based on the analysis of the main wiring of traction substation, a scheme of adding a new DC feeder cabinet on the DC side is proposed, and the electrical components in the cabinet are designed. At last, a simulation model of lithium-ion supercapacitor energy storage system is established based on the transformed test line. The simulation results show that the transformed rail transit test line has a good ability of energy-storage-related experiments, and the expected goal has been achieved.
