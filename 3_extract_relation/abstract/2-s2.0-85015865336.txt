As the fi rst atomic-thick two-dimensional crystalline material, graphene has continuously created a wonder land in materials science within the past decade. A number of methods have been developed for preparation and functionalization of single-layered graphene nanosheets (GNS), which are essential building blocks for the bottom-up architecture of various graphene based nanomaterials. Th e assembly of functionalized GNS into three-dimensional (3D) porous graphene networks represents a novel approach. Resulting 3D porous graphene materials posses unique physicochemical properties such as large surface areas, good conductivity and mechanical strength, high thermal stability and desirable fl exibility, which altogether makes this new type of porous materials be highly attractive for a wide range of applications. In this chapter, we will cover some crucial aspects of porous graphene networked materials based on the accomplishments recently reported. Th e chapter will include: (1) a brief introduction to graphene and its nanocomposites, (2) the major methods to assemble 3D porous graphene networks, (3) structural characteristics of 3D porous graphene, (4) some typical examples of their applications in sensors and energy devices, and (5) conclusions, remaining challenges and outlooks.
