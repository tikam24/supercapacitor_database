Supercapacitors are finding their way into an increasing number of applications for short-term energy storage. One such application is a power ride-through circuit, in which a backup energy source cuts in and powers the load when main power supply fails for a short time. Features that make a good choice for power ride-through applications include small package size, programmable charging current, automatic cell voltage balancing, low drain current on the supercapacitors and a, low noise, constant current charger. Two parameters of the supercapacitor that are critical to an application are cell voltage and initial leakage current. The manufacturers of supercapacitors rate their leakage current after 100 hours of applied voltage while the initial leakage current in those first 100 hours may be as much as 50 times the specified leakage current.
