In the present work, we study Ag doping effect on the specific capacitance of Polypyrrole/Polyacrylic Acid (PPy/PAA). Ag incorporated films were prepared by simple chemical route. Fourier transform-infrared and Fourier transform-Raman techniques were used for the phase identification. Surface morphology of the films was examined by Field Emission scanning electron microscopy and revealed granular structure for PPY, attached granules for PPy/PAA and granules with bright spots of Ag particles for the PPy/PAA/Ag films. The supercapacitive behavior of the electrodes was tested in three electrode system with 0.1 M H2SO4 electrolyte by using cyclic voltammetry. The highest specific capacitance value 226 Fg-1 was observed for the PPy/PAA/Ag film. Â© 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.
