Abstract: The formation of CoMoO4 anisotropic nanostructures has been studied with a combination of programmed co-precipitation of metal hydroxides and the hydrothermal method. The thermal behavior, phase composition, and microstructure features of the obtained nanopowder have been investigated. Using a set of physicochemical methods of analysis, it has been shown that the proposed synthesis conditions make it possible to form a single-phase nanodispersed (average CSR size of about 30 Â± 3 nm) oxide with a monoclinic spinel-type structure (space group C2/m) that does not contain impurity inclusions.
