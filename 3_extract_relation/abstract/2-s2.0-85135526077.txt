Wood has developed pore structure and good mechanical properties. The electrode and electrolyte materials prepared from wood have excellent electrochemical properties, which has become a research hotspot. In this paper, the research progress of wood in the field of electrochemistry in recent years was reviewed, with emphasis on the preparation methods of wood-based electrode and electrolyte materials and their applications in electrochemical sensors, supercapacitors and batteries. The mechanism of wood improving the electrochemical properties of electrode and electrolyte materials is analyzed. It is pointed out that the developed pore structure of wood can effectively adsorb and transport electrolyte ions, which is the key to endow the materials with excellent electrochemical properties. Finally, the problems existing in the application of wood in the field of electrochemistry are summarized, and it is proposed that we should deepen the design and research of wood pore structure and pore morphology, make efficient use of wood microstructure and enrich wood modification schemes in the future.
