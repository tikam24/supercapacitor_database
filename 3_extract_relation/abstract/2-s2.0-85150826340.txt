Carbon based materials have revolutionized the energy storage landscape. Graphene based materials in Li-ion hybrid supercapacitor (LHS) is an upcoming concept for fast charging applications. Herein, we report development of a dual component hybrids with an open porous geometry using Ni-Fe layered double hydroxide (LDH) self assembled on graphene shell with spherical graphene spiral network as anode and superlong graphene nanoscrolls as cathode. 2D structural anisotropy arising from orthogonally aligned crystalline Ni-Fe LDH lamellae over its spherical heterophase interface reveal exciting prospects as a high-performance anode. The driving forces for nanosheet aggregation are restrained efficiently and heterophase reinforced interface layer maximizes the interlayer active site interactions for better ionic conduction. The hybrid anode delivers a stable discharge capacity of 1541 mAhg−1 at a current density of 0.1 Ag−1. Further, scrolled graphene sheets synthesized from anisotropic solidification process served as a cathode, delivering a stable capacity of ≈ 89 mAhg−1. A LHS device prototype fabricated using these architectures offers excellent energy density of ≈ 190 W h kg−1 and maximum power density of ≈ 9.6 kW kg−1. The device is then integrated with a solar panel to store intermittent energy supply which illustrates its true potential for practical applications.
