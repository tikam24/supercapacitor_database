A superior integrated electrode has been devised for high-performance supercapacitor application by developing asymmetric Core@shell NiCo2O4@MnO2 nanocomposites and its performance was further enhanced with MWCNT. The XRD, FTIR and Raman spectra was performed initially for their phase identification and structural information. The HR-FESEM micrographs and EDS analysis confirmed the heterogeneous core@shell morphology of NiCo2O4@MnO2 and MWCNT blended NiCo2O4@MnO2 with their true stoichiometrical ratios. The noteworthy specific capacitance (824 F g-1) was observed with excellent rate capability for NiCo2O4@MnO2 nanocomposites and intensified up to 1048 F g-1 with the incorporation of MWCNT complex at current density 5 A g-1. The MWCNT blended NiCo2O4@MnO2 supercapacitor demonstrated a remarkable energy density of 18.1 Wh-kg−1 at maximum power density 2.9 kW-Kg−1 with compared to NiCo2O4@MnO2 nanocomposites. The outstanding cyclic stability with capacitance retention (90.83%) after 5000 cycles was entrenched for MWCNT integrated NiCo2O4@MnO2 based supercapacitor electrode than its pristine counterpart (82.6%) and it recommends its potential application as supercapacitor electrode materials.
