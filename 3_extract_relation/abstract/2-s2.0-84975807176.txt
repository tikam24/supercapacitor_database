Manganese molybdate is highly significant to improve its energy density to meet the application requirement of hybrid vehicles and renewable energy systems. Here, we report a binder-free ultrathin manganese molybdate (MnMoO4·nH2O) nanosheets/nickel foam electrode for high energy density asymmetric supercapacitor by a facile one-step hydrothermal method. This binder-free electrode demonstrates a very high specific capacitance of 1271 F g-1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1. After 2000 charge/discharge cycles, 84.5% of the initial specific capacitance (945.6 F g-1) is still maintained. Further SEM, TEM and XPS results suggest that this performance degradation can be ascribed to the mechanical expansion of MnMoO4 during the ion insertion/removal process or the dissolution of some MnMoO4 during the charge/discharge cycles. An aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor using the MnMoO4·nH2O as the cathode with an activated carbon anode can deliver an energy density of 31.6 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 935 W kg-1. The remarkable performance of binder-free MnMoO4·nH2O on Ni foam suggest their potential use as positive electrode material for high performance supercapacitors.
