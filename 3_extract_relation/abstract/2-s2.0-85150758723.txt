The development and efficient utilization of clean energy, as well as reducing the harm of electromagnetic pollution, are critical concerns in modern society. Disclosing the relationship between material microstructure and properties through various characterization techniques considerably contributes to the systematic research, production, and application of advanced materials. Supercapacitors and microwave absorbers might be benefit simultaneously from same hierarchical composites due to the merits of multi-component and multi-dimensional synergistic effects. A microstructure of NiCoO2/GO/CF hierarchical composite has been inspired by lush elm trees and constructed. By combining hydrothermal and annealing processes, the hierarchical nickel‑cobalt oxide/graphene oxide/carbon-foam (NiCoO2/GO/CF) composite was synthesized. The elm-like microstructure is found to be conducive not only to electrochemical kinetic processes but also to electromagnetic wave incidence and triggering of various loss modes. The NiCoO2/GO/CF exhibits a high specific capacitance of 826.2 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and long cycling stability of 93.1% after 10,000 cycles at 10 A g−1. And this composite exhibits an ultra-wide effective absorption bandwidth of 13.11 GHz (RL < -10 dB at 5.5 mm; the ratio of prepared composite to paraffin wax is 1:9).
