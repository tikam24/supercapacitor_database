Abstract In this work, we present a facile approach to synthesize nitrogen-doped porous carbon materials via a two-step fabrication process using the stem bark of broussonetia papyrifera (BP) as the biomass precursor. Firstly, the BP stem bark is hydrothermally treated in a KOH aqueous solution. After filtration and drying, the hydrothermal product is directly subjected to simultaneous pyrolysis and activation, giving nitrogen-doped porous carbon materials. The morphology, structure and textural properties of the carbon materials are investigated by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, N<inf>2</inf> sorption isotherms, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The obtained porous carbon exhibits a high BET surface area of 1212 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> and an average pore size of 3.8 nm. Such porous carbon shows outstanding capacitive performance (320 F g<sup>-1</sup> at 0.5 A g<sup>-1</sup>), good rate capacitive behavior, and excellent cycling stability due to the synergistic effect of N, O-doped species, indicating a great potential for supercapacitors.
