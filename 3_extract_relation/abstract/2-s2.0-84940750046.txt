A new type of supercapacitor is fabricated with carbon nanotube (CNT) composite conductive paper as electrode materials. The paper fiber and carbon nanotubes are fully mixed and filtrated to form conductive papers. The conductive papers are characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and four-point probe resistance meter. The two-electrodes supercapacitor cells are constructed with conductive paper as both electrodes and 1 mol/L ANEt4NBF4 as electrolyte. The testing results show that the maximum specific capacitance can reach 7.5 F/g with paper/CNT mass ratio of 1/1. The capacitance can keep 95% with 1.8 F·g-1 after 5000 cycles with paper/CNT mass ratio of 1/3 and the surface resistivity decreases to 4.7 Ω/sq.
