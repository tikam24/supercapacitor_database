This article reports the synthesis, characterization and supercapacitative properties of dodecyl benzenesulphonic acid (DBSA) doped polyaniline(PAni) and its magnetite composites. The synthesized composites are characterized by Uv-Vis, FT-IR, XRD, SEM, electrochemical methods and are evaluated as electrode material for supercapacitor applications. The composites are partially soluble in methanol and are highly dispersible in water. The pristine polyaniline (PAni-DBSA) showed a specific capacitance of 160 F/g, whereas its magnetite(3.8 wt %) composite (C1) and the symmetrical capacitor derived from C1 showed enhanced capacitance of 228 F/g and 180 F/g respectively, at 1 mA/cm 2.
