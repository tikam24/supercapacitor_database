We reported a controlled synthesis method to obtained carbon spheres with tunable geometry under low ZnCl2 aqueous solution conditions using polytriazine as a precursor. The polytriazine precursor was polymerized by mixing/reaction of 2,6-diaminopyridine and formaldehyde in the presence of a diluted ZnCl2 aqueous system. The obtained nanospheres were then decomposed to adulterate nitrogen porous carbon nanospheres (N-PCNSs) by the decomposition and blistering process at high temperature by degrees. ZnCl2 worked as a solid-template and played the role of a stabilizing and foaming agent in the reaction. The as-prepared N-PCNSs with controllable spherical geometry, large micro-/mesoporous volume and high nitrogen content (âˆ¼8.5 wt %) were employed in electric double-layer capacitors that have a good specific capacitance (636 F/g at 1 A/g) and are long lasting. Besides, the N-PCNS delivered a high energy density of 22.1 Wh/Kg at a power density of 500 W/kg.
