Herein, we fabricated a nitrogen-doped porous graphene/nanometer-sized carbide-derived carbon (NPG/nCDC) composite. In this architecture, the nCDC with a hierarchical pore structure is used as spacer to inhibit the agglomeration of NPG ensuring the in-plane diffusion paths for electrolyte ions and has contribution to the specific surface area and the pore structure of the composite as well. The nano-sized pores existing on the NPG sheets can provide the cross-plane diffusion paths for electrolyte ions. Furthermore, the nitrogen doping to NPG can further enhance the capacitive performance of the composite. Benefiting from these advantages, the NPG/nCDC composites exhibit outstanding supercapacitive performance. Its specific capacitance is up to 336 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 in 6 mol L−1 KOH electrolyte, and 99.3% capacitance can be maintained even after 10,000 cycles, demonstrating the great potential as the electrode material for supercapacitors.
