Ordered mesoporous NiCo2O4 nanowires electrodes were prepared using SBA-15 as template through a hydrothermal impregnation method. X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption-desorption and transmission electron microscopy were used to characterize the structure and morphology of the SBA-15 and NiCo2O4. The pseudocapacitive performance of the samples were tested by electrochemical workstation. The results demonstrate that the ordered mesoporous NiCo2O4 electrode material exhibit excellent pseudocapacitance. The specific capacitances were calculated to be 1079.6 F g-1, 1012 F g-1, 943.9 F g-1 and 820 F g-1 at current densities of 1 A g-1, 2 A g-1, 4 A g-1 and 10 A g-1, respectively. The cycling stability during the 1000 cycles was more than 96%. Therefore, the ordered mesoporous NiCo2O4 electrodes materials are an excellent supercapacitor electrode materials.
