A current-sensorless Maximum Power Tracking (MPT) system is proposed for use with thermoelectric generators, employing supercapacitor energy storage. A Boost converter is used for the purpose and a control method is presented that enables the operation of the converter at maximum power with variable source voltage and variable output voltage, therefore suitable for supercapacitor charging. Experimental results from a digitally-controlled prototype have verified the validity of the analysis and the effectiveness of the MPT system. Â© 2012 IEEE.
