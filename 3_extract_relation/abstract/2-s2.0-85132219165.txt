Transition metals nitride, carbide and carbonitride (MXenes) as members of two-dimensional (2D) materials inherit high metallic conductivity, superior hydrophilicity, adjustable interlayer spacing and abundant surface functional groups, thus have attracted widespread attention in the field of energy storage system (ESS). However, the inherent limitations of low capacity, unsatisfactory yield and self-stacking hinder the practical application of MXene. In order to ameliorate the above-mentioned shortcomings, a large number of strategies have been proposed. In this review, we summarize the recent research progress of MXene-based materials applied in ESS, mainly focusing on the preparation strategies, theoretical calculation, as well as electrochemical performance analysis. Moreover, the key challenges and opportunities for MXene-based materials in energy storage devices are also highlighted.
