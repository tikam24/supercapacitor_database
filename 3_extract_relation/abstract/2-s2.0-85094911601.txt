Transient-surge absorption capability of small/low cost supercapacitors (SCs) is already published. SCASA is a patented technique that led to the development of a high performance commercial surge protector which adheres to UL-1449 3rd edition test protocols. The commercial implementation comprises a coupled-inductor, two metal oxide varistors (MOVs) and a SC sub-circuit. This paper presents a permeance based model for the coupled-inductor of SCASA topology in predicting its operation under contrasting voltage conditions. In validating the circuit operation with regard to its surge absorption capability versus 50 Hz AC power transfer, a lightning surge simulator (LSS-6230) was utilized. We discuss this comparison based on the standard IEEE C62.41 surge waveforms up to a maximum of 6.6 kV.
