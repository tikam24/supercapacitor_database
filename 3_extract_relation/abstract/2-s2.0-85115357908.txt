In the present study, we introduce a simple chemical method to synthesize p-phenylenediamine (PPD) as an efficient material for functionalizing graphene oxide. Functionalized reduced graphene oxide Aerogel with PPD (PPD-rGO Aerogel) is used for improving electrochemical performance of polyorthoaminophenol electroactive film. The structural morphology and microstructure analysis of the materials used in this work are performed by different surface analyses. The composite electrode's electrochemical behavior is studied using an acidic solution in cyclic voltammetry (CV) and charge/discharge system. The POAP/PPD-rGO composite electrode shows a Cs of 1180 F/g at 1.0 A/g current density. Our results provide an improved conductive polymer composite film with high active surface area, ease of synthesis and high cycling stability for supercapacitors (SCs).
