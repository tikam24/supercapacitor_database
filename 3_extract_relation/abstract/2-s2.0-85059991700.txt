The increase in energy demand and reduction in conventional resource of energy has enforce the use of renewable energy sources. The Photo Voltaic is the most popular source of energy in the group of renewable energy sources. The addition of Battery Energy Storage (BES) has establish the availability of PV power for 24Ã—7. In this paper the control strategy of PV and BES with and without SC(Super Capacitor) is simulated for DC load. The control strategy is tested for various operation strategy of PV-Battery and PV-Battery-SC for charging/discharging with variable irradiation condition of PV. The performance of controller is simulated in MATLAB/ Simulink environment.
