Two-dimensional (2D) layered metal carbides materials called MXenes (e.g., Ti3C2) are significantly attentioned as electrode material for lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) because of its large surface-to-volume ratio and ultra-high electronic conductivity. Whereas, as anode electrode material, the performance and application prospects of Ti3C2 are severely restricted to its lower theoretical capacity. In this work, a straightforward and effective strategy to surmount the restrictions was developed to combine layered Ti3C2 nanosheets with dual Co/Zn metalâ€“organic framework (MOF) polyhedrons derivatives through electrostatic assembly. Co3O4/ZnO polyhedrons could prevent the stacking of Ti3C2 nanosheets and provide prominent lithium storage capacity. Furthermore, the advanced structure of Ti3C2@Co3O4/ZnO as anode material could provide short Li+ paths, large electrolyte channels and excellent structural stability to enhance the electrochemical performance for LICs. As a result, the prepared Ti3C2@Co3O4/ZnO composite exhibited a specific capacity of 585.7 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g, and the electrode still delivered a capacity of 229 mAh/g at 2 A/g after 1000 cycles with 93% capacity retention in lithium-ion half cell. In addition, by assembling with activated carbon (AC) as cathode and Ti3C2@Co3O4/ZnO as anode, the LIC revealed an ultra-high energy density of 196.8 Wh/kg at a power density of 174.9 W/kg, and delivered a high energy output of 87.5 Wh/kg even at a power density of 3500 W/kg. And its capacitance retention reaches 75% after 6000 cycles at 2 A/g. The advanced structure, handy preparation, and outstanding performance of layered carbon-based material Ti3C2@hollow polyhedrons composite might provide promising applications in LICs.
