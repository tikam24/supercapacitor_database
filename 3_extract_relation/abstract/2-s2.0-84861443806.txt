We have successfully fabricated an asymmetric supercapacitor with high energy and power densities using graphene hydrogel (GH) with 3D interconnected pores as the negative electrode and vertically aligned MnO 2 nanoplates on nickel foam (MnO 2-NF) as the positive electrode in a neutral aqueous Na 2SO 4 electrolyte. Because of the desirable porous structure, high specific capacitance and rate capability of GH and MnO 2-NF, complementary potential window of the two electrodes, and the elimination of polymer binders and conducting additives, the asymmetric supercapacitor can be cycled reversibly in a wide potential window of 02.0 V and exhibits an energy density of 23.2 Wh kg 1 with a power density of 1.0 kW kg 1. Energy density of the asymmetric supercapacitor is significantly improved in comparison with those of symmetric supercapacitors based on GH (5.5 Wh kg 1) and MnO 2-NF (6.7 Wh kg 1). Even at a high power density of 10.0 kW kg 1, the asymmetric supercapacitor can deliver a high energy density of 14.9 Wh kg 1. The asymmetric supercapacitor also presents stable cycling performance with 83.4% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles. Â© 2012 American Chemical Society.
