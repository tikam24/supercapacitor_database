This paper presents results related to the implementation of model-based fault detection and diagnosis procedures into a typical PLC controller. To construct the mathematical model and to implement the PID regulator, a non-integer order differential/integral calculation was used. Such an approach allows for more exact control of the process and more precise modelling. This is very crucial in model-based diagnostic methods. The theoretical results were verified on a real object in the form of a supercapacitor connected to a PLC controller by a dedicated electronic circuit controlled directly from the PLC outputs.
