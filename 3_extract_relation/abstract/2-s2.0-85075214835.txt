This work presents the using of Hybrid power source for electric vehicle four wheels drive, composed of a proton electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) as the main energy source, and a supercapacitor (SC) as an auxiliary power source. The fuel cell PEMFC has a main weak point it is slow dynamics, because to prevent fuel starvation problems must limited the fuel cell current slope in order, to ameliorate its performance and lifetime. The supercapacitor can complement the slow output power of the main source, to produce the compatibility and performance characteristics needed in a propulsion system, because it has a very fast response and high specific. DC-DC boost converter connected to the fuel cell source to ensure the input voltage of four electric induction motors controlled by the direct torque control based space vector modulation (DTC-SVM), and a supercapacitor connected via bidirectional dc converter to the output voltage of the boost converter, to give the overshoot power and the fast response power. The simulation results of powers behaviour of fuel cell, SC and the demanded power by electric vehicle are given and interpreted, then simulation results of speed, electromagnetic torque and current in different phases.
