Supercapacitor is an energy storage device with excellent performance which has been studied in recent years. Biomass-based porous carbon materials are widely used as electrode materials for supercapacitors because of their good pore structure and electrical conductivity. A unique nanoscale pompon with structured porous carbon as core was synthesized by a two-stage activation of H3PO4-K2C2O4 combined with hydrothermal self-assembly in this research. Results showed that the specific surface area of the hierarchical porous carbon sample was up to 1608.1 m2/g with the mesoporous ratio of 54.26%. The self-doped Co-Ni elements were successfully entered into the channel of carbon core and then the self-assembled nano pompon epidermis was formed. Interleaving nanorods with unique characteristics as dispersion at the bottom and aggregation at the top were evenly grown on the surface of the pompon, forming a 3D network structure with a mass of cavities, which brought with excellent faradaic pseudocapacitance of electrode materials. The energy density and power density of the asymmetric supercapacitor assembled by nano pompom and porous carbon reach 30.4 Wh/kg and 1367.1 W/kg respectively.
