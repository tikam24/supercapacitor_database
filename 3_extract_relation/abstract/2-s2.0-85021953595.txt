Complementary features of batteries and supercapacitors can be effectively used in a hybrid energy storage system (HESS).The utilization of the HESS in electric vehicles (EVs) offers many advantages, such as efficient regenerative braking, battery safety, and improved vehicle acceleration. In this paper, a new regenerative braking system (RBS) is proposed for EVs with HESS and driven by brushless DC (BLDC) motor. During regenerative braking, the BLDC acts as a generator. Hence, by using an appropriate switching algorithm, the dc-link voltage is boosted and the energy is transferred to the supercapacitor or the battery through the inverter. The harvested energy can be utilized to improve the vehicle acceleration and/or keep the battery pack from deep discharging while driving uphill. To provide a reliable and smooth brake, braking force distribution is realized through an artificial neural network. Simultaneously, the braking current is adjusted by a PI controller for constant torque braking. To evaluate the performance of the proposed RBS, different simulations and experiments are carried out. The results confirm high capability of the proposed RBS.
