NiPS3 electrodes usually suffer from aggregation large volume changes, low electrical conductivity, and huge volume changes in bulk phase. These significantly decrease the electron transport efficiency, resulting in the sluggish reaction kinetics of supercapacitors during cycling. Herein, we designed and produced hollow porous nitrogen-doped carbon capsules (N-Cc), which are used as a conductive matrix and dispersed growing substrate for NiPS3. Finally, NiPS3 nanosheets were successfully grown in situ on N-Cc by chemical vapor deposition method. The specific capacitance of the highly integrated N-Cc@NiPS3-1.0 electrode structure is notable, at 590 C g−1. The assembled N-Cc@NiPS3-1.0//AC asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) delivers an energy density of 55.42 Wh kg−1 at power density of 750.05 W kg−1 and an outstanding stability with 89.9 % of retention rate for 8000 cycles. It should be noted that the performance of the N-Cc@NiPS3-1.0 here surpasses most of previously reported similar materials.
