Activated carbons (ACs) derived from locally available bioresources could be considered eco-friendly, sustainable, and low cost candidates in energy storage applications. In this work, we prepared AC from locally available koiralo flower (Bauhinia variegata L) from Nepal and studied its potential in supercapacitor applications. The synthesized koiralo flower-based activated carbon (AC-KF) possessed a three-dimensional (3D) morphology with interconnected porous structures. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and Raman spectroscopy confirmed the successful conversion of the flower to carbon. The electrochemical performance of the as-prepared AC was studied in a three-electrode system using a 6 M KOH electrolyte. The AC-KF exhibited a high specific capacitance of 165 F/g at the current density of 0.5 A/g and cyclic stability of 86 % after 5000 runs. Considering the potential benefits of using locally available bio-waste-based activated carbons as supercapacitor electrode materials, it may be a low-cost and sustainable option.
