Metallic cobalt/carbon composites were synthesized by metal-organic framework as precursor via a facile method in the paper. The obtained cobalt nanoparticles are 5-10 nm in size and anchor on carbon homogeneously. The results indicate that metallic cobalt particles have excellent dispersion feature on the surface of carbon. The electrochemical performance of metallic cobalt/carbon composites was characterized by Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests. The specific capacitance of the composite material is up to 144.5 F g-1 at current density of 0.5 A g-1 with a capacitance retention rate of 96.5% at current density of 2 A g-1. The results suggest that synergistic performance can be achieved by combining metallic cobalt and carbon, which inherits the overall system with enhanced electrochemical performance.
