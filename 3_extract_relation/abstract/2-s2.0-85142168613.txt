Curved graphene-nanoribbons@MoS2 hybrid electrode is designed with a hierarchical structure and employed as an electrode for high-performance supercapacitors. Molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) was prepared via hydrothermal method. The XRD result of MoS2 showed hexagonal phase. Hummer's method and reduction process lead to the unzipping of MWCNTs to curved graphene nanoribbons (CGNs). The CGNs were confirmed by the 2θ value, which was located at 26.05° and it was shifted to 23.2°. As prepared CGNs@MoS2 electrode shows better performance and delivered a high specific capacitance of 282F/g @1 A/g also it delivered 78% of specific capacitance over 5000 cycles at a current density of 10 A/g.
