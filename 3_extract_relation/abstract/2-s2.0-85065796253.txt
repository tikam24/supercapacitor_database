Supercapacitors are attracting much attention in sensor, military and space applications due to their excellent thermal stability and non-explosion. The ionic liquid is more thermally stable than other electrolytes and can be used as a high temperature electrolyte, but it is not easy to realize a high temperature energy device because the separator shrinks at high temperature. Here, we report a study on electrochemical supercapacitors using a composite electrolyte film that does not require a separator. The composite electrolyte is composed of thermoplastic polyurethane, ionic liquid and fumed silica nanoparticles, and it acts as a separator as well as an electrolyte. The silica nanoparticles at the optimum mass concentration of 4wt% increase the ionic conductivity of the composite electrolyte and shows a low interfacial resistance. The 5 wt% polyurethane in the composite electrolyte exhibits excellent electrochemical properties. At 175 Â°C, the capacitance of the supercapacitor using our free standing composite electrolyte is 220 F/g, which is 25 times higher than that at room temperature. This study has many potential applications in the electrolyte of next generation energy storage devices.
