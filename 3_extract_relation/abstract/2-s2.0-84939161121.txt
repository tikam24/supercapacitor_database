In this paper, we studied the VOPO4·2H2O as an electrode material for supercapacitors. A systematic comparison of VOPO4·2H2O prepared by reflux and hydrothermal methods was carried out through detailed analyses that included power X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Their electrochemical performances were also investigated by using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Meanwhile, we proposed a possible charge storage mechanism on the VOPO4·2H2O electrode surface. The material synthesized by reflux method had better performance in the capacitance than that by hydrothermal method, and its specific capacitance was up to 202 F/g at 2 mV/s. A total of 67.4 % of capacitance was maintained for the VOPO4·2H2O synthesized by reflux method when current density changed from 0.2 to 2 A/g, much higher than those obtained from the hydrothermal-synthesized VOPO4·2H2O supercapacitor of 42.5 %. The energy density of VOPO4·2H2O supercapacitor synthesized by reflux method was 18.7 Wh/kg at 290 W/kg and maintained 6.2 Wh/kg at 1,421 W/kg, much higher than the hydrothermal-synthesized VOPO4·2H2O supercapacitor. Our work confirms that VOPO4·2H2O is a potential electrode material for supercapacitors.
