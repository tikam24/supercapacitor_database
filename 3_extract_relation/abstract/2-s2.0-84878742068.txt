A hard-soft dual templates method has been developed for the first time to prepare porous carbons by the direct carbonization of phenol formaldehyde resins (PFs), Zn(NO<inf>3</inf>)<inf>2</inf>·6H<inf>2</inf>O and polyvinyl butyral (PVB) at 1000 °C under Ar gas, in which PFs serve as the carbon source. More importantly, Zn(NO<inf>3</inf>)<inf>2</inf>·6H<inf>2</inf>O and PVB acting as hard and soft template, respectively, can be readily removed through the evaporation process, resulting in pure carbon without any post-treatment, commonly employed. The PF-Zn-PVB-1:5:1 sample has a total BET surface area of 864 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, and a total pore volume of 0.76 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>. An electrode based on the porous carbons exhibits the high specific capacitances of 174.7 F g<sup>-1</sup> and 152.8 F g<sup>-1</sup> at the current densities of 0.5 and 1.0 A g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. It also exhibits a superior rate capability, with high specific capacitance retention at ca. 63.1% at a high current density of 20 A g <sup>-1</sup>. Significantly, about 96.2% is retained after charging and discharging for 10000 cycles, revealing its long-term electrochemical stability. The hard-soft dual templates method proposed in the present work is straightforward and effective, and can be utilized to synthesize porous carbons on a large scale for the application of high performance supercapacitors. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.
