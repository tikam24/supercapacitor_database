In this paper, MoS2 nanoflakes was prepared by a vacuum freeze-drying method. Electrochemical performance of MoS2 nanoflakes has been investigated through cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyzer. The results demonstrated that the new electrode maintains a relatively high power density and a good cycle performance in 6 M KOH electrolyte. A maximum specific capacitance of 0.11 F g-1 in an aqueous electrolyte solution has been obtained. The supercapacitor devices exhibit excellent long cycle life along with ~ 40% specific capacitance retained after 500 cycle at scan rates of 500 mV s-1. Â© (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
