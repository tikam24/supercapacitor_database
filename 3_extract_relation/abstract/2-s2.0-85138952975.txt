Electrochemical storage and conversion systems such as fuel cells, supercapacitors, and batteries are critical enablers in today's transition from conventional energy to sustainable energy. Metal-organic frameworks are well-suited to be incorporated into the storage and conversion devices because of their structural diversity, tailorability, functionality, and versatility. MOFs arrived on the scene 20 years ago with a growing amount of studies on obtaining innovative MOF designs and understanding the interplay between their crystal structure, composition, and electrochemical properties. However, unlike most chapters that have been published, this one has combined MOF's common synthesis routes and their applications in electrocatalysis, supercapacitor, and batteries.
