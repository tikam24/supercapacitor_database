This work successfully demonstrates various temperature carbonization of iron based metal organic framework to derive electrode materials for supercapacitors. Furthermore, impacts of calcined temperatures on the nature of as-prepared products are reported, and samples obtained at 300, 400, 500, 600 and 700 °C were investigated respectively. The products reveals excellent electrochemical performance. Carbonized at 600 °C, the composite materials display the highest specific capacitance of 972 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g. Carbonized at 500 °C, the capacitance retention of materials reach up to 93%. The high specific capacitance and excellent cyclic stability of the developed materials would exhibit nice prospect for the practical utilization of electrode materials.
