Manganese phosphate (Mn3(PO4)2) particles decorated polyaniline (PANI) have been proposed as a promising electrode material for supercapacitors. Mn3(PO4)2 particles were synthesized via the sonochemical method followed by calcination. The size of the particles was optimized by varying the sonication times: 30, 60, and 90 min which were labeled as M30, M60, and M90. The optimized Mn3(PO4)2 (M90) was blended with presynthesized PANI to form PANI-Mn3(PO4)2 composite (PANI-M90). The phase structure and purity of the synthesized materials were authenticated via X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The morphological studies through field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) showed that M90 particles are firmly anchored on branched-structured PANI which is beneficial for the quick transfer of charges. The electrochemical performance of M30, M60, M90, and PANI-M90 was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 1 M KOH electrolyte. PANI-M90 exhibited significantly improved specific capacity (347 C/g) than M90 (88 C/g) at 1 A/g due to the augmentation of redox active sites and the synergistic effect between the conductive PANI and Mn3(PO4)2. Furthermore, the hybrid supercapacitor (activated carbon//PANI-M90) achieved a maximum energy density of 14.7 Wh/kg and a power density of 378 W/kg with 80% of capacity retention after 3000 charge-discharge cycles.
