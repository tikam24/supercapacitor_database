Addition of a single walled carbon nanotube in ionic liquids of EMIBF4 produced a nanofluid with increased ionic conductivity. It, as the electrolyte, allowed the increase of the capacitance, energy density and cycling stability of a supercapacitor operated at 4 V. Â© 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
