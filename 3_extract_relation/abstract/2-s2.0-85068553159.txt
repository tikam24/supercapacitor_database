The V3O7.H2O-CNT/GO nanocomposite has been synthesized using facile hydrothermal method by incorporation of functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and Graphene oxide (GO) with ratio of 1:0.8. The predominant (200) and (520) X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks corresponds to orthorhombic structure with crystallite size of 21 nm. The Raman spectrum shows the D and G bands along with V5+=O and V4+=O bands of V3O7.H2O signifies the existence of carbonaceous materials such as CNT and GO. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Transmission electron microscopy images confirmed intertwining network structure of V3O7.H2O-CNTs/GO nanocomposite and demonstrated a specific capacitance of 269 F g−1. Further, the transformation of V3O7.H2O-CNT/GO to V2O5-CNT/GO composite was observed annealing at a temperature of 450 °C in oxygen environment. The intertwining network structured V2O5-CNT/GO nanocomposite has gained high mechanical strength from CNTs and high surface area from GO nanosheets along with excellent conductivity and demonstrated a high discharge specific capacitance 1020 F g−1 and retained 83.9% capacitance even after 5000 cycles.
