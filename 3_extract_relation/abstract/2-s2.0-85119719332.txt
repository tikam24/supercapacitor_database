Supercapacitors (SCs) have received much interest due to their enhanced electrochemical performance, superior cycling life, excellent specific power, and fast chargingâ€“discharging rate. The energy density of SCs is comparable to batteries; however, their power density and cyclability are higher by several orders of magnitude relative to batteries, making them a flexible and compromis-ing energy storage alternative, provided a proper design and efficient materials are used. This review emphasizes various types of SCs, such as electrochemical double-layer capacitors, hybrid su-percapacitors, and pseudo-supercapacitors. Furthermore, various synthesis strategies, including sol-gel, electro-polymerization, hydrothermal, co-precipitation, chemical vapor deposition, direct coating, vacuum filtration, de-alloying, microwave auxiliary, in situ polymerization, electro-spin-ning, silar, carbonization, dipping, and drying methods, are discussed. Furthermore, various func-tionalizations of SC electrode materials are summarized. In addition to their potential applications, brief insights into the recent advances and associated problems are provided, along with conclu-sions. This review is a noteworthy addition because of its simplicity and conciseness with regard to SCs, which can be helpful for researchers who are not directly involved in electrochemical energy storage.
