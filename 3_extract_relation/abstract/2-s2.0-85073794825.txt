Aiming at the problems of the flexible and smart wearable field including single function, low battery life, poor wearing comfort and poor fittness to human body under three dimensional distortion etc., the multi-interdisciplinary flexible and smart wearable fabrics based on textiles, materials, electronics, communication, biology, energy, environment and other disciplines were researched. Meanwhile, the preparation method and the relationship between compositions and structures, the three-dimensional deformations and the performances of the fiber-based flexible smart wearable devices were researched. The research progress of wearable technology and products in recent years were summarized, including the latest applications of fibers in flexible strain sensors, organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), super capacitors, microbial fuel cells and other flexible and smart wearable fields. It illuminates that the integration of wearable technology and fiber materials is an inevitable trend and objective demand for the development of wearable products.
