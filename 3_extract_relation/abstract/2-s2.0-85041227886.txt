A bidirectional, interleaved, multiphase, multidevice, soft-switching, field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-controlled, buck-boost converter with real-time pulse width modulation (PWM) reconfiguration capabilities is presented and validated experimentally. This topology, named multi-interleaved bidirectional buck-boost converter, is intended for medium-and high-power bidirectional dc power conditioning like battery-or supercapacitor-based power systems. Theoretical description of the converter, PWM driving scheme, and design issues is first presented. PWM generation and average current digital control are described for an FPGA-based implementation; and finally, a scaled-down prototype provides experimental validation of the proposed converter.
