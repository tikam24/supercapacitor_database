Manganese-based electrode materials are highly marketed in the field of energy storage owing to their easily modifiable structure, superior electrochemical activity, and minimal noxiousness. In the present work, the optimal ratio of nickel and manganese for augmented electroactive composite is developed to attain better electrochemical performances. Chemically precipitated electroactive composite comprising of nickel hydroxide and nickel manganese oxide had hierarchical nanostructure. In three-electrode system, a maximum specific capacity of 839 C g-1 (2454 F g-1) at 1 A g-1 for the best electroactive material with a high-rate capability of 83 %. Meanwhile, it had 97.2 % capacitance retention even after 2000 cycles. The symmetric supercapacitor device assembly exhibited a maximum specific energy of 51 W h kg-1 at specific power of 1394 W kg-1 respectively. The results reveal that the prepared hybrid electroactive material has prospects of being used as electrode material in high-performance supercapacitors.
