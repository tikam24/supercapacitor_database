A simple and low-cost approach toward flexible and freestanding electrode is developed. The method involves coating the polypyrrole (PPY) encapsulated graphene (RGO) composites on bacterial cellulose, from which large mass loading of 8.93 mg cm−2 is obtained. Benefiting from the well structural features, the flexible PPY/RGO/BC paper can be directly acted as supercapacitor electrode without metallic current collectors, binder and additives, and achieves a high areal capacitance (2100 mF cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2), good rate performance (1570 mF cm−2 retention at 50 mA cm−2) and high flexibility (suitable for arbitrary angles, even 180°). Moreover, the assembled symmetric supercapacitor delivers as high as 790 mF cm−2 of areal capacitance and 0.11 mWh cm−2 of energy density. Therefore, this strategy provides a facile method for design of flexible supercapacitor electrodes with high areal capacitance.
