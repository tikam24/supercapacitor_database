V2O5 is one of the best material for many applications. Progress is currently made to improve its performance for use as a sensor, or an electrode, or smart window, electrochromic device, supercapacitor, photovoltaic applications among others. In this work, we review the progress that has been done these recent years, in relation to the mode of preparation of the V2O5 films. The results outline the complex relationship between the synthesis and the properties, which should serve as a guide for further research on the dependence of the best synthesis process on the type of application that is targeted.
