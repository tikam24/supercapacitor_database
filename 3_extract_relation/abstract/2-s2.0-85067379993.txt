We demonstrate a cost-effective synthesis of 3D quaternary copper-nickel-cerium-cobalt oxide (Cu-Ni-Ce-Co oxide) through a one-step hydrothermal protocol followed by a heat treatment process. The mesoporous Cu-Ni-Ce-Co oxide (with pore diameter 4.34 nm) shows a higher specific surface area (86.9 m2 g-1). The as-synthesized quaternary oxide provides an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 2696 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 along with a moderate cycle stability of 86.5% after 3000 charge-discharge cycles. Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was established by assembling Cu-Ni-Ce-Co oxide and graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) as positive and negative electrode materials, respectively, and the supercapacitor performances were executed thoroughly. The ASC delivers a remarkable energy density of â‰ˆ51 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 581.9 W kg-1 together with long-term cyclic stability (92% specific capacitance retention after 3000 cycles). The compositional and morphological features together with superior electrochemical properties can make it advantageous for practical use in energy and power applications.
