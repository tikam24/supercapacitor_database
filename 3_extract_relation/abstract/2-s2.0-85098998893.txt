Nitrogen and phosphorus heteroatoms-doped carbon materials were prepared by carbonization of cross-linking cyclophosphazene from 10-(2,5-dihydroxyphenyl)-10-hydro-9-oxa-10- phosphaphenanthrene-10-oxide (DOPO-HQ) and Hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene (HCCP) as reactant, followed by activation with KOH as activator. The carbon materials possess a high specific surface area (up to 1342.328 m2 g−1), pore volume with a well-balanced microporosity (up to 0.7289 cm3 g−1), moderate heteroatom content and micrometer-sized morphology. Moreover, the heteroatom contents and porosity parameters (e.g. surface area and pore volume) can be easily controlled by the activation temperature in the range of 700–900 °C. When tested as a supercapacitor electrode in a three-electrode system using 6 M KOH solution as the electrolyte, the typical sample (DP-900) displays a high specific capacitance (265.8 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1), excellent rate capability (155 F g−1 at 10 A g−1) and outstanding cycling stability (98% capacity retention after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles at 10 A g−1). Furthermore, high energy density of 14.912 Wh kg−1 at 1 A g−1 with a power density of 800 W kg−1 can be achieved in a two-electrode cell originating from the microporous structure as well as the excellent synergistic effect of N, P co-doping. These encouraging results demonstrate that the DPs electrode materials with high current charge and discharge capability show great potential for supercapacitor applications, where a fast charge/discharge is required.
