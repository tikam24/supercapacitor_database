Broccoli-like porous carbon nanosheets with high levels of heteroatoms doping was successfully synthesized from the wasted sericin via an environmental friendliness and cost-effective strategy. The hierarchical porous carbon nanosheets was formed from chemical expansion and activation by Mg2(OH)2CO3â€¢xH2O simultaneously. Benefiting from the elaborate structure of NPCN-4, the prepared material shows the satisfactory energy storage ability in electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) area with an outstanding specific capacitance of 214.5 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 in an alkaline solution and high capacitance retention of 87% at 10 A g-1 after 10000 cycles.
