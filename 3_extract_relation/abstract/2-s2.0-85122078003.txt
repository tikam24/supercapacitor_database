In this work, a facile growing laser-scribed graphene (LSG) process is successfully demonstrated, which can pattern in situ sulfur (S)-doped porous graphene electrodes on a flexible sodium lignosulfonate (SLS)-coated polyethersulfone (PES) film. The typical microsupercapacitors (MSCs) based on S-doped porous graphene deliver an ultrahigh areal capacitance of 55.4 mF cmâˆ’2, and have good long-term cycle stability with 85.2% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles. Moreover, these devices exhibit superb mechanical flexibility and outstanding modular integration capability. This novel fabrication approach can be extended to other heteroatom-doped electrode materials for application in high-performance energy storage devices.
