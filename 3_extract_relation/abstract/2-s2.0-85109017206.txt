Polyaniline, as the pseudocapacitive electrode material, has been extensively studied for supercapacitors. However, their cycling stability is limited by the structural instability arising from large volumetric swelling/shrinking, which has been the main obstacle to their practical applications. Herein, this work reports metal organic frameworks(MOFs)-derived porous carbon frameworks as the substrate and further deposit polyaniline by in situ chemical polymerization. Benefit from the structurally stable MOFs-derived porous carbon frameworks and the uniformly-deposited conducting polyaniline nanowires with controlled lengths, the synthesized MOFs-derived porous carbon/polyaniline hybrid electrode displays a maximum specific capacitance of 534.16 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 and a maximum capacitance retention of 211% at 2 A g−1 after 20000 cycles, demonstrating promising applications for pseudocapacitive devices. The assembled semi-solid symmetrical supercapacitors delivers good electrochemical performance (energy density of 9.72 μWh cm−2) and excellent cyclic stability (94.4% at 10000 cycles), which can also power a commercial LED.
