The electrospinning method as a straightforward way to produce nanofibrous membranes from polymer solutions or melts under high electric field conditions has been applied on this work. Polymer fibers/membranes can be used in a wide variety of applications, starting from electrochemical devices to textiles and composite reinforcement materials. Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) electrospun membranes were prepared from different (15, 20, 22.5 and 25% w/w) solutions of PVDF in N,N-dimethylformamide and acetone mixture (80:20 w/w %). PVDF fibrous membranes with fiber diameter within the range from 100 to 2200 nm and different polymorphism of PVDF were produced by electrospinning method and tested electrochemically.
