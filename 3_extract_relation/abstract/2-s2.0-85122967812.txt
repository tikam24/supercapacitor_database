The energy management strategy (EMS) is a key technology to improve the economy and durability of fuel cells. To overcome the shortcomings of most existing strategies, a novel EMS based on game theory is proposed. The power flow modes are mainly divided into four modes, and the power flow distribution problem is modeled as a noncooperative game problem. Different preferences of the power sources are quantified through their individual utility functions. The Nash equilibrium is used to balance the different preferences of the independent power sources. The proposed EMS contributes to better performance in three areas: energy economy, maintaining ultracapacitor state of charge (SOC), and durability of fuel cell. According to the results, compared with the fuzzy control strategy and the power follow strategy, the equivalent hydrogen consumption of the proposed strategy is reduced by 7% and 4.57%, respectively, and the durability of the fuel cell is improved by 125% and 21.8% under the WLTP driving cycle.
