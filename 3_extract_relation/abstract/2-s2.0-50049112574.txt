This paper proposes a wind power generation system composed of a wind turbine generator, a hydrogen generation device, and an energy capacitor system (ECS), which are controlled cooperatively. It can supply the electric power with low fluctuation to the electric power system as well as generates hydrogen constantly. The output of wind turbine generators, in general, fluctuate greatly due to wind speed variations. In the proposed system, ECS composed of electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) and power electronics devices is used for smoothing the fluctuating output from the wind generator and supplying electrical power with low fluctuation to the power system. On the other hand, an electrolyzer is used to generate hydrogen constantly from the smoothed wind generator output. The effectiveness of the proposed system is verified by the simulation analyses using MATLAB.
