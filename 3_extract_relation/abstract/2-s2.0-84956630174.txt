Polypyrrole (PPY)/nitric acid (HNO3) activated carbon aerogel (HCA) composites are prepared through chemical oxidative polymerization with different PPY/HCAmass ratios. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were employed to investigate the components and morphology of the samples. The results demonstrate that the synthesized materials maintain the threedimensional nanoporous structure of the carbon aerogel (CA); the activation by nitric acid and composition with PPY do not destroy the porous structure of the carbon aerogel and the complex still has the original threedimensional nanoporous structure. Composites with different mass ratios (3 : 1, 2 : 1, 1 : 1, 1 : 2, 1 : 3) of PPY/ HCA were prepared and the electrochemical properties were measured by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge test, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results confirm that the PPY/HCA composite with a ratio of 1 : 1 exhibits the best electrochemical performances; it has a high specific capacitance of 336 F·g-1, which is more than two times higher than that of CA (103 F·g-1); it also exhibits outstanding conductivity and cycling stability, retaining 91% of its initial capacitance after 2000 cycles. Therefore, this composite is quite a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.
