In this research paper, the Multi Agent System (MAS) is introduced to Multi Micro- Grid (MMG) mesh system with the consensus control to share the power between arbitrary inverters to meet the load demand. Each microgrid consists with the Hybrid Energy Storage (HESS) which include the battery and Supercapacitor (SC) to supply/absorb the energy according to the load demand. The consensus based droop characteristics are used with MAS topology to share the power between different microgrids. The overall system consists with five microgrids and they interconnected as meshed network. The implemented control architecture achieve the DC voltage stability among all the microgrids.The system's stability being analysed mathematically using graph theory. MATLAB/Simulink virtual environment is used to simulate the overall system. The Java Agent Development Framework (JADE) is used as the platform to see the status of the agents. The overall simulation results substantiate in different modes of operation and compared with the conventional control method.
