Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has been stimulated in extensive researches due to its layered structure and the potential as an electrochemical energy material. However, the effects on electrochemical performance of concentration of MoS2 are rarely mentioned. In this paper, the effects of different concentrated layered MoS2 on the morphology and electrochemical properties of the composite of MoS2 and three-dimensional graphene (MoS2/3DG) were discussed. The results show that layered MoS2 was successfully compounded to 3DG and formed a vertical crosslinking structure. It can be observed that MoS2 nanosheets are vertically loaded on the inner and outer surface of graphene when the concentration of MoS2 is 0.20 mg/L. The specific capacitance of composite (MoS2 (0.20 mg/L)/3DG) reaches 2182.33 mF/cm2 at the current density of 1 mA/cm2, and the specific capacitance remains 116.83% after 5000 cycles. When the current density increased 100 times (from 1 mA/cm2 to 100 mA/cm2), the specific capacitance retains 78.9%. Meanwhile, the hybrid energy storage devises can deliver an energy density of 130.34 Wh/m2. The superior electrochemical properties are attributed to the synergistic effect of MoS2 and 3DG. Therefore, the material has a potential application on supercapacitor electrode material.
