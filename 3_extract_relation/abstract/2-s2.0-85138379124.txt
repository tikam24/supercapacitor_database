High efficient renewable energy storage systems have acquired much attention owing to overconsumption of non-renewable energy sources and growing demand for energy. To be specific, as compared to other conventional energy storage devices supercapacitors have procured all the attention for its charge storage capacity with outstanding charging-discharging performance, long cycle life and higher power density. Additionally, supercapacitors bridge the gap between the batteries and traditional capacitors by yielding the high power density. Metal oxides have high specific capacitances and conductivity, making them worthy for electrode material yielding high energy and power delivering. Moreover, in future the transition metal oxides (TMOs) category will perform a crucial action in cost-effective, high-powered, and environment-friendly energy storage. In this review, we attentive on the function of the synergistic effect concerning to composite transition metal oxides nanostructure for the next-generation supercapacitors. This review provides the useful information on the nano-hybrid and redox active material transition metal oxides. Some emerging concepts are introduced to reflect the improved capacitance resulting from π–π stacking interactions at the interface between two materials with highly conjugated chemical bonds. The prospects of carbon synergy between the TMOs for supercapacitor applications are briefly compared and discussed. In order to facilitate more efficient and effective advancements in the synthesis and design of materials, in addition to the engineering of devices, this article makes easy availability of literature materials to readers with a superior interpretation of supercapacitors and nano-hybrid materials.
