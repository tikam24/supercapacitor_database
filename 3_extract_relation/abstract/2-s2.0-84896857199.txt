Three-dimensional nanoporous carbon with interconnected vesicle-like pores (1.5-4.2nm) has been prepared through a low-cost, template-free approach from petroleum coke precursor by KOH activation. It is found that the thin pore walls are highly graphitized and consist of only three to four layers of graphene, which endows the material with an unusually high specific surface area (2933m2 g-1) and good conductivity. With such unique structural characteristics, if used as supercapacitor electrodes in ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes, the graphitized carbon nanovesicle (GCNV) material displays superior performance, such as high energy densities up to 145.9Wh kg -1 and a high combined energy-power delivery, and an energy density of 97.6Wh kg-1 can be charged in 47s at 60 °C. This demonstrates that the energy output of the GCNV-based supercapacitors is comparable to that of batteries, and the power output is one order of magnitude higher. Moreover, the synergistic effect of the GCNVs and the IL electrolyte on the extraordinary performance of the GCNV supercapacitors has been analyzed and discussed. Carbon makes a capacitor super!
