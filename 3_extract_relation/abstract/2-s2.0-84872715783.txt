We developed a mild and scalable, new approach in order to deposit Mn 3O4 nanospots on the porous walls of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Here, a CNTs network provides fast electronic conducting channels and the coating of Mn3O4 provides high capacitance, which shows that these systems can create high-performance supercapacitor electrodes. Mn3O4-CNTs show a specific capacitance of 498 F g -1 at 0.005 V s-1 and with 90% of capacity retention after 2000 cycles. The Ragone plot shows that Mn3O4-CNT electrodes demonstrate relatively higher energy density than conventional capacitors and normal ultracapacitors, maintaining their power density considerably higher than the conventional batteries and fuel cells. In addition to this, the method used in the present work is promising for producing high performance area-limited electrochemical supercapacitors and provides a new route for uniformly decorating CNTs with active materials such as metal oxides, conducting polymers, etc. Â© 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.
