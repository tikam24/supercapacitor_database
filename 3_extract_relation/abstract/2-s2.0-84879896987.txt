This paper focuses on Distributed Generator (DG) integration in Power Electrical System (PES) for dispersed nodes. The main objective of the DG use can be classified into two aspects: a load following service and ancillary service systems. In this study, the DG system contains a Fuel cell and a Supercapacitor storage device. A gas turbine system is modeled in order to estimate the PES frequency behavior under a variable power demand. The main goal of this work is to develop a DG control strategy with the aim to smooth the frequency and the voltage peak variations. To assess the different management stages, the power flow exchanged between DGs and PES is depicted and discussed for different power demand variations. The results found with the DGs integration strategy confirm the frequency and voltage regulations and also prove the well power flow management. Â© 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.
