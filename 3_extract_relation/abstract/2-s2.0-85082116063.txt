Herein, triangular prism shaped Co3O4 material was constructed by a facile route and used as a supercapacitor electrode. The Co3O4 material was fully characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Electrochemical characterization revealed that the Co3O4 material showed a high specific capacitance of 907.1 F g-1 at a current density of 1A g-1 and excellent cycle stability (with 86.5% of the initial specific capacitance remaining after 3000 cycles) at a current density of 10 A g-1. Additionally, an energy density of 23.0 Wh/kg with a power density of 0.26 kW/kg was obtained over the Co3O4.
