The activated carbon electrode made from acacia leaves (Acacia mangium wild) has been developed successfully. The preparation of the electrodes used a combination of chemical and physical activation with temperature variations at 800 째C, 850 째C, 900 째C, and 950 째C. Highest specific capacitance of activated carbon was 113 F g-1 in the two electrode system and showed excellent electrochemical performances. Additionally, activated carbon exhibits 95.73% purity with a specific surface area of 714.492 m2 g-1. These excellent results show great potential in developing energy storage devices with high specific capacitance for supercapacitor applications.
