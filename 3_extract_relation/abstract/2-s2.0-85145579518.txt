Cellulose has received extensive attention as hydrogel electrolytes in energy storage fields, due to its renewable and environmentally friendly properties. However, it is still difficult to prepare cellulose-based hydrogel electrolytes for supercapacitors with high flexibility, high specific capacitance, and good temperature resistance. Herein, a series of cellulose-based hydrogel electrolytes with good mechanical properties were prepared successfully by incorporating with a small amount of acrylamide/N, N′-methylene bisacrylamide via a simple one-pot strategy and, successively, the resultant hydrogel electrolytes were assembled with the commercial activated carbon, as electrode materials, yielding quasi solid-state symmetric supercapacitors. It was found that the optimum hydrogel electrolytes prepared with 15 wt.% acrylamide/N, N′-methylene bisacrylamide possessed the tensile strength and break elongation as high as 18.7 kPa and 743.3%, respectively. The supercapacitors originating from the above electrolytes showed the excellent electrochemical performance. The specific capacitance could achieve 163.7 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 and the corresponding capacitance retention was 87.9% after the constant charge–discharge cycles for 8000 times. Moreover, the supercapacitors could be operated at various bending angles (0°– 180°) and low temperature (− 30 °C) without significant loss of capacitance. These results indicate that the cellulose-based hydrogel electrolytes presented here would have great potential in the application of flexible energy storage devices.
