In this paper, composites of Ni(OH)2/reduced graphene oxides (rGO) were prepared by chemical co-precipitation method, by which Ni(OH)2 hexagonal nanoplates were successfully inserted into the layers of reduced graphene oxides. As a result, the aggregation of rGO and Ni(OH)2 is efficiently prevented and the stability of the composites are also improved. The electrochemical performance of Ni(OH)2/rGO is further investigated as electrode materials for supercapacitors. We find that when the mass ratio of Ni(OH)2 to rGO is 5.5:1, the composites achieve the best electrochemical performance (optimal specific capacitance of 1 036 F/g has been achieved at a current density of 1 A/g). In addition, the value of capacitance retention is above 70% after 3 000 cycles at the current density of 4 A/g.
