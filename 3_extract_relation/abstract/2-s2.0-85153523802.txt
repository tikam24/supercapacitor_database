Aqueous zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSs) are attracting increased attention as emerging electrochemical energy storage systems. However, the design of high-performance carbon cathodes for ZHSs remains a challenge. Herein, we report the synthesis of heteroatom-rich carbon cathodes based on a biomass precursor of yeast and a hydrothermal pre-carbonization strategy, realizing high-performance ZHSs. The yeast is composed of polysaccharide chains containing abundant O/N heteroatoms, and a hydrothermal pre-carbonization process is conducive to preserving these heteroatoms in the high-specific-surface-area carbon materials obtained by carbonizing-activating the yeast precursor. As a result, the synthesized carbon materials are endowed with high O/N heteroatom contents (exceeding 13.9 at%), and present superior electrochemical performance in ZHSs, including a high specific capacity of 132 mAh/g, a high energy density of 94.4 Wh/kg and outstanding cycling stability with âˆ¼100% capacity retention after 7000 cycles at 5 A/g. Besides, the heteroatom-rich carbon cathodes show a high capacity retention of 85.3% when their mass loading increases from 3.8 to 12.2 mg/cm2, demonstrating promising application for practical ZHSs. Electrochemical analysis reveals that the O/N heteroatoms promote ion chemical adsorption and thus the electrochemical properties of the carbon cathodes. Furthermore, flexible ZHS devices constructed with the heteroatom-rich carbon cathodes and a biodegradable ZnSO4/dough solid-state electrolyte exhibit excellent flexibility (as reflected by almost unchanged capacity under different bending states and 85% capacity retention after 500 bending cycles) as well as good repairability after dehydration under abnormal environments. This study offers new thinking in designing high-performance carbon cathodes and promotes nonflexible/flexible ZHSs moving towards practical applications.
