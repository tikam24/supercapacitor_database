Three new inorganic–organic hybrid zinc organodiphosphonate compounds, [H2TEMED][Zn3(hedp)2] (1), [H2TEPA][Zn6(Hhedp)2(hedp)2]·2H2O (2) and [H2DETA]2[Zn12(Hhedp)4(hedp)4]·3H2O (3) (H4hedp = 1-hydroxyethane 1,1-diphosphonic acid, TEMED = N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine, TEPA = tetraethylenepentamine and DETA = diethylenetriamine) have been synthesized by employing the variable amine-templated hydrothermal strategy. All the compounds are characterized and analyzed by PXRD, FT-IR, TGA, SEM and EDAX studies. Single crystal x-ray diffraction experiments reveal that the compounds 1–3 have formed interconnected 4-T, 8-T and 12-T open ring three-dimensional framework structure through the alternate connection of zinc ions and diphosphonate ligands. Topological analysis study displays compound 1 adopts (4.5.72.8.9)(4.7.8)(52.72.82)(52.7) net topology whereas compounds 2 and 3 show ILEHUD (4.5.6.83)(4.6.8)(52.6.83)(52.8) net topology, even though the observed asymmetric units are dissimilar in case of 2 and 3. The UV-visible spectroscopic studies recommend the compounds as wide band-gap semiconducting materials. The observed dielectric permittivity of the compounds are considerably high (ε′ ∼ 100) at room temperature. The electrochemical performance tests indicate that compound 3 exhibit a high specific capacitance of 216 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 along with an excellent cycle stability of 79.6 % even after 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1 in the 6 M KOH solution while compound 1 and 2 possess specific capacitance values of 164 and 170 F g−1 with cycling retention of 68.42 % and 57.82 %, respectively. Such high-performance supercapacitance behavior in amine templated framework is noteworthy.
