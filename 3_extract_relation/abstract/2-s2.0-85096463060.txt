A functionalized phosphorene/polypyrrole (FPPY) hybrid nanomaterial was prepared via a mechanochemical process and chemical oxidative polymerization. The polymerization of polypyrrole (PPY) on the surface of two-dimensional phosphorene was investigated in detail. The amide bond formation of the FPPY hybrid improved the interfacial interaction between the PPY and phosphorene. The specific capacitance of the FPPY was 411.5 F g−1, which was approximately four times that of pristine PPY (106 F g−1). Additionally, hybridization improved the structural stability of PPY, yielding a cycle stability 2 times higher than that of pristine PPY. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the potential of phosphorene hybridized with conducting polymers for practical energy-storage applications.
