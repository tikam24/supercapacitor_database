Supercapacitors have sparked much research interest recently due to their superior characteristics over other energy storage devices. Likely to provide high-performing and securely operating energy storage solutions for the rapidly expanding consumer and microelectronics application areas, they are the focus of multidisciplinary research by organizations worldwide in the fields of materials, surface, and electrochemical science. They support printable, flexible, and wearable devices. Separators are an essential component of supercapacitor design and thus are crucial for the capacitive performance and security of supercapacitor devices by preventing short circuits and allowing electrolyte ions penetration. Separators from renewable sources have inspired a lot of research because of their great mechanical properties, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and low cost, with exceptionally strong, extendable, and durable features. In this chapter, we concentrate on preparing separator membranes from biomass and their use in supercapacitor devices, as well as possible future directions.
