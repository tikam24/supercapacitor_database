In this report, novel azobenzene self-assembled complexes (azo-Cn, n = 8, 12, 16) were used as an electrode material for pseudo-capacitors. The as-prepared azo-Cn exhibited a good reversible redox process and possessed a specific capacitance as high as 221.0 F g−1 at 10 mV s−1. However, with the value n increased from 8 to 16, the specific capacitances of azo-Cn electrode materials decreased. In order to study the reasons, the effect of surface amphiphilic property of azobenzene self-assembled electrode materials on the properties of supercapacitors was studied and the results showed that the capacitive behaviors of azo-Cn could be greatly improved by better surface hydrophilic properties and azo-C8 with good supercapacitive characteristics could be the potential ideal electrode materials for low-cost and high-efficiency electrochemical supercapacitors.
