In this work, CoNiAl triple hydroxide with nanofiber-composed dandelion-like morphology was synthesized on nickel foam by a hydrothermal route. This delicate nanostructure was initiated from the rolling up of hydroxide nanosheets. The hierarchical nanostructure and optimized molar ratio of Co, Ni, and Al guarantees the high electrochemical performance of obtained samples. The maximum specific capacitance of 2,791 F g−1 for the as-prepared CoNiAl hydroxides was achieved at scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in 3 M KOH aqueous solution. The capacitance of material still remained 85 % after 2,000 charge–discharge cycles. These results demonstrated that the as-prepared CoNiAl triple hydroxide can be applied as a high-performance electrode material for supercapacitor.
