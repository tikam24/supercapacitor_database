The interaction between active materials and conductive additives is complicated but crucial within electrochemical energy storage devices. Here, we first identify that CH2 groups drive the compositing process, leading to an effective formation of Co-O-C chemical bonding serving as the bridge between reduced graphene oxide(rGO) and hydroxide. Due to the enhanced electron transport, a dramatically improved specific capacity is achieved as high as 1368 F/g for rGO/Co(OH)2 electrode at a current density of 0.5 A/g. Thus, we provide new insights into graphene/hydroxide compositing mechanism, which has a significant impact on enhancing electron transport for a variety of graphene/hydroxide in energy storage systems.
