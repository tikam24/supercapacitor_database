Heavily phosphorus-doped nanocrystalline diamond (P-NCD) has been grown by using a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition technique and further applied as an electrode for the construction of supercapacitors. This P-NCD electrode shows a capacitance of 11.40 μF cm −2 in 1.0 M Na 2 SO 4 at a scan rate of 10 mV s −1 and behaves as a n-type semiconductor electrode in redox-active electrolyte of 0.05 M Fe(CN) 6 3−/4− +1.0 M Na 2 SO 4 . The post-thermal treatment of as-grown P-NCD films in vacuum at high temperatures for several hours leads to the achievement of much higher capacitances. At the scan rates of 10 and 20 mV s −1 , the capacitances are up to 2.01 and 63.56 mF cm −2 for an electrical double layer capacitor and a pseudocapacitor, respectively. Such high capacitances originate from the improved electrical conductivity, varied surface state and surface functional groups, and changed content of non-carbon diamond inside the P-NCD films during the annealing treatment. Therefore, P-NCD films are quite promising as an electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
