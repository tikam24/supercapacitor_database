Due to excellent activity, electronic conductivity, and stability, transition metal selenide shows incredible potential for energy storage and conversion. In this work, trimetallic CoNiSe2/Fe-CoNiSe2 yolk-shell nanoboxes (YSBs) are developed via ZIF-67/NiCoFe Prussian blue analogue (PBA) precursors as efficient electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors (SCs). Structural engineering of the PBA framework with Co-Fe oxide increases the topological complexity of the nanostructure. The energy storage activity is effectively improved because of the open structure and larger surface area. The presence of trimetallic selenides in CoNiSe2/Fe-NiCoSe2 YSBs improves the electronic structures and thus electrochemical performances and enhanced conductivity of the nanostructure compared with oxide counterparts. As a result, it enables attractive electrochemical performance when used as an electrode for battery-type supercapacitors. CoNiSe2/Fe-CoNiSe2 yolk-shell nanoboxes show high specific capacity of 1091.2 C/g at 1.0 A/g, good acceleration performance (55% at 20 A/g), and excellent cycle stability (85% recovery after 5000 charge/discharge cycles). Furthermore, the NiCoSe2/Fe-NiCoSe2 YSBs//AC hybrid SC demonstrates an energy density above 76.5 Wh/Kg at a power density of 2378.7 W/Kg. These results suggest that the current strategy may provide a way for designing efficient electrode materials for energy storage by preparing trimetallic chalcogenides with yolk-shell structures.
