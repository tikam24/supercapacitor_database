Herein plasma treated nitrogen-doped graphite oxide (P-N-GO) is synthesized by using ammonium hydroxide solution and plasma for supercapacitor applications. Nitrogen is doped 10 at%, and electrochemical active surface area is increased almost three times, compared to the precursor graphite oxide. Electrochemical impedance is also dramatically reduced from 221 to 29 Ω at 100 Hz. Resultant capacitance of the composite is 201 Fg−1, which is about four times larger than that of precursor graphite oxide (∼60 Fg−1) at the scan rate of 50 mVs−1, demonstrating high energy density of 11 Whkg−1 when its power density reaches to 166 Wkg−1. The capacitance retention is 89% after 2000 cycles, revealing high cyclic stability and reliable performance for the supercapacitor applications.
