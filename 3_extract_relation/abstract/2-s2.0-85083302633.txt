Pollution and its related problems are degrading the planet along with its residents at an exponential rate. The transportation system is the most potential sector for this and electric vehicles the foremost solution. Most innovations in EVs today concern user comforts. But, the need currently is to focus on energy and its optimal utilization. This requires concentrating on the vehicle source side. Hybrid energy storage systems (HESS) possess the perfect remedy to fit into this need. This paper focuses on the development of a control algorithm for the proper designing and the implementation of an efficient energy management system in EVs with active HESS of battery and supercapacitor by bringing in load sharing to this hybridization during the various load demand conditions. Energy management algorithm has been designed. and performance has been analyzed using MATLAB. Hardware prototype for testing was also made and the results were verified.
