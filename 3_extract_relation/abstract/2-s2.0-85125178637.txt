The traditional three branch RC equivalent circuit model of supercapacitor can not describe the charge and discharge characteristics of supercapacitor well in the process of rapid charge and discharge, and it is difficult to achieve the online identification of parameters of three branch RC equivalent circuit model. In order to improve accuracy of state estimation and parameter identification of supercapacitor in the condition of rapid charge and discharge, a state estimation and parameter identification method based on simplified model and EKF was proposed. Firstly, through the feasibility analysis of model simplification in the condition of rapid charge and discharge, the three branch RC model was simplified to the two branch RC model on the premise of meeting the accuracy requirements; Secondly, the model parameters, which were treated as state variables, were also added to the state equation, and the EKF algorithm was used to estimate the state and model parameters of supercapacitor simultaneously; Finally, a 50 F supercapacitor was used to verify effectiveness of the proposed method under the conditions of constant current charging and constant resistance discharge. The experimental results show that the state estimation and parameter identification method based on the simplified model improves the estimation speed without reducing the estimation accuracy.
