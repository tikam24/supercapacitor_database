An adaptive synergetic control strategy is proposed to solve the problem that the control effect of the synergetic control adopted in battery-ultracapacitor hybrid energy storage system of electric vehicles is affected by the equivalent resistance of the ultracapacitor and the input voltage fluctuation caused by the internal resistance of the battery. A synergetic controller is designed based on the ideal state space average model of the DC-DC converter, and its stability is analyzed. Then, an accurate mathematical model of the system is established by considering the equivalent resistance of the ultracapacitor and the battery internal resistance. An adaptive observation function is designed and the adaptive control law is obtained based on the Lyapunov function. The unknown load and varying input voltage are then estimated. Furthermore, a macro-variable is designed, and a duty cycle function of the adaptive synergetic control is derived. Finally, a simulation model of the hybrid energy storage system is established in MATLAB/Simulink to verify the effectiveness of the adaptive synergetic control. Results show that the proposed adaptive synergetic control has slight overshoot and current fluctuation caused by load change, and its response speed is fast (the settling-time is about 4 ms). Moreover, the tracking error is less than 1% in current tracking control. Comparisons with the synergetic control and the sliding mode control show that the adaptive synergetic control has better stability and anti-interference ability. Therefore, the adaptive synergetic control effectively improves the stability and robustness of the hybrid energy storage system, and ensures the effectiveness of power allocation strategy.
