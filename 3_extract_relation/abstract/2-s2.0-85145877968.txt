Modification of the structure and morphology of MXene electrodes and the formulation of the electrolytes used in their supercapacitor configurations are significant factors affecting the performance of electrochemical devices. In this study, we investigated the electrochemical performance and ion dynamics of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, [EmimTFSI], ionic liquid in the presence of acetonitrile (ACN) at different concentrations in Ti3C2T x MXene supercapacitor. We found an optimum concentration of ACN, at which more cations from the ionic liquid attach to the MXene electrode surface, providing higher electrochemical performance. This higher capacitance is also associated with increased microscopic dynamics of the cation away from the pore wall. These findings give a guideline to optimize the performance of MXene-based supercapacitors using organic solvents-ionic liquid-based electrolyte systems.
