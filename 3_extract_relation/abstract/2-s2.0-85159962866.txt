Hydrochar (HC), obtained by the hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of biomass, is an excellent precursor for preparing activated carbon (AC). However, the effects of the intrinsic properties of HC on the microstructure and electrochemical properties of AC are largely unknown. This study investigates the impact of particle size and the degree of aromatization of in-situ HC on the microstructure and electrochemical properties of AC. Our results show that a large particle size and a high degree of aromatization help protect the HC from overactivation by ZnCl2, resulting in an large specific surface area (SSA > 2000 m2/g) and high mesopore to micropore volume ratio value (Vmes/Vmic > 0.3) of the AC. Electrochemical performance measurements show a maximum specific capacitance of 218 F/g at 0.5 A/g was achieved in all samples where the AC (AC180-10 h) was prepared by activating HC180-10 h with a large size, a high degree of aromatization, and abundant surface oxygen-containing functional groups. After AC180-10 h was assembled into a supercapacitor, the specific capacitance of AC180-10 h still reached 158 F/g at 0.5 A/g, and it showed excellent cycling stability. This study advances the understanding of the impact of HC particle size and degree of aromatization on AC properties, providing new insights into tailoring HC qualities so that improving improve the properties of AC.
