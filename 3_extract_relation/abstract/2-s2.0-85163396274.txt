Here, we present the synthesis of a novel porosity core-shell oriented NiS2@C-rGO hybrid network for high-performance supercapacitors using a simple hydrothermal method. The NiS2@C-rGO nanocomposite is a three-dimensional material made up of clusters of NiS2 nanoparticles coated in carbon and rGO nanosheets. To achieve fast ion and electron transportation and a phenomenal specific surface area, NiS2@C-rGO particles are uniformly distributed and intercalated between rGO nanosheets to create a 3D carbon matrix. In a 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte, the cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge method have been used to thoroughly examine the physicochemical features and electrochemical properties. NiS2 and NiS2@C-rGO were reported to have capacitances of 565 Fg−1 (1 Ag−1) and 1297 Fg−1 at 1 Ag−1, respectively, with 95.3% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles at 1 Ag−1. The NiS2@C-rGO is utilized as a positive electrode, and activated carbon (AC) is employed as a negative electrode to fabricate a supercapattery, which exhibits a wide operating potential window of 1.6 V, a high energy density of 44.1 Whkg−1 at 755 Wkg−1, and even 10 Whkg−1 at an elevated power density of 7650 Wkg−1. Hence, the fabricated ASC device confirmed that the NiS2@C-rGO composite could be used as energy storage electrode materials for supercapacitor applications.
