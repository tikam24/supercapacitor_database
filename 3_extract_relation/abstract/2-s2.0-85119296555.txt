Green, sustainable and effective development technique to obtain high porous activated carbon biomass based is important to boosting supercapacitor performance with environmentally friendly effect as conversion system and energy storage devices. We reported porous activated carbon binder-free Scleria sumatrensis stem-based as electrode material high performance of symmetric supercapacitor. Precursor biomass of Scleria sumatrensis stem was converted into porous carbon through simple ZnCl2impregnated with different concentration of 0.4M, 0.5M, 0.6M, and 0.7M at high-temperature phyrolysis. All samples confirmed good amorphous carbon with small amounts of oxidative compounds. In two-electrode system, the optimum sample of ACSS0.6 significantly boosting the specific capacitance as high as 142.62 F g-1 at scan rate of 1 mV s-1. Furthermore, the optimum energy density was found to be 19.80 Wh kg-1 at a maximum power density of 71.35 W kg-1in 1 M H2SO4aqueous electrolyte. These results confirm that the porous activated carbon binder-free Scleria sumatrensis stembased through simple ZnCl2impregnated as an electrode material to boosting the electrochemical behavior of supercapacitors.
