Electrodes play important roles on the performance of supercapacitors, and low-cost, large-scale fabrication of high-performance electrodes is closely related to the actual application of supercapacitors. Herein, a low-cost, large-scale coating-transfer method was developed to fabricate high-performance carbon electrodes with excellent homogeneity, high conductivity, and large surface area. Symmetric button supercapacitors using active carbon as the electrode material fabricated via coating-transfer process exhibit good specific capacitance up to 211 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 in 1 M neutral aqueous electrolyte, which shows 40% improvement as compared with convention rolling process. Furthermore, these supercapacitors present high repeatability and excellent performance stability. The research demonstrates that the low-cost, large-scale coating-transfer process shows great potentials in practical application for fabricating high-performance supercapacitors.
