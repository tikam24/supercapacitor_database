Herein, reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/MnO 2 hybrid materials were prepared via a direct redox reaction between MnCl 2 and KMnO 4 on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) . A systematic study was carried out to understand the role of KMnO 4 . The morphology and microstructure of the as-prepared composite was characterized using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman Spectroscopy. Results indicate that the concentrations of KMnO 4 have a detrimental effect on the distribution of MnO 2 nanoparticles on rGO sheets and hence on electrochemical properties. The electrochemical capacitive behavior of the as-prepared composite was investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 1 M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous electrolyte solution. At the optimum concentration of KMnO 4 , the as-prepared rGM-1 composite shows a high specific capacitance of 366 F/g at a scan rate of 10 mV/s. The composite also exhibits good electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of dopamine (DA), exhibiting a low detection limit of 2.3 × 10 −7 M with a wide linear range between 2.5 × 10 −7 M and 2.30 × 10 −4 M. Hence, the use of rGO/MnO 2 at an optimized concentration of KMnO 4 is a potential competitive candidate in supercapacitor and biosensor applications.
