Three-dimensional vertically aligned graphene (3DVAG) was prepared by a unidirectional freezing method, and its electrochemical performances were evaluated as electrode materials for Zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSCs). The prepared 3DVAG has a vertically ordered channel structure with a diameter of about 20–30 µm and a length stretching about hundreds of microns. Compared with the random structure of reduced graphene oxide (3DrGO), the vertical structure of 3DVAG in a three−electrode system showed higher specific capacitance, faster ion diffusion, and better rate performance. The specific capacitance of 3DVAG reached 66.6 F·g−1 and the rate performance reached 92.2%. The constructed 3DVAG Zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitor also showed excellent electrochemical performance. It showed good capacitance retention up to 94.6% after 3000 cycles at the current density of 2 A·g−1 .
