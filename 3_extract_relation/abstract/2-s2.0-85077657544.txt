A decisive and essential unit of supercapacitors is the electrolyte which has utmost importance to assemble high performance, low cost and flexible devices. Here in we report on supercapacitor application of doped 1,2,4-Triazole (Tri) terminated 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BG) as a novel anhydrous electrolyte. The triazole terminated BG that is BG (Tri)2 was synthesized and then doped with phosphoric acid and ionic liquid at various fractions. The structure of the pristine and anhydrous gel electrolytes was elucidated with several spectroscopic techniques. The results showed that anhydrous gel electrolytes bear desired properties such as high conductivity and stability for high temperature applications. Galvanostatic charge-discharge (CD), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques were employed to investigate electrochemical performances of the capacitor devices. The system with the BG (Tri)2/H3PO4/0.1IL electrolyte has a maximum specific capacitance (Cs) of 147 F g− 1. The same electrolyte illustrated the highest energy density of 10.2 Wh kg− 1 at the power density of 500 W kg− 1. The supercapacitor with anhydrous electrolyte exhibited superior performance and efficiency even after 2000 charge/discharge cycles by keeping 10% of its original capacitance. The Cs of supercapacitor including BG(Tri)2/H3PO4/0.1IL increased up to 271 F g− 1 as the temperature increased from 25 °C to 75 °C.
