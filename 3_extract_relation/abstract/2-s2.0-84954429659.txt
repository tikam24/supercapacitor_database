CuCo2S4 nanoparticles demonstrating outstanding electrochemical performances were firstly synthesized through a simple solvothermal approach without using any templates. CuCo2S4 synthesized in glycerol (CuCo2S4-glycerol) fulfills an ultrahigh capacitance of 5030 F g-1 at 20 A g-1 in a polysulfide electrolyte.
