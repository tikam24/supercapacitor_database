Ti/IrO2-Ta2O5 electrodes were prepared by a low thermal decomposition method. The influence of Ta contents on the microstructure and capacitive performance of the Ti/IrO2-Ta2O5 electrodes was investigated by XRD, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests. The results show that Ta2O5 can inhibit crystallization of the IrO2. With increasing Ta content, the crystallization degree decreases. When the content of Ta is 60 mol%, the electrode with a content of 6.4% crystalline structure has a superior capacitive performance of 239.2 g/F, which is considerably higher than that of IrO2 electrode (54.1 g/F).
