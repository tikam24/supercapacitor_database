Reduced graphene-oxide (RGO)-based electrodes in supercapacitors deliver high energy/power capacities compared to typical nanoporous carbon materials. However, extensive critical analysis of literature reveals enormous discrepancies (up to 250 F g−1) in the reported capacitance (variation of 100–350 F g−1) of RGO materials synthesized under seemingly similar methods, inhibiting an understanding of capacitance variation. Here, the key factors that control the capacitance performance of RGO electrodes are demonstrated by analyzing and optimizing various types of commonly applied electrode fabrication methods. Beyond usual data acquisition parameters and oxidation/reduction properties of RGO, a substantial difference of more than 100% in capacitance values (with change from 190 ± 20 to 340 ± 10 F g−1) is found depending on the electrode preparation method. For this demonstration, ≈40 RGO-based electrodes are fabricated from numerous distinctly different RGO materials via typically applied methods of solution (aqueous and organic) casting and compressed powders. The influence of data acquisition conditions and capacitance estimation practices are also discussed. Furthermore, by optimizing electrode processing method, a direct surface area governed capacitance relationship for RGO structures is revealed.
