Flower like ytterbium molybdate nanopowders were prepared via the fast and easy rout. Pure structure of flower like ytterbium molybdate nanopowders was examined through some techniques including, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDX). Addition to image SEM revealed flower like ytterbium molybdate nanopowders that composite from nanoplate with 5 nm thickness and length of 600 nm. Electrochemical efficiency of ytterbium molybdate nanostructure synthesized on a steel plate as a main material for a capacitor electrode in 3M KCl medium was studied using galvanostatic charge/discharge, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques. The evaluations on Ytterbium molybdate-based electrodes showed that these materials have a specific capacitance (SC) of 318 F g-1 at a scan rate of 2 mV s-1, an energy density (ED) of 24.3 W h kg-1, and a high rate capability. Assessment continual evaluations of cyclic voltammetry making use of ytterbium molybdate-based electrodes confirmed that the electrodes have a potential to keep up to 96.1% of their initial SC after 4000 cycles. As far as we concern the novelty of this work is making use of ytterbium molybdate as electrode materials to be used in supercapacitors. Our findings show an agreement with remarkable features of ytterbium molybdate for such application.
