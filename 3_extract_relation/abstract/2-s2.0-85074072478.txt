A breathable and wearable self-charging power system is developed by integrating paper-based triboelectric nanogenerator (P-TENG) and supercapacitor (P-SC). The felt side and wire side of highly porous and mechanically robust air-laid paper are utilized as the triboelectric pair of the P-TENG, which not only shows remarkable flexibility and cloth-like air permeability (333 mm sâˆ’1), but exhibits exceptional wet stability (85% voltage retention after four soaking cycles). To match the triboelectric output, the self-discharge behavior of the P-SC is comprehensively evaluated for effectively storing the triboelectricity. The service behavior of the self-charging system is investigated when the P-TENG is immersed in water or subject to partial damage. Considering the cost-effective materials and scalable process for the fabrication of the self-charging power units, a promising approach for the development of wearable self-powered electronics is provided here.
