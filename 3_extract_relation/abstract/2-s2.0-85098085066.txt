The pore structure, size and type of electrode material directly affect its electrochemical properties. In this paper, three-dimensional porous graphene electrode materials were prepared by a two-step method of hydrothermal reaction and nitric acid steam treatment. The three-dimensional porous graphene was characterized by scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, Raman spectrum and X-ray diffraction. And the electrochemical properties of the porous graphene were tested by the three-electrode method and electrochemical methods such as cyclic voltammetry, constant current charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance. The results show that the prepared 3D porous graphene has a combined structure of micropores and nanopores, and their synergistic effect leads to excellent electrochemical properties of 3D porous graphene, realizing a specific capacitance up to 191. 5 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g.
