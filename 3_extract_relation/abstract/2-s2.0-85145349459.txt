The popularity of flexible and wearable electronic devices has stimulated the development of flexible energy storage devices, in which micro-supercapacitor (MSCs) are the most promising. Herein, we demonstrated a novel strategy for scalable fabrication of copper-nickel-polypyrrole (Cu-Ni-PPy) MSCs devices through laser-induced selective metallization of Cu interdigitated electrode combined with electroplating Ni and electrochemical deposition active material of PPy. The prepared Cu-Ni current collector exhibit high electrical conductivity and mechanical flexibility. Moreover, the obtained Cu-Ni-PPy MSCs devices display a large areal capacitance of 126.67 mF/cm2 and a high volume energy density of 31.78 and 5.39 mWh/cm3 at the corresponding power density of 0.15 and 7.5 W/cm3, respectively. Besides, the MSCs exhibit remarkable capacity retention of 94.8% after 10,000 bending cycles and 89.3% after 10,000 cycles. The wireless charging of the MSCs device can be realized by reasonably designing the wireless charging coil (WCO) for electromagnetic conversion. It is believed that this work provides insight into the manufacture of portability and flexibility of miniaturized energy storage devices.
