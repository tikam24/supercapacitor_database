The present work explores a facile route to synthesize nanocomposite based on graphene and Polypyrrole nanofiber using a biopolymer, sodium alginate. The synthesis procedure of composite is simple, inexpensive and ecofriendly. The possible interaction between graphene and PPy nanofiber has been characterized by FTIR analysis. Morphological study confirmed the fiber like morphology of PPy and the presence of graphene in the nanocomposite. The composite achieved high electrical conductivity of 1.45 S/cm at room temperature and also showed nonlinear Current-Voltage characteristics, which indicates it's potential to be used in various device applications. A maximum capacitance value of 466 F/g has been obtained for this composite at 10 mV/s scan rate in 1 M KCl solution. The composite also showed highest energy density of 165.7 Wh/Kg at 10 mV/s scan rate. Noticeable improvements in other electrochemical properties allow its possible application as electrode material for Supercapacitors. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
