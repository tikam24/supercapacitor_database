Abstract A ternary composite, Co3O4 nanoparticles/N-doped graphene (NG)/carbon nanotubes (CNTs), has been synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method. N-doped graphene nanosheets were used as the substrate with excellent conductivity and a well conductive network is established through introducing CNTs. Due to the synergetic effects of Co3O4 nanoparticles, N-doped graphene and embedded carbon nanotubes, the Co3O4/NG/CNTs electrode exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance than those of Co3O4/NG, Co3O4/graphene, which have a high specific capacitance of 456 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g. Additionally, a capacitance increase of 23.2% of the initial capacitance is observed after 1000 cycles at a current density of 1 A/g. The results provide a general strategy to design and prepare innovative ternary composites with 0-dimensional, 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional complex structures for diverse structure-sensitive applications.
