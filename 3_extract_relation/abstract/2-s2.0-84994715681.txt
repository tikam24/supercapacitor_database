In this work four polyaniline (PANI) film electrode with different thickness were synthesized by electrochemical method on the surface of glassy carbon (GC) electrode. Four polymer films with various thicknesses from 0.5 to 11 μm were synthesized. Electropolymerization occurs in low monomer concentration. Morphology study of electrode shows that surface structure of polymers depends on film thickness. Capacitance of electrode was studied by CV and charge-discharge (CD) methods. Specific capacitance (SC) of electrodes using cyclic voltammetry were calculated 620, 247 F g–1 for thinnest and thickest polymer film, respectively. Stability of electrodes was studied during 1000 voltammogram cycles. Results show that with the increase of thickness the stability of electrodes enhanced and reach to a maximum and then decreased.
