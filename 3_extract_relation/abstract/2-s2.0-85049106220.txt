One-dimensional (1D) yarn electrodes in flexible wearable storage devices such as yarn supercapacitors and batteries hold the future for powering smart textile electronics. However, to this date, obtaining electroactive yarns with all-textile properties, such as flexibility, mechanical strength, manufacturability, and excellent electrochemical properties with ease remains a challenge. This report seeks to solve the named problems, in which, it discusses the nanofibers coated yarn concept which involves facile self-winding of electroactive nanofibers of MXene onto textile polyester (PET) substrate yarn via templated electrospinning. The resultant yarn self-possesses excellent required properties of flexibility, strength and high-power density owing to the highly electroactive MXene nanofibers and PET employed. Such modified yarns can perfectly fit in wearable storage applications for the anticipated drive of the next generation devices.
