The reactive plasma technique is often employed to activate the surface of materials both chemically and physically. Considering that several parameters should be handled in a plasma treatment process, a multivariate experimental design of three factors in two levels was employed to define the plasma treatment configurations under which the MLG were submitted. Plasma intensity, partial pressure of oxygen and reaction time were employed in the experimental planning. The surface morphology, the generation of Câ€“C bond defects, surface chemical composition, interfacial free energy, and electrochemical properties were analyzed for the MLG electrodes as a function of the plasma treatment parameters. The treatments effectively promoted the MLG electrode's surface activation, considering the results obtained, which showed a dependence on those plasma treatment variables. The results suggested that plasma treatment variable adjustments can be used to modulate specific surface properties and with potential applicability in electrochemical sensors and supercapacitors.
