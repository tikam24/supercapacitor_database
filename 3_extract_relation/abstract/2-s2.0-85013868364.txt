This paper represents the thermal behaviour of an energy storage system based on advanced lithium-ion capacitors. In the proposed study, an extended statistical analysis has been performed for evaluating the main thermal parameters. Based on the performed analysis, an electro-thermal model and a 3D thermal model have been developed for optimization of the thermal management strategy. The models have been developed for a 2300F lithium ion capacitor cell. The developed models are in good agreement with the experimental results, which indicates that the models can be used for the design and optimization of the thermal management.
