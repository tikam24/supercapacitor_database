Two liquid-loaded covalent organic framework composites (IL-COFs) with exceptional periodic molecular ordering, porosities and well-defined pores were constructed by loading ionic liquid (IL, [Emim]ESe) into TFPB-TAPT COF and BTA-TAPT COF. The as prepared IL-COFs present excellent electrochemical properties, especial for [Emim]ESe-TFPB-TAPT COF. It shows an initial specific capacitance of 521 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g and remains 372 F/g at a high current density of 4 A/g with prominent rate performance. In addition, it could retain 76% of the initial capacitance after 5000 charge-discharge cycles (396 F/g), which was better than those of the most of analogous materials reported previously. This work may shed light on designing and fabricating the COF-based electrode materials for supercapacitors.
