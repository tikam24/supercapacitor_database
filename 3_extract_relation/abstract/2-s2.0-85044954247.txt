Electrochemical double layer capacitors can store electrical energy by accumulating electrolyte ions on the electrode surface and are playing an important role in renewable energy sources due to their high power density and superior durability. Owing to the excellent electrical, mechanical, and thermal characteristics, three-dimensional multiporous carbon nanomaterials are catching considerable attention which could lead to the high-rate supercapacitor performance. Here, we present a stable 1.7 nm cage-based metal-organic framework (BMM-9, [Zn2(TPO)4/3(dabco)Â·Solvent]) with high porosity of 62.4%. On the other hand, after the thermal treatment at high temperature, the three-dimensional MOF-derived micro/mesoporous carbon material BMM-9-900 acts as dual-doped active electrode materials and shows a capacitance of 182.8 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1, and a capacity retention of 98.5% over 1000 cycles. Given the well-established structural tunability, these outcomes will shed light on a new generation of MOF-derived supercapacitors whose active materials can be tunable at the molecular level.
