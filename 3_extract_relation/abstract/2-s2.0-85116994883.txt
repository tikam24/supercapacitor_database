In the present work, it has been directly prepared the polyaniline-MnO2-grapheneternary composite film onto fluorine-doped tin oxide glass substrate (FTO/PANI-MnO2-GR). The film in question were obtained through electropolymerization of aniline with manganese dioxide electrodeposition, both occurring at once under the same imposed potential 1.2 V vs. SCE. The electropolymerization process is first performed with the presence of dispersed graphene (2 mg) in 0.1 M aniline, 25 mM, or 75 mM of manganese sulfate, 0.1 M Na2SO4, and 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte solution. The carried out work primarily aims to build a new ternary composite film in directly combining mono dimensional coated MnO2 conducting polyaniline PANI with bi-dimensional graphene sheets. The targeted work is plainly justified by the fact that ternary composites compared to individual components such as supercapacitor electrode materials are endowed with much more high electrochemical capacitance. The process is separately conducted without and with dispersed graphene and its electrolyte solution. The electrochemically synthesized graphene sheets are incorporated under low agitation. The specific capacitance is computed by mean of cyclic voltammetry (CV) technic under 5 m Vs−1 outcomes 107.29 F g−1 for FTO/PANI that rises to 249.03 F g−1 for the ternary composite film FTO/PANI-MnO2 75-GR.
