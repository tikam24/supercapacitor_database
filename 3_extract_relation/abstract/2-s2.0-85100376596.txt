Crystalline Mn3O4nanoparticles were prepared by olive leaf extract (OLE)-mediated wet chemistry under mild conditions. These nanoparticles are used as supported active material on a carbon working electrode in a set of room-temperature charge/discharge assays that allowed evidencing a clear pseudo-capacitance behavior with a high specific capacitance value (583.7 F g−1). The engineered electrode presented a good cycling stability: after 2000 cycles at a current density of 4 A g−1, keeping 87% of the initial value. At this current density, the measured specific energy (55.60 Wh.kg−1) and power (5.12 kW kg−1) were found to be quite competitive with other reports in the literature, highlighting the potential of the produced particles as supercapacitor electrode materials.
