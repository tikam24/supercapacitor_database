Supercapacitors have been regarded as one of the next-generation energy storage devices because of the high power density, excellent cycling performance, long lifespan and easy maintenance. However, its relatively low specific energy hinders its application in the future. Recently, Na-ion based aqueous hybrid supercapacitors have attracted worldwide attention due to its high energy density, environment friendly and low cost. In our work, the Na-ion aqueous hybrid supercapacitor is constructed with NaTi2(PO4)3/C and commercial activated carbon as electrode materials. NaTi2(PO4)3/C nanoparticles with the size of about 40 nm were synthesized by high-temperature solid state reaction method using the NaTi2(PO4)3/C precursor that was prepared through the solution method with Ti(C4H9O)4, NH4H2PO4, Na2CO3as the raw materials, and citric acid as the carbon source. The electrochemical tests were performed using 1 mol•L-1Na2SO4solution as the electrolyte. The carbon-coated NaTi2(PO4)3electrode delivers the discharge capacity of 122 mAh•g-1and shows an excellent cycling stability with the retention of 60% of the initial capacity after 1000 cycles at a 10C rate. The supercapacitor was consisted of NaTi2(PO4)3/C anode, AC cathode and 1 mol•L-1Na2SO4electrolyte. And the weight ratio of active materials in cathode and anode was 2.2. Cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic test were employed to study the electrochemical properties of the supercapacitor. The as-fabricated device was then cycled between 0.15~1.4 V with different current density. Our results show the power density of 121.15 W•kg-1 with specific energy of 18.71 Wh•kg-1at the current density of 0.5 A•g-1. Moreover, the specific energy and power density goes to 14.13 Wh•kg-1and 2.42 kW•kg-1at a higher current density of 10 A•g-1. More importantly, the device showed an excellent cycling stability with the retention of 76% after 1000 cycles at a current density of 1 A•g-1. This research shows the designed hybrid supercapacitor has the potential to be used as auxiliary high-power energy storage device for the practical applications.
