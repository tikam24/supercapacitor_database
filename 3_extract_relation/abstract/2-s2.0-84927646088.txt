Layered MoSe2 nanosheets were prepared on Ni-foam substrate with binder-free via a simple hydrothermal method. As the supercapacitor electrode material, the as-prepared materials showed high specific capacitance (1114.3 F g-1) and an extended long cycle life (maintain at least 104.7% after 1500 cycles) due to their specific structure, which showed significant potential for energy storage applications.
