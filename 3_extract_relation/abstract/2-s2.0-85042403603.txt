A film of a new redox conducting polymer, named poly[meso-Ni(II)-SaldMe], was prepared by electropolymerization of a meso-N,N′-bis-(salicylidene)-2,3-butanediaminonickel(II)] monomer, meso-Ni(II)-SaldMe. The poly[meso-Ni(II)-SaldMe] film revealed electroactivity in the potential range of 0.30–1.10 V vs. Ag/Ag+ and high durability. Specific capacitance, SC, of the film was ∼210 F g−1 (37.2 mF cm−2) at the scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The poly(meso-Ni(II)-SaldMe) film was utilized to fabricate a laboratory model of a new asymmetric supercapacitor with a dual anode and a dual cathode. Composites of reduced graphene oxide, RGO, with polypyrrole (PPy) and poly[meso-Ni(II)-SaldMe] served as a positive electrode (dual anode) while the negative electrode (dual cathode) consisted of composites of RGO with a C60-based polymer and PPy. The fabricated device exhibited a very broad working voltage range of 0–2.20 V in the 0.1 M (TBA)PF6 solution of propylene carbonate, thus allowing for maximum charging of all composite electrodes and delivering a high energy density of 102.60 W h kg−1 (18.2 μW h cm−2) at the power density of 12.21 kW kg−1 (2.2 μW cm−2). The life-time of charge-discharge cycling of this supercapacitor was excellent retaining 91% of its SC after 10 000 consecutive cycles.
