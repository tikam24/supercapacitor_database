This review covers recent developments and progress in polymer and biopolymer blending and material preparation by electrospinning. Electrospinning is a technique that is used to produce nanofibers to improve the quality of membranes. Electrospun nanofibers are highly applicable in biomedical sciences, supercapacitors, and in water treatment following metal ion adsorption. The key affecting factors of electrospinning have been checked in the literature to obtain optimal conditions of the electrospinning process. Future research directions and outlooks have been suggested to think about innovative ideas for research in this field.
