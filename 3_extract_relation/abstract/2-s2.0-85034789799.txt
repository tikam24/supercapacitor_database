Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate the fabrication of Fe 2 O 3 @LiCoO 2 hybrid nanostructures on Ni foam substrate by facile one-step hydrothermal technique. Morphological studies reveal that aggregated Fe 2 O 3 nanoflakes anchored on the surface of sphere-like LiCoO 2 nanoflakes. Electrochemical studies are used to examine the performance of the supercapacitor electrodes. The composite Fe 2 O 3 @LiCoO 2 electrode exhibited excellent electrochemical performance than Fe 2 O 3 and LiCoO 2 electrodes, such as a low charge transfer resistance, a high specific capacitance of 489 F g −1 at 5 mA cm −2 and an enhanced capacity retention of 108% over 3000 cycles at 15 mA cm −2 . The composite Fe 2 O 3 @LiCoO 2 holds great promise for electrochemical applications due to well-defined hierarchical morphology, synergetic effect of Fe 2 O 3 and LiCoO 2 , enhanced electrical conductivity, efficient electrolyte penetration and fast electron transfer.
