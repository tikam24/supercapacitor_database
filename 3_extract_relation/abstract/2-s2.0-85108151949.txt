Abstract: Thin-film vacuum technology permits the creation of new electrode materials on the basis of a flexible carbon matrix with a highly developed surface. Supercapacitor structures, pseudocapacitor structures, and hybrid structures have been produced and studied with a view to smart power storage and transportation.
