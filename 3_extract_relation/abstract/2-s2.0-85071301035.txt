Dynamic Wireless Power Transfer (DWPT)for charging of Electric Vehicles (EV)generates a transient profile of the inverter input power, which could potentially hamper the grid stability. In this paper, a novel topology is proposed that reduces power fluctuations at the input of a DWPT module. It employs a SuperCapacitor (SC)to serve as an energy buffering element at the roadside of the charger. Unlike the topologies proposed so far, the one described in this paper utilizes the existing power converter to control and smoothen the DWPT charger's input power profile. A full system analysis, modeling, controller design, and simulation has been performed to validate the idea and the design.
