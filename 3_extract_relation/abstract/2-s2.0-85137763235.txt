Due to modernization, the number of electrical gadgets have been increased and led to more consumption of electricity. As we know that most of the power produced is from conventional energy sources which resulted in different types of pollution. From those disadvantages, people started developing renewable energy technology leading to more advanced microgrids. In microgrids we can make use of various renewable energy resources such as PV and wind etc., these sources are not available all the time and are irregular due to these we need control techniques. Because of its change of nature maintaining power balance, voltage steadiness, and also to increase the life span of HESS is a risky thing. Hence a conventional, combined PI and sliding mode control (CPISMC) and adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control (AFSMC) are compared for better voltage regulation, managing the current flow among the system. In HESS the oscillating current is taken care by the supercapacitor and the average current is dealt by the battery which would increase the lifetime of BESS by keeping them within SOC limits. These three control techniques were tested to know their performances such as robustness, voltage deviation, how efficient they are in removing the chattering phenomenon, and their current sharing ability among HESS. After comparing all these performances, AFSMC is the best among them and these results were evaluated in MATLAB.
