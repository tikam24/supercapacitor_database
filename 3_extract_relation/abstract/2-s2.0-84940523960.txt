A green and one-step method of electrochemical alternating voltage has been utilized to form NiO quantum dots/graphene flakes (NiO-dots/Gh) for supercapacitor applications. NiO quantum dots (âˆ¼3 nm) are uniformly deposited on few-layer graphene surfaces by oxygen functional groups on graphene surface that is naturally utilized to bridge NiO and graphene through Ni-O-C bands, which exhibits outstanding specific capacitance 1181.1 F g<sup>-1</sup> at a current density of 2.1 A g<sup>-1</sup> and rate behavior 66.2% at 42 A g<sup>-1</sup> as NiO dots can be fleetly wired up to current collector through the underlying graphene two-dimensional layers. The NiO-dots/Gh composite is further undertaken in asymmetric supercapacitors with high energy density (27.3 Wh kg<sup>-1</sup> at 1562.6 W kg<sup>-1</sup>).
