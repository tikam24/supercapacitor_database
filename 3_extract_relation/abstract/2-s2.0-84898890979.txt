Polypyrrole/Graphene oxide composite material (PPy/GO) was synthesized using an in-situ chemical polymerization method. The formation of composite had been shown by the analysis of Fourier transfer of infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction data. Scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy clearly showed sheet-like layered structure of graphite oxide surrounded by polypyrrole. Electrochemical properties were characterized by electrochemical station. We demonstrated the intercalation of conducting polypyrrole into the graphite sheets, and that as electrodes for supercapacitor, the PPy/GO composites(GO0.54) with PPy to GO mass ratio of 5:3 showed a competitive capacitance of 337 F g-1 at a scan rate of 2 mV s-1 than that of PPy alone. Given the electrical and electrochemical properties, we prospect that the PPy/GO composites should find applications in supercapacitors. Â© (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
