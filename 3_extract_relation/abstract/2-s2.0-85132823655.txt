Creating a near-zero energy environment is a hot research topic, and this concept can also be applied to road tunnels. By introducing cleaner energy for power generation, we can achieve the goal of sustainable cities and society. This paper proposes a sliding plate-based transverse deceleration energy harvester for near-zero energy road tunnels. The system comprises four modules. The sliding plate absorbs the kinetic energy lost as the vehicle slows down, and the transmission module converts it to electrical energy via the generator. A supercapacitor is used to store electrical energy from a generator. The average output power of 5.135 W is obtained at a peak conversion efficiency of 64.4% under 1.5 Hz frequency and 10 mm amplitude. At 1.5 Hz frequency and 8 mm amplitude, the harvester can supercharge a 5 F capacity to 4 V in 220 s. For example, the Jiaozhou Bay Tunnel's annual power generation capacity can reach 110 kWÂ·h. The harvester can be installed at the tunnel's entrance and exit by recording the power ratings of tunnel lighting and common sensors, enabling self-powered applications in road tunnels.
