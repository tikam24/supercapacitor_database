Off-highway dump truck contains amounts of potential energy and kinetic energy. During the braking process, these two parts are consumed in the form of heat on the braking resistance, and the energy consumption will be about 24 percent of total energy consumption of the Truck. Hence, it is necessary to recover the braking energy. This paper, aiming at the characteristics of electric drive system in off-highway dump truck, proposes a new type of DC/DC main circuit which is a series connection topology that includes super-capacitor and battery hybrid energy storage, the DC bus's rate voltage is 1800v. The bottom controller is designed based on DSP + FPGA, which realizes the efficient control and protection of the system, and completes the recovery and utilization function of the braking energy in off-highway dump trucks. In the host computer, the monitoring system designed by utilizing of C#.net language, and the relay protection 103 communication protocol has been used to improve system stability. In this paper, the dynamic test platform of braking energy recovery system has been completed, after the dynamic test, the system has been install in Komatsu 730E dump truck of Pingshuo Anjialing surface coal mine to complete the field operation. The experimental result shows the effectiveness and reliability of the system.
