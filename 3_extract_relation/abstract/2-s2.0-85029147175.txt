Flexible supercapacitors have emerged as one of the more promising and efficient space-saving energy storage system for portable and wearable electronics. Laser-induced graphenization has been recently proposed as a powerful and scalable method to directly convert a polymeric substrate into a 3D network of few layer graphene as high-performance supercapacitor electrode. Unfortunately this outstanding process has been reported to be feasible only for few thermoplastic polymers, strongly limiting its future developments. Here we show that laser induced graphenization of sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) can be obtained and the mechanism of this novel process is proposed. The resulting material can act at the same time as binder-free electrode and current collector. Moreover SPEEK is also used both as separator and polymeric electrolyte allowing the assembling of an all-SPEEK flexible supercapacitor. Chemico-physical characterization provides deep understanding of the laser-induced graphenization process, reported on this polymer for the first time, while the device performance studied by cyclic voltammetry, chargingâ€“discharging, and impedance spectroscopy prove the enormous potential of the proposed approach.
