Zn is a promising anode for aqueous energy storage owing to it intrinsic superior properties such as large capacity, abundant reserves, low potential and safety. But, the growth of dendrites during charge and discharge leads to a decrease in reversibility. In addition, further development of zinc-ion hybrid capacitors (ZICs) is seriously challenging because of the lack of an exceptional cathode. Herein, we use ZIF-8 annealed at 500 °C (annealed ZIF-8) as a host material for stable and dendrite-free Zn anodes. Utilization of annealed ZIF-8 results in dendrite-free Zn deposition and stripping as a result of its porous construction, which contains trace Zn. Furthermore, we firstly proposed innovative N,O dual-doped carbon which was designed by the derived ZIF-8 (ZIF-8 derived C) as cathode for high-energy and power-density ZICs. The new ZIC assembled by Zn@annealed ZIF-8 anode and ZIF-8 derived C cathode provides a capacity of 135.5 mAh g−1 and an energy density of 108.4 Wh kg−1 with a power density of 800 W kg−1 at 1.0 A g−1. In addition, it shows outstanding cycling stability of 91% capacity retention after 6000 cycles at 5.0 A g−1. Moreover, the solid-state ZICs can drive LEDs and smart watches. This ZIC holds promise for the practical application of supercapacitors.
