α-MoO3 powders for the application of supercapacitor active material was prepared by using (NH4)6Mo7 O24·4H2O and HAc as raw materials. Carbon aerogel was prepared by the polycondensation of resorcinol (R) with formaldehyde (F), and sodium carbonate was added as a catalyst (C). The physical properties of α-MoO3 and carbon aerogel were characterized by X-ray diffractrometry (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical performances of α-MoO3/CRF composite electrodes with different ratios were studied. The good electrochemical performances of carbon aerogel electrode and α-MoO3 /CRF composite electrodes were confirmed by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurement. The results indicate that the specific capacitance of carbon aerogel electrode is approximately 110.8 F/g. However, when the loading quantity of MoO3 is 10%, the specific capacitance of α-MoO3/CRF can reach 279. 8 F/g, and the specific capacitance of the supercapacitor is 47.6 F/g.
