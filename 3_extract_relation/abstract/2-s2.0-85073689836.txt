Nitrogen/sulfur co-doped porous carbons (NSPCs) receive extensive attention in recent years, but the cost-efficient preparation of NSPCs remains a challenge. In this work, one-step carbonization of biowaste (bamboo shoot shells, BSS)/poly(3,4-ethyldioxythiophene) (PEDOT) composite is used to prepare NSPC. The introduction of PEDOT into biowaste precursor leads to the higher S content and the larger specific surface area of the obtained NSPC. In symmetric supercapacitors, the NSPC (specifically sample PC-600) gives a gravimetric capacitance of 302.5 F g−1 at current density of 0.5 A g−1 and excellent capacitance retention of 87% after 10,000 cycles at 5 A g−1 in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The energy density reaches 30.60 Wh kg−1 at power density of 468.75 W kg−1 in 1 M 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (EMIMPF6) electrolyte and the supercapacitor powers fourteen yellow light emitting diodes (LEDs) for 30 s after charging for 2 s. We believe that the PC-600 is a promising electrode material for high performance supercapacitors.
