The ultrathin amorphous Co-Fe-B nanosheets on the three dimensional nickel foam substrate is fabricated by a facile one-step chemical reduction method. Due to the amorphous structure and ultrathin nanosheet morphology, the Co-Fe-B material shows an excellent specific capacitance (≈981 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and high rate performance. In addition, the Co-Fe-B//active carbon (Co-Fe-B//AC) asymmetric supercapacitors were prepared. The ASC shows a maximum energy density of 21 W h kg−1 (calculated by active materials weight). It also displays excellent long-term stability and the capacitance increase 26% after 5000 cycles. These outstanding supercapacitor performances demonstrate Co-Fe-B material as a low cost candidate material applying to energy storage and conversion.
