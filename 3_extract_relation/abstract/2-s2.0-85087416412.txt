Pyrochlore structured nickel vanadate nanorods had been prepared by simple co-precipitation method. It was examined for pseudocapacitor electrode material. Morphological, optical and structural aspects of synthesized materials had been studied using a high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, UVâ€“Visible absorption spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction analysis, respectively. The functional groups, stretching and bending vibrations were traced by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and the formation of nickel vanadate nanorods was confirmed by the binding energy analysis through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies. The rod-shaped nanostructures of pyro nickel vanadate were confirmed by the scanning electron microscopy and HR-TEM analysis. Electrochemical techniques such as cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques were used to analyse the supercapacitive behaviour of the prepared nanorods. Pyro nickel vanadate nanorods possesses excellent electrochemical stability up to 3000 cycles and the performance retention of about 94.1% was achieved even after 3000 repetitive charge-discharge cycles.
