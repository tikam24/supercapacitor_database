This paper proposes and experimentally validates an online energy management system (EMS) based on improved power frequency approach to meet the load requirements and enhance operating efficiency of fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV). Within the proposed approach, a frequency-driven power splitter is used to assign lower frequencies of power demand towards the fuel cell and higher frequencies to the supercapacitor, which is used as a peak power unit. Subsequently, battery is directly connected with the DC bus, which behaves as an energy buffer. To realize the limitations of storage devices, a local supervisor is integrated in the frequency-based approach. Using the energy macroscopic representation (EMR), the details of FCEV components and power frequency approach are described. In addition, the interactions and energy exchanges between sources are analyzed. The proposed approach is experimentally validated using Opal-RT and dSPACE systems within Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) platform. Based on the experimental set-up, proposed EMS is tested under real-time conditions. Experimental results show stable vehicular operation and improved performance of FCEV in different real-world driving cycles.
