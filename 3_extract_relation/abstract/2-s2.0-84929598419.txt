Abstract A novel ternary Ag decorated CeO2/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposite was synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as surface directing agent and was designed as an electrode material for supercapacitors application. The structure and morphology of the nanocomposites were analyzed by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The synergistic effect between the CeO2 nanoparticles wrapped rGO matrix with Ag nanoparticles gives rise to a nanostructure, empowering the material with enhanced electrochemical performance. The electrochemical characterization was performed using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic studies in 3 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. The nanocomposite electrode materials possess a high specific capacitance of 710.42 F g-1 at an applied current density of 0.2 A g-1, which was nearly two fold higher than CeO2/rGO nanocomposite. This work endows a new route for building Ag/CeO2/rGO ternary nanocomposite which will have some impact on the exploitation of novel ternary electrode materials for supercapacitor applications.
