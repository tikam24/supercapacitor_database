A film-state conjugated microporous polymer constructed with zinc porphyrin cores and dimeric carbazole linkages is fabricated by electropolymerization. With its rich micropores and excellent reversible redox processes, the novel conjugated microporous polymer film is fabricated into a supercapacitor that demonstrates high capacitance up to 142 F g-1 and good capacitance retention at high current densities.
