The exchange processes of previously accumulated electrical energy between parallel connected linear capacitor and nonlinear one or between links of electrical equivalent circuit of supercapacitors, electric capacity of which depends on the voltage on the capacitor plates are studied. It is determined the regularities of the influence of initial voltages and capacities ratio of the linear capacitor and nonlinear one (or links of an electrical equivalent circuit of supercapacitors), on energy loss arising at this energy exchange. Conditions for decrease of losses of the electric power and increase in energy-transfer coefficient at transfer from a nonlinear capacitor element to linear one and vice versa are defined.
