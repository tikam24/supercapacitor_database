Microgrids (μ-grids) are gaining increased interest around the world for supplying cheap and clean energy. In this paper, a μ-grid comprising a wind turbine generator (WTG) and diesel generator (DG) is considered. It is one of most practical and demanding systems suitable for the present energy crisis in isolated or rural areas. However, wind energy is intermittent in nature while load demand changes frequently. Therefore, a µ-grid can experience large frequency and power fluctuations. The speed governor of the DG tries to minimize the frequency and power deviations in µ-grid though its operation is slow and cannot adequately minimize system deviations. The paper proposes a novel arrangement based on a dual structured fuzzy (DSF) whose structure changes according to the switching limit with a reduced rule base. It has the capability to switch between proportional and integral actions and hence improves the frequency regularization of the μ-grid. The proposed strategy is tested in a μ-grid and the results considering step load alteration, load alteration at different instants of time, nonstop changing load request are compared with some of the well published methods to validate the effectiveness and simplicity of the present design. In addition, it shows that ultra-capacitor establishment in a μ-grid has a positive impact in minimizing system deviations with DSF for the studied cases.
