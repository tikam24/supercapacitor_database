Hierarchical mesoporous NiCo2S4@MnO2 core-shell structured arrays on nickel foam were designed and fabricated using a facile hydrothermal method for supercapacitor applications. The electrodes exhibited rapid electron and ion transport, large electroactive surface area, and excellent structural stability owing to the highly conducting nature of the well-defined mesoporous NiCo2S4 nanowire arrays in combination with the large surface area provided by the ultrathin MnO2 nanosheets and ultralong MnO2 nanowires, as well as to the open framework of the three-dimensional nanoarchitectures. The specific capacitance of the resulting electrode was as high as 17.5 F cm-2 at a very high current density of 100 mA cm-2, highlighting its potential as an efficient electrode for electrochemical capacitors.
