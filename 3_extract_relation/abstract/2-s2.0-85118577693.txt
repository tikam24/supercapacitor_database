Widening the possibilities of all-inorganic perovskite materials beyond well-investigated optoelectronic aspects, in this work it has been introduced as a potential electrode material for supercapacitors. Adopting an ambient condition, low-cost, solution processable facile approach we have prepared cesium lead bromide perovskite (CsPbBr3) rod shaped sample. As fabricated electrodes based on CsPbBr3 were subjected to cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and electronic impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test. It offered good electrochemical features with specific capacitance of 121 F/g at the scan rate of 5 mV/s. Aqueous symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) with this electrode exhibited significant capacitive retention âˆ¼73% of its initial capacitance even after 5000 charging and discharging cycles. Electrochemical behaviour registered form the CsPbBr3 is explained in details on the basis of diffusion-controlled process. Such results of the devised supercapacitors show its promises in other electrochemical applications and will pave a pathway to develop new perovskite materials for supercapacitors.
