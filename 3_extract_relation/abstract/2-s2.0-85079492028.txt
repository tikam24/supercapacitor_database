A supercapacitor (SC) is an energy storage device that bridges the gap between conventional capacitors and rechargeable batteries. Emerging architectured nanomaterials are promising for electrode designs for supercapacitors (SCs) due to their unique strategies utilizing electrochemical double-layer capacitance (EDLC) or pseudo-capacitance or both to optimize the energy storage capability and electrochemical (EC) stability. This chapter presents recent advances in metal oxide and carbon-based nanomaterials for supercapacitance energy storage. First, a brief introduction of current SC technologies is given. After that, the research development on the nanoarchitectured carbon and carbon-metal oxide composites in recent years is summarized and classified with various carbon nanomaterials (CNMs). Finally, the advanced strategies of energy storage to increase key performance parameters in terms of specific surface area, specific capacitance, and cyclic stability along with the future challenges are discussed.
