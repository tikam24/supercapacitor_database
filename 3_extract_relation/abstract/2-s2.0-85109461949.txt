A promising method for the direct growth of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) on aluminum foil for supercapacitor electrodes has been developed. Mild oxidation of aluminum foil in a nickel nitrate solution was used to give catalytic properties to aluminum. After the treatment, the detected concentration of nickel in the surface layer of the aluminum foil was 20 wt%. Low-temperature deposition of MWCNTs was carried out by catalytic pyrolysis of ethanol vapor using liquid ethanol as the only precursor. The resulting MWCNTs layers had excellent adhesion to aluminum foil. A symmetrical two-electrode cell as well as a classical three-electrode cell, were used for electrochemical testing of the obtained materials. The cell with MWCNTs/Al foil electrodes exhibits the behavior of an electric double layer capacitor (EDLC). The specific capacity of the MWCNTs reaches 60F/g. This result is comparable to the characteristics of similar materials obtained by other methods. Excellent resistance to multiple chargeâ€“discharge cycles is also shown.
