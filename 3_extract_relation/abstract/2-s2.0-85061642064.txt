Polyaniline/cellulous-derived highly porous activated carbons (PANI/C-ACs) composites have been synthesized for high-performance supercapacitors via a simple and economical method. The obtained three-dimensional and hierarchical porous structure of PANI/C-ACs, not only exhibited high specific surface area and electron conductivity, but also promoted electrolyte ion transportation, facilitated fast and stable surface redox reactions, hence synergistically improved the overall capacitive performance. The as-designed PANI/C-ACs composites exhibited a specific capacitance of 765 F/g at 1 A/g and capacitance retention of two-electrode cell was as high as 91% after 5000 cycles. Moreover, evident pseudocapacitive behavior can be well maintained at high current densities, indicating superior rate capability for these hierarchically structured composites, making them promising electrode materials for high performance supercapacitors.
