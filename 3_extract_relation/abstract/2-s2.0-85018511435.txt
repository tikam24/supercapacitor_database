The 3D mat-like electroactive hydrogel for application as electrode material for supercapacitor was fabricated by chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline in the solution containing two dopants: organic copolymer of acrylamide with 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-propanesulfonic acid and inorganic HCl. Electrochemical tests revealed that utilization of two dopants gave a high areal capacitance 8.1 F cm−2 at current density 5.1 mA cm−2. Prepared electrode material retains 47% of initial capacitance after applying of 5000 charge-discharge cycles.
