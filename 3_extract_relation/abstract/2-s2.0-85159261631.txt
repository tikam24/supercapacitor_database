The study provides a study on energy storage technologies for photovoltaic and wind systems in response to the growing demand for low-carbon transportation. Energy storage systems (ESSs) have become an emerging area of renewed interest as a critical factor in renewable energy systems. The technology choice depends essentially on system requirements, cost, and performance characteristics. Common types of ESSs for renewable energy sources include electrochemical energy storage (batteries, fuel cells for hydrogen storage, and flow batteries), mechanical energy storage (including pumped hydroelectric energy storage (PHES), gravity energy storage (GES), compressed air energy storage (CAES), and flywheel energy storage), electrical energy storage (such as supercapacitor energy storage (SES), superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES), and thermal energy storage (TES)), and hybrid or multi-storage systems that combine two or more technologies, such as integrating batteries with pumped hydroelectric storage or using supercapacitors and thermal energy storage. These different categories of ESS enable the storage and release of excess energy from renewable sources to ensure a reliable and stable supply of renewable energy. The optimal storage technology for a specific application in photovoltaic and wind systems will depend on the specific requirements of the system. It is important to carefully evaluate these needs and consider factors, such as power and energy requirements, efficiency, cost, scalability, and durability when selecting an ESS technology.
