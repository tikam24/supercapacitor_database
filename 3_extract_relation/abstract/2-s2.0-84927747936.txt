CA/Co3O4 composite electrode material was obtained by electrochemical deposition method. carbon aerogel (CA) as the substrate, deposition Co(OH)2 in carbon aerogel (CA) and by heat treatment process. The samples phase structure and morphology were characterized by means of XRD, SEM. electrochemical performance were characterized by means of cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, AC impedance measurements. The results show that: Preparation the composite electrode materials of CA/Co3O4 by electrochemical deposition method, specific capacitance was up to 1020 and 646 F/g at the current density of 0.5 and 5 A/g, respectively. Can be see Co3O4 Composite, can greatly improve the electrochemical performance.
