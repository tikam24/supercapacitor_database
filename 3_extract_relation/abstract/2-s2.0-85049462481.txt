Interconnected porous carbons were successfully synthesized via a facile one-step method from abundant and low-cost coal tar pitch (CTP) and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) for high-performance supercapacitors. The as-prepared IPCs possess unique interconnected porous networks and large surface area (up to 3305 m2 g−1), which could mainly be ascribed to the combined effects of template effect from MCC and adequate KOH activation during pyrolysis. MCC can be converted into crumbed graphene sheets and embedded into the derived carbon block during activation, thereby improving the electron transfer pathway. IPC2-0.2-8 with exceptionally large surface area, well-developed porosity and 3D interconnected networks exhibits high capacitance of 308 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, good capacitance retention of 75% even at a high current density of 20 A g−1, and excellent cycling stability in 6 M KOH electrolyte. The symmetric supercapacitor can deliver an energy density of 21.9 Wh kg−1 at a high power density of 461.6 W kg−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Easy synthesis, low cost, and excellent electrochemical performance make IPCs hold great promise for potential applications in energy-related technological fields.
