NiCo2O4 nanoleaf arrays (NCO NLAs) and NiCo2O4/NiCO2O4 nanofile arrays (NCO/NCO NFAs) material was fabricated on flexible nickel foam (NF) using a facile hydrothermal approach. The electrochemical performance, including the specific capacitance, charge/discharge cycles, and lifecycle of the material after the hydrothermal treatment, was assessed. The morphological and structural behaviors of the NF@NCO NLAs and NF@NCO/NCO NFAs electrodes were analyzed using a range of analysis techniques. The as-obtained nanocomposite of the NF@NCO/NCO NFAs material delivered outstanding electrochemical performance, including an ultrahigh specific capacitance (Cs) of 2312 F g−1 at a current density of 2 mA cm−2, along with excellent cycling stability (98.7% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 5 mA cm−2). These values were higher than those of NF@NCO NLAs (Cs of 1950 F g−1 and 96.3% retention). The enhanced specific capacitance was attributed to the large electrochemical surface area, which allows for higher electrical conductivity and rapid transport between the electrons and ions as well as a much lower charge-transfer resistance and superior rate capability. These results clearly show that a combination of two types of binary metal oxides could be favorable for improving electrochemical performance and is expected to play a major role in the future development of nanofile-like composites (NF@NCO/NCO NFAs) for supercapacitor applications.
