Advances in organic electronics necessitates, ultrathin and miniaturized implantable energy storage modules. Here, an approach for the fabrication of on-chip, ultraflexible electrochemical capacitors is demonstrated. Two different electroactive conjugated polymers are utilized in a fabrication route that allows the patterning of finger electrodes for an ultraflexible energy storage technology. A strategy is demonstrated to realize supercapacitors with a total device thickness of 4 μm, including substrate, polymer electrode, and electrolyte. Interdigitated 20-finger electrodes from either Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) or polythiophene functionalized with tetraethylene glycol side chains P(g42T-T), with 50 μm or 90 μm electrode spacings, are fabricated using a parylene peel off method, followed by electrolyte deposition. The miniaturized devices show 0.77 mF/cm2 areal capacitance for PEDOT:PSS and 0.06 mF/cm2 for P(g42T-T). Furthermore, the devices exhibit excellent mechanical durability, showing robust operational performance at a bending radius of 6.5 mm.
