Graphene with highly flaky state has been successfully prepared through chemical reduction process with the assistance of potassium chloride (KCl) to enhance the ionic strength in the aqueous solution. The microstructure of gra-phene sheets (GS) prepared in different solutions was compared and the effect of the KCl on the dispersion of GS was investigated. The buoyancy and repulsive force from the ions in the solution were effective to prevent the graphene sheets from agglomerating with each other. SEM and TEM images showed that the graphene reduced in KCl solution has kept the highly flaky state whereas the graphene reduced in pure water has curled and re-stacked together. As for supercapacitor electrode application, the highly flaky graphene showed much higher specific capacitance than the agglomerated one in 1 M Li 2SO 4 electrolyte. The more accessible surface of the gra-phene reduced with KCl assistance effectively enhanced the electric double layer capacitance. Â© 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
