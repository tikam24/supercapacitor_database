Understanding ion adsorption in nanoporous carbon electrodes is of great importance for designing the next-generation of high energy density electrical double-layer capacitors. In this work, X-ray scattering is used for investigating the impregnation of nanoporous carbons with electrolytes in the absence of applied potential. We are able to show that interactions between the carbon surface and electrolytes allow adsorption to take place in sub-nanopores, thus confirming experimentally for the first time the results predicted by molecular dynamic simulations.
