Herein, nickel nanocones and zinc oxide nanosheets were electroplated onto a fabric to produce multifunctional (wearable, stretchable, washable, hydrophobic, and antibacterial) materials with sensing, heating, and supercapacitive properties. All these functionalities are integrated into a one-layered fabric that can be used as a portable intelligent electronic textile for potential application in healthcare monitoring, smart sportswear, and energy storage. Electroplated nickel enhances the electrical conductivity and thus increases the electron charge transfer for supercapacitor applications. The integration of ZnO with the Ni-plated fabric provides pseudocapacitance via redox reactions with the electrolyte. The resistance of the Ni/ZnO fabric changes in response to external stimuli such as temperature and strain. When voltage is applied, the fabric generates heat through Joule heating, demonstrating its potential application as winter sportswear. The superior mechanical durability of the fabric was confirmed through bending and stretching tests. The hydrophobic surface prevents viruses contained in liquid droplets from infiltrating the fabric. In addition, bacterial growth is inhibited because of the antibacterial properties of the Ni/ZnO fabric and because of Joule heating. The one-layered fabric integrated with such multiple functionalities is expected to be applicable in the development of next-generation portable and wearable electronic textiles in various industries.
