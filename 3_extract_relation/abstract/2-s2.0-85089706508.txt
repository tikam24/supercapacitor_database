Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have the characteristics of extremely high porosity, diverse nanostructures and high theoretical specific capacities, and are widely used in batteries or capacitors. Today, research on MOFs has not been interrupted. However, in practical applications, MOFs still have the disadvantages of serious volume expansion and poor cycle stability. Therefore, this paper reviews some recent studies on improving the capacitance characteristics of transition metal oxide electrode materials derived from MOFs. We focus on the application of MOFs-derived mixed metal (Ni, Co, Mn) oxides in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), supercapacitors (SCs) and lithium-ion capacitors (LICs). And we analyze the problems that may be faced in the preparation of materials and give our views.
