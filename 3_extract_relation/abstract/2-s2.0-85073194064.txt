Supercapacitors or ultracapacitors are considered as one of the potential candidates in the domain of energy storage devices for the forthcoming generations. These devices have earned their significance in numerous applications, viz., to power hybrid electric/electric vehicles and other power and electronic systems which require electrical energy for their operation. Supercapacitors are the most versatile devices which are most widely used for delivery of electrical energy in short time and in arenas which demand long shelf life. Therefore, the development of supercapacitors has huge market requirements, and long-term progress is needed for their successful advancement and commercialization. Meanwhile, supercapacitors are also facing challenges such as technical problems, establishing electrical parameter models, consistency testing, and establishing industrial standards. In this paper, the above challenges and the future development opportunities of supercapacitors are introduced in detail. This perspective will provide corresponding guidance and new directions for the development of supercapacitors.
