We demonstrate the design and fabrication of a novel flexible nanoarchitecture by facile coating ultrathin (several nanometers thick) films of MnO2 to highly electrical conductive Zn2SnO4 (ZTO) nanowires grown radially on carbon microfibers (CMFs) to achieve high specific capacitance, high-energy density, high-power density, and long-term life for supercapacitor electrode applications. The crystalline ZTO nanowires grown on CMFs were uniquely served as highly conductive cores to support a highly electrolytic accessible surface area of redox active MnO2 shells and also provide reliable electrical connections to the MnO2 shells. The maximum specific capacitances of 621.6 F/g (based on pristine MnO2) by cyclic voltammetry (CV) at a scan rate of 2 mV/s and 642.4 F/g by chronopotentiometry at a current density of 1 A/g were achieved in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. The hybrid MnO 2/ZTO/CMF hybrid composite also exhibited excellent rate capability with specific energy of 36.8 Wh/kg and specific power of 32 kW/kg at current density of 40 A/g, respectively, and good long-term cycling stability (only 1.2% loss of its initial specific capacitance after 1000 cycles). These results suggest that such MnO2/ZTO/CF hybrid composite architecture is very promising for next generation high-performance supercapacitors. Â© 2011 American Chemical Society.
