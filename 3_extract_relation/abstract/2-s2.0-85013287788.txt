Nickel hydroxide is an active material for a wide range of chemical power sources: various types of alkaline accumulators and hybrid supercapacitors. In order to obtain maximum electrode capacity and charge efficiency, the optimization of the electrode composition i.e. the content of activating and electroconductive additives and the binder is needed. The amount of these compounds is governed by various factors, the influence of which is different and often non-linear. The factors that can affect the specific capacity and are determined by the binder content have been reviewed. The effect of these factors has been demonstrated experimentally. The influence of the binder content has been studied. The study has been carried out using polytetrafluoroethylene suspension as a binder, and components used in the manufacturing of accumulators: industrial sample of nickel hydroxide "Bochemie", and electroconductive additive GAK-1. The optimal binder content in active mass has been determined to be 2 %. It has been demonstrated that PTFE content of 1 % in active mass is insufficient for good contact of active mass with the electrode, resulting in a maximum capacity of 11 F/g at 40 mA/cm2. The PTFE concentration of 3 % is excessive and under high current densities leads to screening of active material particles, with a maximum capacity of 67 F/g at 20 M/cm2. The best result for specific capacity has been achieved with PTFE content of 2 % and current density of 40 mA/cm2 - 67 F/g. After analyzing the acquired data, it has been assumed that optimal binder content may depend on the particular type of hydroxide, namely its structure and morphology.
