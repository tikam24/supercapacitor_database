Herein, we report the design of N-doped graphene anchored Zn3V2O8 (MTMO) composite material prepared via hydrothermal method to facilitate more active channels for ion intercalation and to improve the specific capacitance for supercapacitor electrode applications. The sheet like morphology of the Zn3V2O8@graphene (GVZ) composite offered additional active sites for ion buffering at electrode –electrolyte interface. When employed as a supercapacitor electrode, the composite demonstrated attractive capacitive features like capacitance 395 Fg−1at a current density of 1 Ag−1, good rate capacitance (232 Fg−1 @10 Ag−1) and better cyclic stability after 5000 cycles. Besides, this asymmetric supercapacitor could deliver an energy density of 10 Whkg−1 at a power density of 312 Wkg−1. The device showed 77 % of capacitance retention even after 5000 cycles.
