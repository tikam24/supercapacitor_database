Cellulose has been increasingly utilized in the area of flexible supercapacitor, biosensor, and electromagnetic shielding because of its unique advantages of lightweight, biocompatibility and flexibility. The polyhydroxy structure of cellulose is beneficial for the transmission of electrolyte ions, resulting in the good performance of the electric capacity and cyclical stability for flexible electrode materials. Furthermore, flexible cellulose-based electrode can be obtained by coating, compounding, layer-by-layer self-assembling and in situ chemical polymerization with electroconductive materials(e.g., graphene, carbon nanotubes, conductive polymer and so on). Resent researches of the cellulose-based flexible electrode materials from different cellulose-based raw materials(original cellulose, nanocellulose and cellulose derivatives) were introduced in this review and the preparation methods and electrochemical properties of the obtained materials were also focused. The contributions of cellulose-based materials in the flexible electrode were categorized as: the backbone for supporting the flexible electrode material, the flexible substrates(or separator) and the ion channel for electrolyte. The future development and the challenges in the area of cellulose-based flexible electrode were also prospected.
