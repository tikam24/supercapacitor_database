High electrical conductivity and rational design of structures are two crucial routes to improving the electrochemical performance of electrode materials. However, highly conductive electrode materials with short ion-transport paths remain a challenge in energy storage. Here, we propose manganese cobalt sulfide (MnCo2S4) nanowire wrapping by a flocculent shell layer using a facile hydrothermal method with post-sulfurization treatment. The resultant MnCo2S4electrode employed for supercapacitor delivered a remarkable specific capacitance of 2067 F g−1at the current density of 1 A g−1, good rate capability, and excellent cycling stability. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor device was successfully assembled using MnCo2S4and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as electrodes, achieving a high energy density of 31.3 W kg−1at a power density of 800 W kg−1. With such outstanding electrochemical performance, this asymmetric supercapacitor device holds great potential in developing high-energy-storage applications.
