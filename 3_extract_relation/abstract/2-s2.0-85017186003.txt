The design and development of durable and high efficient supercapacitors is highly desired in electronic and energy storage devices. Traditional carbon based capacitors suffer from low specific capacitance and energy density. Recently transition metal sulfides are attractive alternatives for crystal electrode materials. Herein we demonstrate a facial design and synthetic method to grow novel metal sulfide double-shelled polyhedral nanocages consisting of mesoporous amorphous NixSy@CoS via a metal-organic-framework engaged strategy for use in supercapacitors. The NixSy@CoS polyhedrons with the inner and outer-shells respectively consisting of CoS and NixSy are obtained at mild room temperature without further thermal-treatment. The outer-shell is easily adjustable to suit various combinations according to the requirement. The morphological and structural evolution of the NixSy@CoS nanocages was studied systematically. Further electrochemical performance shows that the NixSy@CoS exhibits remarkably high capacitance of 2291 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 in 6 M KOH aqueous solution.
