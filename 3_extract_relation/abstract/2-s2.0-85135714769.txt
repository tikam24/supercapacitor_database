Phthalocyanines (Pc)-derived materials represent an attractive category of porous organic scaffolds featured by extensive π-conjugated networks, but their construction is still limited to the solution-based pathways, producing materials with inferior conductivity and porosity. Herein, a mechanochemistry-driven approach was developed leveraging the on-surface polymerization of aromatic nitrile monomers with ortho-positioned dicyano groups in the presence of metal catalysts (magnesium, zinc, or aluminum) under neat and ambient conditions. Diverse Pc-functionalized conjugated porous networks (Pc-CPNs) were obtained featured by extensively and fully π-conjugated skeletons, high surface areas, and hierarchical porosities. The monomers in this mechanochemical approach could be extended to those difficult to be handled in solution-based procedures. The Pc-CPNs displayed attractive electrochemical performance as supercapacitor and anodes in batteries, together with superb long-term stability.
