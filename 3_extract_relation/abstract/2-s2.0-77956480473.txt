Spinel Li 4Mn 5O 12 nanoparticles are successfully prepared by water-in-oil microemulsion method and characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The Li 4Mn 5O 12 nanoparticles have spherelike morphology with particle size less than 50 nm. The Li 4Mn 5O 12 and activated carbon (AC) were used as electrodes of Li 4Mn 5O 12/AC supercapacitor, respectively. The electrochemical capacitance performance of the supercapacitor was investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results showed that the single electrode was able to deliver specific capacitance 252 F g -1 within potential range 0-1.4 V at a scan rate of 5 mV s -1in 1 mol L -1 Li 2SO 4 solution, and it also showed high coulombic efficiency close to 100%. This material exhibited a good cycling performance. Â© Springer-Verlag 2009.
