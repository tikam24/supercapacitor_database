Large-area manganese oxide nanorod arrays (MONRAs) and herringbones (MOHBs) were successfully synthesized on F-doped SnO 2 coated glass (FTO) substrates by a simple electrochemical method. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements demonstrated that the MONRAs and MOHBs exhibited excellent specific capacitance and good cycling stability in 0.5 M Na 2SO 4 aqueous solution. For example, the specific capacitance of the MONRAs achieves as high as 660.7 F g -1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s -1 and 485.2 F g -1 at a current density of 3 A g -1, respectively. Furthermore, the presented method may be extended to allow similar MONRs with a specific capacitance of 583.6 F g -1 to grow on flexible Ti foil, which may have great potential application in fabricating flexible supercapacitors.
