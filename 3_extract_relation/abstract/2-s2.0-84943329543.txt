The Mo0.91W0.09S2/amorphous carbon nanosheets were successfully synthesized via a facile solid-sate reaction. As the supercapacitor electrode material, the as-prepared Mo0.91W0.09S2/C showed high specific capacitance of 432.7 Fg-1 and long cycle life (its capacitance can remain 93.8% after 500 cycles) due to their specific structure and the synergistic effects between ultrathin nanosheets and carbon, which showed significant potential for energy storage applications.
