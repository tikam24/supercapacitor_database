A comparison of different transient responses by a supercapacitor and battery reacting to a load is presented in this paper. The main focus is improving energy storage systems designed to support a DC-microgrid. This is done by introducing the two storage devices to act as stabilization elements. Through simulations in Matlab®/Simulink® and physical models, a comparison is achieved. Transient characteristics from the simulations tend to give a faster response than the physical. Verification on the error between ideal and physical are analyzed based on the results.
