Transition metallic oxides have attracted considerable attention for supercapacitor applications because of their superior electrochemical performance at relatively low cost. Co 3 O 4 /NiO nanofilms were successfully prepared by calcination of precursor α-Co(OH) 2 /α-Ni(OH) 2 . XRD, XPS, SEM and TEM techniques were used to characterize the composition and morphology of as-prepared samples. The results demonstrated that Co 3 O 4 /NiO nanofilms presented graphene-like morphology with shrinkage and wrinkles. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) measurement showed that specific surface area of Co 3 O 4 /NiO was 176.5 m 2 /g. Electrochemical properties tests indicated that the Co 3 O 4 /NiO nanofilms had a higher specific capacitance and better rate capability than that of precursor α-Co(OH) 2 /α-Ni(OH) 2 at high current density. As to the cycling performance, the specific capacitance of Co 3 O 4 /NiO electrode would first increase from 556 F/g to 710 F/g quickly at 2 A/g after 80 cycles and then remained stable. Therefore, compared with that of precursor α-Co(OH) 2 /α-Ni(OH) 2 , the capacitance performance of as-prepared Co 3 O 4 /NiO nanofilms was improved after calcination. The possible reason for the enhancement of capacitance performance was discussed.
