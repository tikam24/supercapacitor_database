As a green and sustainable porous material, wood has attracted more and more attention of researchers, especially in the field of energy storage. However, the poor conductivity of wood limits its application. Herein, a kind of non-carbonized lignin-free wood (LFW)@PANI supercapacitor material is fabricated for renewable energy storage application. The resultant hybrid used as electrode material of supercapacitor shows a good comprehensive electrochemical performance: 1) A high cycle stability of ~96% after experiencing 5000 cycles. 2) A high specific capacitance of ~800 F g−1 and 192 F cm−3 3) Good rate performance. 4) A high energy efficiency of more than 80%. 5) High energy densities of 41 Wh kg−1 (57 Wh L−1), meanwhile maintaining high power densities of 43 kW L−1 (68 kW kg−1). Compared with the way of carbonization, non-carbonized treatment not only save energy but also be greener. This work is expected to provide more insights and possibilities for application of renewable wood-based materials.
