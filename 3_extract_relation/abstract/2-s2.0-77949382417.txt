An innovative subway has been proposed using supercapacitors as the main energy source. Different steps have been defined in order to check the performance of this new supply system on a real subway. In this paper, a reduced-scale hardware-in-the-loop simulation is presented for initial experimental validations on a reduced-power experimental setup. Special attention is paid to reproducing torque, acceleration, and jerk limitations of the real system. Â© 2010 IEEE.
