Mn3O4 has attracted great interest due to its pseudocapacitive properties, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, the low conductivity and high-volume expansion limit its application to supercapacitors. In this research, a flower-like Mn3O4/reduced graphene (rGO) electrode material was obtained by a one-step solvothermal process. The as-prepared Mn3O4/rGO electrode exhibits a high capacity of 118.375 mAh g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and an excellent cycle ability of 88.1% after 4000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g−1. The high performance of the Mn3O4/rGO electrode can be attributed to the hierarchical structure and improved charge transfer capability as well as buffer space for the volume expansion by the addition of rGO. The nanoflower-like structure of Mn3O4/rGO provides a more active sites and short ion transport pathway during the redox reaction. The results provide an efficient way of improving the electrochemical performance of Mn3O4 and show its great potential in SC applications.
