Excellent self-healability and cold resistance are attractive properties for a portable/wearable energy-storage device. However, achieving the features is fundamentally dependent on an intrinsically self-healable electrolyte with high ionic conduction at low temperature. Here we report such a hydrogel electrolyte comprising sodium alginate cross-linked by dynamic catechol-borate ester bonding. Since its dynamically cross-linked alginate network can tolerate high-content inorganic salts, the electrolyte possesses excellent healing efficiency/cyclability but also high ionic conduction at both room temperature and low temperature. A supercapacitor with the multifunctional hydrogel electrolyte completely restores its capacitive properties even after breaking/healing for 10 cycles without external stimulus. At a low temperature of −10 °C, the capacitor is even able to maintain at least 80% of its room-temperature capacitance. Our investigations offer a strategy to assemble self-healable and cold-resistant energy storage devices by using a multifunctional hydrogel electrolyte with rationally designed polymeric networks, which has potential application in portable/wearable electronics, intelligent apparel or flexible robot, and so on.
