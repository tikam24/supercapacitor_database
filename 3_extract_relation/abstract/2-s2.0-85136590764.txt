In this work, the NiS2nanosheets have been synthesized using Ni(OH)2as a precursor through a sacrificial template method. The microstructure and chemical composition of as-prepared NiS2were characterized by XRD, EDS, BET, SEM and TEM techniques. The results showed that both Ni(OH)2and NiS2were composed of nanoplates. The electrochemical tests revealed that NiS2exhibited the high specific capacitance of 1067.3 F路g-1at a current density of 1 A路g-1and excellent rate performance. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the practical application of NiS2, an asymmetric supercapacitor, NiS2as the positive electrode and AC as the negative electrode, displayed high energy density of 38.4 Wh路kg-1with a power density of 0.8 kW路kg-1. Meanwhile, the asymmetric supercapacitor showed a superior cycling performance and 93.7% of the specific capacitance was retained after 3000 charge-discharge cycles.
