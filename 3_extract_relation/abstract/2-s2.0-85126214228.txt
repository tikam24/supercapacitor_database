Recent studies have shown that the use of battery-battery coupling in Hybrid Energy Storage Systems (HESS) presents advantages in terms of mass, volume and cost when compared to the battery-supercapacitor coupling. However, the sizing of this type of system is not much studied in the literature. So, in this paper a graphical sizing method using Ragone plots is presented. With this method, a HESS perfectly suited to a given application can be obtained.
