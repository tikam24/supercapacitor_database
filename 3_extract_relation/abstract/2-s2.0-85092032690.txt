In this work, a simple insitu chemical co-precipitation technique was adopted for the synthesis of CoFe2O4 (Cf) decorated Pistachio shell derived activated carbon (Cf@Pv-AC) composite to fabricate electrodes for supercapacitor (SC) application. Doping of Cf particles on the surface of the Pv-AC effectively enhanced the diffusion of electrolyte ions by facilitating a porous structural morphology which act as the reservoir of electrolyte ions during the electrochemical redox reactions. FT-IR spectrum of Cf@Pv-AC composite exhibited the strong absorption band at 608 cm−1, which was associated to M-O bonds (Where M=Co and Fe) in Cf structure. FE-SEM images of Cf@Pv-AC suggested that Co-ferrite particles have evenly covered the surface of porous Pv-AC rods. Further, Cyclic voltammetric analysis (CV) of Cf@Pv-AC coated Ni foil electrode proved the battery type behavior of Cf in Cf@Pv-AC sample and delivered the specific capacity of 1233 C/g in the potential range of 0–0.69 V at the scan rate of 5 mV/s. These results revealed that the specific capacity value increased two fold than that of pure Cf (434 C/g) at the same scan rate. Moreover, the obtained results were also substantiated by Galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) measurements. About 93% of specific capacity retention was achieved by Cf@Pv-AC electrode, even after 5000 GCD cycles at the current density of 4 A/g, which were evident for the better capacitive performance of Cf@Pv-AC electrode material.
