Nickel molybdate is emerged as a promising electrode material in supercapacitors for its rich redox chemistry. However, its limited electrical and ionic conductivities keep it from achieving its full capacitance potential. Here, a facile pathway is reported to synthesize NiMoO4/Ti3C2Tx nanosheets with interconnected porous construction, which may promote the electrolyte ion diffusion during reversible insertion/deinsertion processes, further improve its capacity. The fabricated NiMoO4/Ti3C2Tx electrode exhibits a high specific capacity of 545.5 C g−1 (1364 F g−1) at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 alongside with attractive cycling stability, contributed to the strong synergistic effects between NiMoO4 and Ti3C2Tx. Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor is fabricated by coupling NiMoO4/Ti3C2Tx positive electrode with reduced graphene oxide hydrogel negative electrode, which demonstrates a broad potential window of 1.6 V, and an energy density of 33.76 W h kg−1.
