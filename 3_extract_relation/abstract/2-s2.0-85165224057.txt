Lanthanum doped nanocrystalline V2O5 films were fabricated. The chemical composition of xLa2O3–(1−x)V2O5.nH2O (where x = 0.25, 0.50 and 1.0 mol%) prepared by sol–gel method were studied. The structural properties were investigated by XRD and HRTEM and revealed a structure of highly oriented c-axis nanocrystals with (002) peak getting sharper by the addition of lanthanum indicating successful intercalation of lanthanum within V2O5 layered structure. The average crystallite size was calculated by Scherrer method and found to be decreasing from 4.45 to 3.57 nm. DC conductivity was investigated over temperature ranging from 311 to 423 K and found the conductivity is increasing with the increase in temperature over the entire temperature range indicating a thermal activation phenomenon and therefore establishing a typical semiconductor behavior in all prepared samples. The activation energy was calculated for various lanthanum concentrations and found to be increasing from 0.32 to 0.56 eV with the increase of La concentration. The vanadium ions concentration N were calculated and found to be increasing from 1.11 ×1022 to 1.38 ×1022 cm−3, while the spacing of vanadium ions R decreased from 0.448 to 0.417 nm. The hopping carrier mobility (μ) and carrier density (Ne) of the prepared samples were also calculated at fixed temperature. The conduction was predominantly caused by electronic transport between V ions, which revealed the non-adiabatic SPH. Greaves model for variable-range hopping was studied for the prepared samples. The discharge cycling (CD) curve exhibited good stability up to 1000 cycles at a potential of 0.6 V with average specific capacity of 158.1Fg−1, suggesting the material’s potential use in battery or supercapacitor applications. The Nyquist Z-plot of the EIS data revealed the presence of a single relaxation process in the electrochemical system, and the radius of the semicircle decreased after 250 cycles, indicating a decrease in the charge transfer resistance of the electrochemical interface. The electrochemical properties suggest that 1 mol% La concentration is promising electrode material for battery or supercapacitor and energy storage devices.
