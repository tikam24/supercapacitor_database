The relation between the porous structure and the electron structure in carbon materials was investigated in order to optimize the efficiency of the physical-chemical processes in an electric double layer (EDL) formed at the boundary between the carbon material and the electrolyte (KOH 30 % aqueous solution). In particular, an Ni2+ intercalative modification of nanoporous carbon resulted in more than a triple increase in the specific capacitance and a significant improvement of the charge-discharge kinetics in the EDL.
