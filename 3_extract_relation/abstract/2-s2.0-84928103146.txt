In this work, we report a facile approach to synthesis of highly fluffy and wrinkled reduced graphene oxide by simple freeze-drying and microwave-expanding method in vacuum. Compared with thermal reduced graphene oxide (RGO), the as-synthesized freeze drying and microwave reduced graphene oxide (FMGO) electrodes exhibit an improved electrochemical performance with high specific capacitance of 246 F g<sup>-1</sup> at scan rate 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup> and good cycle stability for application in supercapacitors. The outstanding performance of FMGO as a supercapacitor is attributed to the highly fluffy and wrinkled graphene which permits the creation of three-dimensional networks to induce fast electron and ion transport, thus eventually leading the significantly improved electrochemical capacitive behaviors.
