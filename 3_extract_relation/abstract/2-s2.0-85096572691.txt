We have designed MoS2/CoS2 composite (MCC) comprising of MoS2 Nano-Flowers and CoS2 Nanorods by one-step hydrothermal method. The synthesized composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction pattern, Field emission scanning electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and Galvanostatic charging-discharging techniques. The structural and morphological analysis confirms the composite formation. The MoS2/CoS2 composite electrode demonstrates enhanced specific capacitance (response time 0.20 s) of about 216.66 F/g, which is higher than that of MoS2 electrodes. The high value of energy density (32.26 Wh/kg) at power density of 333.43 W/kg is found for MoS2/CoS2 composite electrode. It may be attributed to the high effective surface area of the MoS2 and CoS2 nanorods which facilitates smoother ion dynamics. The enhanced super capacitive performance of MoS2/CoS2 composite may be adopted as a promising candidate as electrode materials for supercapacitor applications.
