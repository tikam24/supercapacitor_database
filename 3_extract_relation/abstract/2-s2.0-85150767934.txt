The chemical properties of copper oxide (CuO) have made it an important material in the field of advanced technology for decades. The advantages of this material are its low cost, chemical stability, and remarkable electrochemical performance. The applications are found particularly in the fields of photovoltaic and energy storage. Growing energy supercapacitors have gotten a lot of interest because of their promising capacitance, availability, obvious electrochemical response, and ease of manufacture of copper oxides to address the high need for efficient electrochemical energy storage systems. This research describes a hydrothermal technique to produce GO/CuO nanocomposite for supercapacitor applications. XRD, FTIR, SEM, UV, and TGA, were used to evaluate the crystal nature, morphology, and chemical states of the produced GO/CuO nanocomposite, and electrochemical performance was tested using CV the manufactured nanocomposite materials as supercapacitor electrodes. The electrochemical results demonstrated that the GO/CuO nanocomposite is a good material for a supercapacitor electrode.
