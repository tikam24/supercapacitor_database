High-performance porous carbons have been prepared as supercapacitor electrode materials by co-doped with nitrogen and MnOx via a direct carbonization method, using sodium butyl naphthalene sulfonate (abbr. BNS-Na) as carbon source. It is believed that the in situ formed Na6(SO4)2(CO3) in the product would probably serve as temporary template for producing porous structures. The impacts of nitrogen/MnOx contents as well as the structures upon the capacitive performances were emphatically discussed. It indicates that introducing nitrogen and/or MnOx into the carbon matrix can remarkably improve their capacitive performances based on the cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements in 6molL-1 KOH aqueous solution. The specific capacitances of doped carbons can reach up to ca. 167.0-241.8Fg-1 compared with that of the undoped carbon of ca. 105.6Fg-1. Of these samples, the carbon-Mn-1:30-N-1:15 sample co-doped with nitrogen and MnOx exhibits the highest specific capacitance and energy density up to 241.8Fg-1 and 33.6Whkg-1, respectively. In particular, these carbons also exhibit high intrinsic capacitances (i.e., capacitance per surface area) up to ca. 0.66-1.92Fm-2. Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc.
