A multifunctional room temperature ionic liquid [DDQM][TFSI] has been designed and its properties have been investigated to be used as an electrolyte. The RTIL bears superior catalytic properties as well as excellent and moderate charge-discharge rate in its composite form with reduced graphene oxide powder (rGO). The RTIL in its composite form bears good specific capacitance to be used as an active electrode material for supercapacitor devices. Furthermore, the RTIL showed excellent thermal properties and catalytic activity for the synthesis of 4-aryl-NH-1,2,3-triazoles in 2 minutes at 90 W (up to 180 Â°C) under metal/ligand/external acid-base free conditions incorporating electromagnetic radiation (EMR).
