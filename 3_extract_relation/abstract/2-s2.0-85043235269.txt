Perovskite BiFeO3 nanoplates were prepared via a facile hydrothermal method with NaOH as mineralizer. The obtained BiFeO3 nanoplates are about 30nm × 90nm ×90nm in an average shape. This hydrothermal novel nanostructure with lots of defects largely enhances the specific capacitance compared with the electrochemically deposited BiFeO3 nanoparticles. The electrode of BiFeO3 nanoplates exhibits the highest specific capacitance of 254.6F g-1 at a scan rate of 1mV s-1 as well as good cyclic stability with 84% special capacitance retention after 1000 cycles. The prominent capacitive properties of hydrothermally obtained BiFeO3 suggest its promising application for supercapacitors.
