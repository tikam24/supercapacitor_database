In this study, a fast and simple technique (2 min) has been developed to modify the pores of a novel micro-porous, amide-functionalized Co(ii)-based MOF [Co(oba)2(bpfb)4](DMF)2, TMU-61, (H2oba = 4,4′-oxybis(benzoic acid) and bpfb = N,N′-bis-(4-pyridylformamide)-1,4-benzenediamine). The material produced through sulfurization of TMU-61, at ambient temperatures, can be used as an appropriate electrode material for supercapacitors (SCs). The highest specific capacitance of a system with three electrodes is 636.6 F g-1 at a current density of 5 A g-1, and the specific capacitance retention is nearly 94% after 6000 cycles, demonstrating an impressive long-term cycling stability. The asymmetric SC (ASC) based on S-TMU-61 showed the highest energy density (25.73 W h kg-1) and power density (2549.3 W kg-1). Additionally, it is observed that two S-TMU-61 ASCs connected in series are enough to supply energy for lighting blue, yellow, green and red light emitting diodes (LED) for 22 min and driving a mini rotating motor, demonstrating the excellent potential of the new material for a variety of applications. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to use post synthetic modification of a MOF with a suitable pore size to optimize the material for use in SCs.
