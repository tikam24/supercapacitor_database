This paper reports a simple and scalable technique for the fabrication of flexible micro-supercapacitors. The supercapacitor electrodes are synthesized via the pyrolysis of patterned photoresist on a SiO2/Si substrate. The electrodes can then be moved to flexible substrates through a simple transfer process. The fabricated devices show excellent energy density of 0.3 mJ/cm2, maximum power density of 5 mW/cm2, and good performance under electrochemical cycling. The electrochemical performance is maintained after 300 mechanical bending cycles. Â© 2014 IEEE.
