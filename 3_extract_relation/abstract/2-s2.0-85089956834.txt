The demand for low-cost and high-performance energy storage supercapacitors is continuously promoting as a result of the rapid development of portable electric vehicles and electronic devices. Here, a high-performance MnCo alloy nanoparticles decorated boron-doped carbon nanotubes (MnCo–B/CNTs) electrode was obtained by a facile heteroatom hydrothermal and subsequent liquid-phase reduction methods, which yields improved performance for supercapacitor. In this process, boron doping led to extra oxygen graft into carbon surface, leading to the improved durability and wettability of the fabricated carbon-based electrodes, which presented both increased capacitances and rate capability due to electrolyte ion penetration and interactions with carbon surface. In addition, boron doping led to smaller size and higher dispersion of MnCo nanoparticles, facilitating more metallic alloy and new electroactive sites formation and promoting supercapacitive activity, which was attributed to increased MnCo alloy nucleation rate with boron-doped, electron donation from boron to alloy, and extra chemisorption sites. The constructed electrode exhibited all-round performance improvements of specific capacitance (1175 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1) and capacitance retention (94.48% at a current density of 20 A g−1 after 5000 cycles), providing a novel insight for designing high performance supercapacitors.
