The demand for bio-based flexible energy devices has increased rapidly in recent decades due to their unique advantages such as flexibility, light weight nature, shape diversity, etc. Nanocellulose has been established as a promising potential candidate for high-performance flexible energy storage device fabrication due to its exceptional physical, mechanical, and optical properties. In this chapter, we discuss about the recent advances in nanocellulose-based flexible energy storage devices for a wide range of applications. Various chemical and physical modification strategies on nanocellulose have also been discussed. The unique properties of nanocellulose enable multiscale structuring of functional composites, which can be tailored to develop new concepts of energy storage devices. This chapter is a comprehensive effort focusing the recent advances on nanocellulose-based flexible energy devices, including supercapacitors, sensors, batteries, and solar cells.
