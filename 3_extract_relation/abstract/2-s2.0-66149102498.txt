Diesel generators in small electricity grids are mostly not used in a very efficient way. The reason for this is twofold. First of all, the efficiency of a diesel generator is dependent on the ratio determined by the average power divided by the peak power of the generator. The smaller this ratio is, the lower the efficiency. Furthermore, some loads can regenerate energy. In small grids, this energy is mostly not needed elsewhere and should be dissipated. A solution solving both problems previously mentioned is using an energy storage device in the system. This storage can be used for peak shaving and storing regenerated energy. This paper focuses on a generator-set with energy storage. Six different power management strategies are discussed. Calculation of the costs shows that adding an energy storage device lowers the cost for all methods. Verification with simulation and experiments has been carried out. Â© 2009 IEEE.
