Graphene oxide nanosheets, stably dispersed in water at 0.2 wt.%, were inkjet-printed onto Ti foils and thermally reduced at 200 °C in N 2, as a new method of fabricating inkjet printed graphene electrodes (IPGEs) for supercapacitors. The specific capacitance of IPGE ranged from 48 to 132 F/g, depending on the potential scan rate from 0.5 to 0.01 V/s using 1M H2SO4 as the electrolyte. The initial performance of IPGEs compares favorably to that reported for graphene electrodes prepared by other fabrication methods. This new finding is expected to be particularly useful for designing and fabricating inter-digitized electrode arrays with a lateral spatial resolution of ~ 50 μm for flexible micro-supercapacitors. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.
