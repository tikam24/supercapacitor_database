Hybrid storage devices are used in microgrids to provide power backup solutions when the distributed energy resources (DERs) are unable to supply the load demands. Combination of battery and supercapacitor (SC) banks provide an appropriate hybrid storage solution. The objective of this paper is to present a comparative study of charging and discharging process of both battery and SC banks and hence understand their application areas in a DC microgrid. Also the rate of charge-discharge and its control to prevent over charging or under-discharging of the storage devices is presented here.
