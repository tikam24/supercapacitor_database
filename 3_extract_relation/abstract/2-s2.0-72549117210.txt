Polyaniline nanofibers were used to produce a flexible supercapacitor electrode with a specific capacitance of 235 F g-1. Cycle life and energy density were enhanced after encapsulating the polyaniline nanofiber electrode in Nafion. A specific capacitance of 195 F g-1 was obtained over 10,000 charge-discharge cycles. A fully flexible, stand alone capacitor comprising two polyaniline nanofiber based electrodes and a PVDF separator was constructed. An initial specific capacitance of 125 F g-1 (100 mV s-1) was obtained. This decreased to 95 F g-1 over 10,000 cycles. Â© 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
