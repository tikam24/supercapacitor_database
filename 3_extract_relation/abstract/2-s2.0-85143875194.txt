Numerous solution-based methods are used to prepare zinc oxide (ZnO) and graphene oxide (GO) nanocomposite (ZnO-GO NCs) such as sol-gel, hydrothermal, and precipitation. These methods require lots of reagents and involve many stages. In this study, a novel one-step solution-based discharge method is used to prepare ZnO-GO NCs through an electrochemical discharge process (ECDP) without the use of any catalyst or toxic chemical reagent. This study focused on analyzing the effects of input parameters on the production rate of ZnO-GO NCs. The experiment was performed by using Taguchi L9 orthogonal array. Materials removal rate (MRR) is considered as output response. The results reveal that voltage is the most significant factor, followed by temperature and duty cycle for obtaining higher MRR. The optimum parameters obtained from the Minitab software for higher MRR are 40 V, 30%, and 45 °C. Further, the morphology of the nanoparticles (NCs) produced at optimum parameters is analyzed which shows flower shape NCs with multilayer graphene oxide, confirmed by the FESEM and TEM images. The XRD peak at 11.27° and Raman spectroscopy peak of G and D bands reveal GO formation. The prepared ZnO-GO NCs tested as supercapacitor activity in the KOH solution. At the optimum parameter, the specific capacitance is observed to be 523.4 F/g at 2A/g current density. The NCs electrode shows good cyclic stability, with 86% retention of specific capacitance after 5000 cycles. This study shows a promising future of converting the e-waste product into valuable nanomaterials such as GO and ZnO from used dry cell batteries.
