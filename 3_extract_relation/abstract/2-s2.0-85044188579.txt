A highly efficient, mild (also dispersant-free) method has been developed in this work for synthesizing β-Co(OH)2nanoplatelets, by using hydrated cobalt chloride as raw material, sodium hydroxide and hydrazine hydrate as alkaline precipitating agents. The morphology and microstructure of the product were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. The edge length of hexagonal β-Co(OH)2 nanoplatelets is about 100-200 nm and the thickness is about tens of nanometers. As the concentration of cobalt chloride solution decreasing, the thickness of the single-chip of β-Co(OH)2 gets attenuated. The electrochemical performances of the as-synthesized samples were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and constant-current charge/discharge test. The thinner cobalt hydroxide will lead to higher specific capacitance of β-Co(OH)2, and it can reach 83.3 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g along with a high stability.
