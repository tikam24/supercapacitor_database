Supercapacitors represent an attractive alternative for portable electronics and automotive applications due to their high specific power, and extended lifetime. The poly (3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and polythiophene (PTh) have attracted much attention because of their excellent environmental stability, optical, electrical and electrochemical properties. We present here the synthesis, characterization and application of graphene (G)-PEDOT and G-PTh nanocomposites as electrode material for supercapacitor applications. These nanocomposites were synthesized using chemical oxidative polymerization technique, and characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray-diffraction, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), and Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) techniques. The electrochemical charge/discharge characteristics of G-PEDOT and G-PTh nanocomposites were investigated in 2M HCl electrolytic medium, and the specific discharge capacitance values were estimated to be varying from 160 to 400 Farad (F)/gram. This study has revealed that the G-PEDOT and G-PTh nanocomposite electrode materials may lead to a stable supercapacitor for portable electronic applications. Â©The Electrochemical Society.
