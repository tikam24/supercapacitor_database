Reduced graphene oxide-wrapped MoO3M (rGO/MoO3) is prepared by a novel and simple method that is developed by using a metal-organic framework as the precursor. After a two-step annealing process, the obtained rGO/MoO3 composite is used for a high-performance supercapacitor electrode. Moreover, an all-solid-state flexible supercapacitor is fabricated based on the rGO/MoO3 composite, which shows stable performance under different bending states.
