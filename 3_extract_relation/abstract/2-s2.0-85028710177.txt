Perovskite KNi0.8Co0.2F3 nanocrystals were introduced as potential electrode materials for supercapacitors, which exhibited superior specific capacity and rate behavior owing to the optimal synergistic effect of Ni and Co redox species. The AC//KNi0.8Co0.2F3 asymmetric capacitor delivered high power and energy densities together with excellent cycling stability.
