Fiber supercapacitor is one kind of promising flexible supercapacitor, which can complement or even replace microbatteries in wearable/portable miniaturized electronics and micro-/nano-electromechanical systems. This chapter provides an overview on the recent developments in the evaluation methods/metrics, electrode materials, device structures and preliminary applications of fiber supercapacitors (SCs). Some perspectives on future electrode/device design trends and directions are also proposed.
