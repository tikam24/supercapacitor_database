In the last decades, fuel scarcity and increasing pollution level pave the way for an extensive interest in alternatives to petroleum-based fuels such as biodiesel, solar cells, lithium ion batteries, and supercapacitors. Among them, structural supercapacitors have been considered as promising candidates for automotive industries in present time. Herein, the use of carbon fiber-based supercapacitors in automotive applications is reviewed. Carbon fiber is an excellent candidate for vehicle body applications, and its composites could be widely used in the development of supercapacitors that could provide both structural and energy storage functions. Different surface modification processes of the carbon fiber electrode to enhance the electrochemical as well as mechanical performances are discussed. The advantages of the glass fiber separator and its comparison with other types of dielectric media have been incorporated. The synthesis procedures of the multifunctional solid polymer electrolyte and its significance have been also elaborated. The fabrication process, component selection, limitations, and future challenges of these supercapacitors are briefly assimilated in this review. Copyright Â© 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
