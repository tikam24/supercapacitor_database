Dumbbell-like ZnO nanoparticles-CeO 2 nanorods (ZnONPs-CeO 2 NRs) composites with superior electrochemical performance were fabricated by one-pot hydrothermal process and characterized by X-ray diffraction, an energy dispersive spectrum, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms. The ZnONPs-CeO 2 NRs nanostructure possessed larger Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface, crystallinity, lower resistance. The specific capacitance of ZnONPs-CeO 2 NRs composite (162.08 mF g -1 ) was higher than that of precursor CeO 2 NRs (151.43 mF g -1 ) in galvanostatic charge/discharge, and the super-capacitor charge storage of ZnONPs-CeO 2 NRs (581.39 F g -1 ) was more 12 times than the precursor (46.63 F g -1 ). The improved electrochemical performances could be ascribed to the import of ZnONPs, which induced variations in the structure, conductivity and surface morphology.
