In this work, nanostructured polystyrene/polyaniline/reduced graphene oxide (PS–PANI/rGO) hybrid materials based on in situ reduction of graphene oxide with ascorbic acid and self-assembly have been successfully prepared for electrochemical supercapacitor and Na-ion battery applications. The supercapacitor based on the PS–PANI/rGO as an electrode material exhibits a specific capacitance of 180 F g<sup>−1</sup> at a current density of 0.5 A g<sup>−1</sup> from −0.4 to 1.0 V and a high energy density of 49 W h kg<sup>−1</sup> at the power density of 352.8 W kg<sup>−1</sup>. Moreover, the nanostructured PS–PANI/rGO has a good cycle stability (74 % capacitance retention after 5000 cycles), indicating its future potential application in electrochemical energy storage. The material is further used as an anode in Na-ion batteries, and the results show that the porous nanostructured PS–PANI/rGO delivers a high capacity of 155 mA h g<sup>−1</sup> and keeps over 150 charge–discharge cycles at a constant current of 100 mA g<sup>−1</sup> (0.5 C).
