This paper presents for the first time a solid-state supercapacitor fabricated in just a single woven cotton textile layer. The controlled spray coating process enables the depth of the activated carbon electrodes to be precisely controlled from both sides of the textile. This leaves an uncoated region within the cotton textile layer that acts as the separator and also minimizes the effect of the added functional materials on the feel of the textile. The cotton electrode is then vacuum impregnated with the gel electrolyte to ensure good coverage of the electrode by the electrolyte. After drying, the single textile layer supercapacitor has been fully characterized and demonstrates good capacitance and excellent electrochemical cycling stability even after mechanically straining the textile.
