This work proposes the strategy of the proportional-integral-derivative regulator with noise reduction filter (PIDF) for frequency and tie-line power flow regulation of a two-area Photovoltaic (PV) and Thermal power plant interconnected power system. The Supercapacitor energy storage (SCES) unit has also been employed to refine the power system's steady-state and dynamic performance. A recently designed new metaheuristic optimization technique dwarf mongoose optimization algorithm (DMO) has been employed to fine-tune the controllable parameters of PIDF and proportional-integral (PI) regulators. This is an earlier attempt of supercapacitor unit and DMO algorithm in such hybrid unit. The superiority of the DMO-tuned PIDF regulator has been validated in contrary with PI regulators optimized with various renowned algorithms i.e. genetic algorithm and firefly algorithm in the presented power system. Further, the performance of the studied controller has been validated with various performance indicators. The robustness analysis of the presented controller has been checked with various ambiguities applied by changing system parameters.
