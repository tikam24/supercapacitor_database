Green energy production for environmental protection and its sustainability has been a hot topic for the last decade. The solar source is one of the candidates for green energy to be developed in Indonesia. It is because of the tropical climate that makes Indonesia receives a lot of sun exposure. Besides, the development of green energy needs to be balanced with the development of better energy storage. The high-power density, long lifetime, and environmentally friendly are exciting and unique points of a supercapacitor. Research of photo-supercapacitor, which integrating solar cells with a supercapacitor, has been developed widely. This Integrated structure will capture and convert light energy into electrical energy then store it. Investigation on improving DSSC performance was carried out in many ways, such as a variation on dye materials, variation on the photoanode material, and other component variation, observations on the effects of temperature variations in the growth of photoanode materials, and investigation on the role of blocking layers and any others. To obtain a good start for the next investigation, we need a complete map of the recent progress on the integrated photo-supercapacitors, mainly the device constructed from EDLC and DSSC. This review article is focused on summarizes current trends in the structure and performance of integrated EDLC Supercapacitor with DSSC. The optimized additional blocking layer in the DSSC section for integrated photo-supercapacitors devices is also proposed.
