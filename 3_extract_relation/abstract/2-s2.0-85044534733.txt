The combination of double layer capacitor and pseudocapacitor materials are the next generation composites for energy storage. Nitrogen enriched species like metal phthalocyanines with metal redox centres may be combined with electrical double layer capacitive carbon materials for improved charge storage. We have explored electrochemical capacitance applications of nickel phthalocyanine (NiPc) nanofibres and its composite with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) synthesized through simple chemical routes. The composite material exhibits a superior specific capacitance, 223.28 Fg −1 at 1 Ag −1 , four fold higher than the individual components and also good stability over continuous cycling for 1000 cycles. The synergistic effect of NiPc and rGO with excellent physical interface offers less charge transfer resistance and better charge storage capacity.
