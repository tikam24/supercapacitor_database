There is growing interest in the field of energy storage devices, particularly in supercapacitors, due to their high power density, long cycle stability, and fast charge/discharge rates. This chapter highlights different types of supercapacitor electrode materials and describes recent developments in the field of transition metal oxides (TMOs), conducting polymers (CPs), and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-based materials for supercapacitor application. TMOs-CPs nanocomposites (NCs) provide several advantages as supercapacitor materials, as the loss of active mass, in particular of metal oxides, can be prevented by encapsulating the metal oxide in the polymer matrix. The synergistic effect, configurations, and electrochemical properties of TMOs/CPs nanocomposites for supercapacitor application are discussed in this chapter. Also, the outstanding properties of MOs/MOFs NCs and MOF-derived materials are also highlighted. The major challenges and opportunities for further research associated with these for electrochemical energy storage are discussed with future prospective solutions in the light of current progress. The latest reports from the literature are listed in tabular form, and the key developments with results are highlighted and critically analyzed.
