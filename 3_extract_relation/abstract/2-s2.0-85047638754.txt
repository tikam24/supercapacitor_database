Nowadays, the energy management of the hybrid system is becoming an interesting and the challenging topic for several researchers. The wise choice of the energy management strategy allows not only the best distribution of power between different sources but also reduce system consumption, increase the lifetime of the used sources and ensure the energy demand that involve the autonomy of the electrical vehicle. In this paper, the control and the energy management using the passivity control is adopted to the multiconverters multisources system, in particularly, Fuel Cell/SuperCapacitor (FC/SC) hybrid system. In the proposed system, the FC represents the main source and the SC is used for the transient of power where they can absorb or supply powers peaks. The proposed system is validated by experimental results. The obtained results prove the efficacy and the feasibility of the proposed approach for a real electrical vehicle.
