The rational design and preparation of cathode and anode materials with high capacitance within both positive and negative potential windows for hybrid supercapacitors remains a great challenge. Herein, a hybrid supercapacitor with ultrahigh energy density is assembled with biomass-derived iron/cobalt disulfides immobilized on porous carbon (FeS2/CoS2 @KC) and N, S co-doped porous carbon (NSKC) as cathode and anode materials. These two electrode materials are prepared by a facile impregnation and pyrolysis method. FeS2/CoS2 @KC-800 cathode material exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with a superior specific capacitance of 3480.47 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and high capacitance retention of 60.35% at 15 A g−1. NSKC-800 anode material delivers a high specific capacitance of 268.75 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. Remarkably, the assembled hybrid supercapacitor outputs an ultrahigh energy density of 200.20 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 463.19 W kg−1. Moreover, it also possesses remarkable cycling stability with improved capacitance retention of 94.79% after 10,000 cycles at 5 A g−1. This work demonstrates that kelp is a promising precursor to construct high-performance electrode materials for energy storage applications.
