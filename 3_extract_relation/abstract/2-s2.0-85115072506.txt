Nanostructured Mn3O4 electrodes were synthesized via a simple and rapid one-step microwave irradiation route, using manganese (II) nitrate hexahydrate and hydrazine hydrate. Four different morphologies (plate-like, hexagonal-like, rice-like, and sphere-like) were obtained by changing the reaction temperature such as 125°C, 150°C, 175°C, and 200°C (denoted as Mn-125, Mn-150, Mn-175, and Mn-200). Various analytical techniques such as X-ray diffraction, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis were utilized to characterize the physicochemical properties of the prepared electrodes. The average crystallite sizes of the Mn-125, Mn-150, Mn-175, and Mn-200 samples were ~32.3, ~28.8, ~31.7, and ~28.9 nm, respectively. To evaluate the electrochemical properties of the Mn3O4 nanostructures for supercapacitors, cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements were performed. Remarkably, the hexagonal-like Mn3O4 electrode showed a higher specific capacitance of 449.98 F g−1 at a lower current density of 1 A g−1 and showing outstanding cyclic permanence (95% capacitance retention 5000 cycles) than the other nanostructures.
