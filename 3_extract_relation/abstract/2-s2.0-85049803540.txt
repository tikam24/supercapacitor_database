A miniaturized and flexible asymmetric micro-supercapacitor (ASC) based on surface-modified MnO2@Au and thin nanosheets of NiCo2O4@Au (termed 2D-qMnO2//NiCo2O4 micro-supercapacitor) is reported. A lightweight and superior flexible micro-supercapacitor is successfully achieved using conventional microfabrication techniques. The proposed electrodeposition method is very effective for the surface modification and, as a result, uniform and high-quality 2D-quasi MnO2 and NiCo2O4 thin-film formation on a collector current is achieved. The fabricated 2D-qMnO2//NiCo2O4@Au and polymeric gel electrolyte-based micro-supercapacitor has advantageous features, with a high areal capacitance of 5.36 mF cm−2. The 2D-qMnO2//NiCo2O4 MSC delivers a high energy density of 0.42 mWh cm−2 at 48.90 mW cm−2 power density with superior cycling stability (89.62 %) over initial 5000 cycles. Impedance analysis showed that the 2D-qMnO2//NiCo2O4 MSC device has a phase angle of −73° with an extremely small relaxation time constant of 14 ms. Finally, excellent device performance of the 2D-qMnO2//NiCo2O4 MSC under different bending and twisting is demonstrated to evaluate its mechanical flexibility.
