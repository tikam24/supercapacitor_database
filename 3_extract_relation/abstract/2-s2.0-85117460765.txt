The traditional capacitive serial equalizer uses the voltage difference between series single batte-ries to realize the serial equilibrium between single batteries. Because the voltage difference between series single batteries is small, the equalizer has low energy equilibrium efficiency and slow equilibrium speed. For this, a parallel equalizer of double supercapacitors voltage doubling battery system is proposed. The equalizer has the following two working modes:parallel energy reserve of double supercapacitors by parallel equalizing discharge of multiple single batteries, and series energy release of double supercapacitors by parallel equalizing charge of multiple single batteries. The proposed parallel equilibrium strategy can greatly improve the equilibrium speed, the energy storage capacity of capacitor equilibrium is doubled through double supercapacitors, and the equilibrium performance is not limited by the small voltage difference between single batteries. The structure, working principle and control strategy of equalizer are introduced in detail. The experimental platform of four series lithium-ion battery equalizer is established and its prototype is designed, and the experimental results prove the feasibility and superiority of the proposed equalizer.
