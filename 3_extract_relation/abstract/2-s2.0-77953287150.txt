Polyaniline co-doped with Zn2+ and H+ was synthesized in aqueous HCl solution containing ZnCl2, and tested for its supercapacitive behavior in three-electrode or two-electrode system with 1.0 M H2SO4 as electrolyte by cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) techniques were employed for characterization of polyaniline co-doped with Zn2+ and H+. Compared with polyaniline doped with H+, it shows a larger specific capacitance of 369 F g-1. Moreover, the specific capacitance remains 90% after 1000 cycles at a current density of 0.5 A g-1, indicating good cycleability. Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
