The article presents research on minimising transmission losses in the trolleybus electric traction. The problem in question is the minimisation of these losses by applying systems with storage batteries. Different locations of such batteries in the network were analysed. The calculation of the power loss, voltage and current drops were made using the actual measurement results on a sample section of the trolleybus line. More than a sixfold reduction of the power loss was obtained for the supercapacitor battery location at the end of the analysed section. These results provide clear evidence that the retrofitting of electric traction in correctly placed storage batteries brings significant economic effects.
