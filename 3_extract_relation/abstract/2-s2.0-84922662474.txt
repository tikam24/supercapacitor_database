Ni(OH)2 nanoparticles were self-assembled on porous hexagonal CoOOH sheets by a simple cathodic electrophoresis in CoOOH suspension with nickel nitrate additive. A significant shift of redox peaks in the Ni(OH)2/CoOOH composite electrodes compared with the bare Ni(OH)2 electrode indicated the formation of mixed Co-Ni hydroxide layers. The amount of Ni(OH)2 nanoparticles on the porous CoOOH sheet dominated the capacitive behavior of the composite electrodes. The Ni(OH)2/CoOOH electrode with 20 wt% of Ni(OH)2 prepared in 1 mM nickel nitrate showed the highest specific capacitance and good cycle-life stability, its specific capacitance discharged at 1 A g-1 could reach as high as 1537 F g-1 much higher than that of bare CoOOH (52 F g-1) and Ni(OH)2 (785 F g-1) electrodes. A noticeable improvement in capacitive behavior resulted from the porous conductive CoOOH sheets that facilitated the transport of electron and electrolyte. This journal is
