In this method, green synthesis of reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO) using strawberry extract was capping and reducing agent to form rGO. The prepared rGO was analyzed by XRD, DRS-UV–vis spectroscopy, FT-Raman, SEM, HR-TEM, cyclic voltammetry and photodecomposition of ciprofloxacin (CIP). The cyclic voltammetry performance reveals the significant improvement in the specific capacitance value of 236 Fg−1 at a current density of 1 Ag−1. The prepared rGO catalysts were performed for the photodecomposition of the CIP at 70.8% under UV-light irradiation in 90 min.
