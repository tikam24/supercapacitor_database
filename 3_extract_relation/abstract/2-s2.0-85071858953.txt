Al doped Co hydroxyl fluoride (Al–Co(OH)F) with vertically aligned nanosheets arrays architecture onto Ni foam substrate was prepared by hydrothermal hydrolysis of Co precursor mediated by F− and Al3+ ions. By virtue of the vertical electron and ions transfer channels along the nanosheets arrays, as well as the coexistence of different oxidation values of Co element, the faradaic Al–Co(OH)F electrode could offer a maximum specific capacitance (Cs) of 1576 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1, and 624 F g−1 was still maintained at high current density of 20 A g−1. Additionally, 84 % of its initial Cs was maintained underwent 5000 repeated charge-discharge cycles at 5 A g−1. When used as faradaic electrode of hybrid supercapacitor (HSC), high energy density (Ecell) of 42.7 Wh kg−1 at power density (Pcell) of 382.6 W kg−1 was harvested, and Ecell declined to 18.2 Wh kg−1 with Pcell increased to 3123.5 W kg−1, showing the potential of Al–Co(OH)F in faradaic energy storage.
