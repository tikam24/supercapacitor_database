The amorphous nano-structured manganese oxide was electrochemically deposited onto a stainless-steel electrode. The structure and surface morphology of the obtained manganese oxide were studied by means of X-ray diffraction analysis and scanning electron microscopy. The capacitive characteristics of the manganese oxide electrodes were investigated by means of cyclic voltammetry and constant current charge-discharge cycling. The morphological and capacitive characteristics of the hydrous manganese oxide was found to be strongly influenced by the electrochemical deposition conditions. The highest specific capacitance value of ca. 410 F g-1 and the specific power of ca. 54 kW kg-1 were obtained at 400 mV s-1 sweep rate of potentiodynamic deposition condition. The cyclic-life data showed that the specific capacitance was highly stable up to 10,000 cycles examined. This suggests the excellent cyclic stability of the obtained amorphous hydrous manganese oxide for supercapacitor application. Â© 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
