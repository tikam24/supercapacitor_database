In the present communication, ZrTiO4 nanoparticles (NPs) are synthesized by the solution combustion method using urea (ZTOU) and oxalyl dihydrazide (ODH) (ZTODH) as fuel and calcined at 700 °C. The synthesized samples were characterized with different techniques. Powder X-ray diffraction studies show the presence of diffraction peaks corresponding to ZrTiO4. In addition to these peaks, a few additional peaks corresponding to the monoclinic and cubic phases of ZrO2 and the rutile phase of TiO2 are observed. The surface morphology of ZTOU and ZTODH consists of nanorods with different lengths. The TEM and HRTEM images confirm the formation of nanorods along with NPs, and the estimated crystallite size matches well with that of PXRD. The direct energy band gap was calculated using Wood and Tauc's relation and was found to be 2.7 and 3.2 eV for ZTOU and ZTODH respectively. The photoluminescence emission peaks (λ = 350 nm), CIE and CCT of ZTOU and ZTODH clearly confirm that the present nanophosphor might be a good nanophosphor material for blue or aqua green light emitting diodes. Furthermore, antibacterial activity and a viability test were conducted on two food borne pathogens. The X-ray/gamma ray absorption properties are also studied, which clearly show the ZrTiO4 might be a good absorbing material. Furthermore, cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis of ZTOU nanorods shows very good redox peaks compared to that of ZTODH. From the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, the charge-transfer resistances for prepared nanorods ZTOU and ZTODH are found to be 151.6 Ω, and 184.5 Ω respectively. The modified graphite electrode with ZTOU shows good sensing activity for both paracetamol and ascorbic acid, compared to ZTODH.
