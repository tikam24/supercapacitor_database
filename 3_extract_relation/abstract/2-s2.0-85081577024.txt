Herein, we report the surface functionalization of carbon nano-onions (CNOs) through an amidation reaction that occurs between the oxidized CNOs and 4-(pyren-4-yl)butanehydrazide. Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy methods were used to confirm the covalent functionalization. The percentage or number of groups in the outer shell was estimated with thermal gravimetric analysis. Finally, the potential applications of the functionalized CNOs as electrode materials in supercapacitors were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Functionalization increased the specific capacitance by approximately 138% in comparison to that of the pristine CNOs, while acid-mediated oxidation reduced the specific capacitance of the nanomaterial by 24%.
