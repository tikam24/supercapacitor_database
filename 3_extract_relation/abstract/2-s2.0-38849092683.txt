A symmetrical (p/p) supercapacitor has been fabricated by making use of activated carbon (AC)-poly-ethylenedioxythiophene (PEDPT)-composite electrodes for the first time. The composite electrodes have been prepared via electrochemical deposition of β-napthalenesulphonate doped PEDPT onto AC electrodes. The characteristics of the electrodes and the fabricated supercapacitor have been investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and AC impedance spectroscopy. The electrodes show a maximum specific capacitance of 158 Fg-1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s_1. This indicates that the in situ electro-polymerization of ethylenedioxythiophene (EDPT) onto AC could improve the performance of carbon electrodes for use in supercapacitors. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
