A ternary composite of poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) was prepared using TiO2 through an emulsion polymerization method adjusting various weight ratios of TiO2 to PEDOT, and blending synthesized reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with this composite. The Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry, ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry, and X-ray diffraction analysis displayed characteristic features of PEDOT and TiO2. The morphology of the nano-hybrid structure was additionally investigated by scanning electron microscopy analysis. Pore size and surface area analysis of particles were characterized by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method. The electrochemical analysis showed that the specific capacitance (Csp) for PEDOT-TiO2-15-rGO was 18.9 F g−1 at 0.1 mA cm−2 current density. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
