This paper deals with a hybrid energy source consisting of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell, two storage devices, and a load. Generally, this type of source constitutes of nonisolated dc-dc converters. In order to have galvanic isolation for safety reasons and a high voltage ratio, we introduce another system based on the use of three-port isolated dc-dc converters. The storage device can be either a battery or a supercapacitor. This paper presents a control strategy for the hybrid source and includes a global efficiency analysis of power sharing between modules. The proposed system is validated through different simulation results. Additionally, some experimental results are given for the single module operation.
