Due to their combination of enhanced electrical conductivity and high-performance electron and ion transport channels, binary metal oxides with well-morphological optimized electrode materials have been attracted the greatest research attention for high-performance supercapacitor applications. An easy co-precipitation method is used to synthesize ZnCo2O4 nanoparticles using NaOH and Urea as precipitation agents. To facilitate electrical conductivity, suitable carbon material such as carbon nanotube (CNT) has been added to make a composite material. The three-electrode system was preferred for estimating specific capacitance of prepared material and optimally efficient ZnCo2O4/CNT electrode delivered a moderate 888 F/g capacitance at 1 A/g in 3 M KOH and after 5000 charge discharge cycles 94.72% of cycling stability retained at 5 A/g. This paper presents a little price and simple procedure for preparation of ZnCo2O4/CNT electrode that promotes creative sprit for energy storage applications.
