Nanocomposites with a well-defined sandwich-like nanostructure were prepared via in situ growing NiCo-layered double hydroxide nanosheets with tunable Ni/Co ratios on reduced graphene oxide (rGO). Electrochemical impedance spectra and N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherms confirmed that these sandwich nanostructures effectively promoted charge transport and enlarged the specific surface area. The nanocomposites with Ni : Co = 2 : 1 exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 2130 F g −1 at 2 A g −1 , excellent rate capability (72.7% retention at 15 A g −1 ), and cycling stability. Asymmetric supercapacitors were assembled with these nanocomposite cathodes and rGO as a negative electrode (anode), and demonstrated an energy density of 34.5 W h kg −1 at a power density of 772 W kg −1 , while maintaining a capacity retention of 86.7% after 10 000 cycles at 5 A g −1 . The robust electrochemical properties indicate the composites as promising electrodes for electrochemical energy storage devices.
