SnO2 nanoparticles supported by reduced graphene oxide (SnO2/RGO composites) have been fabricated through a simple chemical route in a water system. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation of the composite with mass ratio of 76.1:23.9 (SnO2:RGO) reveals that SnO2 nanoparticles (about 4-8 nm in size) locate on RGO sheets homogeneously. Interestingly, the morphology features of RGO in composites are influenced by the number of loaded SnO2 nanoparticles. In the composite, SnO2 act as spacers to prevent effectively the agglomeration of RGO sheets while the RGO sheets in good dispersion server as a conductor for fast electron transfer between the active materials and charge collector, as well as buffered spaces to a ccommodate the volume expansion/contraction during discharge/charge process. The composite, as electrode materials in supercapacitors, exhibited a specific capacitance as high as 326 F/g at the specific current of 1 A/g in 1M H2SO4 electrolyte in the potential window from 0 to 1.0 V. Furthermore, the composite was testified to have rather excellent cycle life along with about 97.2% specific capacitance retained after 1000 cycle tests. These results indicate that the electrochemical capacitive performance of as-prepared nanocomposites could be enhanced by the positive synergistic effect between RGO and SnO2.
