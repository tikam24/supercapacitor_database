A Ni(OH)2 composite with good electrochemical performances was prepared by a facile method. Ni(OH)2 was homogeneously grown on the hydrophilic graphene/graphene oxide (G/GO) nanosheets, which can be prepared in large scale in my lab. Then G/GO/Ni(OH)2 was reduced by L-Ascorbic acid to obtain G/RGO/Ni(OH)2. Caused by the synergy effects among the components, the G/RGO/Ni(OH)2 electrode showed good electrochemical properties. The G/RGO/Ni(OH)2 electrode possessed a specific capacitance as high as 1510 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 and even 890 F g−1 at 40 A g−1. An asymmetric supercapacitor device consisting of G/RGO/Ni(OH)2 and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) was installed and displayed a high energy density of 44.9 W h kg−1 at the power energy density of 400.1 W kg−1. It was verified that the G/GO nanosheets are ideal supporting material in supercapacitor.
