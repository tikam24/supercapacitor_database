The electrochemical performance of capacitor was studied with LiCoO 2/AC as composite cathode and activated carbon (AC) as anode, in 1.0 mol/L LiPF6/EC+DMC electrolyte. Cyclic Voltammetary, Constant-Current Charge and Discharge, Electrochemical Impedance Spectrum (EIS) and Leakage Current Test were tested to study the characteristics of supercapacitors. The results illustrate that recharging voltage of hybrid supercapacitor can reach to 3.0 V and show good capacitance characteristics. The supercapacitor can rapidly charge and discharge and show good cycling performance. There is a great effect to the performance of the capacitors by adopting different proportional composite electrode. When the ratio of composite electrode is 6:4, we get maximum symmetrical Cyclic Voltammetary and short charge-discharge time only 26.4min; When the ratio is 7:3, the minimum AC impedance of 26.2Ω can be attained and least leakage current is only 19.92mA/g; When the ratio is 5:5, the best first specific capacity can reach to 70.17F/g but a lower capacity retention rate is 74.86%. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.
