Abstract: One-dimensional h-MoO3 structures were produced by a hydrothermal method. The effect of the hydrothermal treatment conditions on the microstructure and particle size of the formed oxide powder was shown. The formation of the hexagonal structure of the powder and the absence of crystalline impurities were confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction analysis. The electrophysical characteristics of the surface of the obtained powder were evaluated by scanning capacitance force microscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy. The kinetics of the visible-light photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B in the presence of h-MoO3 was studied.
