In this paper, a comprehensive control strategy of hybrid power source is presented to provide required electricity for a standalone DC power system in rural residential area. This hybrid system consists of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel cell (PEMFC), a photovoltaic (PV) system and a supercapacitor (SC). The main aim of this paper is establishing a kind of hybrid power management for ensuring electricity production without interruption regarding to the PEMFC and PV uncertainties and limitations. The reason of utilizing the SC is covering the low dynamic of PEMFC against the fast load variation because of high power density of SC. Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT) controller is implemented for PV system by means of a new DC-DC converter topology. This proposed topology let us to control DC bus voltage at the same time. In addition, the Fuzzy logic controller is applied in different parts of the system such as PV MPPT and PEMFC voltage regulation. Ultimately, the simulation result are investigated to validate the proposed method authenticity.
