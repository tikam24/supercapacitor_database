A new three-dimensional (3D) porous graphene thin film named rGO-Fe was prepared through chemical reduction from Fe3+ ions cross-linking graphene oxide hydrogel, and a 3D porous graphene/titanium-containing conjugated polymer composite film named rGO-Fe/P(EDOT:P3C)-1-Ti was further prepared via electrochemical polymerization on the rGO-Fe substrate. As a new composite film, rGO-Fe/P(EDOT:P3C)-1-Ti film with average thickness of 3 μm can withstand the tensile load 0.97 N which is better than that of rGO-Fe (0.76 N). We compared the electrochemical properties of these film materials, and prepared self-supporting electrodes and a flexible all-solid-state supercapacitor based on rGO-Fe/P(EDOT:P3C)-1-Ti. Galvanostatic charge-discharge test results showed that the as prepared flexible supercapacitor delivered a gravimetric specific capacitance of 71.13 F·g-1 (18.14 F·g-1) and an area specific capacitance of 101 mF·cm-2 (25.8 mF·cm-2) at 0.1 A·g-1 (0.6 A·g-1).
