A simple approach to prepare NiCo2O4/NiO nanorods assembled from nanoparticles has been explored. The length and width of the nanorods can be easily controlled by adjusting the amount of metal salts. The nanorods present excellent electrochemical performance when used as electrode materials for supercapacitor. The large surface area and the small diameter provide not only rich active sites and high utilization of materials, but also the ability to accommodate volume changes. The materials exhibited a specific capacitance of 1395 F g−1 (697.5 C g−1, 1 A g−1) and good cycle stability with the capacitance retention of 123.6% after 5000 cycles.
