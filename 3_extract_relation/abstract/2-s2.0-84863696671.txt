A three-component, flexible electrode is developed for supercapacitors over graphitized carbon fabric, utilizing γ-MnO 2 nanoflowers anchored onto carbon nanotubes (γ-MnO 2/CNT) as spacers for graphene nanosheets (GNs). The three-component, composite electrode doubles the specific capacitance with respect to GN-only electrodes, giving the highest-reported specific capacitance (308 F g -1) for symmetric supercapacitors containing MnO 2 and GNs using a two-electrode configuration, at a scan rate of 20 mV s -1. A maximum energy density of 43 W h kg -1 is obtained for our symmetric supercapacitors at a constant discharge-current density of 2.5 A g -1 using GN-(γ-MnO 2/CNT)-nanocomposite electrodes. The fabricated supercapacitor device exhibits an excellent cycle life by retaining ≈90% of the initial specific capacitance after 5000 cycles. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
