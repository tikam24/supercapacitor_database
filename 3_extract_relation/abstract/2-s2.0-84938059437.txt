The porous carbon materials were synthetized by using the method of hydrothermal based on lignin biomass. This paper adopted ligninsulfonate, paraformaldehyde as carbon sources, F127 as a template agent. KOH was used to activate the materials and broaden its apertures. The electrochemical performance was characterized by charge-discharge of constant current and cyclic voltammogram (CV). The purpose is to produce a new kind of carbon electrode materials with favorable capacitive performance of supercapacitor.
