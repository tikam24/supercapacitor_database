Highly porous carbon electrodes for supercapacitors with high energy storage performance were prepared by using a new precursor blend of aromatic polyimide (PI) and polyvinyli-dene fluoride (PVDF). Supercapacitor electrodes were prepared through the electrospinning and thermal treatment of the precursor blends of aromatic PI and PVDF. Microstructures of the carbonized PI/PVDF nanofibers were studied using Raman spectroscopy. Nitrogen adsorp-tion/desorption measurements confirmed their high surface area and porosity, which is critical for supercapacitor performance. Energy storage performance was investigated and carbonized PI/PVDF showed a high specific capacitance of 283 F/g at 10 mV/s (37% higher than that of PI) and an energy density of 11.3 Wh/kg at 0.5 A/g (27% higher than that of PI) with high cycling stability.
