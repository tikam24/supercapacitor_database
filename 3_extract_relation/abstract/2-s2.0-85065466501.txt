ZnFe 2 O 4 @MnO 2 was synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. The morphology of ZnFe 2 O 4 @MnO 2 was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). SEM and TEM photographs showed that the structure of manganese dioxide was affected by the reaction time. The composition of this compound was investigated by XRD and XPS. Electrochemical tests showed that ZnFe 2 O 4 @MnO 2 had more desirable electrical properties than ZnFe 2 O 4 , and the areal capacitance was 1442 Fg −1 at 2 mA cm −2 . It also showed that ZnFe 2 O 4 @MnO 2 possessed superior stability (90%remained after 3000 cycles). Activated carbon and ZnFe 2 O 4 @MnO 2 were used to form the negative and positive electrodes of an asymmetric supercapacitor, respectively. The asymmetric supercapacitor had an energy density and power density of 49.7 Wh kg −1 and 1918.4 W kg −1 , respectively.
