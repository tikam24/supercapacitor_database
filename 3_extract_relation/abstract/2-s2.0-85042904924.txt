Expelling of heavy metal ions into water resource systems is extremely hazardous to the environment. Adsorption is one of the most cost effective and potential methods to remove the heavy metal ions from the effluents. Therefore, an attempt has been made to study the adsorption of metal particles of Cd and Hg from aqueous solution by using reduced graphene oxide-molybdenum disulphide (rGO-MoS2) nanocomposites as adsorbents. The rGO-MoS2 composites were synthesized by following simple physical methods; which involve the mixing of dispersions of MoS2 and graphene oxide (GO) by sonication, followed by subsequent reduction with hydrazine hydrate. Characterization of the nanocomposites was performed by FESEM, TEM, EDAX, raman spectroscopy, XRD and BET surface area analysis. Electron microscopic images validate the presence of homogeneity in the synthesized nanocomposite. Batch adsorption experiments were used to scrutinizethe effect of an array of parameters like effect of pH, initial concentration of the metal ions, adsorbent dose, and contact time on the adsorption capacity of metal ions on rGO-MoS2 nanocomposites. The thorough examination of adsorbed isotherm and energy demonstrates the best fitting of the adsorption data with the ‘Langmuir adsorption isotherm model’ and follows the pseudo-second-order kinetic in active condition. The synthesized materials havealso been tested against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains and have showcased promising antimicrobial activities. At the same time, the nanocomposites were evaluated for electrochemical performance in supercapacitors. The rGO-MoS2 nanocomposite demonstrates better capacitance (440 Fg-1) at 5 mvs−1 scan rate. The inimitable surface property of MoS2 and good electrical conductivity of rGO results show versatile usage and formidable performance as an adsorbent, antibacterial agent and electrode material for supercapacitors.
