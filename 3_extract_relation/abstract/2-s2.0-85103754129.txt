3D hierarchical porous soybean root-derived carbon (SRC) is successfully developed from N, O-contained natural soybean root through a convenient one-step carbonization activation route. SRC own abundant hierarchical pores, great specific surface area and considerable N and O elements. As-prepared carbon-based electrode exhibits specific capacitance of 269.4 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and capacitance retention (97% after 20,000 charge and discharge cycles), while assembled symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) has an operating voltage window of 2.0 V and energy density of 23.0 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 500 W kg−1. This work makes natural soybean root be utilized as 3D heteroatom-doped carbon and provide another alternative strategy for high-performance electrode materials.
