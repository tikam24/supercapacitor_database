This paper proposes for an optimal functioning of an electro energetically wind system an original method. A mathematical model is used for analyzing energy characteristics of the electric power generation system. The system is composed from a synchronous generator with permanent magnet excitation from the wind turbine, a synchronous generator with permanent magnets (WT+PMSG), an active rectifier and inverter with PΩM, an electric accumulator and a super capacitor. This paper is trying to solve fundamental problems of the WT measuring the wind speed, on given time intervals. Problems are related to the determination of the generator speed in the way that the captivated energy to be maximal. To reach this, a correlation between the load of the generator and the variation of kinetic energy of the moving rotation masses need to be made; fluctuations of the power given in the standard national network need to be smoothed; algorithms are needed to control the active rectifier, inverter and DC+DC for a variable speed wind turbine; analytical relations are needed for a constant generation of voltage and power in the system; fluctuations need to be loaded in the electric accumulator (EA) and super capacitor (SC). Recommendations are given for choosing control algorithms and structural circuits for a wind power system at a variable speed of the wind turbine (WT). © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
