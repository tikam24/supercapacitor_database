Mesoporous Mn3O4 with 3D network and high specific surface areas have been successfully synthesized at room temperature via a template-free way. Acting as a supercapacitor electrode in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, the sponge-like mesoporous Mn3O4 exhibits high specific capacitances (230~280 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1) as well as greatly improved rate and cycling performance. Their capacitance retentions of ca 52.8% obtained when the current density increasing from 0.5 A g−1 to 30 A g−1, and a cycle stability reached 98.9% after 5000 cycles at a current density of 2 A g−1. Furthermore, the high yield, facile and environmental friendly synthetic route allows the mesoporous Mn3O4 preparation to be readily scaled-up. The results indicate that the as-prepared mesoporous Mn3O4 with a 3D cross-link network structure has a great potential as the electrode material for supercapacitors with high electrochemical performance.
