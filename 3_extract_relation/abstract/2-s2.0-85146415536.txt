Owing to the rising interest in the utilization of renewable energy sources, research studies on optimizing energy storage have gained momentum. Metal oxide nanosheets are one of the most promising materials employed in supercapacitors, batteries, and fuel cells to enhance electrochemical storage efficiency. In particular, the excellent properties of metal oxide nanosheets, such as flexibility, transparency, semiconductivity, photosensitivity, redox properties, atomic-level thickness, abundant active sites, remarkable mechanical strength, along with high specific surface area and chemical stability, make them highly suitable for application in electrochemical energy storage systems. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the recent developments in the usage of metal oxide nanosheets in electrochemical energy storage systems, including supercapacitors, batteries, and fuel cells, the fabrication and tuning methods, as well as the challenges associated with the material.
