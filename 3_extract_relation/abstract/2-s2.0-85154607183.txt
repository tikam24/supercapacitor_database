The one-dimensional (1D) transition metal oxide (TMO) nanostructures have significant advantages in electrochemical energy storage fields. To date, simplifying the processing techniques and improving the yield without compromising the quality are one of the top priorities in pushing these TMO materials for scalable energy storage applications. This study presents a simple ultrasonic-assisted chemical route to prepare Na2V6O16 (NVO) nanobelts. The X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy characterizations are used to confirm the formation of 1D NVO nanobelt structures. The growth mechanism for the formation of NVO nanobelts is also provided. Moreover, these synthesized NVO nanobelts are used as an electrode material for supercapacitor (SC) applications, which exhibit a specific capacitance of 455 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 with typical capacitive behavior. An asymmetric coin cell SC device of activated carbon//NVO is also fabricated. This fabricated device delivers a high energy density of 42.4 W h kg-1 and a high power density of 4.3 kW h kg-1, along with 80% capacity retention after 5000 cycles. The 1D NVO nanobelt structures can be considered a promising cathode material with superior rate capability and high capacitance for SC applications.
