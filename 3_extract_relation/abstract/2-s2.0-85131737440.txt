Metal-organic frameworks derived materials have been explored as advanced energy storage materials in high power-energy applications. In this work, ZIF-67 and graphene oxide template-derived NiCo2O4 nanosheets is synthesized by the ultrasonication method. A simple and novel approach is proposed to get NiCo2O4 nanosheets. From the probe sonication method, multi-nanosheets structure, i.e., NiCo2O4 nanosheets/graphene nanosheets, based composite electrode material was prepared and fabricated into supercapacitor application to achieved a high specific capacitance of ca. 1365 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and excellent capacity retention of 89.11% over 2000 cycles at 10 A g−1. The proposed composite electrode could also be performed as a high-capacity battery-type anode material in other energy storage applications.
