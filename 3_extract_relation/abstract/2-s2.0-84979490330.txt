Hierarchical Co3O4@CoWO4/rGO core/shell nanoneedles arrays are successfully grown on 3D nickel foam using a simple, effective method. By virtue of its unique structure, Co3O4@CoWO4/rGO demonstrates an enhanced specific capacitance of 386 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 current density. It can be used as an integrated, additive-free electrode for supercapacitors that boasts excellent performance. As illustration, we assemble an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) using the as-prepared Co3O4@CoWO4/rGO as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode. The optimized ASC displays a maximum energy density of 19.99 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 321 W kg-1. Furthermore, the ASC also presents a remarkably long cycle life along with 88.8% specific capacitance retention after 5000 cycles.
