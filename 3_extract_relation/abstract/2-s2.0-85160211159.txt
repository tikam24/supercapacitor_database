The construction of new-type power systems in China is accelerating as the country puts forward the national strategic goals of peak carbon dioxide emission and carbon neutrality. To meet the minute-level power supplement demands that have appeared in the power system with high new energy penetration, this paper proposed a new type of energy storage system solution which is based on hybrid ultracapacitors. In this paper, the basic principle, classification, and characteristics of hybrid ultracapacitor are first introduced. Then, the main components and typical structure of the hybrid ultracapacitor-based energy storage system are described. The key technologies of the hybrid ultracapacitor-based energy storage system integration are discussed. Finally, the paper prospects for the future development of short-term high-frequency energy storage represented by the hybrid ultracapacitor-based energy storage in the new-type power system. The promising application scenarios of the hybrid ultracapacitor-based energy storage system in the new-type power system are analyzed and illustrated.
