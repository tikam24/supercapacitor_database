The N/O co-doped porous carbon nanoribbons (PCNR) have been prepared via a template polymerization synchronous chemical activation route. The PCNR samples were characterized by SEM, TEM, FTIR, Raman, XRD, BET and XPS. The results show that the PCNR presents a 3D connected ribbon structure. The surface of carbon nanoribbons is porous. The PCNR800 activated at 800â„ƒ presents a large specific surface area of 2342 m2/g, high-level nitrogen atom doping of 10.75% and oxygen atom doping of 13.90%. As supercapacitor electrode materials, the typical PCNR800 sample exhibits excellent energy storage characteristics. The PCNR800 supercapacitor shows a high specific capacitance of 58.8 F/g (1.0 A/g). A high energy density of 73.3 Wh/kg at a power density of 1.5 kW/kg can be achieved. The specific capacitance of the supercapacitor was 96.5% of the initial specific capacitance and the columbic efficiency still remains above 99% after 5000 cycles.
