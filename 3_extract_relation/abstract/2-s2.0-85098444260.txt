The ultrafine tin oxide (SnO2) nanorods/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composites are synthesized by a two-step hydrothermal method. The prepared nanocomposites are characterized by scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffractometer, and Fourier transform infrared spectra. The results of electrochemical performance show that specific capacitance of the composite can reach 262.2 F g−1 at the current density of 100 mA g−1 in the 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. An initial capacitance retention of the composite is 96.1% after 6000 cycles, indicating its excellent electrochemical performance.
