Due to the environmental friendliness and high safety of aqueous Zn-ion hybrid capacitors (ZIHCs), the exploration of high-performance porous carbon electrodes for ZIHCs has recently attracted significant attention. However, most of the reports focus on the preparation method and modification of porous carbon, and rarely explore the mechanisms of material synthesis/fabrication in the carbonization process. In this study, we developed a simple self-template method for preparing N-doped porous carbon from d-calcium pantothenate (DCP). More importantly, the morphology evolution, heteroatom doping, and defect generation of the DCP during carbonization are clarified. Based on a clear understanding of the carbonization mechanism, assisted by DFT theoretical simulations, we find the optimal carbonization temperature of the DCP-derived porous carbon for ZIHCs. The assembled ZIHCs exhibit excellent rate performance (140 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 and 86.2 mA h g−1 at 6.4 A g−1), and high energy density and power density (111.1 W h kg−1 and 4835.2 W kg−1, respectively). This work provides a constructive avenue for designing high-performance ZIHC electrode materials.
