In terms of enhancing the energy storage performance of flexible MXene electrode, both heteroatom doping and introducing electroactive “spacers” are proved to be effective strategies. In this work, a facial protective hydrothermal method is explored to synthesis nitrogen doped porous MXene/TiO2 heterostructure in one pot, which enables a well preserved conductivity of porous N-doped MXene and controlled in-situ generation of uniformly dispersed electroactive TiO2 spacers. This unique hybridized structure provides a chance to integrate several physical and chemical advantages in a complementary easy way. As a result, the assembled freestanding film electrode based on the N-doped porous MXene/TiO2 heterogeneous layers demonstrates excellent energy storage performance with an outstanding specific capacitance value of 2194.33 mF cm−2 (918.69 F g−1), which outperforms most of the heteroatom-doped MXene electrodes reported previously. Besides, the film electrode delivers excellent cycling performance with a 74.39% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles and the as fabricated flexible supercapacitor displays almost no changes on capacitive performance when subjected to mechanical deformations, indicating its excellent flexibility and stability. This work presents a simple way of modifying MXene with N doping and inserting “spacer” for enhancing the electrochemical performance, and builds up an exciting potential for applying to highly flexible and integrated energy storage devices.
