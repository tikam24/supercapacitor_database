A facile and feasible electrochemical polymerization method has been used to construct the multi-wall carbon nanotubes@poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrene sulfonate) (MWCNTs@PEDOT/PSS) core-shell composites with three-dimensional (3D) porous nano-network microstructure. The composites are characterized with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope, and transmission electron microscopy. This special core-shell nanostructure can significantly reduce the ions diffusion distance and the 3D porous nano-network microstructure effectively enlarges the electrode/electrolyte interface. The electrochemical tests including cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests are performed, the results manifest the MWCNTs@PEDOT/PSS core-shell composites have superior capacitive behaviors and excellent cyclic stability, and a high areal capacitance of 98.1 mF cm-2 is achieved at 5 mV s-1 cyclic voltammetry scan. Furthermore, the MWCNTs@PEDOT/PSS composites exhibit obviously superior capacitive performance than that of PEDOT/PSS and PEDOT/Cl electrodes, indicating the effective composite of MWCNTs and PEDOT noticeably boosts the capacitive performance of PEDOT-based electrodes for electrochemical energy storage. Such a highly stable core-shell 3D network structural composite is very promising to be used as electrode materials for the high-performance electrochemical capacitors.
