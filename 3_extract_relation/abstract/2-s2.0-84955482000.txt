Here, we report an efficient strategy by which a significantly enhanced electrode-electrolyte interface in an electrode for supercapacitor application could be accomplished by allowing in situ polymer gel electrolyte generation inside the nanopores of the electrodes. This unique and highly efficient strategy could be conceived by judiciously maintaining ultraviolet-triggered polymerization of a monomer mixture in the presence of a high-surface-area porous carbon. The method is very simple and scalable, and a prototype, flexible solid-state supercapacitor could even be demonstrated in an encapsulation-free condition by using the commercial-grade electrodes (thickness = 150 μm, area = 12 cm2, and mass loading = 7.3 mg/cm2). This prototype device shows a capacitance of 130 F/g at a substantially reduced internal resistance of 0.5 ω and a high capacitance retention of 84% after 32000 cycles. The present system is found to be clearly outperforming a similar system derived by using the conventional polymer electrolyte (PVA-H3PO4 as the electrolyte), which could display a capacitance of only 95 F/g, and this value falls to nearly 50% in just 5000 cycles. The superior performance in the present case is credited primarily to the excellent interface formation of the in situ generated polymer electrolyte inside the nanopores of the electrode. Further, the interpenetrated nature of the polymer also helps the device to show a low electron spin resonance and power rate and, most importantly, excellent shelf-life in the unsealed flexible conditions. Because the nature of the electrode-electrolyte interface is the major performance-determining factor in the case of many electrochemical energy storage/conversion systems, along with the supercapacitors, the developed process can also find applications in preparing electrodes for the devices such as lithium-ion batteries, metal-air batteries, polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells, etc.
