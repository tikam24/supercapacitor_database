The development of MoS2 in the metallic phase (1T-MoS2) is of paramount interest as it exhibits superior electrochemical activities compared to its semiconducting polymorph (2H-MoS2). In this work, an ionic liquid (IL)-assisted solvothermal method was employed to produce the thermodynamically metastable 1T-MoS2. Structural characterization of the material suggests the intercalation of the IL into MoS2. De-intercalation of ILs from 1T-MoS2 leads to the formation of 2H-MoS2. Carbon cloth-supported 1T-MoS2(1T-MoS2@CC) shows higher electrocatalytic activity towards acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by delivering a current density of 50 mA/cm2 at an overpotential of 210 mV whereas 2H-MoS2@CC requires an overpotential of 260 mV to reach the same current density. In addition, the 1T-MoS2@CC electrode delivers a high electrochemical double-layer storage ability compared to 2H-MoS2@CC in 1 M Na2SO4. The enhanced electrochemical activity of 1T-MoS2 over 2H-MoS2 may be due to the existence of conducting basal planes and the high interlayer spacing (about 1 nm) caused by the intercalation of ILs into the MoS2 layers.
