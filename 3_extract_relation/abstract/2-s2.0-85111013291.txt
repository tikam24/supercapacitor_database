In this study, we report on the synthesis of pristine and iron (Fe)-doped nickel oxide nanoparticles (NPs) using a precipitation method. The optical, magnetic, and supercapacitor properties of NPs were investigated via ultravioletâ€“visible absorption, vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The effect of Fe doping on the optical bandgap of NiO nanoparticles demonstrates that the bandgap increases with increasing doping concentration (x = 0.02 M, 0.04 M, and 0.06 M). The VSM exhibits ferromagnetic behavior at room temperature. Fe doped sample shows promising supercapacitor electrode material properties ensuring that NiO: Fe could act as an enhanced working electrode for the future generation of supercapacitors.
