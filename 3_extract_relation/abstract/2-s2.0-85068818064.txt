Supercapacitors are considered to be a new promising green energy storage device owing to their excellent long cycle life. Compared with the conventional coating technique, the strategy of self-growing electrode materials on highly flexible collectors have become a new development trend. A binder-free and flexible electrode composed of vertical MoS2 nanosheets arrays on carbon cloth was obtained via a convenient hydrothermal method. Carbon cloth, as a supporting substrate, effectively avoids the agglomeration of MoS2 nanosheets and exposes more electrochemical active sites. The construction of binder-free electrode is an effective way to improve the electrochemical performance, which makes ions transfer faster. As a result, MoS2 nanosheets arrays decorated carbon cloth shows high areal capacitance (2236.6 mF cm−2 at 10 mA cm−2) with favorable cycle stability (86.1% after 2000 cycles). To further explore the practical application of supercapacitors, symmetric coin cell (SCC) and all-solid-state supercapacitors (ASC) were assembled using MoS2/CC as working electrode. Due to the facile preparation, the excellent performance and the stable architecture, the vertical MoS2 arrays decorated carbon cloth as binder-free electrode will be greatly developed in the field of flexible supercapacitors.
