In this paper, hierarchical Co 3 O 4 -SnO@SnO 2 nanostructures flexible supercapacitor electrodes were fabricated by hydrothermal routine. Owing to the introduction of Co 3 O 4 as well as a cleverly PN junction hierarchically skeleton, the Co 3 O 4 -SnO@SnO 2 electrode presents a structure of nanospheres covered by nanoparticles, offering a low internal resistance (0.6 Ω) and high electrical conductivity. Without the use of a binder and complicated manufacturing process, the hierarchical nanostructures can be directly used as the working electrode in the three-electrode system. In addition, the electrode demonstrates a high specific capacitance (1.056 F cm −2 at 1 mA cm −2 ) and excellent stability (only 8.5% was lost in initial specific capacitance at 1 mA cm −2 after 2000 cycles). Therefore, the hierarchical Co 3 O 4 -SnO@SnO 2 nanostructures provide an opportunity for the coordinated development of novel energy density and power density of supercapacitor.
