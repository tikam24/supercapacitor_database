This paper describes a multi-variable robust control scheme for frequency regulation in a diesel–photovoltaic–supercapacitor hybrid power generation system operating in stand-alone mode. The proposed control structure relies on a two-level architecture, with conventional PI-based current tracking controllers placed on the lower control level and receiving references from an H∞-control-based upper level. The specific engineering demands of microgrid operation are cast into an H∞ control formalism. A rapid-prototyping test bench composed of a real supercapacitor-based energy storage system and an emulated diesel–photovoltaic–load grid is developed using real-time digital simulators, namely RT-LAB® and dSPACE®, in order to experimentally validate the proposed frequency robust control strategy under realistic operating conditions.
