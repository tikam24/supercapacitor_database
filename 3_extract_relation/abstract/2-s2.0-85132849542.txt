The feasible solution to overcome the mismatch between the world's energy demand and supply can be the development of appropriate charge-storing devices like batteries and supercapacitors. In the present work, an attempt has been made to design an efficient supercapacitor electrode material by employing the synergistic effects of Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO). A time saving hybrid microwave assisted annealing technique has been used to synthesize MoS2-RGO based nanostructures with varying composition of RGO i.e. 5, 10, 15 and 20%. FESEM, XRD and Raman spectroscopy have been employed to study the surface morphology and structure of the synthesized nanomaterial. The candidature of the MoS2-RGO nanostructures for the electrode material of supercapacitor has been justified by using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). A magnificent performance like specific capacity of 429.67 Cg−1 (1023 Fg−1) at a current density of 1 Ag−1 and a decent retention of 82% after 1000 cycles, even at the higher current density i.e. 5Ag−1, was displayed by the MoS2-RGO (10%) nanostructure based electrode. The correlating results of voltammetric and EIS studies are reported and discussed.
