In this paper, the graphene-like two-dimensional Ti3C2Tx was prepared by an improved method. Firstly, Ti3AlC2 powders were etched by hydrofluoric acid, then intercalated in dimethyl sulfoxide with the assistance of the surfactant cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide, and finally subjected to ultrasonic treatment. XRD tests showed that the intercalation agent molecules were more likely to enter the Ti3C2Tx layer due to the intercalation of the surfactant, which significantly increased the interlayer spacing and reduced the interaction between the layers, facilitating the delamination. Nitrogen adsorption and desorption experiments confirmed that the Ti3C2Tx prepared by this method exhibited a higher specific surface area and pore volume. Electrochemical tests showed that the symmetrical capacitor using Ti3C2Tx as electrode materials exhibited a higher specific capacitance, the specific capacitance at a current density of 0.5 A/g was 75.0 F/g. And when the charging current was increased to 4 A/g, its capacitance was maintained at 57.0 F/g. After 2 500 charge and discharge cycles, the specific capacitance of Ti3C2Tx material was 61.5 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g, and the capacitance retention was 87.0%.
