Cerium (Ce) doped SnO2/g-C3N4 composites were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. The obtained Ce doped SnO2/g-C3N4 composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), UV–visible spectroscopy (UV–Vis), scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectra (EDS), elemental mapping and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). An electrode made of Ce doped SnO2/g-C3N4 exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 274 F/g at 1 A/g current density. The supercapacitor device fabricated by using Ce-SnO2/g-C3N4//Activated Carbon as electrodes has showed an energy and power densities of 39.3 W h kg−1 and 7425 W kg−1. The asymmetric device gives the retention of 84.2% after completing 5000 cycles. When the same, Ce-SnO2/g-C3N4, composite is used as a photo-catalyst for reduction of methylene blue dye under visible light irradiation, exhibits a higher degradation efficiency of 98% which is higher efficiency compared to all other synthesized samples.
