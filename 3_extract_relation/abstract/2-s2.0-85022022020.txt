In this manuscript, we describe the synthesis and electrochemical characterization of polyaniline—gum arabic nanocomposites and graphene oxide (PANI-GA/GO) modified electrodes with a detailed study concerning their supercapacitive properties. The electrode modification was carried out by using the Layer-by-Layer technique (LbL), where the PANI-GA nanocomposite dispersion was used as polycation and the GO colloidal dispersion as polyanion. The bilayer growth was followed by both UV–vis spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry, and an increase in the characteristic PANI absorption and in the electrochemical signal was verified, confirming the electrode build up. Galvanostatic charge-discharge curves (GCDC) were performed to evaluate the supercapacitive properties of the modified electrodes, these results showed the dependence of the specific capacitance with the number of bilayers, where values of C S around 15 mF cm −2 (i = 0.1 mA cm −2 ) were found. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy confirmed the pseudocapacitive properties of the modified electrodes, showing an increase in the low-frequency capacitance with the number of bilayers. Hereby the (PANI-GA/GO)-LbL electrodes were shown to be good candidates for active materials in supercapacitors.
