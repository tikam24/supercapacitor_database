A binder-free supercapacitor electrode of NiCo2O4 nanograss coated on nickel foam (NF) was prepared by single-mode microwave method along with calcination, displaying a higher specific capacitance (1042 F/g at 1 mV/s). Furthermore, we demonstrate excellent electrochemical performance of NiCo2O4 nanograss as anode electrode and carbide-derived carbon as cathode electrode. The resultant asymmetric supercapacitors possess high specific capacitance (105.6 F/g at 1 mV/s), good cycling stability (retention capacitance of 78.5% after 5000 cycles), high energy density (32.9 Wh/kg) and large power density (970.1 W/kg), which has potential application in energy storage devices.
