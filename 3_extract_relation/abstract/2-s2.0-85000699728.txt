The ternary alkali metal copper chalcogenides have been studied for 30 years. The compounds can be classified by their geometrical structures and their electronic structures. The copper in these compounds can exhibit a monovalent state or a mixed-valence state. Most previous researches mainly focus on the unique transport phenomena, electrical conductivity and phase transition properties of these materials. However, the thermoelectricity and supercapacitor properties are rarely investigated. In this review we mainly study the techniques for the preparation of ternary alkali metal copper chalcogenides and discuss the recent advances in several compounds based materials in energy science, including thermoelectricity and supercapacitors.
