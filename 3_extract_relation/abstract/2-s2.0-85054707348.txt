Transition metal oxides especially Fe2O3 has been widely considered as a potential electrode material for current commercial supercapacitors. However, the low electronic conductivity limits the obtained specific capacitance and cycle stability of supercapacitor devices. In the present work, 2D nano-circular-like α-Fe2O3 coupled reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composites have been synthesized for the first time via a simple, inexpensive hydrothermal process. Moreover, circular α-Fe2O3 nanoplates are well-dispersed on rGO layers, which can offer abundant active sites and effectively buffer the reunion of α-Fe2O3 nanocomposites during the electrochemical reactions. At an optimal ratio of 10 wt% GO, the as-prepared sample exhibits electrochemical performance with excellent specific capacitance of 621.3 F g−1 at 5 mV−1 and 533 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, which is better than that of pure α-Fe2O3. Most attractively, the specific capacitance is highly retained about 77% after 14000 cycles, revealing superior cycle ability.
