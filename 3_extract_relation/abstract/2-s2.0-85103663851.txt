Rational optimization design for the structure of materials on the self-supported electrode usually be an effective strategy for the development of advanced supercapacitors. Herein, the Co3O4/CoVxOy nanosheets composed of interweaved nanowires with core-shell structure were prepared through the two-step hydrothermal process combined with annealing treatment. These electrode materials exhibited a high specific capacitance of 1162.2 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, a good rate capability and a satisfactory cycling life. Asymmetric devices were fabricated using an as-prepared electrode as a positive electrode and activated carbon as a negative electrode, which delivered the highest energy density of 26.1 Wh kg−1 with a power density of 400 W kg−1 in the voltage range of 0–1.6 V. This work with the encouraging results point out the as-obtained Co3O4/CoVxOy composites not only can be a promising candidate for the energy storage system but also present a practicable route to design nanosheets core-shell structures for other transition metal oxides.
