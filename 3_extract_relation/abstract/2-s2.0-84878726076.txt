A superior electrode for high-performance supercapacitors has been designed by growing homogeneous NiO nanoparticles on conductive Ni foam substrate through a facile two-step method. The preparation strategy involves the electrodeposition of nickel hydroxide precursor on Ni foam and subsequent lowtemperature annealing process. These NiO nanoparticles are interconnected with each other, forming a loose network with a highly open and porous structure. This unique 3D NiO-Ni foam electrode manifests the electrolyte penetration and ion migration as well as large electroactive surface area. As a result, outstanding pseudocapacitive performance is achieved with a high specific capacitance (2558 F g-1 at 2 A g-1 in a potential window of 0.5 V) and excellent rate capability (70% capacity retention at 40 A g-1), which shows great potential in the development of high-performance energy-storage systems.
