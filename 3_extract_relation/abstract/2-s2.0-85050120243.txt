This Paper presents as electronic actuation control unit used in the automotive domain and it will provide an embedded energy of about 450J in case of emergency conditions such as during accidents if the main battery fails or if any problems occur in the wiring parasitic of vehicle connectivity network. Ultra capacitor based energy system used in the electric vehicle propulsion and it provides high energy density for the electronic actuation control unit in case of emergency conditions. It consists of 4 EDLC (Electric double layer capacitor) of 3 V and capacitance 25F and provides the energy back up if main battery fails in the vehicle and it will provide the necessary voltage and current levels to the ACU to make the system to work in safe condition. Step-up converter (Boost Converter) will provide the voltage and current levels for to the load and it is used in SMPS (Switch Mode Power Supply) because it is having low switching losses and the efficiency is high. ACU can be designed on the PCB (personal Computer Board) which is inserted in the vehicle connectivity network. CAN (Controller Area Network) protocol is used in the automotive domain as the connectivity network. ACU will maintain the power level and provide power level of hundred of watts within a short time for the crucial mechatronic applications.
