This work is conducted with aim of enhancing the energy density and cycling performance of PANI/fMWCNTs within a very low molar concentration of the mixed acidic/neutral electrolyte where not only the medium, but the structure too facilitates easy charge transfer because of increased ionic mobility. A promising optimized flower-like morphology of symmetric supercapacitor electrode of functionalized Multi-walled Carbon Nanotubes (f-MWCNTs) with Polyaniline (PANI) composites are prepared by in-situ chemical oxidative polymerization method with different doping concentrations of f-MWCNTs (5 wt% and 10 wt%). The synthesized PANI/f-MWCNTs (5 wt%) composite provides a large surface area (133.55 m2/g), high porosity (11.24 nm), low internal resistance (6.16 Ω) and charge transfer property (2.74 Ω) between the electrode within a mixed (0.1 M H2SO4 + 0.1 M Na2SO4) electrolyte interface. To overcome the cracking/swelling of PANI during electrochemical performance, the electrodes of PANI are incorporated with different doping concentration of f-MWCNT (5 wt% or 10 wt%). With a specific capacitance of 867 F g−1 at 10 mV/s, energy density ~77.0 Whkg−1 and power density ~801 Wkg−1, PFC1 nanocomposite indicates ~20 % more stability than pure PANI. Also, the nanocomposite electrode cell shows a columbic efficiency of 97 % and 98.5 % of its initial value of specific capacitance after 10,000 GCD cycles in a mixed acidic/neutral (0.1 M H2SO4 + 0.1 M Na2SO4) aqueous electrolytic solution.
