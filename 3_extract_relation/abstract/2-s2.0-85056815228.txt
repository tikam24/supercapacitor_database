The sudden rise in gasoline products makes the transportation sector hectic. So the gasoline transportation is replaced by electrified transportation. The usage of renewable energy sources and energy storage technologies are of great demand in electrified transportation. Individual energy storage systems cannot compensate efficiently the demand for power for an electric vehicle. So a solar fed integrated system of lithium-ion battery and supercapacitor in an electric vehicle is nominated in this paper. Hybrid energy storage system (HESS) is implemented by the charging and discharging of storage elements used. HESS enhances the whole performance and efficiency of electric powered vehicles. MATLAB and Proteus are the simulation platform used.
