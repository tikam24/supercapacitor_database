Mesoporous Mn-Ni oxides with the chemical compositions of Mn 1-xN ixOδ (x=0, 0.2, and 0.4) were prepared by a solid-state reaction route, using manganese sulfate, nickel chloride, and potassium hydroxide as starting materials. The obtained Mn-Ni oxides, mainly consisting of the phases of α- and γ-MnO 2, presented irregular mesoporous agglomerates built from ultra-fine particles. Specific surface area of Mn1-xNixOd was 42.8, 59.6, and 84.5 m 2 g -1 for x=0, 0.2, and 0.4, respectively. Electrochemical properties were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge in 6 mol L -1 KOH electrolyte. Specific capacitances of Mn 1-xN ixOδ were 343, 528, and 411 F g -1 at a scan rate of 2mV s -1 for x=0, 0.2, and 0.4, respectively, and decreased to 157, 183, and 130 F g -1 with increasing scan rate to 100 mV s -1, respectively. After 500 cycles at a current density of 1.24 A g -1, the symmetrical Mn1-xNixOd capacitors delivered specific capacitances of 160, 250, and 132 F g -1 for x=0, 0.2, and 0.4, respectively, retaining about 82%, 89%, and 75% of their respective initial capacitances. The Mn 0.8Ni 0.2Oδ material showed better supercapacitive performance, which was promising for supercapacitor applications. © Springer-Verlag 2010.
