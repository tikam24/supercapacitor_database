This research utilizes a simple and effective dip coating/ultrasonication method to prepare porous graphene-coated sensing fabrics made with commercially produced acrylic/spandex yarn with multifunctional performance. We examine the electrochemical performance of graphene-coated fabrics and explore their potential in applications involving pressure sensors. The results show that our graphene-coated fabric demonstrates a maximum specific capacitance value of 17.4 F/g. When applied as a pressure sensor, the capacitance change rate of our sensor increases linearly with the increase in pressure applied to the fabrics. Our sensor also shows a fast response in a pressure loadingâ€“unloading test, which indicates an outstanding sensing property and shows promising capabilities as a supercapacitor.
