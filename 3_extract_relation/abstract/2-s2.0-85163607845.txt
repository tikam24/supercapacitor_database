In this research, manganese cobaltite (MCO) nanoparticles with different morphologies were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method with excellent electrochemical properties. To investigate the physical features of prepared samples, XRD analysis was used to study the crystalline structure. The SEM and TEM proved that the morphology of synthesized materials formed as flake and nanoplane structures. The electrode of samples was prepared using the hydrothermal method and the electrochemical properties of samples were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic stability analysis. Results showed that the flake structures of nanoparticles revealed the highest capacitance of 1971.98F g-1 at 0.5Ag-1 as well as longer stability compared to the others with the nanoplane structure. The high cyclic stability of 91.47% after 5000 cycles introduces this electrode as a durable and promising electrode for use in energy storage devices.
