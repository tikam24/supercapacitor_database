Because of excellent power density, good reversibility, and superior stability, supercapacitors have attracted more attention in microelectronic system developments. However, the large-scale preparation of high-performance supercapacitors with low-cost and high mechanical flexibility is still challenging. Herein we report the convenient fabrication of an all-in-one pseudocapacitor by magnetron sputtering and electro-deposition of a MnO2@Ni cathode and an activated carbon@Ni anode on the two sides of a glass fiber separator. Specifically, the MnO2 cathode deposited on Ni Nanocone arrays (NNAs) showed good cycle performance (92.2% after 5000 cycles) and excellent capacitance (644 F/g) and. The NNAs@AC (activated carbon) anode deposited on the other side showed a 224 F/g high capacitance and favorable cycle performance (105.9% after 5000 cycles). Benefiting from the special integration method, the porous architecture of the electrodes, and the use of zinc ions as the charge carrier, our all-in-one device achieved favorable mechanical flexibility, high energy density (103.4 Wh/kg at 1.7 kW/kg) with a long cycle(76% after 5000 cycles). Besides, our fabrication approach can be easily extended to the mass production of low-cost devices and provides a new alternative strategy for flexible high-performance energy storage devices.
