Experimental results on cathodic electrosynthesis of MnO2 electrodes for electrochemical supercapacitors are presented. The deposition yield data at different pulse durations and electrosynthesis mechanism are discussed. Electron microscopy investigations show porous structure of the electrodes, which is beneficial for good electrolyte access to the active material. The capacitance of 2.6Fcm-2 (199Fg-1), energy density of 20Whkg-1 and power density of 28kWkg-1 are achieved for 13mgcm-2 electrodes. The electrodes show improved capacitance retention at high scan rates. The Ni plaque-based MnO2 electrodes are promising for energy storage applications in electrochemical supercapacitors. MnO2 electrodes for supercapacitors are prepared by cathodic pulse electrosynthesis, which allows impregnation of Ni plaque current collectors, designed for high power applications. The electrodes show high capacitance and high power-energy characteristics at high materials loadings. Â© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
