The classic proper energy element in electric vehicle consists of batteries and Fuel cell (FC), which allow a relatively high autonomy, but they are with moderate power capability. On the other hand, the capacitors have high power capability they can only be considered for applications which require little energy. In term of specifics energy and power, supercapacitors are situated between accumulators and traditional capacitors. The hybridation of these sources with a power source as Supercapacitor (SC) is proposed. A recent approach of Passivity-based control (PBC) is the Interconnection and Damping Assignment (IDA-PBC) which is a very useful technique to control systems assigning a desired Port-Controlled Hamiltonian (PCH) structure to the closed-loop.
