The hollow NiCo2O4 nano-spheres (∼300–500 nm) are synthesized by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis method and used as electrode for high-performance supercapacitor (SC) and lithium-ion battery (LIB). When used in SC application, the hollow NiCo2O4 deliver a specific capacitance of ∼1000 F g−1 even after 3000 charge–discharge cycles. In addition, as an anode material for LIBs, it exhibits admirable high capacity values of 763 and 516 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at a current density of 1500 and 3000 mAh g−1, respectively. The excellent electrochemical performance of this hollow NiCo2O4 nano-sphere indicates its potential applications for next generation SCs and LIBs.
