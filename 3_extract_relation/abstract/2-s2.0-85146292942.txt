As an environmentally friendly energy storage device, supercapacitors have the advantages of low pollution and fast charging and discharging speed, which have attracted extensive attention of researchers. Aerogels are considered as a potential electrode material for supercapacitors due to its excellent characteristics such as light weight, low density, porosity. In last decades, although researchers have done a lot of work in the field of aerogels as electrodes of supercapacitors, the updating speed of knowledge is faster and faster. In addition, electrolyte also has an important influence on the energy storage characteristics of supercapacitors. Therefore, this mini review paper aims to compare the influence of different electrolytes on the energy storage performance of supercapacitors and summarize the recent research on the application of aerogel electrodes in supercapacitors in the past three years, in terms of various aerogel electrodes, material structure design, preparation methods, and related electrochemical performance. Finally, in view of the existing problems and challenges in the field, the author also gives his own views and prospects. Hopefully, this mini review can provide some more comprehensive information and reference for the further development and exploration of various electrolyte and aerogel electrodes of supercapacitors with excellent comprehensive electrochemical performance.
