γ-MnO2 nanotubes have been successfully synthesized by chemically depositing manganese hydroxide in anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) templates and thermally annealing at 500°C. The synthesized nanotubes have been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm analysis. The electrochemical capacitance behavior of the γ-MnO2 nanotubes electrode was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge studies in 1 mol/L Na2SO4 solution. The electrochemical data demonstrate that the γ-MnO2 nanotubes display good capacitive behavior with a high specific capacitance of 566 F/g at a current density of 100 mA/g and a good specific capacitance retention of ca. 90% after 1000 continuous charge-discharge cycles, indicating that the γ-MnO2 nanotubes can be promising electroactive materials for supercapacitor.
