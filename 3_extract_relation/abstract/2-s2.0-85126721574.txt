Day by day, energy storage systems have gained more and more great attraction owing to the growing needs of electrical power supply for moveable devices like mobile phones, electric vehicles and energy supply for fulfilling householdâ€™s equipment. Supercapacitors (SCs) or ultracapacitors are considered the most encouraging energy storage applications as a result of their matchless, superior characteristics than conventional electrochemical capacitors, as well as higher power density than batteries and their environment-friendly nature. Electrode materials have enlarged much care through these last years, due to their major impact on the supercapacitor storage performance. Therefore, great efforts are focusing on developing supercapacitors and intensive studies have been stated to fabricate materials for electrodes with large specific capacitance and smart behavior. In this chapter, we have attempted to cover an extensive range for tested electrode materials used for improving supercapacitor efficiency. Carbon-based materials, metal oxides, conducting polymers and their nanocomposites materials have been considered a focus point and have showed up in excellent pose for energy storage.
