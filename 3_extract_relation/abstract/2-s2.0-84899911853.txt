In the present investigation, we report the synthesis of ruthenium oxide (RuO2.nH2O) thin films by simple chemical bath deposition (CBD) method at low temperature on the stainless steel substrate. The prepared thin films are characterized for their structural and morphological properties by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The structural study revealed that the ruthenium oxide thin films are amorphous. Scanning electron microscopy study shows compact morphology with small overgrown particles on the surface of the substrate. FT-IR study confirms the formation of RuO2.nH 2O material. The supercapacitor behaviour of RuO2.nH 2O thin film was studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique in 0.5MH2SO4 electrolyte. RuO2.nH2O film showed maximum specific capacitance of 192 F.g-1 at a scan rate of 20 mV.s-1. The charge-discharge studies of RuO2.nH 2O carried out at 300 μA.cm-2 current density revealed the specific power of 1.5 kW.kg-1and specific energy of 41.6Wh.kg-1with 95% coulombic efficiency. ©Indian Academy of Sciences.
