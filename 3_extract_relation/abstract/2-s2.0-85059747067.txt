In order to improve the performance of metal oxides as the supercapacitor electrodes, incorporating transition metal oxides and carbon materials homogeneously in one hybrid has become an effective method. For the purpose of getting NiO/carbon composites, Ni-MOFs were annealed at different temperatures (200 °C, 300 °C, and 400 °C) with a ramp rate of 1 °C min −1 . As a result, NiO/graphite carbon nanocomposites were successfully obtained by one-step pyrolysis of Ni-MOFs at 300 °C in air. Large specific surface area and good conductivity made it exhibit excellent capacitance of 317 F g −1 at the current density of 1 A g −1 and excellent cycling stability.
