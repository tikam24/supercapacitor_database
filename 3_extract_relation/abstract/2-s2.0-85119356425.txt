Nickel cobalt sulfur is attracting more attention due to its great electrical conductivity and high specific capacitance for faraday pseudo-capacitors. Here, by evaporation-induced drying, heterostructure NiS2/NiCo2S4 nanosheets on self-supporting substrate of nitrogen-doped single-walled carbon nanotubes sponge (NSCS) are obtained with the sponge volume significantly being reduced. With the electrode film thickness being 80 μm, the as-prepared heterostructure NiS2/NiCo2S4/NSCS electrode shows outstanding areal/gravimetric/volumetric capacitance of 10.5 F cm−2/2905 F g−1/1307.2 F cm−3 at 1 A g−1. With the increase of current density from 1 to 60 A g−1, the current retention rate maintains at 61%. When the active material loading is increased to 14 mg cm−2, the gravimetric capacitance can still maintain at 1725 F g−1, indicating the high ratio performance. After 10,000 cycles, the capacity retention still remains 83% at current density of 10 A g−1. In addition, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) delivers have high gravimetric/volumetric energy density of 58.1 W h kg−1/52.3 W h L−1 with excellent cycle stability after 20,000 cycles. Therefore, the electrode material with high loading and high rate performance can be realized by this method.
