The supercapacitor has large potential on electric cars, the power supply of electromagnetism launch system as a new type storage energy element. In this work, it is intended to discuss the charge and electric field distributing models of two kinds of supercapacitors: the double layer of porous electrode and the hybrid supercapacitor that is composed of anodes of electrolytic capacitors, cathodes of electrochemical capacitors, and 38wt% H 2SO4 electrolyte solution. It explores the factors of thickness, pore distributing, and permittivity influenced on the electric field of supercapacitors by ANSYS and reveals the distributing charge of supercapacitors. On the basis of the discussion and analysis, the result shows that changing physical parameters, such as electrode structure and material, and the electric parameters can optimize the structures and performance of supercapacitors to improve the energy density and the power density, and increase the instantaneous discharge current.
