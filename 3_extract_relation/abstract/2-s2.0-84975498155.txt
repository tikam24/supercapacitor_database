Ni-Co alloys and oxides have attracted considerable attention in diverse fields, such as magnetic materials, energy storage and environmental/energy producing catalysts. Herein, the formation of magnetic Ni-Co alloys was induced by the water-gas shift reaction (WGSR) and the oxides were prepared by post-annealing and a CO oxidation reaction. The materials were characterized using a range of techniques. The annealed and post-CO oxidation Ni and Co-rich samples showed the crystal structures of NiCo 2 O 4 (Co 3 O 4 )/NiO and NiCo 2 O 4 /Co 3 O 4 , respectively. The Ni-Co oxides showed better supercapacitor performance than the corresponding Ni-Co alloys. The Co-rich samples exhibited better supercapacitor performance and CO oxidation activity than the Ni-rich sample. In addition, the Co-rich alloy showed a magnetization of 114 emu/g, which was approximately 2Ã— larger than that of the Ni-rich alloy. The WGS reaction and the wide application tests are useful for designing new materials applicable to a wide range of areas.
