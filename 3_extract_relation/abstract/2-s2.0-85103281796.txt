Complex of carbon nanotube sheets and DNA were prepared and twisted into a coiled fiber and used as a stretchable supercapacitor electrode. The results show that the supercapacitor electrode had good stability when stretching up to 50% strain and the maximum specific capacitance is 35F/g. The electrode also showed a good reversibility.
