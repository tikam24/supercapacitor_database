In this work, a one-step method synthesis of reduced graphene cotton yarn as a wearable supercapacitor was developed using γ-rays as a clean, cheap, and effective tool for graphene oxide reduction. Three different concentrations of cotton yarn were first immersed in graphene oxide (GO) solution followed by a reduction by 100 KGy of γ-ray. The analytical techniques such as Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-Ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were used to confirm the GO reduction and coating of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets on cotton yarns. It was found that the weight of deposited RGO on yarns was controlled by changing the yarn concentrations in GO solution during the irradiation process. The prepared yarn electrodes show an excellent electrochemical performance and stability. The specific capacitance of yarn electrodes was increased with an increase in deposited graphene sheets weight. The obtained maximum specific capacitance reached 97 F/g. Also, the charge transfer resistance (Rc) and series resistance (Rs) were decreased by an increase in yarn concentration in GO solution.
