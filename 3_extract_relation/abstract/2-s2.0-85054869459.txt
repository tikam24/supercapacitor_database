Binder-free Ti3C2 MXene/carbon nanotubes (Ti3C2/CNTs) films were successfully deposited onto graphite paper via electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method for supercapacitor electrodes. The as-prepared Ti3C2/CNTs electrode exhibits enhanced specific capacitance, approximately 1.5 times and 2.6 times of that of pristine Ti3C2 and CNTs films, respectively. Impressively, Ti3C2/CNTs electrodes demonstrate excellent cycling stability, without capacitance decay over 10,000 cycles. Incorporation of CNTs into MXene builds a robust structure, preventing MXene from restacking, and thus leading to the enhanced electrochemical performance. These results suggest that robust Ti3C2/CNTs films can be prepared by a simple yet effective EPD method, potentially applicable to other hybrid MXene systems.
