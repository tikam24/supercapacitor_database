NixCo2x(OH)6x, as a precursor of intensively studied NiCo2O4, has been directly deposited into self-standing titanium nitride nanotube array (TiN NTA) grid monolithic supports to form a coaxial nanostructured electrode for supercapacitors. With TiN NTA substrates providing a large surface area, fast electron transport, and enhanced structure stability, this NixCo2x(OH) 6x/TiN electrode exhibits superior pseudocapacitive performance with a high specific capacitance of 2543 F g-1 at 5 mV s-1, remarkable rate performance of 660 F g-1 even at 500 mV s -1, and promising cycle performance (about 6.25% capacitance loss for 5000 cycles). Interestingly, the NixCo2x(OH) 6x/TiN NTA electrode outperforms the NiCo2O 4/TiN NTA electrode, indicating that this self-standing Ni xCo2x(OH)6x/TiN NTA monolith is a promising candidate for high-performance supercapacitor applications.
