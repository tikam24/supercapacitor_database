A novel meosoporous tubular Co3O4 has been fabricated by a simple and cost-effective biomorphic synthesis route, which consists of infiltration of cotton fiber with cobalt nitrate solution and postcalcination at 673 K for 1 h. Its electrochemical performance as a supercapacitor electrode material is investigated by means of cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry tests. Compared with bulk Co3O4 prepared without using cotton template, biomorphic Co3O4 displays 2.8 fold enhancement of pseudocapacitive performance because of the unique tubular morphology, relative high specific surface area (3 and 0.8 m2/g for biomorphic Co3O4 and bulk Co3O4, respectively), and mesoporous nature.
