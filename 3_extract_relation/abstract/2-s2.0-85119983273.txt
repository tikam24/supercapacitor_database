The supercapacitor-assisted low-dropout (SCALDO) regulator is a novel extra-low frequency technique to design low noise, high-efficiency, and high current DC-DC converters. Given that, a low noise inherited low-dropout (LDO) regulator is coupled with a supercapacitor (SC) circulation front end, where the SC acts as a near-lossless series voltage dropper and the load sees a high-quality output of a linear regulator. During the SCALDO operation phases, the input of the LDO regulator sees a low-frequency sawtooth waveform with a DC offset. The encapsulation of the LDO regulator attenuates this switching ripple based on its power supply ripple rejection ratio (PSRR). This paper discusses the design parameters that have a direct impact on the low-frequency switching ripple considering a case of a 12-5 V discrete component-based SCALDO regulator with the aid of MATLAB SIMULINK simulation.
