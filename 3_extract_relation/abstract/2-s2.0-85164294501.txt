Natural wood has the potential to prepare self-supporting hierarchical porous carbon electrodes due to its well-ordered pore structure and sufficient mechanical strength. However, the fabrication of self-supporting carbon electrodes with high specific surface area and high electrical conductivity using simple and green strategies remains a challenge. Based on the unique structure and the rich-N/S elements of natural wood, a 3D self-supporting carbon electrode (KCW-5) was prepared by one-step thermochemical conversion with the environment-friendly activator (KHCO3). KCW-5 has a specific surface area of 921.8 m2 g−1 due to the hierarchical pore structure and the introduction of activators, the N and S elements are well retained with a N content of 1.21 % and a S content of 1.89 %. The KCW-5 exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, reaching a high specific capacitance of 240.1 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1, and the specific capacitance is retained at 129.89 F g−1 at a current density of 10 A g−1. A wood-based symmetry supercapacitor (W-SSC) is assembled using KCW-5 as the electrodes, which delivers an energy density of 8.143 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 50 W kg−1. After 10,000 long-term charge-discharge cycles at a current density of 5 A g−1, 92.04 % of the capacitance is still retained.
