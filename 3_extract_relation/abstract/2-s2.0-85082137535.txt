Thermal pore stability of activated carbon materials and float charging durability of Li-ion capacitors (LICs) using heated activated carbons were evaluated. Silicon-carbide-derived carbon (SiC-CDC) was prepared via a chlorination/steam activation process, and its properties were compared to commercial activated carbon. After heat-treating both samples at 1400Â°C, the surface area of SiC-CDC decreased by only 10%, whereas that of the commercial activated carbon declined by 20%. The heat-treated SiC-CDC exhibited excellent durability as an LIC positive electrode. These results provide insights into the effect of preparation methods on the thermal stability and durability of carbon-based electrodes as LIC positive electrode.
