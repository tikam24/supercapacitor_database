Herein we describe a low-cost method for fabricating high-performance flexible supercapacitors based on 10 nm-scale MnO2 nanoparticles as active electrode materials. The as-fabricated supercapacitor possesses an electrochemical capacitance as high as 645 F g-1 at a discharge current density of 0.5 A g-1, as well as good stability, retaining 95% of its initial capacitance after 2000 consecutive cycles, which ensures its potential for application in microelectromechanical systems, flexible electronics, microsenors and other microelectronics.
