This paper introduces new deep freezing attacks on capacitors and electronic circuits that use them. The new attacks leverage liquid nitrogen to rapidly freeze electrolytic capacitors and supercapacitors to temperatures approaching -195∘ C (-320∘ F or 77 K). Due to the quick freezing to the extremely low temperatures, overall capacitance of the capacitors rapidly drops towards zero. Change of the capacitance can affect reliability and security of electronic circuits that these capacitors are used to build, and this work in particular evaluates electronic filters, as well as capacitor-powered microcontrollers, and their response to the deep freezing attacks. This work presents disruptive attacks that affect the operation of the target device, but then return device to normal operation after short amount of time when the components warm up. In addition to the disruptive attacks, this work also demonstrates destructive attacks where the target device is damaged due to the extreme freezing. Both types of attacks leave no trace as the liquid nitrogen evaporates after the attack is finished. This paper highlights new threats that designers should be aware of and defend against.
