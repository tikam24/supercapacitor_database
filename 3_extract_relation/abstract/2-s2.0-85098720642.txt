We demonstrated a novel strategy to prepare nitrogen-doped interpenetrating porous carbon/graphene (NIPCG) networks based on interpenetrating poly(o-phenylenediamine)/N-doped graphene networks. The as-prepared NIPCG shows both high nitrogen content of 13.1 at.% and density of 1.13 g cm−3, and displays ultrahigh specific gravimetric and volumetric capacitances of 673 F g−1 and 760 F cm−3, respectively. Furthermore, the interpenetrating networks structure can afford rapid electron transport, and thus exhibiting excellent conductivity and good cycling stability. In addition, NIPCG assembled symmetric supercapacitor shows ultrahigh energy density of 27.6 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 600 W kg−1. Based on the above advantages, the present work holds a good potential to develop high performance energy storage and conversion devices.
