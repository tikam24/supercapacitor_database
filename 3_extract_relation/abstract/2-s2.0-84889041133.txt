A novel C–Ni–SiC composite using sawtooth-like SiC as support and carbon as modified material was prepared by hydrothermal synthesis and thermochemical pyrolysis. As a supercapacitor electrode, it exhibits very high specific capacitance (1780 F g−1) and excellent cycling performance (>96% for 2500 cycles). © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
