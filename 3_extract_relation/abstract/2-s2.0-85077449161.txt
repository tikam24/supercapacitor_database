In this paper, two types of filter capacitors of varying capacity were connected to the battery packs of a cascaded H-Bridge single-star multilevel vehicle traction inverter, and their influence on the battery losses has been analyzed. The battery and capacitor simulation models used are experimentally verified in a downscaled system. Different capacitor configurations were simulated for four-drive cycle scenarios to determine the potentials for the mitigation of current pulse stresses and battery loss reduction with respect to the added weight. By adding capacitors corresponding to a weight of 4% of the initial battery storage, the peak current is reduced by 5%-20%, depending on the operating point from dc to a few kilohertz, and the battery losses are reduced by 10%. In comparison, it is demonstrated that adding supercapacitors is more beneficial for lower output frequencies, while adding electrolytic capacitors is better for higher output frequencies. Furthermore, the low-order voltage harmonics of the dc-rails between the converter and battery were reduced by 10%-30% for frequencies above 9 kHz, which decreases the potential of electromagnetic disturbances. In addition, during cold battery temperatures, when it is very important to avoid heavy cyclings, the loss reduction using the capacitors was 2.5 times larger than for nominal temperature.
