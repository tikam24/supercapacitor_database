An effective technique to fabricate thin-film carbon nanotube (CNT)/manganese dioxide (MnO2) composite material is developed for electrochemical supercapacitor applications. Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charging-discharging experiments indicate that this composite material demonstrates far superior capacitive properties than prestine CNTs. The chemistry of this material is confirmed with XPS. Â©The Electrochemical Society.
