CoWO4 is predicted to be a very promising electrode material for supercapacitors. In this study, a novel flower-like morphology of CoWO4 fabricated by a hydrothermal method is presented for the first time. The prepared CoWO4 have been thoroughly characterized by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The special CoWO4 nanostructure exhibits noticeable specific capacitance of 156 Fg-1 at 0.5 Ag-1 and shows outstanding rate capability (85.2% capacitance retention at 10 Ag-1). The proposed feasible route is expected to be applied prospectively and widely in preparing CoWO4 pseudocapacitive material, which owns great application value in supercapacitors.
