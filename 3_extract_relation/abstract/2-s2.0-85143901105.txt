This paper examines a novel robust polynomial decentralized control scheme for islanded DC MicroGrids with saturation constraint. The investigated MicroGrid system consists of a Fuel Cell (FC), a battery and a SuperCapacitor (SC). Each source is controlled by employing a DC-DC converter. Using the Polynomial Control strategy, the main control objectives achieved are: 1) stabilizing the DC bus voltage at a certain desired value, 2) maintaining the power balance in the system, and 3) ensuring the robustness against parameters uncertainty. The proposed design conditions of the polynomial control is solved using the Sum Of Squares (SOS) approach taking into account the saturation constraint. The resulting control algorithms are simple, and do not need important computer resources, such to be easily implemented in micro-controllers for real-time application. Finally, simulations on MATLAB/Simulink are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control scheme. Results are compared to a model-based feedback linearization control technique.
