The integration of energy-harvesting and storage in a single device is considered to be one of the most demanding technologies for future wireless sensors. Photovoltaic supercapacitors are among promising solutions with the dual properties of photoelectric and electrochemical charge storage. In order to improve the efficiency in hybrid photovoltaic supercapacitors, most research has focused on studying electrode materials. In this work, we have studied the effect of polyaniline (PANI) concentration in a composite gel-based electrolyte on the impedance of the device. The photovoltaic supercapacitors were fabricated in a two-electrode configuration combining a titanium dioxide (TiO2) coated on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass as the working electrode, a multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) porous electrode as the counter electrode, and a composite gel-based electrolyte. The composite gel was made of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), hydrochloric acid (HCl), ammonium persulfate (APS), and different concentrations of aniline (ANI). The impedance study of the gel with 0.5 mM concentration of PANI showed a two-stage charge storage mechanism associated to the double-layer at the electrode-electrolyte interface and a pseudo-capacitive charge storage mechanism in the bulk of the electrolyte. The absorption spectrum of the synthesized gel shows a strong absorption peak near 780 nm confirming the formation of the emeraldine salt of PANI in the gel. The current results are inspiring the research for optimizing the composite material to improve both energy harvesting and the charge storage stability in photovoltaic supercapacitors.
