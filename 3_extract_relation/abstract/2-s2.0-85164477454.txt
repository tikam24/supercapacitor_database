Supercapacitors have proven themselves as a subject of interest over the years for energy storage. As a result, it is not surprising that significant effort has been put into supercapacitor research. However, a device with all desirable properties still needs to be developed, requiring special attention. A simple synthesis of porous magnesium niobium silver phosphate (Mg3Nb1−xAgx(PO4)3) nanocomposites is presented using a novel mixed solvent solution and a hydrothermal method. The MgNbAgPO4 anode with an interconnected porous structure not only offers a large number of active sites for divalent ion trapping but also improves charge transfer kinetics. As a result, the Mg3Nb1−xAgx(PO4)3 anode has a high specific capacity of 958 C g−1 using a binder-free electrode and better rate capability. The full-cell design is also built with Mg3Nb1−xAgx(PO4)3 and activated carbon (AC). The hierarchical pore structure and appropriate functional groups Mg3Nb1−xAgx(PO4)3 anode deliver a maximum energy density of 57 Wh kg−1, a high power density of 1200 kW kg−1, and anti-self-discharge solid behavior. The analysis of the charge storage mechanism suggests that Mg3Nb1−xAgx(PO4)3//AC supercapattery involves adsorption/desorption and Faradic reactions to store charge. This study opens the path for high-performance Mg3Nb1−xAgx(PO4)3 electrode and gives a better knowledge of charge storage.
