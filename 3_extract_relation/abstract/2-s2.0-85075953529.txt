Abstract: A hybrid system for short-term energy storage has been developed. It includes lithium-ion batteries for steady operation and supercapacitors for transient operation. The store may be used in systems with renewable energy sources, in electric vehicles, and in uninterruptible or backup power supply systems for consumers drawing large currents. It may also be used for energy recuperation.
