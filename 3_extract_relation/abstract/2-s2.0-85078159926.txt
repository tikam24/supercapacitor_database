Recent development of manganese-lithium borate glasses for applications as supercapacitor was reported. The glasses were prepared by melt-quench technique and characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Uv–visible spectroscopy (UV-VIS). The paramagnetism of synthesized glasses was observed at room temperature measured by vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM). The electrochemical properties were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The specific capacitance of 0.2MnO2-0.8(Li2O-xB2O3) glasses were increase from 144 F g−1 to 196 F g−1 for x = 1 to x = 3 (mol%) with scanning rate of 5 mV s−1. However, the specific capacitance was decrease when x = 4. To understand the structure-function of these glasses, the x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was also used to study a local structure and oxidation state of Mn content in these glasses. Mixing of Mn2+/Mn3+ oxidation state was exhibited with the mean Mn–O bonding distance of approximately 2.0495 Å.
