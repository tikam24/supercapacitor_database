Polypyrrol was prepared by electrochemical polymerization. Polypyrrol morphology has been investigated by FE-SEM and it shows a polypyrrol nanofibre network. By doping PPy nanofibers with different MW-CNT proportions (10%, 20%, 30%, 40% vol.ratio), nanocomposites were obtained. When adding MW-CNT with PPy, the nanotubes particles on the nanofibre network gradually grew in proportion to added ratio, and hence a clear change in the nanocomposite structure was observed. The electrochemical measurements indicate that the nanocomposites demonstrate strongly pseudocapacitive activity. The capacitance of pure PPy was (19.23 Fg-1), while the maximum value of capacitance (153 Fg-1) was observed when 30% MW-CNT was doped with pure PPy.
