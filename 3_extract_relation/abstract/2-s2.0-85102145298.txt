In this report, we have forwarded an idea to turn waste into wealth, herein, we have synthesized metallic nickel nanoparticles decorated carbon fibers (Ni-NPs/CFs) derived from discarded ostrich eggshell membrane (OESMs) via a simple and cost-effective process. As-fabricated Ni-NPs/ CFs composite was characterized via field-emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques. The morphology of Ni-NPs/CFs clearly revealed the successful deposition of metallic nickel nanoparticles on the surface of CFs. As-fabricated Ni-NPs/CFs composite was employed as electrode materials for supercapacitors. The specific capacitance of Ni-NPs/CFs composite was calculated and found to be 191.55 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, which is higher than pure CFs (13.8 F g−1). Furthermore, as-fabricated Ni-NPs/CFs composite retained 88.39% of the original capacitance after 1000 cycles. The obtained Ni-NPs/CFs composite seems to be a potential electrode materials for supercapacitors.
