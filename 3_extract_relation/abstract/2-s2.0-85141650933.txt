To improve the supercapacitive performance of MXene, and to prevent MXene oxidation in the preparation process, an MXene/nano-sized carbide-derived carbon (MXene/CDC) has been developed using the vacuum freeze-drying technology. The introduction of the nano-sized CDC, with an abundance of porous structures, prevents the agglomeration of MXene layers while constructing a 3D gel-like structure with fast ion transport channels. Benefiting from the gel-like hierarchical porous structure, the surface functional groups on MXene are fully activated, which significantly increase the pseudocapacitance of the MXene/CDC composite. Therefore, the MXene/CDC composite exhibits excellent supercapacitive performance. The specific capacitance of the MXene/CDC composite is as high as 367 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in an acidic electrolyte. This capacitance is retained at about 99% after 6000 cycles. Hence, MXene/CDC composites have the potential to be used in the field of energy storage. Graphical Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
