ZrO 2 -WO 3 mixed oxide nanotubes were synthesized by a simple electrochemical anodization route. The oxide nanotubes contained a mixture of metastable hexagonal WO 3 and monoclinic (and orthorhombic) ZrO 2 phases, as well as a mixed-oxide ZrW 2 O 8 phase that showed a metastable tetragonal symmetry. Evaluation of photo-activity of the materials showed generation of photo-potentials of -85 mV and -230 mV in the as-anodized and annealed conditions. Because of the mismatch in the band edge positions of the WO 3 and ZrO 2 phases and the resultant relaxation of photo-generated charge carriers, no significant photo-current density could be observed. The arrays of oxide nanotubes are considered for electrochemical capacitor application because of their morphology-assisted fast charge/discharge kinetics and large surface area. Presence of a large concentration of charge defects (on the order of 10 21 cm -3 ) and the reported high proton conductivity of the ZrO 2 -WO 3 mixed oxide rendered high capacitance, which decreased with an increase in the scan rate of cyclic voltammetry. The highest measured capacitance was 40.03 mF/cm 2 at a scan rate of 10 mV/s and the lowest was 1.93 mF/cm 2 at 1 V/s in 1 M sulfuric acid solution. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
