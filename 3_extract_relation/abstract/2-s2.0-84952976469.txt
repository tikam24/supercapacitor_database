The electrochemical, structural and photoelectrochemical properties of blend of a low-viscosity IL 1-ethyl 3-methyl imidazolium dicynamide (EMIM DCA, viscosity 17 cP) in poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene) (PVdF-HFP) are presented in detail. The blending of low-viscous IL provides charge carriers with higher mobility which are significantly observed in ionic conductivity measurement. The incorporation of IL provides more amorphous region within polymer matrix which is known as a beneficial condition for conductivity enhancement and are affirmed by our DSC and XRD measurements. The fabricated supercapacitor with configuration MWCNT/PVdF-HFP +IL/MWCN shows promising results.
