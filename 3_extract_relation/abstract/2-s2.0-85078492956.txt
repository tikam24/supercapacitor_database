This work reveals a green combustion route for the synthesis of TiO2, Fe2O3 and TiO2-Fe2O3 nanocomposites as photocatalysts for decolorization of Titan Yellow (TY) and Methyl Orange (MO) dyes at room temperature in aqueous solution concentration of 20 ppm under UV-light irradiation. We observed that the TiO2-Fe2O3 nanocomposite shows superior photocatalytic activity for TY dye compared to pure TiO2 and Fe2O3. Rate constant (k) values of TiO2, Fe2O3 and TiO2–Fe2O3 for TY and MO are 0.0194, 0.0159, 0.04396 and 0.00931, 0.00772 0.0119 kmin−1 respectively. The surface area and pore volume of TiO2-Fe2O3 nanocomposite were found to be 71.56 m2/g and 0.076 cm3/g, respectively as revealed by BET studies. From the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) plot, the mean pore diameter of TiO2-Fe2O3 nanoparticles was found to be 2.43 nm. Further, the TiO2-Fe2O3 nanocomposite showed good electrochemical behavior as an electrode material for supercapacitors when compared to pure TiO2 and Fe2O3 nanoparticles resulted in stable electrochemical performance with nearly 100% coulombic efficiency at a scan rate of 10 mV/s for 1000 cycles. Interestingly, the novelty of this work is that the designed supercapacitors showed stable electrochemical performance even at 1000th cycle, which might be useful for rechargeable supercapacitor applications. The electrochemical properties of the nanocomposites were compared by the data obtained by cyclic voltammograms, charge-discharge tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic studies. These results demonstrated that the TiO2-Fe2O3 nanocomposite showed stable performance compared to TiO2 and Fe2O3 nanoparticles at current density of 5 Ag−1.
