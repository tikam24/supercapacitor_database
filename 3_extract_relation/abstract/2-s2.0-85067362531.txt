This proceeding is the second part of a previous work, which provides readers with an overview of our multidisciplinary approach to technical textile research. It reviews the recent results of the project aiming at developing super-capacitor fabric structures. The fundamental idea of the project is based on, production of graphene nano-sheets and their application onto fabrics, growing the oxides of manganese on graphene coating and utilization of the final fabric within a suitable electrolyte as electrode material. After sample fabric weaving and battery cell preparation are briefly introduced, cyclic voltammetry and electro-impedance spectroscopy characterization of the fabricated samples are summariazed. Simple test circuit design for the measurements, basic micro-controller firmware development as well as data quality monitoring software application for visualization purposes are also introduced. Finally, the measurement results with over 800 F/g capacitance for graphite are presented.
