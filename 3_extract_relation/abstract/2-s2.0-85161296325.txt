During the last decade, the interest in developing sustainable solutions such as renewable energy sources (RES), distributed electricity generation, energy storage systems, and electric vehicles (EVs) has been increased significantly. Multiport power converters are required in these applications for the interconnection of multiple energy production and storage units with the electric grid. A new non-isolated multiport converter (MPC) is presented in this paper which is capable to manage the power flows of four different DC sources (i.e. photovoltaic array, supercapacitor array, EV battery, and battery bank) and interconnect them with an AC load or the electric grid. Compared to the conventional MPC structures, the proposed MPC inverter consists of fewer power switching and passive components, providing an MPC architecture of lower complexity and cost. A laboratory prototype of the proposed MPC inverter was developed and its correct operation has been experimentally verified under various operating conditions.
