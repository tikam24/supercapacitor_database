Endowing supercapacitors with higher energy density is of great practical significance but remains extremely challenging. In this work, an innovative densified 3D printing enabled by a surface-adaptive capillarity strategy is proposed for the first time. The printable ink formulated with pyrrole surface-modified reduced graphene oxide renders the printed electrodes excellent surface tension regulability to the subsequent capillary densification, creating an intensely condensed electrode with well-maintained structural integrity. Furthermore, simultaneous in situ nitrogen doping and hierarchical microâ€“meso porosity are readily realized upon post-carbonization, encouraging enhanced capacitance and fast reaction dynamics. As a result, the printed symmetric supercapacitor delivers a double leap in areal and volumetric energy densities in both aqueous and organic electrolytes, a rarely achieved yet gravely desired attribute for 3D printed energy storage devices.
