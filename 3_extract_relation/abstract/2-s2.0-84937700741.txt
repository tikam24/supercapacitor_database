High-performance supercapacitor electrodes with a core-shell heterostructure of carbon-fabric/NiCo 2 S 4 /Ni(OH) 2 are rationally designed. The NiCo 2 S 4 nanotube core synthesized by two step hydrothermal methods has a diameter of about 120 nm and a thickness of about 25 nm. The Ni(OH) 2 shell prepared by electrochemical deposition method is made up by the small Ni(OH) 2 ultrathin sheets. With this design and method, high specific capacitance of 2700 F/g at a current density of 1 mA/cm 2 is found from NiCo 2 S 4 /Ni(OH) 2 heterostructured arrays. These samples show energy density of 120 Wh/kg and power density of 0.4 kW/kg at a current density of 1 mA/cm 2 , and good cycle stability with 78% capacitance retention after 2000 circles.
