This paper discusses capacitance performance of flip chip double stacked micro supercapacitor structure with interwoven electrodes. The supercapacitor has stacked structure with alternating electrodes arranged vertically and laterally to one another to optimize its charging capacity. Capacitance improvements of the double stacked design are evaluated as opposed to the planar design and size reduction between the two designs are compared. The supercapacitor was fabricated by initially electroplating nickel interdigital structures onto SiO2 pre-deposited silicon substrate. The interdigital structures were then coated with polypyrrole (Ppy) before gaps between the fingers were filled with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as electrolyte, and a matching mirror-imaged supercapacitor structure were flipped on top of the initial structure, creating a fully encapsulated flip-chip supercapacitor. The double stacked supercapacitor design was simulated and analyzed for capacitance performance using CoventorWare ver.2008. A 20 finger pair double stacked supercapacitor cell has charging capacity of 15.5 pC, compared to 6.77 pC capacity of a planar supercapacitor of the same size. The improved capacitance performance is due to additional charging between top and bottom sets of electrodes. Thickness only slightly increases for the double stacked structure, with double stacked and planar structures are approximately 2 mm and 1 mm thick respectively. The improved capacitance performance and compact packaging of the double stacked design enables it to be utilized in more energy demanding biomedical applications.
