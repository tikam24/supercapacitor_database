It was still a worldwide challenge to improve capacity, cycling stability and rate performance in consideration of the intrinsic properties and structure of material. Compared with other nanostructure, nanowire have demonstrated better electrochemical performance in regard of electrochemical energy storage devices such as Li-ion battery, Li-air battery and supercapacitor, since it has unique anisotropy, large specific surface area, facile strain relaxation, fast axial electron transport and radial ion diffusion. Moreover, nanowire have shown the advantages in facile assembly and in-situ characterization of electrochemical energy storage devices. Based on the latest progress in nanowire materials, we mainly summarize the design, assembly and characterization of single nanowire electrochemical energy storage device and the optimization strategy of nanowire materials. In this article, we review the strategy in improving the electrochemical performance of one-dimensional structure. This article lays a foundation for the development and applications of nanowire materials in electrochemical energy storage field.
