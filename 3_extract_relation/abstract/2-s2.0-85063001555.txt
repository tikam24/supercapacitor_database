Herein, a 3D composite electrode supported by g-C3N4 nanowire framework as scaffold and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS) as conducting polymer is reported for flexible solid-state electrochemical capacitors. Compared to pure PEDOT: PSS, the composite electrodes have a greatly increased specific surface and showed good electrochemical performance. A specific capacitance of 202 F gâˆ’1 is achieved, and 83.5% of initial capacitance maintained after 5000 cycles. The device based on the 3D g-C3N4/PEDOT: PSS electrode also exhibits good performance in capacitance, flexibility, and cycling stability.
