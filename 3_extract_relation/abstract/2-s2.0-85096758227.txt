The development of electronic devices with low power is increasingly being used in various fields of technology including energy storage. The energy storage system is a significant thing in a diverse range of industrial applications. As an emerging technology of energy storage, the ultracapacitor is a low power electronic device with high capacitance and durability than others. In this journal, the ultracapacitor becomes the main object of energy storage. Estimating the value of the SOC based on the classical equivalent circuit with the self-discharging load to monitor the percentage value when charge and discharge the ultracapacitor. The estimation state of charge of ultracapacitor using extended Kalman filter as one of the best methods in estimating. As a result, the response of the method compared with experimental data and has no big different value.
