Graphene is already known as a material with the capability of conducting electrical, thermal, lightweight, and robust traits. Graphene has shown promising use in electronic industries in that its thermal and conductivity abilities make it a suitable candidate for interconnections in electronic circuits as well as being part of the circuits themselves. The potential of graphene to be used in various types of sensors makes it more interesting than the conventional sensors because this one-atom-thick sheet of carbon can sense the smallest signal. The potential for graphene nanocomposite-filled polymers for stretchable conductive ink (SCI) has raised attention and interest in its potential in many industries. Graphene also is capable to effectively convert light into energy, which generates more electrons for each photon of light energy it receives. Graphene can be used in lithium ion (Li-ion) batteries by combination of tin (Sn) and the graphene nanocomposite. Graphene has gained a lot of interest in supercapacitor applications. Graphene can associate fully accessible high specific surface area (SSA) with high conductivity to be able to shield the electromagnetic induction (EMI) waves during transportation, and graphene materials are also widely used in electrostatic discharge (ESD) and shielding. It can increase the durability of the electronic devices, and the cost is very low.
