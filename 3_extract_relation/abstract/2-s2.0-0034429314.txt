Transient voltage/current pulses can not be stored into normal DC batteries. This work reviews possibility of storing these surges using supercapacitor. Laser induced plasma may be caused by firing laser pulses into the clouds charge clusters. The charge pulses flow down along the laser induced air wire (LIAW) and passes through a supercapacitor to charge it. Objective of this study is to test the possibility of storing these charges using supercapacitors. Energy storage in solid state electrochemical capacitors (supercapacitors) or ultra supercapacitors occurs through reversible oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions. Contribution of double layer is less significant, however, a major percentage of total energy stored is attributed to reversible surface redox reactions. Different types of supercapacitors have been analyzed regarding their charge and discharge performance under repetitively charging pulses. Our initial analysis based on existing mathematical techniques, shows that a real superconductor may charge under transient conditions at a much higher rate but subsequent considerations based on mathematical analysis and available data on supercapacitors technology, lead us to new recommendations to improve the design of supercapacitor to perform as an ultrasupercapacitors.
