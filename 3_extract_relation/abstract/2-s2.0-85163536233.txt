The voltage level of a power system can be impacted by the sporadic nature of renewable energy sources and fluctuating load requirements. A hybrid energy storage system (HESS) may be used to combat this problem, but maintaining the HESS's state of charge (SoC) could be challenging. The conventional method of assigning power to the HESS is to use a high pass or low pass filter. The proposed standalone microgrid includes a solar photovoltaic (SPV) generation system, a battery energy storage system (ESS), a supercapacitor, and a load. A model predictive control is used to mitigate the deviations in the DC link voltage. This proposed method is more effective than the conventional filter-based control. The system is simulated in MATLAB Simulink.
