The increasing interest in portable and consumable electronics demands efficient and low-cost energy storage devices with excellent energy storing capacity. From this point, a high mass loading of the active electrode material on three-dimensional current collectors is favorable for obtaining a higher energy storing capacity for the corresponding device. The present study demonstrates an ideal example of high-performance aqueous asymmetric supercapacitors (SCs) using α-MnO 2 nanowires as the positive electrode and h-WO 3 nanorods as the negative electrode, respectively. Initially, one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures composed of α-MnO 2 and h-WO 3 are prepared on carbon cloth by a conventional hydrothermal method. The prepared α-MnO 2 and h-WO 3 with a high mass loading of 4.9 mg/cm 2 and 5.8 mg/cm 2 , respectively, show excellent electrochemical features in aqueous Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte in the positive and negative potential regions. A high-performance asymmetric SC is developed with uniquely engineered electrodes, which exhibits the excellent electrochemical performance in an extended potential window of 1.4 V and with excellent cycling stability of ∼135% after 7500 cycles with a volumetric capacitance of 350 mF/cm 3 and energy density of 0.095 mWh/cm 3 . This authentic scheme may offer new opportunities for developing asymmetric arrangements for energy storage devices in various portable electronic systems with a high mass loading.
