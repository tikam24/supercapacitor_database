In this work, we report the synthesis of FeCo2O4 nanostructure electro-active material through a double-hydroxide medium via a facile hydrothermal method. The obtained product was subjected to structural and morphological studies. Morphological images of FeCo2O4 material revealed rod-like structures. Electrochemical properties of the modified electrode were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, charge–discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques. The modified FeCo2O4 electrode delivered the highest specific capacitance of 393.5 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 in 2 M KOH aqueous electrolyte with battery-type faradaic behavior and excellent capacitive properties. Furthermore, the long cycling stability of the electrode was tested up to 1000 cycles under a constant current density of 2 A g−1. The novel synthetic route of FeCo2O4 preparation is a convenient potential means of obtaining secondary energy material for supercapacitor applications.
