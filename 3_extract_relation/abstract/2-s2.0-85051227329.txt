Herein, we report the synthesis of a hybrid nanocomposite containing one dimensional (1D) TiO2 nanotube supported over a two dimensional (2D) network of conducting graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets by a facile hydrothermal strategy. Symmetric supercapacitors based on the hybrid composite electrodes were fabricated and their electrochemical energy storage performances were evaluated and the results were compared with individual component based supercapacitors. The symmetric supercapacitor based on the composite with 1:4 weight ratios of TiO2 and g-C3N4 exhibited a remarkable increase in the specific capacitance in comparison with the individual components. The improvement in electrochemical behavior of the composite sample was attributed to the increase in surface area of the composite due to the spacer effect of titania nanotubes in the 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets.
