A new type of ordered mesoporous carbon/polyaniline (OMCx/PANI) composite with a hexagonally ordered mesostructure was prepared by a two-step nanocasting method using SBA-15 as a template. This method could protect the pore structure of OMCx from being blocked by PANI, and the in situ polymerization of aniline inside the pore structure between OMCx and SBA-15 could avoid the phase separation of OMCx and PANI. Pore-structure analysis showed that PANI was well coated over the surface of the OMCx's nanorod. Sample OMC8/PANI possessed high capacitance and excellent cycle performance. Although the capacitance value in this experiment was not among the highest, the new perspective to assemble nano-materials is very meaningful. This journal is
