The electrodeposited cobalt oxide grown on MXene/N, S-rGO surface was successfully synthesised via chronoamperometry technique at-1.2 V. The effect of MXene/N, S-rGO surface and electrodeposition time of cobalt oxide on the electrocapacitive behaviour was investigated. SEM-EDS evidenance confirmed that the highly dense growth of flake-like structure of cobalt oxide with interconnected pores was obtained on MXene/N, S-rGO surface. The synergistic effect of cobalt oxide grown on MXene/N, S-rGO surface can enhance the electrochemical properties with the highest specific capacitance of 608.3 F/g at 1 A/g (628.8 F/g at 10 mV/sec) with 35.7 Wh/kg and 180.6 kW/kg.
