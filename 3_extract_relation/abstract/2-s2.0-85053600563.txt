Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with high porosity could act as an ideal substitute for supercapacitors, but their poor electrical conductivities limit their electrochemical performances. In order to overcome this problem, conductive polypyrrole (PPy) has been introduced and a novel nanocomposite resulting from polyoxometalate (POM)-based MOFs (NENU-5) and PPy has been reported. It comprises the merits of POMs, MOFs, and PPy. Finally, the highly conductive PPy covering the surfaces of NENU-5 nanocrystallines can effectively improve the electron/ion transfer among NENU-5 nanocrystallines. The optimized NENU-5/PPy nanocomposite (the volume of Py is 0.15 mL) exhibits high specific capacitance (5147 mF·cm-2), larger than that of pristine NENU-5 (432 mF·cm-2). Furthermore, a symmetric supercapacitor device based on a NENU-5/PPy-0.15 nanocomposite possesses an excellent areal capacitance of 1879 mF·cm-2, which is far above other MOF-based supercapacitors.
