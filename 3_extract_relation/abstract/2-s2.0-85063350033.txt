Hierarchically porous holey graphene/PANI/graphene nanohybrid is fabricated by adopting a facile two-step process in which PANI/graphene hybrid was first synthesized hydrothermally and then wrapped with a layer of holey graphene. The resulted sandwich-like structure cannot only promote electronic transmission and ionic diffusion, but also contribute to a prominent rate capability. A symmetric supercapacitor was assembled with the obtained holey graphene/PANI/graphene nanohybrid, exhibiting a maximum specific capacitance of 437 F·g-1 at 1 A·g-1, an energy density of 55 Wh·kg-1 at 900 W·kg-1, an ultrahigh-rate performance (retained 43% capacitance at 100 A·g-1), as well as a long-term life (84% retention after 5000 loops at 10 A·g-1). The present work may provide an insight for designing high-performance symmetric supercapacitor.
