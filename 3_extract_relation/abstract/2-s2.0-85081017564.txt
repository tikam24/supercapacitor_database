We proposed the synthesis of MoP/MoO2/carbon nanotube (MoP/MoO2/CNT) through a simple and ultrafast microwave strategy. After phosphating, the conductivity and electrochemical activity of the nanocomposites were significantly increased, and charge storage was accelerated. The MoP/MoO2/CNT electrode was a novel supercapacitor electrode material with a specific capacitance of up to 447.6 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, maintaining a stable cycle life at 86.5% of the initial capacitance after 10,000 cycles. Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) with MoP/MoO2/CNT and AC (activated carbon) are a positive electrode and negative electrode, respectively, with an energy density of 31.6 Wh kg−1 and a power density of 190 W kg−1. The MoP/MoO2/CNT nanocomposite was a potential electrode material for future applications due to its outstanding properties, especially in the field of industrial convenient and rapid synthesis of electrode materials.
