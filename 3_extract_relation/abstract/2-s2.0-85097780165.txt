Non-graphitic carbon is a potential supercapacitor electrode material attributed to the combination of dense porous structure and high surface area. However, production cost limits its high usage. Herein, inexpensive and sustainable flavonoids rich precursor Citrus sinensis is utilized for synthesis of non-graphitic carbon and is characterised using XRD, Raman, XPS & BET. For controlled porosity, KOH activation at two different temperatures (750 °C & 900 °C) is carried out that result in controlled meso/macro porous carbon with 900 °C activation (AC-900). The edges of pores with dangling oxygen functionalities (37 %) contributes to pseudocapacitive charge (385.91 F g−1) whereas meso/macro pore size distribution facilitates fast diffusion (0.78 (Formula presented.) 10−9 cm2 s−1) in symmetric cell (AC-900||AC-900). Furthermore, an impressively high energy density (51.1 Wh kg−1 @ 0.75 A g−1) is obtained owing to this blend of controlled porous structure and oxygen functionalities. In future, this study will pave a path for designing of low cost non-graphitic controlled porous structure carbon.
