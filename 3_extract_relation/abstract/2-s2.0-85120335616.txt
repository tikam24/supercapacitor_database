Perovskite transition metal oxides are promising materials for supercapacitor electrodes due to their high theoretical capacities. However, these materials still suffer from poor conductivity, low specific capacitance, and moderate cycle stability, restraining their practical applications. In this study, LaMnO3@CC-PPy materials were prepared by two-step electrodeposition based on the inspiring design of coaxial cables. To this end, electrochemically active LaMnO3 was first grown on carbon cloth (CC) with good flexibility and conductivity and then followed by further coating with polypyrrole (PPy) layer. The best PPy load was identified by adjusting the deposition time. The resulting LaMnO3@CC-PPy electrodes showed excellent specific capacitance reaching 862F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with retention rate of 75% at high current density of 10 A g−1, indicative of excellent rate performance. The cycle stability of the electrodes also improved after 3000 cycles at 10 A g−1 with a retention rate reaching 66%. To assemble asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) devices, NiCo2O4@CC cathodes were prepared by electrodeposition. Ultra-high energy density of about 73 Wh kg−1 and good cycle stability were recorded with the devices. The high performance of the as-obtained materials was attributed to the existence of internal and external double electric channels, as well as the abundant internal space. These features ensured good conductivity, rapid charge transfer, and fast ion diffusion, thereby significantly improving the overall material cycle stability. In sum, these findings look promising for future preparation of high-performance perovskite supercapacitors.
