A novel conducting polymer polyaniline has been studied extensively due to the commercial availability of the monomer, easy synthesis, well-behaved electrochemistry, good environmental stability, high conductivity and multiple redox and protonation states. In the present work, the nucleation and growth mechanism for the oxidative polymerization of aniline with ammonium persulphate (APS) as oxidant and electro polymerization of aniline in aqueous medium containing 0.5 M H2SO4 was investigated. The synthesized polyaniline thin films were characterized by various physico-chemical techniques such as XRD, optical absorption, FT-IR spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry for their structural, optical and electrochemical properties. FT-IR study confirms the polymerization of aniline. SEM study explains the growth of thin films and suggests that electrochemical polymerization is best for synthesis of fibrous polyaniline thin films. The aim of this paper is to study the effect of synthesis method on polyaniline thin films which can be useful to understand the electrochemical properties and to propose its future utility in energy storage devices such as supercapacitors.
