The development of nickel cobalt sulfides electrodes with excellent electrochemical performance is important for supercapacitor applications. In this study, we constructed well-defined hierarchical nanosheet-built NiCo2S4/Co9S8 hollow nanospheres based on morphology and structural engineering. A combination of structural and compositional advantages endowed NiCo2S4/Co9S8 hollow nanospheres with enhanced electrochemical performance with favorable capacitance of 1008 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, exceeding that of single-component NiS (616 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and Co3S4 (430 F g−1 at 1 A g−1). Furthermore, an assembled asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) comprising NiCo2S4/Co9S8 hollow nanospheres and activated carbon achieved a high energy density up to 36.7 Wh kg−1 at 800 W kg−1, suggesting that it could be a promising electroactive material for energy storage devices.
