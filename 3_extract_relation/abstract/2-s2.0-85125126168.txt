Fine-tuning the interlayer space and composition of the layered double hydroxide (LDH) is a promising strategy to obtain high-performance battery-type electrode materials for super-capacitor battery. In this work, a series of two-dimensional (2D) porous hetero-trimetallic Zinc-Nickel-Cobalt LDHs sheets intercalated with nitrate anion and different Zn/Ni ratios (ZnxNi1-xCo-LDH-NO3–, x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0) are firstly synthesized through a Zeolitic imidazolate framework-L (ZIF-L)-assisted co-precipitation reaction and ion etching procedure. Among which, the Zn0.25Ni0.75Co-LDH-NO3– electrode, with a Zn/Ni ratio of 1:3, provides a high specific capacity (275 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1). To further tune the interlayer space, Zn0.25Ni0.75Co-LDH-BA–/AA– (BA– = benzoate anion and AA– = acetate anion) sheets intercalated with BA– or AA– are synthesized by an anion-exchange method. A super-capacitor battery device (Zn0.25Ni0.75Co-LDH-BA–//activated carbon) using Zn0.25Ni0.75Co-LDH-BA– as the positive electrode can achieve a high energy density (51.8 Wh kg−1 at 789 W kg−1) and superb durability (94.6% over 10,000 cycles). This work can shed light on regulating the interlayer space of LDHs for advanced electrochemical energy storage applications.
