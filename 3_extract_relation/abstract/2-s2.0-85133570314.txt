Invited for this month's cover picture is the work of a collaboration group led by Professor Tae Jung Park, Dept. of Chemistry, Chung-Ang University, Republic of Korea. The work depicted in the cover picture is a high-performance aqueous hybrid supercapacitor based on all redox-active 2D MXenes and 0D phosphomolybdic acid nanocluster-anchored polypyrrole nanotubes. The resulting device showed a specific energy of 36.1 Wh kg−1 and a specific power of 6.66 kW kg−1, with good stability over 5000 charge-discharge cycles.
