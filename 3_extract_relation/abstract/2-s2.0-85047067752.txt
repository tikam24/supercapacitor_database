Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) hold promising potential in energy storage but are limited by poor conductivity. In this work, a metal-organic framework/polypyrrole hybrid is constructed by a facile one-pot electrodeposition method in the presence of dopamine. An all-solid-state fabric supercapacitor based on this hybrid demonstrates excellent electrochemical energy-storage performance, which achieves a specific capacitance of 10 mF cm-1 (206 mF cm-2), a power density of 132 μW cm-1 (2102 μW cm-2), and an energy density of 0.8 μWh cm-1 (12.8 μWh cm-2). The stable cycling life and excellent mechanical flexibility over a wide range of working temperature are also achieved, which maintains a capacitance retention of 89% over 10 000 charging/discharging cycles, a capacitance decrease of only 4% after 1000 frizzy (360° bending) cycles, and no obvious capacitance loss under 100 repeated heating (100 °C)/cooling (-15 °C) cycles. This fibrous supercapacitor displays promising potential in wearable textile electronics as it can be easily woven into common cotton cloth. Our strategy may shed some valuable light on the construction of MOF-based hybrids for flexible energy-storage electronics.
