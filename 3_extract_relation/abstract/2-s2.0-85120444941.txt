The passive video surveillance system is designed in this paper. At first, it captures images through the camera sensor and displays the image in the client program without battery and complicated wiring. This system consists of three modules: energy harvesting, data transmission, and data processing. Firstly, the system transmits UHF radio frequency signals to the environment through a signal transmitter, then the system converts the received radio frequency signal into an electrical signal and stores it in a on-board supercapacitor to supply power to each device in the system. The system dispatches the image capture task through a low-power microprocessor, and transmits the data to the host under the same local network through a Wi-Fi module.
