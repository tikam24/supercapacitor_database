NiCo2O4 is one of the well-known pseudocapacitive material with higher specific capacitance. In this work, carbon nanotubes (CNT) integrated carbon fibers (CF) are used as the flexible substrate for the growth of NiCo2O4 nanoneedle arrays by an in-situ hydrothermal approach to obtain NiCo2O4/CC flexible electrode for supercapacitors application. The NiCo2O4 nanoneedles with diameters of 40–50 nm were formed on the hydroxyl-functionalized CC. This hybrid electrode NiCo2O4/CC not only exhibits a high specific capacitance of 249.69 F g−1, but also shows a favourable cycling stability of 63.3% retention after 1000 cycles at high mass loading. In addition, the proposed method provides a simple and effective strategy for preparing flexible electrode materials for supercapacitor and enables the perfect combination of pseudocapacitance and double layer capacitance.
