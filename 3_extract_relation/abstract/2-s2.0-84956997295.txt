Pseudocapacitive materials are highly capable to achieve high energy density integrated with high power electrostatic capacitive materials. However, finding a suitable electrostatic capacitive material to integrate with pseudocapacitive material in order to achieve high energy density with good rate capability is still a challenge. Herein, we are providing a novel synthetic approach starting from the synthesis of polypyrrole nanotubes (PPy-NTs) and ending up at the carbonization of PPy-NTs to obtain N-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs). With highly porous nature of PPy-NTs and great graphitic texture with copious heteroatom functionalities, N-CNTs significantly promoted the faradic pseudo-capacitors, demonstrating high single-electrode capacitance over 332 F/g(PPy-NTs) and 228 F/g(N-CNTs) in 1 M H2SO4 aqueous solution. Further, a novel asymmetric supercapacitor with PPy-NTs as positive and N-CNTs as negative electrode has been fabricated. This PPy-NTs//N-CNTs cell effectively provides high operation voltage (1.4 V) and hence high energy density over 28.95 W h/kg (0.41 mW h/cm3) with a high power density of 7.75 kW/kg (113 mW/cm3) and cyclic stability of 89.98% after 2000 cycles.
