Nowadays, imminent deficiency of primary energy sources and environmental issues have been raised, so huge exploration of the environment and natural resources can be improved by green and sustainable power sources. Especially, supercapacitors are developing as one of the renewable energy sources attributable to their desirable properties. In this research article, ternary CoO-NiO-Er2O3 (CNEO) were synthesized using co-precipitation method and are characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and electrochemical characterization by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatic charge- discharge (GCD) method. The devices how maximum specific capacitance of 232.39F g-1, making them good candidates for future energy storage.
