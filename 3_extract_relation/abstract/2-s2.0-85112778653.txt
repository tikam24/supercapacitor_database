Supercapacitors are emerging as adaptive and competitive devices for flexible and portable electronics. The flexible electronics require flexible supercapacitors to store the energy. In this connection, two-dimensional layered materials with permeable channels with excellent conductive properties are of great interest. This work gives a brief overview of synthesis, characterization and supercapacitor electrode performances of VS2nanosheets. VS2nanosheets were synthesized using hydrothermal reaction and characterized by microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. As synthesized VS2nanosheets show hexagonal layered structure with nanosheets morphology. The supercapacitor electrode performances were studied by fabricating VS2electrodes on the glassy carbon electrode and tested in a three electrode configuration. The nanosheets exhibit excellent supercapacitor electrode characteristics with a specific capacitance of 235F/g at 100 mV/s. The superior performances can be attributed to excellent electrical conductivity and fast ion transport through the layered structure.
