This article deals with the general concepts of new developments in production of high-value activated porous carbon from various types of wastes for use in supercapacitors. Recently, there has been a rise in the manufacture of activated carbon using waste materials since trash is affordable, economical, and easy, and it is also seen as an effective way to combat the waste management issue in the environment. The composition of diverse wastes, including palm, plastic, E-waste, tea, agricultural, and animal wastes, has made waste materials viable candidates for the starting substance of activated carbon for supercapacitor performance. The advantages of several types of waste materials utilized as energy storage are discussed in this work. The procedures for preparing activated carbon, such as pretreatment and activation are addressed. Finally, the economic element of supercapacitor generation from trash is highlighted, as well as future potential for supercapacitor application. This work proposes environment friendly use of waste materials by using activated carbon for energy storage via supercapacitors.
