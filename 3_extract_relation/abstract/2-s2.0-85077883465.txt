Octahedral metal phase molybdenum disulfide (1T-MoS2) shows excellent capacitive behaviour by storing charge via double layers over individual two-dimensional (2D) layers and through Faradaic reactions on the Mo centre because of its multiple oxidation states. In this study, we fabricate a free-standing film based on large-scale 1T-MoS2 nanosheets and use it as an electrode for a flexible supercapacitor without any additives. The resulting free-standing electrodes have a layered structure, hydrophilicity and high electrical conductivity, which are beneficial for electrolyte accessibility and fast ions transport. The specific volumetric capacitance of this pure 1T-MoS2-based electrode is up to 407.1 F ⋅ cm−3 (the corresponding mass and area capacitance were 26.1 F ⋅ g−1 and 184.8 mF ⋅ cm−2, respectively). The all-solid-state 1T-MoS2 based supercapacitor shows extended stability (92.8% retention after 12, 000 cycles), high flexibility (only 12% drop after bending 180 degrees for 100 cycles) and bending cycling stability (86.2% retention after in-situ bending 1500 times).
