Photoassisted energy storage is a promising approach to realizing the utilization of solar power, and the reasonable design of a photoassisted supercapacitor with photosensitive materials is one of the efficient ways to realize solar power conversion and storage. Herein, we design a photoassisted supercapacitor electrode (TiO2/CF) by integrating a photoelectrode (TiO2) and a capacitive electrode (CF) together, which achieves photoelectric synergistic charge storage. It is found that spherical TiO2precursors will crash, expand, integrate, stretch, and tear, forming a reticulated structure. Reticulated TiO2guarantees illumination, which can boost the utilization of solar power. The TiO2/CF electrode exhibits a considerable (1.9-fold) increase in capacitance performance under light conditions as compared to dark conditions. Furthermore, this TiO2/CF photoassisted supercapacitor electrode exhibits an excellent cycle stability of about 99.19% after 5000 cycles. Moreover, the enhancement mechanism is elaborated as follows: these high-energy photoelectrons will participate in charge transfer to increase the total energy of the process, thereby enhancing capacitance performance. In addition, these photoelectron-hole pairs act as additional charge carriers to favor charge accumulation. This work may offer new prospects for developing photoassisted energy supply systems for the utilization of solar power.
