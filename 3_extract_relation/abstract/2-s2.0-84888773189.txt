We report the effect of manganese oxide (MnO2) dispersion in Polypyrrole (PPy) matrix for supercapacitor electrode. Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are used as a large area conductive support to enable the dispersion at nano-scale. PPy and MnO2 nanocomposites are synthesized in two different structural forms i.e. mixed (MWCNT/PPy:MnO2) and co-axial multilayered (MWCNT/PPy/MnO2). Dispersion of MnO2 is studied from molecular level to layered nanostructure. Electrical and electrochemical investigations show that MWCNT/PPy:MnO2 is more conducting and capacitive as compared to MWCNT/PPy/MnO2. Galvanostatic charge discharge measurement shows that MWCNT/PPy:MnO2 stores high energy density (∼44 Wh/kg) compared to ∼36 Wh/kg for MWCNT/PPy/MnO2. The improved performance in mixed composite is attributed to molecular level dispersion of MnO2 which forms a percolative path between two PPy chains. Increase in PPy wt (%) leads to thick PPy layer over MWCNT in MWCNT/PPy/MnO2 structure and significantly affects the electronic conduction whereas MWCNT/PPy:MnO2 nanocomposite is capable of loading high PPy wt (%) with improved charge storage. Cyclic voltammogram of MWCNT/PPy:MnO2 at 5 mV/s shows maximum capacitance ∼365 F/g at ∼70 wt (%) PPy in PPy/(PPy + MnO 2) while co-axial nanostructure exhibits maximum ∼270 F/g at ∼ 50 wt (%) PPy. This work suggests that in situ incorporation of MnO 2 in PPy matrix yields molecular level dispersion of MnO2 which leads to enhanced performance instead of using layers of PPy and MnO 2 over MWCNT. Besides, this study also proposes the tuning of supercapacitor device characteristics by tailoring the electrode material composition. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
