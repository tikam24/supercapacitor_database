Two-dimensional materials such as graphene has become a promising candidate for electrode materials of supercapacitors due to their excellent properties, especially high specific surface area. This article summarizes the research in this area, including 2D materials such asgraphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, transition metal carbides/nitrides/carbonitrides, layered transition metal oxides/hydroxides, from the perspectives of producing methods, product properties, and performance of electrodes based on these materials. It also indicates and predicts the future and challenges of the use ofthese new emerging materials insupercapacitors.
