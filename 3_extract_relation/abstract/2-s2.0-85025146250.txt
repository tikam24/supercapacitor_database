Power allocation is a major concern in hybrid energy storage system. This paper proposes an extended droop control (EDC) strategy to achieve dynamic current sharing autonomously during sudden load change and resource variations. The proposed method consists of a virtual resistance droop controller and a virtual capacitance droop controller for energy storages with complementary characteristics, such as battery and supercapacitor (SC). By using this method, battery provides consistent power and SC only compensates high-frequency fluctuations without the involvement of conventionally used centralized controllers. To implement the proposed EDC method, a detailed design procedure is proposed to achieve the control objectives of stable operation, voltage regulation, and dynamic current sharing. System dynamic model and relevant impedances are derived and detailed frequency domain analysis is performed. Moreover, the system level stability analysis is investigated and system expansion with the proposed method is illustrated. Both simulations and experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy and analytical results.
