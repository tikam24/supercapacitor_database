In this article, we have synthesized a series of nitrogen-doped nanoporous carbon (NPC) from metal organic framework of UiO-66 with different ratios of adenine and 1,4-benzendicarboxylate (H2 BDC) coated on carbon nanotube film (CNTF) to obtain a flexible porous electrode (NPC/CNTF). It is worth noting that the introduction of adenine at different ratios did not change the structure of UiO-66. We also investigated the effect of carbonization temperature from 800 to 1000°C on the electrochemical properties of the NPC. The ratio (H2 BDC:adenine) 9: 1 and the NPC carbonized at 900°C (denoted as NPC-1-900) exhibits better electrochemical properties. The results show that NPC-1-900/CNTF electrode exhibits an exceptional areal capacitance of 121.5 mF cm−2 compared to that of PC-900/CNTF electrode (22.8 mF cm−2) at 5 mVs−1 in a three-electrode system, indicating that the incorporation of nitrogen is beneficial to the electrochemical properties of nanoporous carbon. A symmetric flexible solid-state supercapacitor of NPC-1-900/CNTF has also been assembled and tested. Electrochemical data show that the device exhibited superior areal capacitance (43.2 mF cm−2) at the scan rate of 5 mV s−1; the volumetric energy density is 57.3 µWh cm−3 and the volumetric power density is 2.4 mW cm−3 at the current density of 0.5 mA cm−2 based on poly(vinyl alcohol)/H3 PO4 gel electrolyte. For practical application, we have also studied the bending tests of the device, which show that the device exhibits outstanding mechanical stability under different bending angles. Furthermore, the flexible device shows excellent cyclic stability, which can retain 91.5% of the initial capacitance after 2000 cycles.
