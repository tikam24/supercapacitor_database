A novel regenerative braking method for electric city bus was presented, which used the series-parallel switchable ultra-capacitor (UC) models. UC models were controlled discharging in series during driving operations and were controlled charging in parallel for regenerative braking operations. With the proposed strategy, torque of generator could be maintained constant with only regenerative braking in the early course of braking process, and the mechanical braking system continued to brake the vehicle when the torque of generator could not be maintained constant. The simulation models of the proposed regenerative braking system and strategy were built. Simulation and some experimental results indicate that the present approach can achieve low speeds regenerative braking and provide an improvement in fuel economy of the electric city bus and guarantee the brake safety in the meantime.
