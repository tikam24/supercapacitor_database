The development of oil-extracted biochar and NiO-based hybrid electrode materials (OEB@NiO) for supercapacitor applications is the focus of the present work. The biochar was prepared using cow dung via thermochemical treatment. The solâ€“gel method was used to synthesise the NiO nanoparticles. The OEB@NiO-based nanocomposite was developed under ultrasonic conditions. The electrochemical investigation of OEB@NiO was carried out using GCD, CV, and EIS techniques. The maximum specific capacitance was determined to be 545.4 F/g at a current density of 8 A/g under a three-electrode system. The material proved suitable for device systems; the specific capacitance of 87.1 F/g was obtained at a current density of 2 A/g in a two-electrode system. The cyclic stability of OEB@NiO was found to be 97.2% after 5000 GCD cycles.
