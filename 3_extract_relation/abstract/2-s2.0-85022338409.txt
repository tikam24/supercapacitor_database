The single phase residential inverter provide backup power during interruption of supply. The present technology of residential inverter cannot able to provide peak load at the time of starting. This paper presents inverter incorporating supercapacitor. The purpose of connecting supercapacitor along with the battery is to reduce the stress and improve the life of battery. And also provide surge power demand when load is connected at the time of starting. We observed that sinusoidal pulse width modulation provides better result output in harmonic reduction compared to single pulse width modulation. In order obtain above mention objective simulation is carried out using MATLAB/SIMULINK
