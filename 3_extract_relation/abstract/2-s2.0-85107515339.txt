This paper dealt with the off-grid household energy system improvement by developing a control based on battery storage system embedded with an ultracapacitor. The hybrid energy system is constituted with photo-voltaic arrays, battery, ultracapacitor, and active load. Non-conventional sources of energy such as photo-voltaic generation is characterized by high variability of parameters due to their dependency to the weather and variable active demand power (load). Partial charge or discharge cycles can happen which has a detrimental effect on energy storage system life span and rating. The ultracapacitor based storage energy system provides the greatest power demanded to keep the reliability and the good level of energy quality on the short time and log-time duration. A high of energy supply can be obtained in an isolated household system generation. Optimization model was developed to combine the battery coupled with an ultracapacitor.
