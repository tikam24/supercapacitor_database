With the rapid demand in the power system, the renewable energy sources (RES) have led to the higher penetration in the existing main grid. The proper control strategy for energy storage systems (ESS) have received a huge attention. The ESS is critical to maintain the correct power balance between the RESs and load demand. In this research, fuzzy logic control algorithm is implemented among other existing control algorithms to operate the battery and supercapacitor (SC) based hybrid energy storage system (HESS) in an optimal way. The battery is used to compensate the energy requirement during long duration, while the supercapacitor handles mainly the transient power fluctuations. This increases the battery life cycle due to limited stress on the battery. The proposed fuzzy inference system decides the optimal amount of charging/discharging of the HESS based on the state of charge (SOC) constraints of the battery and supercapacitor. MATLAB/Simulink is used to create and implement the microgrid test bench and fuzzy logic system (FLS). The simulation results substantiate the potential of FLS in the microgrid energy management in different modes of operation and load conditions.
