The development of new and cheap electrode materials in energy production devices and especially supercapacitors caused our research team to synthesize a new type of active carbon obtained from the wheat husk (ACWH) and combine it with one of the most efficient binary metal oxides (NiFe2O4) and measure the capability of this electrode material in energy storage. The successful synthesis of NiFe2O4/ACWH by the hydrothermal method was confirmed by accurate physical characterization and the results of cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests show the excellent capability of this electrode material in electrochemical energy storage. Specific capacitance of 1280 F/g and 84% stability of NiFe2O4/ACWH after 5000 consecutively GCD make this electrode material an attractive option for use in supercapacitors on an industrial scale. The assembled supercapacitor also kept the blue and red LEDs on for about 39 s.
