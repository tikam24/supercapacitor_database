Et4NBF4/AN with concentration of 1 mol·L-1 was used as electrolyte to study the effects of aluminum foil etching and two conductive agents (graphite and conductive carbon black) on effective series resistance (ESR) and specific capacitance of supercapacitor. The results show that, the contact resistance of activated material and aluminum foil decreases with increasing etching time and using graphite as conductive agent, which contributes to obtain smaller ERS and larger electrode specific capacitance; 80 s etching aluminum foil and conductive carbon black are also useful to get smaller ESR and larger electrode specific capacitance. The effective internal resistance of double electric layer capacitor (EDLC) be made up of aluminum foil of 80 s etching as current collector and the conductive carbon black as conductive agent is 1.4 Ω, and its specific capacitance is 168.3 F/g.
