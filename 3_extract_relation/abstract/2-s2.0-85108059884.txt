The energy density limit of the metal oxide system increases by altering the bi-metallic system to ternary metal oxide systems. Here we report, the synthesized ternary metal oxide system for distinct dual applications (Micro supercapacitor and Dye-sensing activity). The nanoflake-shaped materials [MNC-A (Ni 1.0 Co 0.9 and Mg 0.4) O 0.6 and MNC-B (Ni 1.0 Co 0.5 Mg 0.5) O1.0] were synthesized by the hydrothermal method followed by an annealing process. The synthesized tri-metal-oxide were analyzed using various physicochemical and electrochemical analyses to examine their material and electrochemical properties respectively. The obtained nanoflake-like structure can render rich active reaction sites and rapid ion diffusion pathways. When examined as an asymmetric supercapacitor electrode material, it delivers outstanding specific capacitance of 198 Ag−1 at 0.3 Fg−1. Furthermore, the asymmetric supercapacitor provides a high-energy density of 70.7 W h kg−1 at 0.36 kW kg−1 and a high-power density of 4.5 kW kg−1 at 11.0 W h kg−1 respectively. Particularly, it maintains the high cyclic stability and retained 99.8 % initial specific capacitance after 50,000 charge/discharge cycles at the current density of 2 A g−1. Interestingly, the three interconnected systems deliver enough power to brighten a 3 V LED for up to 2 minutes. Also, the active material used as an electrode for the detection of low-level dissolved dyes in water (ppm).
