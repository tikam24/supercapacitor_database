LiCoO2 is used as a cathode material in most commercial lithium-ion batteries. Of the phases formed upon Li-removal the P3 phase has been only reported in the chemically delithiated materials. In this paper we compared LixCoO2 produced by chemical and electrochemical methods. P3 phase was found in both chemically and electrochemically delithiated specimens. We investigate the phases formed at elevated temperatures by X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy. Above approximate 200Â°C Li xCoO2 decomposed into fine Co3O4 and LiCoO2 particles. copyright The Electrochemical Society.
