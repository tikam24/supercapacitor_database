Bimetallic 2-D materials especially metalâ€“organic frameworks (MOFs) are a fascinating class of materials because of their high active surface area and synergistic effect of bimetals. The ultrathin structure helps in enhancing the conductivity with the increase in exposed active sites which ultimately facilitates the catalytic activity of the 2-D bimetallic MOFs for energy applications. The catalytic activity of 2-D bimetallic MOF can be explained using electroanalytical methods like impedance, cyclic voltammetry, and Tafel plots. To understand catalysis at the molecular level in terms of the charge transfer kinetics and study the effect of unsaturated metal sites on catalysis density functional theory can be employed. Unfortunately, only a few reports have been published to explore 2-D bimetallic MOF for applications like water splitting reactions (oxygen evolution reactions and hydrogen evolution reactions), and energy storage devices (batteries, supercapacitors, and pseudocapacitors). This review highlights the catalytic behavior of 2-D bimetallic MOF in-depth, employing electrochemical and theoretical studies.
