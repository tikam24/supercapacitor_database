The limited energy storage capacities of carbon-based negative electrodes, which rely on conventional double layer charge storage mechanisms, have limited the electrochemical performances of hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs). The development of nanostructured redox-active materials that serve as alternatives to carbon-based negative electrodes is crucial to overcome the limitations of current HSCs. In this work, a coordination chemistry approach is utilized to tune the nanostructure of zinc ferrite thin films on flexible stainless steel (SS) foil by using several zinc salt precursors, including ZnCl2·6H2O, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, and ZnSO4·6H2O, while using the same iron precursor (FeCl2·4H2O). Materials prepared with the ZnCl2·6H2O metal salt form porous nanosheets with groundnut-like structures that exhibit maximum specific capacities of 544 mA h/g (454 F/g) at current density of 2.5 A/g. Redox-active solid-state HSCs are assembled by using zinc ferrite as a negative electrode, MnO2 nanoflakes as a positive electrode, and a polymer gel as the electrolyte. The developed solid-state HSC cells show excellent performance as exemplified by a maximum specific capacitance of 123.8 F/g and an energy density of 55.72 Wh/kg, both of which are superior to those of conventional carbon-based symmetric and HSCs.
