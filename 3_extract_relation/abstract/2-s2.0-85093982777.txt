The cycling stability of electrode materials is a key for Faraday supercapacitors (FSs), especially the structure-unstable Ni(OH)2. There exist various strategies for stabilizing the structure of Ni(OH)2 such as cobalt ions doping and mechanical support from substrate. However, these strategies have their own disadvantages. On the other hand, the combination of two or more strategies has the serious issues in materials synthesis. In this work, a branched nanosheets-interlaced structure of Co2+/Co3+-doped Ni(OH)2 is built by a method of precursor template, which effectively applies two strategies including ions doping and self-supportive structure. Due to the synergistic contribution of these two strategies, the cycling stability of as-prepared material is significantly enhanced. This material also presents excellent high-rate capacity, and the as-assembled asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) show both high energy and power densities. These results prove that the effective combination of ions doping and self-supportive structure strategies is a promising route for the preparation of Ni(OH)2-based electrode materials with high performance.
