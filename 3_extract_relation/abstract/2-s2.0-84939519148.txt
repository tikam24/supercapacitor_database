Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop porous nitrogen-enriched carbon (NC-U) with high nitrogen concentration and high specific capacitance (Cpe) as the electrode material for supercapacitors. Design/methodology/approach NC-U was obtained by carbonization of polyvinylpyrrolidone/melamine formaldehyde resin (PVP/MF) with different contents of urea. In comparison, NC-K was also prepared by the KOH activation method. A series of asymmetric supercapacitors with NC as a negative electrode was assembled. The composition, microstructure and electrochemical properties of NC and their supercapacitors were studied. Findings The results show that NC-U shows irregular particles with a porous honeycomb structure. High Cpe was obtained for urea-treated NC-U because of the improvement of nitrogen, conductivity and specific surface area (SBET). NC-U50 with 13.15 per cent at nitrogen has the highest Cpe of 148.53 F/g because of the highest concentration of N-6 and N-5. NC-K with higher SBET has lower Cpe than NC-U50 because of its lower nitrogen concentration. When the specific power of the supercapacitor with NC-U50 as a negative electrode is 1,565.56 W/kg, its specific energy is still 4.35 Wh/kg. There is only 5.9 per cent decay in Cpe over 1,000 cycles. Research limitations/implications NC-U is a suitable electrode material for supercapacitors, which can be used in the field of electric vehicles to solve the problems of energy shortage and environmental pollutions. Originality/value Porous NC-U based on PVP/MF/urea composites with high nitrogen concentration and Cpe is novel, and it owns good electrochemical properties.
