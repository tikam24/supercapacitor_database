We report a method to construct ordered hierarchical porous structures in carbon nanofiber membranes using poly(ethylene oxide)-block-polydimethylsiloxane bottlebrush block copolymers (BBCPs) as templates. The BBCPs self-assemble into a spherical morphology driven by small-molecule hydrogen bond donors which act as bridges between carbon precursors and templates to promote uniform dispersion of the templates. We successfully obtained flexible, self-supporting, and porous carbon nanofiber membranes (PCNFs) with high porosity. Then, a supercapacitor electrode was independently prepared using PCNFs as an active substance without infiltrating any conductive agents or binders. The PCNFs exhibit excellent performance with a capacitance of 234.1 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 owing to the abundant hierarchical porous structures and high content of nitrogen and oxygen elements internally. The aqueous symmetric supercapacitor prepared using PCNFs electrodes maintains more than 95% capacitance retention after 55,000 charge-discharge cycles. Furthermore, the capacitance retention reaches up to 67.72% at a current density of 50 A g-1 (compared to 1 A g-1), exhibiting excellent cycling stability and rate capability. Based on the excellent electrochemical performance and flexible self-supporting ability of PCNFs, this work is expected to facilitate the development of flexible displays, flexible sensors, wearable devices, and electrocatalysis.
