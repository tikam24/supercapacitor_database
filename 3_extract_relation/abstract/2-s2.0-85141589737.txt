Supercapacitors start to become major energy storage for electrical and electronic applications other than batteries. It provides better charging and discharging cycle in terms of time and rate of current which is higher than batteries. The ability to charge and discharge at a high current makes the supercapacitor has a higher power density which made it suitable for various application with high power demand. Supercapacitor is also sustainable material as it has a high charging cycle and longer life span. Self-discharge is the only drawback of the supercapacitor when compared to a battery. Supercapacitor self-discharge is affected by the charge and discharge cycle and the time taken to discharge after charge which will be the focus of this paper. The time where the supercapacitor is let in an open circuit gives effect toward the next self-discharge condition after fully charged to its rated voltage. The same rated supercapacitor will undergo constant current charging and be stored at a different timeframe and measure the self-discharge. The different timeframe to store the supercapacitor even with the same capacitance and rated voltage in an open circuit condition gives an effect on the self-discharge rate where the results show the longer time the supercapacitor is stored after fully charged, the higher the self-discharge rate of the supercapacitor will be.
