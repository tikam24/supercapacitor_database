Simulation research work is presented for fuel cell supercapacitor hybrid powertrain. Sub-systems of the fuel cell hybrid powertrain are modeled, simulation system is developed and load following control strategy is designed. Vehicle dynamic and fuel economy performance are investigated through simulation method and the control strategy is verified through experiments on dynamic testbed. Simulation and test result show that supercapacitor can work well for power assist and fuel economy performance is improved through brake energy recovery.
