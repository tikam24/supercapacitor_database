Supercapacitors are of two kinds, namely, the electrical double-layer capacitors and the pseudocapacitors. For electrical double-layer capacitance, various fabrication materials have been used such, as porous carbon which includes activated carbon, CNTs, and, lately, graphene. Carbon and its derivative have properties like high conductivity, highly tunable surface area, good chemical stability, and excellent mechanical strength. On the other hand, several properties like excellent conductivity, flexibility, low cost, and high environmental stability are characteristic feature of conducting polymers. Polymeric conductors are also tuned appropriately with metal oxides in order to accumulate and store charges. This combination helps in overcoming problems and makes it an effective material for fabrication of electrochemical devices. Both have merits and demerits, hence efforts are being made to tune both synergistically so that better properties can be achieved. There are different factors such as morphology, surface area, temperature, and methods, etc., that affect the performance of electrochemical devices.
