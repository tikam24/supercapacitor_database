In this study MnO2 nanorodes (MNR) were fabricated on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets using a facile hydrothermal synthesis route. As prepared binder free MNR-rGO electrodes exhibited promising electrochemical performance. A similar approach was employed to prepare V2O5 nanowire (VNW) on rGO electrodes as anodes for supercapacitor applications. The VNW-rGO anode and MNR-rGO cathode were combined to form a novel hybrid supercapacitor. The hybrid supercapacitor exhibited excellent electrochemical performance reflecting the synergistic effect of combining the MNR-rGO electrode and VNW-rGO electrode. This novel hybrid supercapacitor delivered an energy density of ~15Wh/kg with a specific capacitance of 36.9F/g. These results suggest that the binder free flexible MNR-rGO electrode is a promising cathode material for asymmetric supercapacitors and also for hybrid devices, which incorporate metal oxide anodes.
