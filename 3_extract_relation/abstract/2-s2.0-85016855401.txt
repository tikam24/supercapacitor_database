FIB-SEM, XPS, TOF-SIMS and electrochemical methods have been used for the characterization of physical properties and chemical composition of microporous carbide derived carbon electrodes, prepared from TiC at 950 °C (noted as TiC-CDC) after 40000 charge/discharge cycles. Changes in surface chemical composition of TiC-CDC electrodes, includes partial contamination with reaction intermediates (F2, CH-, CHO-, CN-, organic radicals), and Al current collectors, like partial dissolution of Al from positively charged electrode and deposition of Al onto the negatively charged TiC-CDC electrode surface, have been analyzed. The values of gravimetric energy (taking into consideration the active TiC-CDC material weight only) calculated before and after constant current charge/discharge cycling at cell voltage 3.4 V are quite similar (35 and 34 W h kg-1, respectively). At starting moment the gravimetric power was practically 1.4 times higher (195 kW kg-1, 146 kW dm-3) than that calculated after 40000 charge/discharge cycles (144 kW kg-1, 104 kW dm-3). The characteristic relaxation time constant (0.94 and 1.23 s, respectively) increases somewhat in accordance with the decrease of power density during long-lasting cycling at higher cell voltage range from 0.2 to 3.4 V. © 2012, The Electrochemical Society, Inc.
