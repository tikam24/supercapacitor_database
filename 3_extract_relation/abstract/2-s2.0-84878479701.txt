The present paper represents a study of a hybrid electric system that uses a battery of electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLC), a conventional leadacid battery and a proprietary electronic system, designed to obtain minimum electromagnetical disturbances, with uses in automotive applications. The electronic control module offers the possibility of programming the control method of the distribution of electricity in the hybrid system. Electromagnetic compatibility assessments of the electronic were also performed according to CISPR 22 standard and the results are compared with the limits specified by the standard. Electrical tests performed on both charge / discharge cycles of the battery of supercapacitors and in combination with a reversible electric motor highlights the benefits of using EDLC in automotive applications.
