Composite of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and polyaniline (PANI) have gained much attention in industrial applications especially for the fabrication of supercapacitor and flexible sensors. Nevertheless, existing studies mainly focus on the application efficiency and are lacking information on how morphology of the nanoparticles can affect the electrode properties. Herein, the effects of shape of PANI on the electrode resistivity were systematically investigated. PANI of different shapes was synthesized using different reagents, namely H2SO4, CH3COOH, H2O, and NH3·H2O, which induced formation of globule, tube, plate, and flake-like PANI. rGO-PANI composite was then produced using ex situ method and cast on a PVC substrate to form a flexible electrode. The rGO-PANI globules displayed superior electrical conductivity owing to its high protonation level. The resistivity of this sample was found to be 0.015 ± 0.002 Ωcm, which is lowest as compared to the counterparts. Interestingly, electrode made of rGO-PANI plates had a slightly lower electrical resistivity than rGO-PANI tubes despite its low protonation level. It is speculate that the aspect ratio characteristic of the PANI might have influence the electron mobility. rGO-PANI electrode was found to exhibit a lower specific resistivity than pure rGO and pure PANI, evincing the presence of synergism.
