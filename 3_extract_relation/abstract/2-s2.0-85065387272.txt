Reasonable design of multi-component metal oxides hierarchical nanostructures is an effective and promising way to improve electrochemical performances of electrode materials. In this work, novel hydrangea-like ZnCo2O4/Ni3V2O8 hierarchical nanostructures are constructed by adjusting the ratio of ZnCo2O4 and Ni3V2O8. The perfect architecture maximizes the synergistic effect between different components and provides abundant electrochemical reactive sites, promoting the diffusion and transfer of electrolyte ions in electrochemical reaction process. As a result, ZnCo2O4/Ni3V2O8 electrodes deliver an enhanced specific capacitance of 1734 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and cyclic stability (96% of initial capacitance is retained after 8000 cycles). Furthermore, the assembled ZnCo2O4/Ni3V2O8//AC device e achieves excellent energy density of 90 Wh kg−1 at power density of 812 W kg−1, proving the optimized hydrangea-like ZnCo2O4/Ni3V2O8 hierarchical nanostructures are promising electrode material for supercapacitor. In addition, this work supplies helpful insights into rational design of structure and composition of multi-component metal oxides for enhanced electrochemical performance.
