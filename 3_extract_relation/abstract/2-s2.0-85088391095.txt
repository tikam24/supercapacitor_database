NiCo2O4@MnMoO4 core@shell nanostructures are synthesized as electrode material using hydrothermal method for the fabrication of asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device. The NiCo2O4@MnMoO4 electrode shows better electrochemical performance with specific capacitance (SC) of 1821 F/g at current density of 5 A/g and cycling stability of 94%. The NiCo2O4@MnMoO4 core@shell electrode shows better SC compared to pure NiCo2O4 and MnMoO4 electrodes. An ASC device is fabricated using NiCo2O4@MnMoO4 as a positive and rGO/Fe2O3 as negative electrode materials. Remarkably, the fabricated device shows a SC of 294 F/g at current density 4 A/g, with an energy density of 91.87 Wh/kg at a power density of 374.15 W/kg. The device shows good reversibility with cycling stability of 68% after 2,000 cycles. The ASC device is used to illuminate nine green color LEDs for 35 min. Therefore, the present report provides a simple method to fabricate efficient and stable energy storage devices for industrial applications.
