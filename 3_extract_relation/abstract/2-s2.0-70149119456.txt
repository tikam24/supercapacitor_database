An in-situ silica template method has been employed to prepare mesoporous carbon materials. As-prepared carbon materials have been characterized by transmission electron microscopy, small-angle X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption-desorption, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and electrochemical techniques. The results reveal that highly ordered mesoporous carbon with abundant hydrophilic functional groups and high specific surface area (1628 m2 g-1) was obtained. Such material has high specific capacitance (161 F g-1) and the capacitance shows negligible dependence on the potential sweep rate, which makes it promising in supercapacitor application.
