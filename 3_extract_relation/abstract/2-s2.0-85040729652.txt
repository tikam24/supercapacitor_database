Facile synthesis of materials with high specific surface areas is very urgent for their potential applications in the field of energy storage. In the present work, coral-like LiFePO4 particles etched for 60, 90, and 120 min (labeled as S-60, S-90, and S-120, respectively) were successfully synthesized through a facile chemical etching method with rugby-like LiFePO4 (named as LFP) particles as precursors synthesized by the solvothermal method. They were then applied as electrode materials for high-performance electrochemical capacitors. In particular, the specific surface area of S-120 reaches 52 m2 g-1, which is 5.2 times greater than that of unetched counterpart. Therefore, S-120 can achieve a higher capacitance of 359 F g-1 at a scan rate of 2 mV s-1 compared with the unetched counterpart. Furthermore, S-120 presents a good cycling stability of 82.3% capacitive retention even after 2000 cycles, which is much higher than that of unetched LFP particles (64%). As a result, the coral-like LFP particles are promising candidate electrode materials for supercapacitor applications.
