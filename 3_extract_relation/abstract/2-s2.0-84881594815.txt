The electrocapacitive properties of MnFe2O4 hollow spheres and colloidal nanocrystal clusters in electrolyte LiNO3 containing surfactants were studied. Electrochemical performances of supercapacitors were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge, self-discharge, cycle stability and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Results showed that the MnFe2O4 colloidal nanocrystal clusters electrode displayed a higher capacitance than that of MnFe2O4 hollow sphere. Anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and non-ionic surfactant p-t-octylophenol (Triton-X-100) and poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-Poly(ethylene glycol) (P123) were added respectively to LiNO3 electrolyte to investigate capacitive features of MnFe2O4-nanocrystal-based supercapacitors. It was found that lowering the interfacial tension between the electrode and electrolyte favoured the diffusion of lithium ions. For example, surfactant SDS enhanced 36.8% capacitance with an energy density of 14.5 Wh/Kg at the current density of 0.05 A/g, and the capacitive retention was 82% after 1000 cycles. However, the capacitance improves about 22.8% and 12.8% after the addition of Triton-X-100 and P123, respectively. Based on the experimental results, the enhancement mechanism of surfactants on the electrochemical performances of the as-prepared supercapacitors was proposed. Â© 2013 by ESG.
