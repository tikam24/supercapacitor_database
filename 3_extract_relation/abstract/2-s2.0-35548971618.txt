Porous carbon electrode materials for use in supercapacitors were prepared by carbonization polymer blend method using phenolic resin as the precursor and polyethylene glycol (PEG) as the pyrolyzing polymer. The specific surface area and pore structure were measured by N2 absorption/ desorption isotherm. The electrochemical performance of the porous carbon in 1 mol·L-1 Et4NBF4/PC were evaluated with galvanostatic charge/discharge, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and AC impedance spectroscopy, etc. The BET surface area of the porous carbon reaches 618 m2·g-1 and the mesopore ratio is 59.7%. The specific capacitance of porous carbon is 32 F·g-1, and the product also shows good rate and cycling performance.
