This paper discusses about remote area power supply (RAPS) system for the conversion of power from wind into electrical energy along with supercapacitor and battery storage to supply main load and dump load. Generation of power during varying loads and fluctuating wind is difficult to control. The wind power generating system have difficulty to supply the required amount of reactive power. This is compensated using synchronous condenser. The performance related to the energy storage system is improved using energy management algorithm. The wind power is converted to dc using bridge rectifier and buck boost converter. Voltage controlled converter is designed to convert dc to ac to operate in synchronization with grid voltage. Real power obtained from the wind energy conversion system and the reactive power are controlled separately to provide support for the frequency and voltage control. The system is simulated to show the performance of the developed system.
