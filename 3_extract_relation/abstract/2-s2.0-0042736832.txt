The performance of supercapacitor electrodes based on single wall carbon nanotube/polyacrylonitrile (SWNT/PAN) composite films was reported. Two circular pieces of SWNT/activated carbon films were sandwiched into a supercapacitor testing cell. The SWNT/activated carbon film exhibited significant nonlinear discharging behavior, at low discharging current. The specific capacitance of SWNT/activated carbon at 0.001 A discharging current was strongly dependent upon the discharging voltage.
