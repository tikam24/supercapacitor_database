This paper describes advances in integrated ultra-thin wireless power module components for Internet of Things (IoT) and wireless sensor applications. A typical wireless module integrates both an inductive link for wireless power transfer, and supercapacitor as a storage element. The performance of the inductive link is enhanced with innovative high-permeability and low-loss magnetic films for improved inductive coupling between the receiver and the transmitter. Up to 4X enhancement in power transfer efficiency is demonstrated with the innovative magnetic films. Energy storage is achieved through a thinfilm micro fabricated supercapacitor layer with interdigitated graphene-based planar electrodes and solid-state electrolytes for easier integration. The component properties demonstrated through this work are projected to achieve high power levels with ultra-thin form-factors.
