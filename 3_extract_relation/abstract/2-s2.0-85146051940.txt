Carbon dots (CDs), a new member of the family of carbon materials, can be potentially used in electronic devices. In this study, porous activated carbon derived from CDs (ACD) was synthesized using industrial glucose as a carbon source via a direct pyrolysis, followed by KOH activation with a low mass ratio. Owing to the co-contribution of CDs and double-layer capacitance, the obtained ACD exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 350 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and a superior rate capability (248 F g−1 even at 20 A g−1) when the mass ratio of KOH to carbon was 0.75. Furthermore, the symmetric supercapacitor using the optimized ACD as electrodes exhibited a remarkable energy density of 7.3 Wh Kg−1 at a power density of 251.7 W Kg−1 and an unexceptionable cycling stability with only 3 % capacitance decay over 10,000 charge-discharge cycles at 2 A g−1. Thus, the low cost, ease of preparation, and suitable electrochemical performance endow CDs-derived porous activated carbon with promising application in the supercapacitor industry.
