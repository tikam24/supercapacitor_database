A new class α-MnO2 nanofiber-based on assemblies of nanoparticles was synthesized to improve the availability of Mn atom for application in electrochemical storage. Furthermore, the effect of graphene quantum dots/polyaniline (GQD/PANI) on the structure and electrochemical performance of α-MnO2 nanofiber was investigated. The MnO2 nanofiber combined with GQD/PANI showed a larger specific capacitance of 1022.5 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 comparing to other MnO2-based electrode materials. The result was attributed to α-MnO2nanofiber with loosely assembled structure and GQD/PANI with good conductivity, providing more electrochemical active sites and reducing internal resistance. The working does not only report new MnO2-based electrode materials with high performance but also provides a facile method to synthesize α-MnO2 nanofiber with a loosely assembled structure for various applications.
