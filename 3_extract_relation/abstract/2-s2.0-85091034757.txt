Herein, we report one pot synthesis of a bimetallic transition metal sulfide, NiFeS2 nanocomposite by solvothermal decomposition of FeCl2(4-Cl-benztsczH)2 (4-Cl-benztsczH = 4-chlorobenzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone) and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O in presence of oleylamine (OLA). TEM reveals that the NiFeS2 nanocomposite has spherical morphology. The electrochemical studies show that NiFeS2 electrode has excellent specific capacitance of 1051 Fg−1 at current density of 1 Ag−1 in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte and superior cycle stability of 90.5% even after 1000 charge–discharge cycles.
