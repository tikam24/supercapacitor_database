Nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) was prepared via different synthesis strategies namely chemical precipitation and hydrothermal method. The structural, morphological and electrochemical characteristics of the materials were analyzed. The chemically precipitated NiFe LDH had hydrotalcite-like structure, porous surface and a superior specific capacitance of 725 F g-1 at 1 A g-1. Meanwhile, hydrothermally synthesized NiFe LDH had comparatively lower cavities on the surface and a specific capacitance of 403 F g-1 at 1 A g-1. The chemically precipitated NiFe LDH had greater porosity and remarkable electrochemical activity, making them more desirable candidate for supercapacitor electrodes.
