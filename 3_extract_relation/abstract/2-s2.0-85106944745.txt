In recent times, microwave synthetic strategies have been considered as one of the facile methods for the development of efficient supercapacitor electrodes. Reduced graphene oxide containing cobalt oxide (rGO@Co3O4/CoO) hybrids were synthesized via single-step microwave irradiation in which the uniform Co3O4/CoO nanoparticles were attached in thin layers of rGO nanosheets. During short time of single-step microwave irradiation process, three kind of phenomena occurs as (i) reduction and exfoliation of graphite oxide into rGO nanosheets, (ii) decomposition of cobalt(II) acetate into Co3O4/CoO nanoparticles and (iii) rGO nanosheets covers the Co3O4/CoO nanoparticles. The BET surface area and pore diameter range of rGO@Co3O4/CoO hybrids were 133.2 m2g−1 and 5–45 nm, respectively, which shows the mesoporous structure formation of hybrids. Electrochemical evaluations of rGO@Co3O4/CoO hybrids as electrode materials for supercapacitor shows specific capacitance of 276.1 F g−1 (scan rate of 5 mV s−1) and long-term cycling stability as 82.37% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles (scan rate of 60 mV s−1) in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte solution. The Co3O4/CoO nanoparticles with conducting scaffolds rGO structure will pave an encouraging alternative for electrode materials and suggesting good potential for supercapacitors applications.
