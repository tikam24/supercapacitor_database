As a new quasi-zero-dimensional nanomaterial, graphene quantum dots (GQDs) can solve the impact of carbon materials that have low specific surface area and few active sites, improving the performance of planar on-chip micro-supercapacitors (POMSs) by reducing the interdigital width. In this article, nitrogen and oxygen co-doped GQDs (N-O-GQDs) as an electrode material and narrow electrode width and gap are both 6 μm make the POMS possess a power density of 28.1 μW cm−2 and an energy density of 15.11 nWh cm−2. Importantly, the capacitance retention rate is as high as 96.1% after 10,000 cycles of charging and discharging.
