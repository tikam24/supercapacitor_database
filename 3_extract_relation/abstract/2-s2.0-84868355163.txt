Cyclic voltammetry was used to deposite polyaniline/activated carbon (PANI/AC) film on flexible graphite paper. The surface morphology of the PANI/AC film was characterized by SEM, and the electrochemical properties of PANI/AC film electrode were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatic charge-discharge. From SEM graphs, PANI/AC film had different forms with increasing scan cycles, and from electrochemical measuring results, PANI/AC electrode synthesized by three scan cycles had the best electrochemical performance among those different scan cycles electrodes. Specific capacitance was about 504 F Â· g -1, and only about 14% of the initial capacitance was lost after 2000 cycles in circling life process.
