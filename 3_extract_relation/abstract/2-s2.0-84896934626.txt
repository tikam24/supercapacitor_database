This paper presents the design of a power converter for electric vehicle (EV) applications energized by Li-ion battery (LiB) and supercapacitor (SC). The combination of these energy sources is a good solution for better performances of the EV. A single non-isolated bi-directional converter is proposed in order to get the lowest loss, weight and cost of total electric vehicle applications perspective. The battery voltage represents bus voltage of the power supply system connecting to the load. To control the dynamic of converter, state space averaging technique and power equation linearization are employed to get the transfer function for designing the PI controllers. In order to get the fast response of SC power energizing, the cascade controller is implemented to control current and SC voltage. MATLAB simulation is successfully verified the proposed power converter topology, configuration and controller design for EV. The result shows the capability to settling supply a significant amount of power for step load change within few milliseconds. Sudden load power demand can be drawn from SC. This can reduce the stress of battery as in case of the pure battery power supply system. Â© 2014 Penerbit UTM Press. All rights reserved.
