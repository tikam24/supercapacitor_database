We report on the fabrication of a high performance flexible micro-supercapacitor (MSC) for powering a vertically integrated skin-attachable strain sensor on a gecko-inspired micro-structured adhesive. Combined utilization of the mixed manganese/vanadium (Mn/V) oxide grown on MWCNT electrode and the sulfone-based electrolyte, PC/SL/LiClO4/PMMA, enhances both the capacitance and operation voltage up to 2 V of MSC. Thus, the fabricated MSC exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with an areal capacitance of 11.8 mF cm−2 and an areal energy density of 6.58 µWh cm−2 at an areal power density of 200 µW cm−2. The MSC shows mechanical stability over 1000 repetitive bends at a bending radius of 3.7 mm. The strain sensor made of fragmentized graphene foam embedded in PDMS film provides a high gauge factor of 12.6 up to 50% strain to detect strains due to various bio-signals. Our gecko-inspired adhesive made of PDMS micropillars inked with a mixture of PDMS and Silbione to have spatula tips exhibits not only high adhesion property but also high durability over repeated cycles of attachment-detachment and negligible skin irritation. After vertical integration of the MSC, strain sensor, and the adhesive film, bio-signals such as an arterial pulse, swallowing, and frowning of the brow are successfully detected using energy stored in the MSC.
