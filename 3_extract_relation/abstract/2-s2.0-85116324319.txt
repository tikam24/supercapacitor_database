In the increasingly complex power system on ships, photovoltaic system plays an important role. Some of them have the problem of unstable output power and power fluctuation caused by sudden load unloading. Therefore, the energy storage stabilization system is needed to suppress this instability. A modified typical topology based on DC bus is adopted, in which photovoltaic array and hybrid energy storage are connected to the load on DC bus respectively through the converters. Aiming at the shortage of the traditional limit management method, a power distribution method based on the supercapacitor charge state is proposed, and the control strategy and working mode of each converter are given. MATLAB/Simulink is adopted for modeling. The analysis on simulation results and engineering test results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed hybrid energy storage management method and converter control strategy. They can reduce the influence of charge and discharge process of hybrid energy storage, maintain the stability of dc bus voltage, and guarantee the effective work of whole power system.
