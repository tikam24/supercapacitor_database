Flexible solid-state supercapacitors possess promising safety performance and intrinsic fast charging-discharging properties, enabling them to accomplish the requirements of lightweight and multifunctional wearable electronics that have recently become fairly popular. Because electrode materials are the core component of flexible solid-state supercapacitors, we exhaustively review the recent investigations involving electrode materials that have used carbons, metal oxides, and conductive polymers. The principles and methods of optimizing and fabricating electrodes for use in flexible supercapacitors are discussed through a comprehensive analysis of the literature. In addition, we focused on three types of flexible solid-state supercapacitors (fiber-, paper-, and porous foam-based structures) to satisfy the requirements of flexible electronic devices. Further, we summarize the practical applications of flexible solid-state supercapacitors, including energy conversion/collection devices and energy storage/detection devices. Finally, we provide the developmental direction for flexible solid-state supercapacitors in the future.
