Polyaniline/nitrogen-doped hollow carbon spheres(PANI/N-HCS) nanocomposites were prepared via in situ polymerization of nano-sized polyaniline thorns on the surface of nitrogen-doped hollow carbon spheres. The morphology and structure of PANI/N-HCS were characterized by SEM, TEM and FTIR, respectively. The electrochemical capacitive behavior of PANI/N-HCS was investigated by cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in 1 mol/L H2SO4 solution. The specific capacitance of PANI/N-HCS is 346 F/g at 0.5 A/g, which is higher than that of each individual component. In addition, PANI/N-HCS shows excellent power characteristics: the specific capacitance is as high as 228 F/g when the current density increases to 20 A/g, and the specific capacitance retains 66% compared to that of 0.5 A/g. The specific capacitance retains 76% after 1000 charge-discharge cycles.
