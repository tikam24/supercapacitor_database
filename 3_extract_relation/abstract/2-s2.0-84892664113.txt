Supercapacitor devices promise to be an effective means of storing energy, and delivering power for personal electronics, remote sensors, and transportation.1,2 Rare earth metals, such as ruthenium, have been used and report high value of capacitance, specific power, and energy. 4 Nevertheless, the rarity of such metals prevent their practical use. In this study we utilize an earth-abundant nickel and a controlled microwave synthesis to create nickel oxide (NiO) with an optimal nanostructure for capacitance. To surpass the lofty series resistance associated with metal oxides such as NiO, we exploit the conductive properties of single and multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The carbon nanotubes and NiO can benefit from the presence of each other by preventing unnecessary aggregation. Â© 2013 Materials Research Society.
