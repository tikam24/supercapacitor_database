Herein, composite material cotton carbon/Co-Ni-Mn LDH (CCO/CNM) combining the cotton carbon and the metal organic framework (ZIF-67) material is successfully prepared depending on solvothermal method and calcination. Simultaneously, the impact of load upon the sacrifice template CCO/ZIF-67 and electrochemical performance of CCO/CNM are further studied, and find that the optimized CCO/Co-Ni-Mn LDH-2 (CCO/CNM-2) composite electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical properties. In the case of a current density of 1 A g−1, the high specific capacitance of CCO/CNM-2 electrode materials can be calculated as 2995.56F g−1. In addition, when the current density is set to 10 A g−1, the capacitance value can still maintain 91.8% of the initial capacitance after experiencing 5000 cycles of charging and discharging. Moreover, the assembled CCO/CNM-2// activated carbon (AC) asymmetric supercapacitor shows a superior energy density of 104.98Wh kg−1 at power density of 800 kW kg−1, and 79.3% of the capacitance retention rate at current density of 10 A g−1 after 10,000 charge–discharge cycles. Finally, three light emitting diodes (LEDs) are successfully lit by connecting with two CCO/CNM-2//AC asymmetric supercapacitor.
