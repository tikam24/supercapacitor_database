A nanocomposite containing three-dimensional (3D) flower-like MoS2 nanosheets and two-dimensional (2D) interconnected carbon nanosheets was successfully prepared by a facile hydrothermal method. The nanocomposite (MC-2) containing 6% surface-functional carbon nanosheets are beneficial to inhabit the restacking of MoS2 nanosheets and form curved MoS2 nanosheets, which are grown along the vertical orientation on the carbon nanosheets. The curved MoS2 nanosheets could provide more suitable ion transport channels. The carbon nanosheets can enhance the electronic conductivity and keep the integrity of the nanocomposites. MC-2 exhibits the highest specific capacitance of 381 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g, as well as superior cyclic stability with 92% capacitance retention over 3000 cycles in KOH electrolyte. The excellent electrochemical performance of MC-2 as supercapacitor electrode is attributed to the 3D/2D structure and the synergistic effects between MoS2 nanosheets and carbon nanosheets.
