A series of nitrogen-doped (N-doped) polymeric resin-derived porous carbons (NPCs) have been fabricated by a direct carbonization of the mixture of polymeric resin and potassium acetate. The polymeric resin serves as carbon and nitrogen precursor and potassium acetate as activation agent. The prepared carbons have a high specific surface area of 1946 m2 g−1 and high N content of approximately 6.37 at%. The NPC-700 sample exhibits a highest specific capacitance of 312 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in a three-electrode system in 7 M KOH. When tested with a two-electrode system, the optimal sample NPC-800 shows a good rate performance (capacitance retention of 73% in the range of 0.05 A g−1 to 20 A g−1) and high cycling stability (96.5% retention after 5000 cycles at 2 A g−1). The easy preparation and superior electrochemical performances render the NPCs a promising alternative electrode material for supercapacitor.
