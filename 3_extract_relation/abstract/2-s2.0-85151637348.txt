In the area of electrochemical energy storage technology, quasi-solid-state electrolytes (QSSEs) are recognized as emerging electrolytic materials. With improved packing and mechanically flexible features, QSSEs have demonstrated their supremacy in electrochemical energy-storing devices as an alternative to both liquid and solid electrolytes. It refers to a broad category of composite compounds that contain both the solid and liquid phases of various materials. Among all different types of energy storage techniques, batteries are the most common and advanced form of energy storage device, storing charges faradaically in a noncapacitive mode, whereas the pseudocapacitor, on other hand, operates with both faradaic and capacitive processes. The precise compositions of QSSEs for different electrochemical devices with improved stability, flexibility, and electrochemical performances have been studied in this chapter. A brief overview of QSSEâ€™s application, notably in electrochemical rechargeable batteries and pseudocapacitors, is offered here. Furthermore, the advantages of QSSEs in the electroactive performances of recent discoveries with hybrid energy storing devices that exhibit both battery and supercapacitor-like behaviors have been explored in this chapter, underlining their significance in future energy storage advances.
