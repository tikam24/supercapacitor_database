As first research work, lignin derived carbon (LDC) was chemically synthesized, then studied its effects on the supercapacitive properties of the POAP/ LDC composite, as an active martial, and then characterized by FE-SEM and BET methods. For significantly increasing the volumetric capacitance and achieving a synergistic effect, poly ortho aminophenol (POAP) was injected into the channels of LDC. POAP could be uniformly dispersed within the channels due to their high pore volume and surface area. Moreover, in addition to active pseudocapacitive function and facilitating energy storage, POAP could act as a proton transport media and promoter of protonation/deprotonation processes during the redox reactions in the channels. The values of 485 F/g at 1.0 A/g current density and 86% (as a good cycle stability) after 3000 cycles are obtained as the specific capacitance (Cs) and the retention rate of the initial capacity.
