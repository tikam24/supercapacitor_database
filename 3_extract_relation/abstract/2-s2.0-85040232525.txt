The demand for advanced energy storage devices such as supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries has been increasing to meet the application requirements of hybrid vehicles and renewable energy systems. Here, high energy density aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is assembled based on chestnut shell-based activated carbon (CAC)/PANI composite positive electrode and tungsten trioxide (WO3) nanowires negative electrode. The CAC/PANI composite and WO3 nanowires were synthesized through an interfacial polymerization method and a simple sodium sulfate assisted hydrothermal process, respectively. The CAC/PANI//WO3 ASC device operates with a voltage of 1.5 V in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte and achieved a high energy density of 15.4 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 252 W kg−1. Furthermore, the device shows an excellent cycling performance with capacitance retention of 83% after 1500 cycles.
