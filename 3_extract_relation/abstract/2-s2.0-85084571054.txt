Cobalt manganese hydroxides with well-defined nanowire morphology (CoMn-HW) is scalable fabricated by adjusting solution contents, Mn/Co ratio and alkaline species. To further improve the conductivity of CoMn-HW, GO is introduced during fabrication process and reduced to rGO according to the high temperature and alkali atmosphere. By optimizing the adding mass of rGO, CoMn-HW/rGO with sandwiched like structure is successfully synthesized for supercapacitor electrode. The composite delivers a high specific capacitance of 784 F g−1 at current density of 0.5 A g−1, good rate capability (84.2% capacitance retention after current density increase 10 times). Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor with CoMn-HW/rGO10 as the positive electrode and active carbon as the negative electrode, is assembled and delivers a maximum energy density of 38.3 Wh kg−1 and power density of 8000 W kg−1, representing its potential in energy storage and conversion systems.
