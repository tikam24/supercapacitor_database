The quest for developing the scalable methods of synthesis of materials with potential electrochemical energy storage applications remains a great challenge. Herein, we propose a facile, one-step chemical precipitation method for the synthesis of Bi2S3 with the nanorods morphology. Influence of different synthesis temperatures on the physical, chemical, and electrochemical performance was investigated. Relatively low BET surface area and mesopore volume of Bi2S3 increased with the higher reaction temperature. Bismuth sulfides synthesized at various temperatures were used as an electrode active material in supercapacitor. The semiconductive properties of Bi2S3 resulted in exceptional capacitive behavior. Bismuth sulfide synthesized at 75 °C exhibited a specific capacitance of 457 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in 6 mol L−1 KOH solution as an electrolyte. Moreover, material prepared at 75 °C maintained the best capacitance value at a large current density of 20 A g−1, compared with bismuth sulfides synthesized at the temperatures of 0 °C and 25 °C.
