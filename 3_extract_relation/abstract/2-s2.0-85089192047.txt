The charge storage performance of metal oxides as electrochemical supercapacitor electrodes is limited by their poor conductivity and limited operating potential window. Herein, we report on the oxygen-vacancy engineering of Ti−Mo−Ni−O nanotubes via hydrogen annealing to boost their capacitive performance. Hydrogen treatment of the nanotubes resulted in 110% increase in specific capacitance as compared to the air-annealed counterpart with excellent stability over 3700 cycles and an exceptional capacitance retention of 99%. The observed enhancement can be ascribed to the faradaic capacitance contribution from the several redox pairs of Nickel, Molybdenum, and Ti3+. This was further confirmed via the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements, revealing a drastic decrease in the internal resistance upon hydrogen treatment. We hope our demonstrated two-step interfacial engineering opens a new strategy to design high performance electrode materials for advanced electrochemical supercapacitors.
