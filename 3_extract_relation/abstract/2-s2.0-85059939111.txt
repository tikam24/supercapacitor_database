In this work, a series of Ni x Co 1−x Se 2 selenides are prepared with x ranging from 0 to 1 and investigated as electrode materials for supercapacitor. The sample Ni 0.6 Co 0.4 Se 2 shows 1580 and 1205 F g −1 at 1 and 20 A g −1 , respectively. At 10 A g −1 , 90% capacitance retention is sustained after 20,000 cycles. A Ni 0.6 Co 0.4 Se 2 -based asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is assembled and exhibits energy density of 44.1 and 36.8 Wh kg −1 at power density of 691.3 and 15070.6 W kg −1 and long stability. Systematic physicochemical/electrochemical analysis reveals that the high active MOOH (M = Ni, Co)/Ni 0.6 Co 0.4 Se 2 phases generated by electrooxidation act as the actual active materials during the charge storage/release process. The collective effects of large ion-accessible active area, high conductivity and electrochemically active MOOH (M = Ni, Co)/Ni 0.6 Co 0.4 Se 2 phases convincingly account for the remarkable performance, especially the excellent rate capability and stability.
