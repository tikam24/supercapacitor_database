The paper is concerned with description of the simulation model of the tram equipped by the energy storage system using supercapacitors. This paper is also concerned with the construction of the tram emulation with the energy storage system. The tram accumulates the kinetic energy into supercapacitors during vehicle braking. This energy can be used to accelerate the tram (in next). It is important to save the braking energy of the vehicle which accelerates very often. Â© 2013 University of West Bohemia.
