A novel hybridized phosphate is developed through a mild hydrothermal method to construct high performance asymmetric supercapacitor. Single layered (Ni,Co)3(PO4)2.8H2O nanoslices (âˆ¼ 1 nm) and single crystal (NH4)(Ni,Co)PO4.0.67H2O microplatelets are obtained through a template sacrificial method and dissolution recrystallization approach respectively in one step. This unique hybridized structure delivers a maximum specific capacitance of 1128 F g.1 at current density of 0.5 A g-1 The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) based on the hybrid exhibits a high energy density of 35.3 Wh kg-1 at low power density, and still holds 30.9 Wh kg-1 at 4400 W kg-1. Significantly, the ASC manifests very high cycling stability with 95.6% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles. Such excellent electrochemical performance could be attributed to the synergistic effect of the surface redox reaction from the ultrathin nanoslices and ion intercalation from the single crystal bulk structure. This material represents a novel kind of electrode material for the potential application in supercapacitors.
