Herein, a cheap, environmentally-friendly and degradable polyacrylonitrile coated by sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (PAN@SDBS) nanofibers membrane is prepared by coaxial electrospinning method and further used as a separator for supercapacitor. The self-discharge behavior is well suppressed by restraining the ion diffusion driven by concentration gradient without sacrificing electrochemical performance.
