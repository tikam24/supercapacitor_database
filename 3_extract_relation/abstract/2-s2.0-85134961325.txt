A hybrid supercapacitor exhibits excellent electrochemical properties due to its simultaneously high power and energy densities. However, the capacity under long hours will be greatly reduced. Therefore, this study develops a new type of Zn2+ ions hybrid supercapacitors (Zn-HSCs). The cathode of this device requires not only an ultra-high stability tunnel structure, but also high electrical conductivity. Thus, on the basis of the study of ZnxMnO2, an appropriate amount of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was doped and a new material (i.e., ZnxMnO2-CNTs) is formed. Zn-HSCs are based on ZnxMnO2-CNTs as the cathode, activated carbon (ACC) as the anode, and an aqueous liquid electrolyte, which significantly improves the cycling performance of the device. In addition, the proposed ZnxMnO2-CNTs has a high electrical conductivity suitable for the development of rechargeable ZnxMnO2-CNTs //ACC Zn-HSCs devices.
