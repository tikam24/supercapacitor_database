Zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSCs) have received widespread attention because of their advantages of high power density, long lifetime, low cost and environmental protection, but they restricted to the low energy density mainly caused by low specific capacitance of carbon electrode materials. Herein, we design and utilize a novel method to synthesis of zinc and nitrogen co-doped zinc-based metal-organic framework derived porous carbon (ZMDPC) materials through the binding of two ligands. The obtained carbon materials show excellent electrochemical properties with high specific capacitance and cycling stability due to the zinc and nitrogen co-doping, excellent pore structure and high specific surface area. As a result, ZHSCs assembled by the zinc and nitrogen co-doped porous carbon cathode and zinc metal anode demonstrate an high specific capacitance of 255.6 F g–1, high energy density of 90.88 Wh kg–1, outstanding cycle stability and excellent rate performance. Furthermore, the supercapacitor exhibited a capacity retention of 97.8% after 10,000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g–1. The development provides an attractive route to design porous carbon electrodes based on various two-dimensional nanomaterials.
