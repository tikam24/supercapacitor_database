This paper presents an active state-of-charge (SOC) balancing control strategy for modular super capacitor energy storage system (ESS). The strategy has a master-slave structure, including a common dc bus voltage loop and individual slave current loop for each submodule. The common voltage loop ensures the ability of the system to stabilize dc bus voltage cannot be affected by SOC balancing control, and provides a same original current reference for all submodules. SOC information is introduced into current loops to achieve SOC balancing control. The highest SOC is taken as a reference for low SOC modules, thus, the low SOC modules can regulate the submodule average operation current according to the SOC reference and their own SOC. In order to minimize system current deviation caused by the introduction of SOC, a current correction method is proposed to improve system current regulate performance. The proposed strategy can achieve SOC balancing control during ESS charging and discharging process dynamically, in addition, the modularity of the system is improved and the proposed strategy has favorable stability. A modular ESS prototype consisting of three half-bridge submodules is tested in the laboratory, and the experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.
