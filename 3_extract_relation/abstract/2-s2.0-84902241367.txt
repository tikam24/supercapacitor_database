Design and fabrication of high performance pseudocapacitors from 3D hierarchical hybrid electrodes with large areal capacitance and excellent rate capability still remains a challenge. Here, 3D hierarchical hybrid mesoporous NiCo2O4@CoxNi1-x(OH)2 core-shell nanosheet arrays on Ni foam have been rationally designed and facilely synthesized via an electrodeposited routine for pseudocapacitor applications. Electrochemical measurements show that the NiCo2O 4@Co0.33Ni0.67(OH)2 electrode material exhibits a large areal capacitance as high as 5.71 F cm-2 at a current density of ∼5.5 mA cm-2, as a result of our high mass loading up to ∼5.5 mg cm-2. Moreover, it exhibits an excellent rate capability (∼83.7% capacitance retention at 273 mA cm-2). Based on these excellent properties, an asymmetric supercapacitor based on 3D hierarchical hybrid mesoporous NiCo2O4@Co 0.33Ni0.67(OH)2 nanosheet arrays as the positive electrode and CMK-3 as the negative electrode was successfully fabricated. The as-fabricated device achieved the maximum areal capacitance of 887.5 mF cm-2 (specific capacitance of 87.9 F g-1) at 5 mA cm-2 with a stable operational voltage of 1.6 V and a high energy density of 31.2 W h kg-1 at a power density of 396 W kg-1. Moreover, two asymmetric supercapacitors in series could power 5 mm diameter red round light-emitting diode (LED) indicators efficiently for more than 5 minutes. The present 3D hierarchical hybrid material electrode with remarkable electrochemical properties has significant potential applications in high energy density storage systems. 2014 This journal is © the Partner Organisations.
