The practical applications of some advanced carbon nanomaterials in supercapacitors are still hampered by the resource scarcity and high cost. It arouses great interest to seek for ample and low-cost substitutes to meet the need of upcoming large-scale productions. The chemical conversion of renewable and abundant biomass provides a good opportunity for the economic and sustainable synthesis of carbon based electrode materials. In this work, activated ginkgo leaf-derived carbons were investigated as porous cheap biomass carbons with utility as supercapacitor electrode materials in the acid electrolyte. The influences of KOH-, ZnCl2-, and H3BO3-activations on the composition, morphology and performance of as-prepared carbons were studied and discussed. Benefiting from the superior electrochemical activity endowed by the hierarchical nano-architecture and abundant oxygen-containing groups, the as-obtained KOH-activated ginkgo leaf-derived carbon material exhibited the best specific capacitance (374F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1) relative to pristine carbon, ZnCl2-, and H3BO3-activated carbons. And this KOH-activated ginkgo leaf-derived carbon in the two-electrode configuration also demonstrated satisfactory specific capacitance (272F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1) and cycling reliability. Moreover, these performances also outperform those of some similar carbon materials.
