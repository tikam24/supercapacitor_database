In this paper, we used cyclic voltammetry method to prepare manganese dioxide with different scanning rates of voltage on a three-dimensional porous nickel foam substrate. We systematically studied the influence of the scanning rate of electrodeposition on the morphology, structure, and electrochemical performance of the sample. According to the electrochemical performance, we found the optimal electrodeposition parameters, and the electrode prepared under this condition has a high specific capacitance (458 F g−1 and 286 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1 and 10 A g−1) and low impedance.
