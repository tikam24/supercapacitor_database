P-doped multi-metal oxide is an effective method to improve its electrochemical energy storage performance. Herein, a novel P-doped ternary metal oxide (P-Ni0.5Cu0.5Co2O4) with a yolk-shell hollow structure is reasonably prepared and used as electrode material for supercapacitors. The as-prepared electrode has significantly improved conductivity and capacity, with a high specific capacitance of 1570.2F g−1 in a three-electrode system. Furthermore, the as-assembled P-Ni0.5Cu0.5Co2O4//activated carbon supercapacitor possesses an ultra-high energy density of 118.6 W h kg−1 and stable cyclic performance.
