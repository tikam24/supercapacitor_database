Nitrogen-rich carbon nanospheres (NCNs) with a uniform low diameter (< 50 nm) and high specific surface area (SSA, 455 m2 g−1) have synthesized by a simple and facile soft-template strategy by carbonizing polyaniline-co-polypyrrole (PACPP) nanospheres which have further synthesized by polymerization/self-assembly of aniline and pyrrole under ice-cold conditions. The synthesized NCNs are confirmed by using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). The existence of numerous nitrogen-oxygen functionalities is affirmed by X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). These uniquely-synthesized NCNs deliver a good electrochemical response at 1 A g−1 with a maximum specific capacitance (Cs) of 156 F g−1. The NCNs electrode has possessed an extraordinary retention rate ability of 62.2% over 5 A g−1. Exclusive investigation research provides an ideal route for synthesizing NCNs for numerous applications in medicine, environment, particularly for high energy storage/conversion aspects as well as further applicable to other materials.
