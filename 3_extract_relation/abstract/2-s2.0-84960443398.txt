ZnO quantum dots (QDs) are anchored on graphene oxide (GO) by a wet chemical self-assembling technique. Firstly, GO are functionalized with thiol(f-GO) by a series of chemical reactions and the ZnO alcogel are prepared by a sol-gel process. Secondly, the f-GO/ZnO composite is obtained by a self-assembling technique. Typically, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and EDS spectrum are employed to characterize the structure, morphology and composition of the obtained samples, moreover, the electrochemical performance of the as-prepared electrode is also detected by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge experiments. It is found that the f-GO/ZnO-1 possesses the highest specific values of 149.4F/g and good long-term cycle stability. The results show that the f-GO/ZnO nanocomposite could be used as electrode material for high performance supercapacitors.
