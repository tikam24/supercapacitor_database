In this work, a modified Bosch etching process is developed to create silicon nanowires. Au nanoparticles (NPs) formed by magnetron sputtering film deposition and thermal annealing were employed as the hard mask to achieve controllable density and high aspect ratios. Such silicon nanowire exhibits the excellent anti-reflection ability of a reflectance value of below 2% within a broad light wave range between 220 and 1100 nm. In addition, Au NPs-induced surface plasmons significantly enhance the near-unity anti-reflection characteristics, achieving a reflectance below 3% within the wavelength range of 220 to 2600 nm. Furthermore, the nanowire array exhibits super-hydrophobic behavior with a contact angle over ~165.6â—¦ without enforcing any hydrophobic chemical treatment. Such behavior yields in water droplets bouncing off the surface many times. These properties render this silicon nanowire attractive for applications such as photothermal, photocatalysis, supercapacitor, and microfluidics.
