This paper presents a theoretical comparison between fuel cell (FC) power train and conventional petrol driven propulsion system. FC has potential to reduce the CO2-emissions from road. However, FC power trains require energy storing device, to meet the peak power during extreme drive situations and also able to recover the kinetic energy of the vehicle during break operation. The proposed system includes a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) based drive train and a super capacitor connected in parallel. The system is designed and dimensioned for a conventional petrol driven propulsion system of the Mercedes B-Class160. The feasibility study also includes comparison between the existing conventional systems. It is shown that although FC power train is heavier compared to existing system, urban performance is better and produces no CO2 and other harmful emissions.
