This paper proposes a high-efficiency ultracapacitor charger using a soft-switching full-bridge pulse-width modulated (PWM) converter. Conventional full-bridge phase-shift modulated (PSM) converter is used for charging ultracapacitors. However, the power efficiency of conventional converters is low because of its circulating current and high output diode voltage stresses. This study presents a high-efficiency full-bridge PWM converter to overcome the drawbacks of conventional converters. The proposed converter has the advantages of lower switch voltage stresses and reduced circulating current compared to other converter topologies. The performance of the proposed converter is evaluated by experimental results for a 54-V, 35-F ultracapacitor bank.
