A highly flexible NiTe/Ni@CC electrode material for supercapacitor is fabricated via a two-step approach including electroplating and in situ growth.X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and electrochemical workstation are employed for the characterization and analysis of NiTe/Ni@CC electrode material. It is shown that the electrode material has a CC-Ni-NiTe hierarchical structure.As the current density is 5 mA•cm-2, the areal specific capacitance of the electrode reaches 2.85 F•cm-2. NiTe/Ni@CC//AC/CC all-solid-state flexible supercapacitor assembled by this electrode can provide an area energy density as high as 0.50 mWh•cm-2 at an area power density of 5.57 mW•cm-2, and has a capacitance retention rate of 77.20% after 2, 000 bending cycles from 0° to 90°.
