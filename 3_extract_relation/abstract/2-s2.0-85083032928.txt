Hybrid supercapacitors have recently emerged as next-generation energy storage devices that bridge the gap between supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries. However, developing high energy cathodes that maintain long-term cycle stability and a high rate capability for real applications remains a significantly challenging issue. Herein, we report a facile synthesis method for a laser-scribed graphene/LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 (LSG/NMC) composite for high energy cathode materials for use in hybrid supercapacitors. LSG/NMC composites exhibit not only a high capacitance of up to 141.5 F/g but also an excellent capacitance retention of 98.1% after 1000 cycles at a high current density of 5.0 A/g. The introduction of an NMC spacer between the LSG layers provides an enlarged interspace that can act as an efficient channel for additional storage sites and rapid access. In addition, we further confirmed that hybrid supercapacitors using LSG/NMC cathodes and H2T12O25 anodes with an AlPO4/carbon hybrid coating layer (H-HTO) deliver a remarkable energy density of ~123.5 Wh/kg, power density of ~14074.8 W/kg, and a long-term cycle stability of 94.6% after 20,000 cycles. This work demonstrates that our proposed material can be considered a strong cathode candidate for next-generation hybrid supercapacitors.
