This paper is concerned with supercapacitors (electrochemical capacitors) and their applications in electric home appliances and smartphones in place of or in combination with batteries. Supercapacitors are advantageously positioned between batteries and capacitors in the electronic component taxonomy. Here, we recorded a facile two-step method for fabricating honeycomb like NiMoO 4 @NiWO 4 nanocomposites on Ni foam as electrode for high performance electrochemical supercapacitor applications. We synthesized NiMoO 4 @NiWO 4 nanocomposite electrode for supercapacitors to give a power supply to home appliances and smartphones. A single supercapacitor can store far more energy than a conventional capacitor with a solid dielectric. They can store sufficient energy for the appliances and have several advantages, including their ability to turn on instantaneously, charge quickly, and require less complicated charging circuits.
