In this work, the extraordinary properties of CuO addition on the morphology and supercapacitive performance of Mn2O3 electrodes were demonstrated. Concisely, CuO/Mn2O3 thin films were prepared by an easy and inexpensive successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. The prepared thin films were characterized by various sophisticated physiochemical systems. The results demonstrated formation of Mn2O3 thin films with noteworthy morphological alteration upon introduction of CuO. Furthermore, a significant effect of CuO introduction was observed on the electrocatalytic properties of the nanostructured Mn2O3 electrodes. At 3% CuO doping, the Mn2O3 electrodes displayed the maximum specific capacitance owing to formation of nanoplate-like structures. The enhanced specific capacitance attained for 3% CuO doping in the Mn2O3 electrode was 500 F/g at 5 mV/s in a 3 M KOH electrolyte. All results confirmed the plausible potential of the CuO/Mn2O3 electrode for supercapacitor applications.
