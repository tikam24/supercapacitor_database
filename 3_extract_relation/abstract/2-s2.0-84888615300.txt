Unique layered NH4CoPO4·H2O microbundles consisting of one-dimensional layered microrods are firstly synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. As a result of novel layered structures, there are many nanolayered channels for the diffusion of ions and electrolytes. The preliminary supercapacitor investigation indicates that the specific capacitance of layered NH4CoPO4·H 2O microbundle electrodes reaches up to 662 F g-1 at a current density of 1.5 A g-1 and remains at 520 F g-1 even at 15.0 A g-1. The cycle test shows excellent cycling performance of layered NH4CoPO4·H2O microbundle electrodes (the retention 92.7% of initial specific capacitance after 3000 cycles). © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
