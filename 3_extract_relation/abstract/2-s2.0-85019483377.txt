In this research article, we report hybrid nanomaterials of copper hydroxide/copper oxide (Cu(OH)2/CuO). A thin films were prepared by using a facile and cost-effective successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. As-synthesized and hybrid Cu(OH)2/CuO with two different surfactants polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and triton-X 100 (TRX-100) was prepared having distinct morphological, structural, and supercapacitor properties. The surface of the thin film samples were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A nanoflower-like morphology of the Cu(OH)2/CuO nanostructures arranged vertically was evidenced on the stainless steel substrate. The surface was well covered by nanoflake-like morphology and formed a uniform Cu(OH)2/CuO nanostructures after treating with surfactants. X-ray diffraction patterns were used to confirm the hybrid phase of Cu(OH)2/CuO materials. The electrochemical properties of the pristine Cu(OH)2/CuO, PVA:Cu(OH)2/CuO, TRX-100:Cu(OH)2/CuO films were observed by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technique. The electrochemical examination reveals that the Cu(OH)2/CuO electrode has excellent specific capacitance, 292, 533, and 443 Fgâˆ’1 with pristine, PVA, and TRX-100, respectively in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution. The cyclic voltammograms (CV) of Cu(OH)2/CuO electrode shows positive role of the PVA and TRX-100 to enhance supercapacitor performance.
