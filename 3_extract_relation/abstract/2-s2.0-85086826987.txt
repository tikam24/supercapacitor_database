A promising approach is proposed for the efficient conversion of soy sauce residue (SSR) into aromatic hydrocarbons and a supercapacitor electrode material by ex situ catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) technology with HZSM-5. The thermal decomposition behaviors of SSR were first investigated via thermogravimetry (TG) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) analyses. The ex situ CFP of SSR was conducted to elucidate the aromatic hydrocarbons production under different pyrolysis temperatures and HZSM-5-to-SSR (HZ-to-SSR) ratios using both Py-GC/MS and lab-scale instruments. The results indicated that the aromatic hydrocarbons reached the maximal yields of 22.20 wt% from Py-GC/MS with an HZ-to-SSR ratio of 11 at 650 Â°C, and 17.61 wt% from the lab-scale device with an HZ-to-SSR ratio of 2, respectively. The as-obtained yield of aromatic hydrocarbons was far higher than those obtained from typical lignocellulosic biomass materials, confirming that SSR is a promising material for aromatics production. The pyrolytic solid product collected with this method was further activated by KOH to synthesize N-doped activated carbon (NAC) for supercapacitors. The physicochemical analysis showed that NAC possessed N-incorporated hierarchical pores, and exhibited a promising capacitance of 274.5 F g-1 at 1 A g-1
