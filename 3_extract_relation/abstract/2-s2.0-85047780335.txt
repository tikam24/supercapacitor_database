The rapid development of personal electronics imposes a great challenge on sustainable and maintenance-free power supplies. The integration of nanogenerators (NG) and electrochromic supercapacitors (SC) offers a promising solution to efficiently convert mechanical energy to stored electrical energy in a predictable and noticeable manner. In this paper, by integrating hybrid NGs and electrochromic micro-SCs (µ-SCs) array, the authors demonstrate a smart self-charging power package capable of indicating the charging state with color change. The electrochromic µ-SC employs Ag nanowires/NiO as electrode materials, exhibiting high capacitance (3.47 mF cm−2) and stable cycling performance (80.7% for 10000 cycles). The hybrid NG can produce a high output voltage of 150 V and an enhanced output current of 20 µA to satisfy the self-charging requirements. The integrated electrochromic µ-SCs array is capable of self-charging to 3 V to light up a LED under human palm impact. The charging states can be estimated according to the color differences with the naked eye during the self-charging process. Moreover, it is possible to design the planar interdigitated electrodes into different shapes according to user demand. The proposed simple and cost-effective approaches for smart self-charging power package may pave the way for future intelligent, independent and continuous operation of daily electronics.
