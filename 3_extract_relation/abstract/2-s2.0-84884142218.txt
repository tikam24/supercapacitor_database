The operating temperatures of current electrochemical energy storage devices are limited due to electrolyte degradation and separator instability at higher temperatures. Here we demonstrate that a tailored mixture of materials can facilitate operation of supercapacitors at record temperatures, as high as 200 C. Composite electrolyte/separator structures made from naturally occurring clay and room temperature ionic liquids, with graphitic carbon electrodes, show stable supercapacitor performance at 200 C with good cyclic stability. Free standing films of such high temperature composite electrolyte systems can become versatile functional membranes in several high temperature energy conversion and storage applications.
