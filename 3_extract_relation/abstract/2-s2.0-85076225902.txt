A uniform dry leaf-like mesoporous MoSe2 nanostructure was successfully synthesized via a microwave-assisted method. The MoSe2 nanostructure was optimized by maintaining the microwave reaction at 160 °C for 25 min. The mesoporous nanostructured MoSe2 was employed as an electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution from water splitting. The MoSe2 with the novel mesoporous nanostructure led to a superior hydrogen evolution reaction with a small Tafel incline of 58 mV dec−1 and remarkable long-term durability. The leaf-like mesoporous MoSe2 electrode achieved a capacitance of 257.38 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with remarkable cyclic stability for 5000 cycles.
