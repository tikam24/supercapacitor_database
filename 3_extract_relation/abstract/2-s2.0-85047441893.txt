The electrochemical property of ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) can be changed significantly due to the incorporating of electron-donating heteroatoms into OMC. Here, we demonstrate the successful fabrication of nitrogen-doped ordered mesoporous carbon (NOMC) materials to be used as carbon substrates for loading polyaniline (PANI) by in situ polymerization. Compared with NOMC, the PANI/NOMC prepared with a different mass ratio of PANI and NOMC exhibits remarkably higher electrochemical specific capacitance. In a typical three-electrode configuration, the hybrid has a specific capacitance about 276.1 F/g at 0.2 A/g with a specific energy density about 38.4 Wh/kg. What is more, the energy density decreases very slowly with power density increasing, which is a different phenomenon from other reports. PANI/NOMC materials exhibit good rate performance and long cycle stability in alkaline electrolyte (~ 80% after 5000 cycles). The fabrication of PANI/NOMC with enhanced electrochemical properties provides a feasible route for promoting its applications in supercapacitors.
