Brain-implanted stimulators are revolutionizing treatment of many neurological and psychiatric diseases, but still rely on temporary batteries for power, which require periodic replacements. Battery-free, self-sustainable deep brain stimulation (DBS) devices remain an unsolved challenge. Herein, we report a self-sustainable, battery-free, intermittent DBS system. This device is enabled by interfacing a high-performance bio-triboelectric nanogenerator (Bio-TENG) as an energy harvester with bio-supercapacitors as fast-charging energy storage units to intermittently drive a DBS pulse generator. The Bio-TENG acts as a smart breathing sensor and biomechanical energy harvester using the inhalation and exhalation motions of an inflated swine lung to charge bio-supercapacitors, which drive the pulse generator to stimulate neurons in mouse hippocampus tissues ex vivo. An intra-electrode triboelectrification strategy is used to boost the Bio-TENG power output. This sustainable intermittent power approach may provide a strategy for powering brain-machine bioelectronics.
