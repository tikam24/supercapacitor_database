The development of polymer gel electrolyte system with high ionic conductivity is the main objective of polymer research. Electrochemical devices based on lithium ionconducting polymer electrolyte are not safe due to the explosive nature of lithium. An attempt has been made to synthesize magnesium ion-conducting polymeric gel electrolytes, poly (vinylidene fluoride-co- hexafluoropropylene)-propylene carbonate-magnesium perchlorate, PVdF(HFP)-PC- Mg(ClO 4) 2 using standard solution-cast techniques. The maximum room temperature ionic conductivity of the synthesized electrolyte system has been observed to be 5.0×10 -3 S cm -1, which is quite acceptable from a device fabrication point of view. The temperature-dependent conductivity and the dielectric behavior were also analyzed. The pattern of the temperature-dependent conductivity shows the Arrhenius behavior. The dielectric constantε r and dielectric loss ε i increases with temperature in the low-frequency region but almost negligible in the high-frequency region. This behavior can be explained on the basis of electrode polarization effects. The real part M r and imaginary part M i versus frequency indicate that the systems are predominantly ionic conductors. Further, the synthesized electrolyte materials have been checked for its suitability in energy storage devices namely redox supercapacitor with conducting polymer polypyrrole as electrode materials, and finally, it was observed that it shows good capacitive behavior in low-frequency region. Preliminary studies show that the overall capacitance of 22 mF cm -2 which is equivalent to a single electrode specific capacitance of 117 F gm -1 was observed for the above said supercapacitors. © Springer-Verlag 2012.
