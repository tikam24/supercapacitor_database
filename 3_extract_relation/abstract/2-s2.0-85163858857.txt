Molybdenum disulfide as a supercapacitor material has attracted great attention owing to its low price and high theoretical capacity. However, the low conductivity and relatively few active sites restrict its practical application. In this work, a 3D bacterial cellulose intercalated MoS2@rGO nanocomposite is fabricated via the freeze-drying method and an in situ carbonization process. The BC can prevent the stacking of rGO and expose more electrochemical active sites. Benefitting from the synergistic effect of BC and rGO, the prepared MoS2@rGO@CF-2 displays a high specific capacitance of 345 F g−1 at the current density of 0.5 A g−1
