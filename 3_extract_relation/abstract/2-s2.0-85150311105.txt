In current study, we report the hydrothermal synthesis of highly electroactive bismuth trichloride (Bi2S3) polyhedrons, modified with multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The physiochemical characterizations of pure Bi2S3 and Bi2S3@MWCNTs composite were carried out through X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). XRD data revealed orthorhombic crystal structure of Bi2S3 having crystallite size of ∼13.23 nm, that got reduced to ∼10.81 for Bi2S3@MWCNTs composite. Polyhedral Bi2S3 showed some tendency to aggregate after fabricating with MWCNTs. Functional group analysis confirmed the formation of Bi–S bonds through multiple metal-sulfide bonding vibrations in the finger print region (880–550 cm−1). For electrochemical tests, Bi2S3/NF and Bi2S3@MWCNTs/NF were applied as electrodes. Due to the synergistic effects from highly conductive MWCNTs and pseudo-active Bi2S3, as prepared Bi2S3@MWCNTs/NF exhibited a significant enhancement in electrochemical response. The specific capacity of Bi2S3@MWCNTs/NF was measured as 625.1 C g−1, that was ∼1.45 times greater than that of non-fabricated Bi2S3 polyhedrons. Additionally, Bi2S3@MWCNTs/NF delivered a better charge/discharge efficiency. The values of RES (2.25 Ω) and RCT (3.54 Ω) prominently decreased for Bi2S3@MWCNTs/NF due to low internal and diffusional resistance.
