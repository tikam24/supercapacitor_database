The utility of Super Capacitors has been widely used in the aspect of hybrid energy management which is applied together with energy storage systems into batteries through active regulation schemes. The availability of battery energy in a solar power generation system will determine the performance of providing electrical energy, especially for loading. The way to adjust the additional hybrid storage in this study includes the sensitivity of the battery voltage and the type of load so that there is no sudden decrease in battery capacity due to the loading issue. This study aims to develop a system for regulating the supply of electrical energy through the help of fuzzy logic computing using a microcontroller as the based setting between the battery circuit and the supercapacitor module also connected to a DC-DC converter. The system was tested with 3W and 8W loads which have a computational difference point of 0.812 and 0.196 having the capability of supplying the energy system to the load according to the lowest voltage level rules.
