The aim of this paper is to present the practical control structure (PCS) and energy management strategy of a testbed hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). This vehicle is equipped with batteries, a supercapacitor system, and a fuel cell system (FCS). The PCS, based on the energetic macroscopic representation methodology, is used to evaluate and compare the different energy management strategies to be implemented in the vehicle. This paper introduces a dynamic strategy to manage the energy in the hybrid electric vehicle; this strategy uses a fuzzy logic controller and considers the slow dynamics in the FCS, the vehicle speed, and the state of charge in the supercapacitors.
