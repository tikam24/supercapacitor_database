The fascinating features of 2D nanomaterials for various applications have prompted increasing research into single and few-layer metal dichalcogenides nanosheets using improved nanofabrication and characterization techniques. MoS2 has recently been intensively examined among layered metal dichalcogenides and other diverse transition metal-based materials, that have previously been studied in various applications. In this research, we report mixed-phase Mn-doped MoS2 nanoflowers for supercapacitor performance studies. The confirmation of the successfully prepared Mn-doped MoS2 nanoflowers was characterized by XRD, SEM-EDS, RAMAN, and BET research techniques. The mixed-phase of the as-synthesized electrode material was confirmed by the structural changes observed in the XRD and RAMAN studies. The surface area from the BET measurement was calculated to be 46.0628 m2/g, and the adsorption average pore size of the electrode material was 11.26607 nm. The electrochemical performance of the Mn-doped MoS2 electrode material showed a pseudo-capacitive behavior, with a specific capacitance of 70.37 Fg−1, and with a corresponding energy density of 3.14 Whkg−1 and a power density of 4346.35 Wkg−1. The performance of this metal-doped MoS2-based supercapacitor device can be attributed to its mixed phase, which requires further optimization in future works.
