This article reviews selected literatures from the authors' research group on the development of capacitive electrochemical energy storage (EES) devices, focusing on supercapacitors and supercapatteries at both the electrode material level and device level. Electronically conducting polymers (ECPs) and transition metal oxides (TMOs) composited with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were found to be able to improve the capacitance performance as capacitive faradaic storage electrode. Carbon materials, like activated carbon (Act-C) and carbon black, were used to fabricate non-faradaic capacitive storage electrode. It was found that the electrode capacitance balance can effectively extend the maximum charging voltage (MCV) of the supercapacitor, and hence, to enhance the energy capacity of this capacitive EES device. The MCV of this kind of device can also be multiplied by bipolarly stacking the su-percapacitors to meet the high voltage demand from the power device. Supercapatteries that take advantages of both capacitive and faradaic charge storage mechanisms have been proposed and demonstrated to achieve the high power capability of supercapacitors and the large storage capacity of batteries.
