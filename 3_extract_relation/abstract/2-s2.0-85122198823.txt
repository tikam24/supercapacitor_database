Aqueous supercapacitors (SCs) attracted widespread attention owing to the advantages of high power density, low-cost, safety and environmental friendliness. However, the improvement of energy density is restricted by low cell voltage. Herein, a uniform MnO2 layer-modified activated carbon cloth (ACC-MnO2) is constructed by controlling the deposited time of MnO2 via a self-limiting electroless deposition process. The targeted flexible electrode exhibits optimal areal capacitance of 423.7 mF/cm2 at 0.5 mA/cm2 and also shows excellent cycle stability ~ 81% of its original value after 10 000 cycles scanned at 100 mV/s. Moreover, the flexible quasi-solid-state asymmetric SCs (FQSASCs) are assembled based on ACC-MnO2 as a flexible positive electrode, ACC as a flexible negative electrode, and PVA-LiCl as a gel electrolyte. The FQSASCs possess an extended voltage up to 2.0 V, show extremely excellent cycle stability (maintaining over 100% capacitance retention value after 5000 cycles at 10 mA/cm2), deliver excellent energy density (0.78 mWh/cm3) and power density (71.86 mW/cm3), and also exhibit superior mechanical properties (keeping over 100% of its initial capacitance after bending at 180Â° for 500 cycles). FQSASCs reveal potential applications as a candidate in flexible electronic devices.
