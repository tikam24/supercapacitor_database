The usage of composites with chalcogenides and hydroxides are fascinated prodigious consideration for supercapacitor application. In this work, the layer by layer assembly of MnS@Ni(OH)2 core-shell hybrids were prepared by facile electrodeposition method and utilized as a binder-free electrode material for symmetric supercapacitor application. Systematic analyses have been done to confirms the formation and morphological features of MnS@Ni(OH)2 core-shell hybrids. The core-shell hybrids of MnS@Ni(OH)2 exhibits the redox behavior and delivered a high specific capacity of 2612 F g­1 at a current density of 1 A g­1 with excellent cycle stability of 88% capacity retention over 5000th cycle in 3 M KOH electrolyte. The delivered specific capacity is the highest among MnS and Ni(OH) based supercapacitors and also higher than various types of other metal oxide-based supercapacitors. Moreover, a sandwich-like solid-state symmetric supercapacitor was fabricated using MnS@Ni(OH)2 core-shell hybrid, and thus provided the specific capacity of 168.75 F g­1 at a current density of 1 A g­1 with the energy and power density of 60 Wh kg−1 and 800 W kg−1, respectively. The attained results recommended that the MnS@Ni(OH)2 core-shell hybrid has the probability to be applied as a novel, robust, and low-cost electrode material for supercapacitor energy storage devices.
