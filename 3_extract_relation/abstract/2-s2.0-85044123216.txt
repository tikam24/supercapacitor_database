Graphene based supercapacitors are being developed as potential devices for large scale energy storage applications with physical flexibility, because of their low cost and high electrochemical performance. This paper is mainly focused on the preparation of pure Bi2O3 and graphene / Bi2O3 based nanocomposite materials via sol–gel method and their physical / electrochemical characterization towards application in supercapacitors. The physical characterization like crystallinity, structure, morphological studies etc. were carried out by XRD, FTIR, SEM, EDAX and HR-TEM techniques. The capacitance behaviour of the prepared electrode materials was examined by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge and impedance analysis respectively. Among the two samples studied, Bi2O3/graphene nanocomposite electrode material has exhibited higher specific capacitance of 136.76 Fg−1, which is much higher than the specific capacitance of pure Bi2O3 based electrode (81.03 Fg−1). Moreover, the synthesized nanocomposite electrode material has exhibited good cyclic stability (>95% over 1000 cycles) which may lead to applications in high-performance energy storage devices such as super capacitors.
