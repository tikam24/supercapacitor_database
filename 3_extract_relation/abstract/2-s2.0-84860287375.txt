Novel activated carbon has been prepared from tea seed shell by activation with K 2CO 3. The porosity of the activitated carbon sample was studied by the nitrogen adsorption at 77 K. The supercapacitors were assembled with carbon electrode and electrolyte of 6 mol/L KOH solution. Their electrochemical properties were investigated by galvanostatic charge/discharge, cyclic voltammogram and impedance spectrum. The results show that the specific surface area of the activated carbon is sharply increased after activation, the value is up to 1272 m 2/g, and the electrochemical performance is obviously improved, the specific capacitance is up to 150 F/g, which suggests that it may be promising candidates for supercapacitors.
