Recently, the batteries deliver great discharging efficiency, but the capability extremely reduces the discharging effectiveness as the load current rises. This paper presented an advanced controller for multiple-input bidirectional DCâ€“DC power converter (MIPC) in hybrid energy storage system (HESS). The supercapacitor (SC) association with battery is called as HESS. The projected system is utilized as an advanced controller for MIPC. The modeling of the proposed system is designed by MIPC, DC sources, HESS, and the controller. The controlling process is utilized with MIPC process, and the input is produced from the HESS. To achieve the optimal output load voltage maintained as constant output load voltage at any nonlinear condition is the novelty of the paper. The MATLAB/Simulink platform was utilized for simulating the proposed system. The simulation results are developed for proposed controller for two-input bidirectional converter for sudden change in photovoltaic (PV) generation and load demand.
