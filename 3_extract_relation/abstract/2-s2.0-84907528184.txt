For the first time, we proposed the proof-of-principle of a new concept of ionic supercapacitor systems on the basis of the system- and ion-level design. In this system, multiple-valence metal cations can be transformed to electroactive colloids in alkaline electrolyte, which can perfectly participate in Faradaic reactions. The design of ionic-state colloid electrode, which consists of electroactive cationic media within the whole colloids, can represent a new promising strategy to increase the energy density of pseudocapacitors without the compromise of power and lifetime performances. Therefore, high power density and energy density can be achieved in the designed ionic pseudocapacitor systems. This novel concept of ionic supercapacitor systems by ion- and system-level planning can open a new direction for the development of the next-generation of high-performance supercapacitors.
