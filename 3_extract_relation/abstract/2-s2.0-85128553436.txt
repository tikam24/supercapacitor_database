In this work, an adaptive power management algorithm is developed for a multi-source dc microgrid system. The proposed algorithm is tested with a dc microgrid system consisting of PV, wind, batteries, supercapacitors, and variable load. The PV and wind energy systems are operated in maximum power point tracking mode to extract maximum energy from the available wind power and solar irradiation. The proposed algorithm has considered wide variation in weather conditions like zero wind velocity, zero solar irradiation, wind gust, and dynamic load change at the dc bus. For these cases, the proposed algorithm maintains the dc bus voltage constant without using a communication link. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is tested using MATLAB-Simulink. Also, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are validated using OPAL-RT control platform-based experimental studies.
