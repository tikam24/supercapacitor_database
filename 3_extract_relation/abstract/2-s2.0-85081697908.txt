Birnessite-Type MnO2 materials are widely studied as electrodes for pseudocapacitors. However, the poor cycling stability limits their applications. Here, wrinkle birnessite-Type MnO2 nanosheet array has been synthesized and taken as an example to discover the reason of capacity fading for pseudocapacitors. It is discovered that in the the galvanostatic charge-discharge process, the smalle nanosheets blocking the macropores of the array framework have been dissolved and recrystallized on the large wrinkle birnessite nanosheet array framework, finally forming a hierarchical structure of nanosheets@nanosheets of birnessite. The recrystallizaion of the small birnessite nanosheets may decrease the specific capacity through the decreasement of the surface area of the electrode.
