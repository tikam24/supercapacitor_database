Four cobalt-based complexes (C26H18ClCoN4O9, namely trans-O,O-1; C26H19CoN4O10, namely trans-O,O-2; C26H18CoN5O12, namely cis-O,O-1; C26H18CoN5O12, namely cis-O,O-2) were prepared by facial hydrothermal methods combined with the double ligands (Pda = pyridine 2,5-dicarboxylic acid, Phen = 1,10-phenanthroline) using different cobalt salts. Among these complexes, trans-O,O-1 and trans-O,O-2 are heterogeneous isomorphisms whose structures are identical with similar cell parameters and the same P-1 space group, while cis-O,O-1 and cis-O,O-2 are isomers which have the same molecular formula but different structures. The elemental oxidation states and complex structures were confirmed via X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) and single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD). The synthesis process and the structure of the mesophases were analyzed. Furthermore, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and ultraviolet–visible spectrum analysis (UV–vis) were applied to characterize the products. Afterwards, trans-O,O-1 was selected and calcined under a flow of nitrogen showing that mesoporous composite structures (C(N,Cl)/CoO/Co) were formed when trans-O,O-1 was calcined at 500 ℃, which were further used as electrode materials for supercapacitors. The electrochemical performance of the mesoporous composite structures showed a high specific capacitance of 700F·g−1 in 6 M KOH solution at a current density of 1 A·g−1, and retained well after 2000 cycles at 20 A·g−1 current density.
