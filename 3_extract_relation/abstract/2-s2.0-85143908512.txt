Supercapattery is a hybrid renewable device that stores a significant amount of energy and delivers sufficient power together. In this paper, we used the hydrothermal technique for the synthesis of nickel-manganese sulfide (NiMnS) and carbon nanotube (CNT)-incorporated nickel-manganese sulfide (NiMnS/CNT). The surface and structural analyses were done using SEM and XRD. In a three-cell arrangement, NiMNS delivered the specific capacity of 685 Cg−1 at the current density of 1.9 Ag−1. The incorporation of CNT into NiMnS significantly improves the storage capacity. The NiMnS75/CNT25 composite delivered the specific capacity of 1188 Cg−1 at the current density of 2.8 Ag−1. The supercapattery device was designed using NiMnS75/CNT25 as the anode while activated carbon as the cathode. The supercapattery (NiMnS75/CNT25//AC) demonstrates an outstanding specific capacity of 105.9 Cg−1 at the current density of 0.6 Ag−1. The device (NiMnS75/CNT25//AC) provided a high power density of 1600.8 WKg−1 at an energy density of 9 WhKg−1. These results suggest NiMnS75/CNT25 as a more suitable electrode material for supercapattery applications. Graphical Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
