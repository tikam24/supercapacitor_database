Reduced graphene oxide (RGO) flexible film pillared with lignosulfonate (LS) and carbon microspheres (CM) was fabricated via a facile vacuum-filtration process to serve as a high-performance electrode material for supercapacitors. Composite electrodes comprising graphene and biomass materials have the advantages of being flexible, lightweight, cheap, and environmentally friendly. The addition of LS and CM between the RGO layers mitigated the self-restacking of reduced graphene oxide flakes. Composite film electrode displayed a high specific capacitance of 641 mF cm-2 at 0.2 mA cm-2, which was much higher than that of the RGO film (117.9 mF cm-2). The present findings indicate a great potential of the graphene films composited with biomass materials in fabricating flexible supercapacitor electrodes.
