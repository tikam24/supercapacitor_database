PbO2 thin films were prepared by pulse current technique on Ti substrate from Pb(NO3)2 plating solution. The hybrid supercapacitor was designed with PbO2 thin film as positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as negative electrode in the 5.3 M H2SO4 solution. Its electrochemical properties were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV), charge-discharge test and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results revealed that the PbO2/AC hybrid supercapacitor exhibited large specific capacitance, high-power and stable cycle performance. In the potential range of 0.8-1.8 V, the hybrid supercapacitor can deliver a specific capacitance of 71.5 F g-1 at a discharge current density of 200 mA g-1(4 mA cm-2) when the mass ratio of AC to PbO2 was three, and after 4500 deep cycles, the specific capacitance remains at 64.4 F g-1, or 32.2 Wh Kg-1 in specific energy, and the capacity only fades 10% from its initial value.
