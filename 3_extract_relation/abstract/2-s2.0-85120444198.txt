Poly-vinyl alcohol (PVA)-based electrolytes can play a vital role in the development of supercapacitors by providing a desirable charge separator layer with an added advantage of stretchable nature. These properties enable them as a global contender in wearable electronics and charge storage applications. In this study, the PVA-based electrolyte has been synthesized with potassium hydro-oxide (KOH) as ionic migration agent, which may enhance the electronic double-layers capacitance (EDLC) phenomena. In order to mechanically strengthen the graphene-based activated carbon, larger pore fabric is utilized for its encapsulation. Post-fabrication analysis of the supercapacitor using the standard imaging/microscopy techniques (scanning electron microscopy, electron-dispersive electroscope, and atomic force microscopy) are carried out as initial diagnostic test. For detailed electrical, optical, and charge-based evaluation, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), Nyquist plot analysis, current–voltage (I–V) measurements, charged deep-level transient spectroscopy (Q-DLTS), and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PLs) are performed. The fabricated supercapacitor took ~ 30 min to completely discharge itself at “full load operation.” The band diagram, at carrier transport levels, has also revealed the presence of two possible trap centers which may be responsible for the degradation and/or overall stability of the supercapacitor.
