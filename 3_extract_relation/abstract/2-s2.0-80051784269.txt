This paper presents two light electric vehicles (LEVs) with a electric propulsion system developed at an academic laboratory. One LEV is an electric city scooter powered by a lithium-ion battery pack and propelled by a wheel motor drive. The other LEV is an electric bicycle powered by a fuel cell system with the assistance of a supercapacitor bank. Power and energy design of the electric propulsion systems of the two LEVs as well as characterization of the energetic devices are illustrated. Â© 2011 IEEE.
