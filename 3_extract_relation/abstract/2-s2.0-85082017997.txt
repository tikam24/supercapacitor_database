This paper presents a study on PV and fuel cell (FC) based DC microgrid (MG). The PV array and FC stack act as energy sources and a hydrogen electrolyzer system is used for energy storage whenever surplus power is generated by the PV source. A supercapacitor (SC) bank is utilized for short-term energy storage to handle abrupt changes in load demand. This system is capable of supplying both DC and AC loads. The inverter is controlled by a voltage and frequency (VF) control scheme to regulate the deviations in frequency and voltage. PI controllers and fuzzy logic based self-tuning PI controllers (Fuzzy-PI) are used in the inverter control scheme to regulate VF deviations caused due to the changing AC loads and their effects on the system are analyzed and compared. With fuzzy logic based self-tuning PI controllers, the frequency and load current deviations are found to be minimized. Modelling and simulations are accomplished in MATLAB/Simulink software.
