Cycling stability and specific capacitance are two of important performance parameters for pseudocapacitive electrodes under frequent charging and discharging. Herein, we present a facile solvothermal approach to rationally design and fabricate chiffon-like and hydrotalcite-like α-Co(OH)2 nanoflakes for extrinsic pseudocapacitive electrode, which exhibits linear galvanostatic discharge behavior and superior charge-storage performance, including high capacitance of 475 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, excellent rate capability and superb cycling stability with capacitance retention of 93.9% after 10000 cycles at 10 A g−1. The superior performance is mostly attributed to the good electrical conductivity and stable microstructure of the hydrotalcite-like α-Co(OH)2 nanoflakes and the abundant redox active sites on the chiffon-like nanoflakes with short and facile electron transport. In addition, other α-Co(OH)2 samples with different morphologies and size as contrast are prepared and discussed, indicating that the morphology/size design and optimization of the α-Co(OH)2 could greatly improve the electrochemical energy-storage performance. The findings demonstrate that the chiffon-like and hydrotalcite-like α-Co(OH)2 nanoflakes have a great practical application potential in long-life and high-performance supercapacitors. This study also presents a facile way to design and prepare nanoflake-like materials with adjustable lateral size and thickness from spherical morphology consisting of nanoflakes.
