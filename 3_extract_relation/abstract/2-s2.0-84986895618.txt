A test bed with a coplanar architecture is employed to investigate the integration of an in situ cross-linked, polymer-supported ionogel with several commercially available, high surface area carbon paper electrodes. Specifically, a UV-cured poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA)-supported ionogel electrolyte film is formed in situ against a variety of porous electrodes comprising: a carbon fiber paper, a carbon aerogel paper, and four carbon nanotube-based papers. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements reveal that the relative performance of a particular carbon paper with the neat ionic liquid is not necessarily indicative of its behavior when integrated with the solid ionogel electrolyte. The coplanar test bed can therefore serve as a useful tool to help guide the selection of suitable carbon-based electrode structures for supercapacitors that incorporate UV-cured ionogels created in situ for wearable energy storage applications.
