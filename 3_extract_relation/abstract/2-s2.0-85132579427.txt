Alternative options for producing electricity and fulfilling the increasing electric vehicles power demand can help in minimizing the global warming impact. It is important to maintain the load-balance generation based on load demands. This research investigates plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) through designing the charging and the working controllers and studying them. The DC bus voltage regulation and tracking of the battery and supercapacitor currents to their desired values were designed using non-linear sliding mode controllers. The validation of the SMC controller’s efficient performance was carried out using a non-linear based backstepping controller and compared with the non-linear sliding mode controllers. Further, this research presents a comparative analysis, that is, a detailed response of the non-linear based backstepping controller and the SMC controller regarding their ability to track, the DC bus voltage regulation and desired reference, the battery, and supercapacitor currents. Also, a Lyapunov function candidate was used to analyze the PHEV’s global asymptotic stability. After verification of the designed controllers using MATLAB/Simulink, the results indicate that both controllers achieved the aim of the DC bus voltage regulation and its reference voltage tracking under different load conditions.
