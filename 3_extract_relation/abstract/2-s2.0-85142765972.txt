A sharp increment in the demand of the electrical energy has opened the door for the utilization of renewable energy. But because of its intermittent nature it has some limitations and requires some kind of Energy Storage System (ESS). In this paper, an islanded DC microgrid of small-scale is considered which incorporates solar photovoltaic energy generators, power converters, local DC loads and a hybrid energy storage system of battery and super capacitor. Various cases of solar irradiance are simulated to authenticate the presented power management and control strategy to regulate the DC bus voltage. This work adopts bidirectional DC/DC converters to perform the transfer of power in both directions. The charging or discharging of the battery and super capacitor are controlled by the circuit according to the need and maintain the magnitude within limits. The SIMULINK is used for modeling of DC microgrid system with HESS.
