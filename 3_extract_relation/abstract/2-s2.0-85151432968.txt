The supercapacitor has drawn more attention because of its enhanced electrochemical properties, including a long life cycle, high specific capacitance, and power density. The supercapacitor has been suggested as a potential energy storage system for high-potential applications. In this work, the nanocomposite fibers of NiCo2O4/polyaniline(PANI)/graphene were prepared by low cost and simple electrospinning method, and prepared materials were studied by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and transmission electron microscope (TEM). SEM and HR-TEM analyses of morphology have shown the clear formation of nanofibers with decreasing diameter and size of the composite NiCo2O4/PANI/graphene. Using galvanostatic chargeâ€“discharge, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques, the supercapacitance behaviour of NiCo2O4/PANI/graphene nanofibers was investigated. The NiCo2O4/PANI/graphene nanofiber achieved the maximum specific capacitance value of 1410 F/g at 1 A/g at 6 M KOH. The NiCo2O4/PANI/graphene nanofiber was found to be highly stable for 8000 cycles at 1 A/g.
