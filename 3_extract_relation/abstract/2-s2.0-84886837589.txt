Crumpled nitrogen-doped graphene-ultrafine Mn3O4 nanohybrids (CNGMNs) were synthesized through a one-step strategy under hydrothermal conditions for promising application as supercapacitor materials. Doping of N atoms in the lattice of graphene and anchoring of Mn 3O4 nanoparticles on graphene sheets were achieved concomitantly during the process under the assistance of aniline. The specific capacitance of this nanostructured hybrid was nearly six times that of the Mn3O4 counterpart. Additionally, enhanced rate capability and cycling stability (∼98.7% retention after 2000 cycles) were also obtained. The facile approach to prepare CNGMNs and exceptional electrochemical properties indicate that the CNGMNs could be a promising candidate material for supercapacitors. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
