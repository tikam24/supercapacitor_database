In general, the actual specific capacitance for MnO2 is less than 300 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 when the loading mass exceeds 0.6 mg cm−2. In some cases, it even it decreases further as the increase of loading mass. To achieve a higher capacitance for MnO2, plenty of studies have been performed on various complex processes, for example, the addition of extra ingredients and the use of complex electrode structures. In this study, the pure MnO2 films were prepared on three-dimensional porous foam nickel by applying a simple electrodeposition method. Some details about the traditional preparation techniques were improved. MnO2 showed a high capacitance. Especially, when the deposition potential was 0.6 V, the specific capacitance reached as high as 469 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1. Furthermore, at a large current density of 5 A g−1, the specific capacitance remained at about 358 F g−1, and the capacity retention rate is 83.9% after 2500 cycles. Even at a specific power of 2544 W Kg−1, it can also reach the specific energy of 50.52 Wh Kg−1, showing superiority to the existing work. Overall, the existing capacitance of pure MnO2 was improved, the electrode structure was simplified and the cost was reduced.
