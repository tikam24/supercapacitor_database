The electrochemical performance of tungsten oxide (WO3) is closely related to its morphology and lattice symmetry. However, current synthetic approaches are typically limited by product controllability, environmental friendliness, and low scalability. Here, a facile and high-efficient synthesis is reported of WO3 nanosheets based on the synergistic intercalation and oxidation of layered tungsten disulfide (WS2). The complete conversion from WS2 to WO3 is confirmed by crystallographic, spectroscopic, microscopic, and elemental analysis. The prepared WO3 nanosheets exhibit a superior specific capacitance of 480 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and a good cycling stability at a current density of 10 A g−1. Notably, benefitting from the 2D nanosheet structure and the high lattice symmetry, the cubic WO3 nanosheets possess a high specific capacitance of 384 F g−1 at a high current density of 20 A g−1, which is much higher than that of other WO3-based electrode materials.
