Battery systems, widely used as energy storage devices for electric vehicles (EVs), suffer from issues such as short lifetimes and low power density. In this paper, a hybrid energy storage system (HESS), which is a combination of a supercapacitor (SC) and a battery, that can be charged using wireless power transfer (WPT) technology, is presented. This combination can achieve the desired energy capacity and power density. Moreover, it offers an acceptable energy storage size for applications such as EVs and machines. In order to optimize the system for the energy and power requirements of a power train system, an optimal design principle for the HESS is proposed. The battery charge degree, Q, is defined and calculated to minimize the entire weight of the HESS. The optimal SC ratio can be obtained on the basis of the defined operation constraints. This optimal combination can reduce the weight of the storage system by 30% for the given operation pattern. Furthermore, under some conditions with optimized charge times, the SC can serve as the sole operated energy storage device and charge power can be increased using WPT.
