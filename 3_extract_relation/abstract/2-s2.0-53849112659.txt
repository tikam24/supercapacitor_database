Composite electrodes consisting of CoMnO2 and carbon nanofibers(vapor grown carbon nanofiber, VGCF) with high electrical conducivity(CoMnO2/VGCF) were prepared on a porous nickel foam substrate as a current collector and their supercapacitive properties were investigated using cyclic voltammetry in 1 M KOH aqueous solution. The CoMnO2/VGCF electrode exhibited high specific capacitance value of 630 F/g at 5 mV/s and excellent capacitance retention of 95% after 10 4 cycles, indicating that the used VGCF played the important roles in reducing the interfacial resistance in the composite electrode to improve supercapacitive performance.
