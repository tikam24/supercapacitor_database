Spiral wound supercapacitor was fabricated by using activated carbon fibre cloth (ACFC) as the electrode materials and using 1mol/L Et4NBF4/PC as the electrolyte. BET was used to measure the pore structure of the ACFC. Performance of the ACFC supercapacitor was characterized by galvanostatic charge/discharge and leakage current measurement. The results show that supercapacitor based on the ACFC has a specific capacitance of 80F/g, a specific energy of 20.2 Wh/kg, excellent power performance, very low leakage current and therefore a splendid future for industrialization.
