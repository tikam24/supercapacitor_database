In this article, the performance of a specific multi-port DC-DC converter is investigated. The energy management under load variation is investigated. A simulation model of this specific multi-port converter is developed. By parametric analysis, some properties of the circuit are demonstrated. This converter is part of an energy storage system. The operational principle is demonstrated by using a supercapacitor as an energy storage element. The operation in different energy transfer directions is demonstrated.
