As a new type of energy storage device between traditional capacitors and batteries, supercapacitors have the properties of fast charging and discharging of capacitors, as well as the energy storage characteristics of batteries. With the deterioration of the global climate and the reduction of resources, supercapacitors have received widespread attention. Electrode materials take an important part of ultracapacitors, which affect the performance and production of ultracapacitors. This paper studies the effects of different preparation methods and different dopants on the performance of activated carbon electrodes. The purpose of this article is to summarize the methods and research directions for improving the performance of activated carbon electrodes. Through the summary, it can be found that the specific capacity, internal resistance and cycle life of the activated carbon electrode are greatly improved by forming the composite electrode material of the metal compound or polymer and activated carbon. But whether it can be put into mass production has also become one of the factors to be considered in future research.
