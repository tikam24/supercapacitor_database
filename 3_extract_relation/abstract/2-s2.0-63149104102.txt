IrC2 thin films were prepared by radio frequency (rf) sputteringtechnique, and the supercapacitive properties of the films werestudied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 1 M LiNO3 electrolyte for the first time. The specific capacitance of the single IrO2 film electrode was calculated to be 293 F.g -1 at a scan rate of 5 mV.s-1 for the sample prepared at room temperature. Â© The Electrochemical Society.
