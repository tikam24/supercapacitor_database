In this work, we formulate highly-concentrated aqueous graphene oxide/ graphene nanoplatelet (GO/GNP) dispersions. The stability of these dispersions mainly depends on the pH and the concentrations of the dispersed phase. The graphene hydrogels that we prepare from GNP, containing a small fraction of GO, are characterized by electrical conductivity measurements, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy. The GNP hydrogels have a better mechanical stability compared to a conventional rGO hydrogel; a 50 mg freeze-dried sample can sustain a load of 200 g of weight. A flexible supercapacitor is prepared from the GNP hydrogels. A specific capacitance of 212 F g-1 is obtained at 0.8 A g-1, which is around 30% higher than that of a comparable supercapacitor made from rGO hydrogels. Additionally, the specific capacitance at 10 A g-1 remains at almost 90% of the initial values, even after 1000 cycles.
