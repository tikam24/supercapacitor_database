Three-dimensional (3D) nanostructured graphene can be used as a replacement or enrichment material. This review presents the types of 3D graphene developed thus far, for example, nanoshells, encapsulates, graphene foams, aerogels and hydrogels, their properties and the methods by which to obtain them, such as chemical vapour deposition, the hydrothermal method or by sugar-blowing production. The review also covers areas in which 3D graphene foam has been exploited for application such as energy, electronic, biomedical and environmental protection as well as the latest developments.
