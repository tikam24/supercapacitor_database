Now-a-days, the world is going towards environmental friendly and sustainable renewable energy resources instead of fossil fuel based energy. Thus, energy storage system has become an emerging technology for renewable energy source and application. Supercapacitors have competitive advantages over batteries like high power density and fast charging. However supercapacitors with boost converter gives good performance and optimum cost benefit. Also it helps to achieve high power level and reduction in current ripple. In this paper, performance of supercapacitor is presented using boost convertor to maintain constant output voltage across DC motor with the help of MATLAB Simulink software and experimental results using Digital Signal Controller (DSC).
