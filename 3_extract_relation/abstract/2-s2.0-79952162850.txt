We report the synthesis of self-organized titania nanotubes and nanocrystalline titania powders employing an alternative and novel approach. Integrating these nanostructures in a binder-free working electrode improved the capacitance up to 911 μF cm-2, which is around one to two orders of magnitude higher than the conventional electric double layer capacitors. © the Owner Societies 2011.
