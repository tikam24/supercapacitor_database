Electrochecmical energy storage plays a major rule in the current shift to renewable energy sources in the form of batteries, supercapacitors, and fuel cells. This work represents the fabrication of supercapacitor electrodes comprised of activated carbon powder (ACP) and graphene oxide (GOx) drop-casted onto graphite substrates. The ACP+GOx layered electrodes produced a specific capacitance of 16.5 F/g and energy density of 2.3 Wh/kg at scan rate of 0.01 V/s.
