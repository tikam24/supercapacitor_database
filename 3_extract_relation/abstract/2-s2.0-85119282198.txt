In this work, NiMg@OH/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposites are synthesised through microwave-assisted synthetic methodology using various reducing agents. The structural features and surface morphology of synthesised materials are fully examined with different spectroscopy and microscopy techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), Raman and Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Further, this material was subjected to cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques for the systematic study of the properties and impact of reducing agents at various percentages of rGO on the specific capacitance of synthesised materials. The presence of rGO gradually improves the charge transfer process at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Among these nanocomposite materials, maximum specific capacitance of 650.31 F/g was observed for NiMg@OH-1.5 wt% rGO synthesised using NH4OH reducing agent in 6 M KOH electrolyte. Hence, the result signifies these composite materials are a promising candidate for supercapacitor applications.
