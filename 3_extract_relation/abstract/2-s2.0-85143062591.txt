To synthesize the efficient morphological electrode nanomaterial with a rough surface is a key parameter in high-energy storage devices. The α-NiS microstructure with rough surface nature is synthesized by the most adoptable hydrothermal method and characterized by different characterization techniques. The end product is subjected as electrode material of a supercapacitor, showing good electrochemical performance. To improve the electrochemical performance of the electrode material, α-NiS@MWCNTs is also synthesized. The specific capacitance (Cs) of 2057 F g-1at 1 A g-1is obtained from α-NiS@MWCNT material, which is found to be higher than solely α-NiS material. Asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) show an energy density of 27 W h kg-1at 362 W kg-1with a current density of 0.5 A g-1. A kitchen timer, a toy motor fan, and 13 LEDs are also powered from two asymmetric supercapacitors connected in series.
