The manufacture of multifunctional and high-performance wearable supercapacitors (SCs) requires a new class of flexible electrodes with high conductivity, high mechanical stability, good water-proof ability and self-healable capability. Herein, we report a stretchable and self-healable SC based on a MoS2/PEDOT/CNT electrode. The specific capacitance of the SC could be retained up to 81.98% even after the 21st breaking/healing cycle. Furthermore, a sheet-type asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) based on a MoS2/PEDOT/CNT positive electrode and SnS2/CNT negative electrode is constructed, and it exhibits high performance with an extended potential window of 1.7 V, areal capacitance of 103.76 mF cm-2 at 1.5 mA cm-2, and outstanding stability with no capacitance degradation under a wide range of bending conditions. The ASC is sealed by polyimide films, and it shows high electrochemical stability in hot water and under high speed centrifugation conditions, indicating good water-proof ability and wearability. The as-prepared ASC is also encapsulated in elastic films to provide 225% stretchability. The ASC devices packaged in all these ways exhibit high capacitance retention (>90%) under various bending and dynamic conditions.
