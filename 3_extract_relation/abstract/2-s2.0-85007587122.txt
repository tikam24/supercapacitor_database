Simonkolleite nanoplatelets were deposited on 3D nickel foam-graphene (NiF-G/SimonK) by a rapid microwaveassisted hydrothermal method. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) of the NiF-G/SimonK electrode revealed that the SimonK nanoplatelets were evenly distributed on the surface of NiF-G and interlaced with each other, resulting in a higher electrochemical performance compared to NiF-G and NiF/SimonK. Utilizing this composite material, a supercapacitor with a specific capacitance of 836 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 has been achieved.
