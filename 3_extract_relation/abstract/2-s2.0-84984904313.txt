Results of a study of the structure of porous carbon materials (PCMs) prepared by the carbonization of plant raw materials and the modification of oxidized or thermally expanded graphite have been described. It has been experimentally found that the studied materials have a porous fractal structure with an average micropore radius of 17–37 Ǻ. Based on this finding and results of previous studies, it is reasonable to state that the studied materials can be effectively used as supercapacitor electrodes. Adsorption/desorption of vapors and an aqueous solution of ethyl alcohol has revealed that the resulting materials are not inferior to pharmaceutical activated carbon with respect to the studied parameter. At a temperature of 37°C, carbonized sunflower seed shells retain the adsorbate three times longer than activated carbon does; this feature makes it suitable for use in medical applications.
