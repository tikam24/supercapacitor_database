Metal-organic framework (MOF) composites are considered to be one of the most vital energy storage materials due to their advantages of high porousness, multifunction, various structures and controllable chemical compositions, which provide a great possibility to find suitable electrode materials for batteries and supercapacitors. However, MOF composites are still in the face of various challenges and difficulties that hinder their practical application. In this review, we introduce and summarize the applications of MOF composites in batteries, covering metal-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, lithium-oxygen batteries and zinc-air batteries, as well as supercapacitors. In addition, the application challenges of MOF composites in batteries and supercapacitors are also summarized. Finally, the basic ideas and directions for further development of these two types of electrochemical energy storage devices are proposed.
