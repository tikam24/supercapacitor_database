Present work explored a room temperature, simple and low cost chemical route for the preparation of hydrophilic cobalt oxide films from alkaline cobalt chloride (CoCl 2 :6H 2 O) and double distilled water precursor solutions. As-deposited cobalt oxide films showed amorphous nature, which is one of the prime requirements for supercapacitor, as confirmed from X-ray diffraction studies. Changes in direct band gap energy and electrical resistivity of as-deposited cobalt oxide films were confirmed after annealing. Spherical grains of about 40-50 nm diameters were uniformly distributed over the substrate surface. Surface wettability studied in contact with liquid interface, showed hydrophilic nature as water contact angle was <90°. Finally, presence of cobalt-oxygen covalent bond was observed from Raman shift experiment. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
