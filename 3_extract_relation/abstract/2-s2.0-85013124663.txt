The bouquet-like NiCo2O4@CoNi2S4 ternary heterostructure on nickel foam is successfully synthesized through a hydrothermal method and electrodeposition. CoNi2S4 nanosheets uniformly cover the surface of nanoneedle-like NiCo2O4 arrays. The as-prepared NiCo2O4@CoNi2S4 material was characterized by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Their electrochemical performance was tested by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) methods. The bouquet-like NiCo2O4@CoNi2S4 material with a ternary heterostructure shows the advantages of fast electron and ion transport, a large electroactive surface, and a remarkable areal capacitance (6.25 F cm−2 at current density of 2 mA ⋅ cm−2), which suggests NiCo2O4@CoNi2S4 is a promising material in practical application for pseudocapacitors.
