Designing electrode materials with high reversible capacitance is the key to developing high-performance pseudocapacitors. In this work, a novel ternary hybrid material, porous ZnS@Co3S4@NiO nanosheets are successfully constructed through a morphology reshaping enabled by a hydrothermal method followed by calcination. From a macroscopic view, the introduction of NiO changes the nanorod morphology of ZnS@Co3S4, and forms a porous nanosheet structure. The porous architecture with an increased specific surface area can promote the transport of ions and electrons, accelerate the diffusion of the electrolyte, and offer more active sites for electrochemical reactions. These advantages enhance the electrochemical properties of ZnS@Co3S4@NiO nanosheets when used as electrode materials for supercapacitors. ZnS@Co3S4@NiO nanosheets deliver an initial capacitance of 1418.7 F g−1, and it also reaches 1550.9 F g−1 with a capacitance retention rate of 109.3% at 5 A g−1, after 5000 cycles. However, ZnS@Co3S4 nanorods only deliver an initial capacitance of 708.7 F g−1, and maintain 716.4 F g−1 with a capacitance retention rate of 101.1% after 5000 cycles. These results show that the ZnS@Co3S4@NiO nanosheets are a promising electrode material for high-performance pseudocapacitor electrode, and morphology reshaping is an effective strategy to design high-performance pseudocapacitive materials.
