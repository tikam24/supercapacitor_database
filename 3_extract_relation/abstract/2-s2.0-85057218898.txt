For supercapacitor electrode materials, polypyrrole (PPy) usually shows compact microstructure due to its dense growth. To enhance its electrochemical capacitive properties by facilitating the dispersed distribution of PPy, we have incorporated graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets into PPy via facile electrochemical polymerization. And meanwhile, the effect of electropolymerization conditions (12 different conditions) on the electrochemical properties of the prepared PPy/GO composites is investigated detailedly. Three important results are obtained by electrochemical measurements. First, the electrochemical properties of PPy electrodes are remarkably boosted by the incorporation of GO. Second, galvanostatically polymerized PPy/GO composites exhibit better electrochemical performances than potentiostatically polymerized PPy/GO. Third, the galvanostatically polymerized PPy/GO composite with 1 mA cm−2 shows the best electrochemical capacitive performances, achieving high specific capacitance of 154.5 mF cm−2, good rate capability, and excellent cycle performance, showing 107.5% of initial capacitance after 5000 cycles. This study demonstrates that the electropolymerization conditions significantly affect the electrochemical properties of the prepared PPy/GO composites, and the electrodes prepared under the optimal condition are very promising for high-efficiency supercapacitor applications.
