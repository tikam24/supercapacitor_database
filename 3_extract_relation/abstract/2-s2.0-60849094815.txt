(Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)(OH)2 powders used as positive electrode of asymmetric supercapacitor AC/(Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)(OH)2 were prepared by using the co-precipitation route and characterized by XRD, ICP and SEM. The electrochemical capacitance performance of the asymmetric supercapacitor was tested by using galvanostatic charge/discharge, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The initial discharge specific capacitance of 35.90 F/g was obtained in 1 M LiOH solution within the potential range 0-1.0 V at the current density of 100 mA/g. The asymmetric supercapacitor exhibited a good cycling performance. Â© 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
