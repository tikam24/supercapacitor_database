The novel Ni(OH)2-graphene(Ni(OH)2-G) composite was first prepared through a simultaneous hydrothermal method. The structure, morphology and electrochemical performance of the obtained samples were systematically investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Raman spectra and so on. According to the TEManalysis, needlelike and platelikeNi(OH)2 nanoparticles were supported on the surface of graphene in the Ni(OH)2-G composite. Furthermore, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements showed that the Ni(OH)2-G electrode material had not an excellent electrochemical capacitance, but graphene can stabilise the Ni(OH)2 electrode material, which could be the main reason for the remarkable improvement of electrochemical performance.
