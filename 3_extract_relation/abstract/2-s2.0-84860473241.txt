OMC/NiCo 2O 4 composite was prepared by co-precipitation with ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) as a support. The crystalline structure and morphology of the composite were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM images showed that NiCo 2O 4 was uniformly coated on the OMC. Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge were used to investigate the electrochemical performance of the OMC/ NiCo 2O 4 composite. The specific capacitances of the OMC/NiCo 2O 4 composite with a mass fraction of 40% NiCo 2O 4 were 577.0 F·g -1 at a current density of 1 A·g -1 and 470.8 F·g -1 at 8 A·g -1. The specific capacitance remains at 508.4 F·g -1 after 2000 cycles at a current density of 2 A·g -1, with a capacitance retention of 92.7%.© Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.
