Abstract: A lithium-ion supercapacitor with the positive electrode based on a high-porosity carbon material modified by a conducting polymeric complex of nickel with a Schiff base has been developed for the first time. The electrochemical capacitance of the proposed device is more than 40% higher than that of a similar cell with nonmodified positive electrode, while all other practically significant characteristics (working voltage, resistance, number of chargeâ€“discharge cycles) are retained.
