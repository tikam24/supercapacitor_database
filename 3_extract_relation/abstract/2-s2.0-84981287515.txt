Uniform porous pompon-like Mg-incorporated Î±-Ni(OH)2 were designed and synthesized by a facile co-precipitation method. The results of ICP, XRD, FESEM, EDS and N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms revealed that Mg2+ in the Ni(OH)2 lattice had a significant effect on the physicochemical and electrochemical properties. The enhanced chemical stability, high specific capacitance of 1647 F g-1, excellent rate capability and long cycle life with capacitance retention of 82.0% after 1000 cycles were obtained for Mg-incorporated samples.
