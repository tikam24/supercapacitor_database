In this paper, the ZnO/G nanocomposite was synthesized by facile in-situ microwave irradiation method. The as-prepared ZnO/G composite has been characterized with X-ray powder diffraction. The electrochemical properties of the obtained composite electrode for supercapacitor have been studied by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectra analyses. The ZnO/G nanocomposites showed a good capacitive behavior with a higher specific capacitance of 140.4 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV/s scan rate in 1M KOH electrolyte. Based on the electrochemical results revealed that the composite electrode is a suitable candidate for supercapacitor applications.
