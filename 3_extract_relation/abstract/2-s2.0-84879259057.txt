The proceedings contain 13 papers. The topics discussed include: a phase field model of solid electrolyte interface formation in lithium- ion batteries; graphene-based all-solid-state supercapacitor with ionic liquid gel polymer electrolyte; nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) characterization of a polymerized ionic liquid electrolyte material; nano-sized lithium manganese phosphate/carbon nanotube composites with enhanced electrochemical activity for lithium-ion batteries; block copolymer assisted fabrication of graphene/carbon nanotube hybrid architectures and their application in supercapacitors; monitoring phase behavior of hydrogen confined in carbon nanopores by in-situ small angle neutron scattering technique; and design considerations to improve transport in porous electrodes for lithium-ion batteries.
