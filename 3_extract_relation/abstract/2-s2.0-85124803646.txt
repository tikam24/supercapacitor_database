Estimation of the supercapacitor State-of-Power (SoP) is necessary to achieve efficient power management while respecting safety limits during acceleration and regenerative braking conditions of the electric vehicle. However, the SoP is dependent on the supercapacitor State-of-Energy (SoE) which itself should be obtained based on the State-of-Health (SoH) information. This paper proposes a co-estimation framework to accurately estimate the SoP based on SoE/SoH estimations obtained using real-time measurement data. The electronic control unit decisions can accordingly be made upon more accurate information enhancing the overall performance and functional safety. Experimental supercapacitor data under the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) cycle is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. This is complemented by a few real-time tests to demonstrate the feasibility of embedded implementation.
