In this work, ZnCo2O4@MnO2 core-shell structures are successfully prepared on nickel foam by a simple hydrothermal approach. The obtained core-shell structures exhibit excellent areal capacitance and cycling stability, which may be ascribed to the rational design of a hybrid-material based electrode structure that facilitates ion transport. The as-assembled supercapacitor device shows outstanding specific capacitance, demonstrating that ZnCo2O4@MnO2 core-shell structure is a candidate as a supercapacitor electrode material in flexible energy storage applications.
