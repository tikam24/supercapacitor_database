As the demand for electric vehicles (EVs) is increasing nowadays, the need for customer-friendly, effective, and innovative solutions for charging is rapidly enhancing. The recent advancements in this direction not only include the fast and efficient charging mechanism but also the automation in the process. Frequent plugging in the EVâ€™s charging cable to the socket maybe tiresome that can be overcome by robotic technology, where this repeated task can be done using autonomous mobile robots. This paper deals with a fully automated system of charging EVs via robots with V2X communication. Further, a supercapacitor-based fast and efficient charging method has been proposed, which can be adopted for the autonomous charging process to improve its effectiveness.
