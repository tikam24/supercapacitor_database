Enhanced electrochemical capacitance of 2D-nanosheets of Ni(OH)2 via reinforcement of star-shaped CuS flat nanoflakes synthesized using in-situ hydrothermal root is presented. Microscopic and structural characterization suggest the inclusion of CuS nanoflakes in the films. Reinforced CuS nanoflakes offer high surface area resulting into open-sheet morphologies for Ni(OH)2@CuS films; contrasting with the folded sheet structures attained for the neat Ni(OH)2 films. The remarkably high bulk (10−3 S cm−1) conductivity of CuS enhances the conductivity and enable facile electron transport in the composites. Asymmetric supercapacitors constructed using Ni(OH)2@CuS and graphite as the electrodes is noted to show specific capacitances of 642 Fg−1 at current density of 1 Ag−1, good rate capability and excellent cycling stability (86% capacitance retention at the end of 1000 cycles) relative to the neat Ni(OH)2 based supercapacitor cells that shows specific capacitance of 142 Fg−1 at the same current density. The direct contact of Ni(OH)2 with the conductive CuS nanoflakes and highly porous structures of Ni(OH)2@CuS electrodes doubles the power densities of the Ni(OH)2@CuS supercapacitors than Ni(OH)2 cells due to the low ion-diffusion resistances for charging by ions from the electrolyte, afforded by the short diffusion pathways in the composites.
