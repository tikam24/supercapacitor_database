Lithium (Li) doped and undoped NiFe2O4 thin films for supercapacitor application have been prepared through the chemical deposition method. The Li doped and undoped NiFe2O4 thin films for structural, morphological and supercapacitive performance have been studied. As the Li doping percentage varies from 1 at. wt.% to 3 at. wt.%, the thickness of NiFe2O4 thin films increases up to 120 min deposition time, after that slight decrease in thickness was observed. SEM images show randomly grown flake-like structure of Li-NiFe2O4 thin films. The angle of contact of Li-NiFe2O4 thin films decreases with increase in Li doping into NiFe2O4 thin films. The effect of Li doping percentage on supercapacitive performance revealed that as the Li doping percentage is increased from undoped to 3 at. wt.%, the specific capacitance is increased from 314 F/g to 571 F/g.
