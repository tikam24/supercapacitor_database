Electrode materials with rationally designed architecture are crucial to achieve high-performance supercapacitors. However, there is still a great challenge for integrating the features of large accessible surface areas, fast electron/ion transport kinetics and favorable mechanical flexibility within a single electrode. Herein, we propose a facile approach to fabricate high-performance freestanding carbon-based electrode of polyaniline modified nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon nanofibers, which effectively combine the merits of highly conductive electrospun carbon nanofibers with hierarchical porous structure, suitable nitrogen content as well as pseudocapacitive materials. Benefiting from the well-designed architecture, the as-assembled symmetric all-solid-state flexible device exhibits a high specific capacitance of 260 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and high rate capability with a capacitance retention of 60% at 16 A g−1. Furthermore, the device also displays a desirable energy density of 8.9 Wh kg−1 with power density of 0.27 kW kg−1 and excellent cycling stability with 80.1% capacitance retention after 10,000 charge-discharge cycles at 2 A g−1. Eventually, the as-designed composite electrodes open up new avenues for facile construction of high-performance supercapacitor electrodes.
