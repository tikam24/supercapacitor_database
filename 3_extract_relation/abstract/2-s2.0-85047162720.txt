Core–shell nanostructured magnetic Fe3O4@SiO2 with particle size ranging from 3 nm to 40 nm has been synthesized via a facile precipitation method. Tetraethyl orthosilicate was employed as surfactant to prepare core–shell structures from Fe3O4 nanoparticles synthesized from pomegranate peel extract using a green method. X-ray diffraction analysis, Fourier-transform infrared and ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) spectroscopies, transmission electron microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectroscopy were employed to characterize the samples. The prepared Fe3O4 nanoparticles were approximately 12 nm in size, and the thickness of the SiO2 shell was ~ 4 nm. Evaluation of the magnetic properties indicated lower saturation magnetization for Fe3O4@SiO2 powder (~ 11.26 emu/g) compared with Fe3O4 powder (~ 13.30 emu/g), supporting successful wrapping of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles by SiO2. As-prepared powders were deposited on carbon fibers (CFs) using electrophoretic deposition and their electrochemical behavior investigated. The rectangular-shaped cyclic voltagrams of Fe3O4@CF and Fe3O4@C@CF samples indicated electrochemical double-layer capacitor (EDLC) behavior. The higher specific capacitance of 477 F/g for Fe3O4@C@CF (at scan rate of 0.05 V/s in the potential range of − 1.13 to 0.45 V) compared with 205 F/g for Fe3O4@CF (at the same scan rate in the potential range of ~ − 1.04 to 0.24 V) makes the former a superior candidate for use in energy storage applications.
