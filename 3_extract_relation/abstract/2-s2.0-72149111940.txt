This paper focuses on the use of modeling and simulation of a renewable energy. The capacitive energy storages contribute to the rapid energy recovery associated with regenerative braking in electric vehicles. This power system allows the acceleration and deceleration of the vehicle with a lower loss of energy. Short-distance passenger traffic on electrified lines is a domain where brake energy recuperation might reduce the total energy consumption significantly. In this paper the results of simulation models by Matlab-Simulink for an urban-metro railcar and some methods for reducing the needed value of capacitance are presented. The aim of the new management of the energy storage system for decreasing the needed value of capacitance and improving the system performance is presented. Â© 2009 IEEE.
