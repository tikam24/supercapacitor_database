This study deals with the implementation of an efficient control strategy using batteryâ€“supercapacitor for an electric vehicle driven by a permanent-magnet synchronous motor. The whole system consists of two parts: the energy management system and the traction system. The energy management system is mainly composed of a fuzzy-Lyapunov controller used to regulate both the current sources and the DC-bus voltage. For the traction system, direct torque control based on 12 sectors drive is used for the control of the motor to ensure both decoupled flux and torque with low ripple compared with the conventional Direct Torque Control (DTC). To make a comparative study for the energy management system, two strategies of energy management have been implemented. The first strategy does not include the regulation of the supercapacitor voltage, whereas the second one is based on the regulation of the supercapacitor voltage to protect it from deep discharge and avoid short circuit. The experimental tests were implemented using two dSPACE 1104 implementation boards. The results show that the system under the second energy control strategy works perfectly and verifies the effectiveness of the proposed control technique.
