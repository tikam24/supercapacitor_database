Metal-organic framework nanosheets draw continuous attention in energy storage areas. In this work, for the first time, a facile strategy is developed to grow metal-organic framework nanosheets on electrospun nanofibers as supercapacitor electrode materials, exhibiting a high capacitance of 702.8 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and excellent cycling stabilities over 10000 cycles. Through a specific carbonization process, the metal-organic framework based hybrids are preserved to produce a porous metal doped carbon material with the improved rate performance and a great prospect for cathode materials. Furthermore, an asymmetric solid-state supercapacitor device is assembled using the metal-organic framework based hybrids and metal doped carbon materials as anode and cathode materials, respectively. The maximum energy density of 51.4 Wh kg−1 with a power density of 1500.1 W kg−1 is achieved, which is superior to many previous reports, revealing a promising prospect for the novel high-performance asymmetric supercapacitor.
