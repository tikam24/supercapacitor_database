In this study, we have fabricated manganese oxide nanoparticles embedded with N-doped carbon (MnO2/NDC) using egg albumin via hydrothermal and post calcination treatment. It was noticed that the MnO2 nanoparticles were grown into the nitrogen doped carbon matrix. As-fabricated NDC and MnO2/NDC show excellent surface area about to 685 m2/g and 645 m2/g respectively. The SEM and TEM images results revealed that the fabricated birnessite-type MnO2 nanoparticles are uniformly embedded into N-doped graphitic carbon matrix. The asymmetric super capacitor cell (ASC) was fabricated using the NDC and MnO2/NDC nanocomposites as a cathode and anode respectively and separated with whatman filter paper and 1.0 M Na2SO4 was used as electrolyte. The specific capacitance of the asymmetric supercapacitor is determine and found 895 F•g−1 at 0.5A•g−1 current density. The fabricated ASC show excellent charge and discharge properties and long term stability. The asymmetric NDC//MnO2/NDC cell supplies an excellent energy density about to 402.5 W h kg−1 with power density about to 2250 W kg−1. Therefore, these outcomes support that fabricated nanocomposite can be used as a potential electrode material for supercapacitor application.
