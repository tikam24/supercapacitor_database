A UiO-66-NO2/carboxyl graphene composite (UiO-66-NO2/CXYG) was synthesized using a simple solvothermal reaction. The composite was then calcined to obtain series of all-carbon mixture of carbonized UiO-66-NO2/reduced carboxyl graphene (CUiO-66-NO2/rCXYG). The obtained carbon materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen sorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Then their electrochemical properties were systematically tested. The results indicated that UiO-66-NO2/CXYG derived Carbon-700 as an electrode for the electrochemical capacitor exhibited a high specific capacitance of 302 F g-1 in 6 M KOH at a current density of 0.15 A g-1, even 170 F g-1 at a high current of 10 A g-1 and good stability (retaining 94% capacitance after 5000 cycles). These UiO-derived porous carbon materials may offer a new insight into the various fields, such as fuel cells, supercapacitors and lithium batteries.
