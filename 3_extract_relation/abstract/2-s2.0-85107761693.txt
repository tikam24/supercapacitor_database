This work pertains to integration of supercapacitor energy storage system with wind-penetrated two-area power system. A small-sized SCES device is incorporated in automatic generation control of each area. For robust and optimum usage of SCES, a customized neuro-adaptive predictive control model is developed using level 1 S-function coding. This model feeds reference power command to the converter of storage system with its voltage used as feedback loop. A step load disturbance reflecting load outage is introduced back to back in the power system. It is seen through simulation studies carried out in MATLAB Simulink Environment that there is significant improvement in frequency response and tie power deviations. SCES converter power limits are fully maintained; besides, SCES voltage and power response is also depicted.
