High mass loading metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibit great potentials as electrode materials in energy storage, benefiting from their massive exposed reactive sites. Keeping high mass loadings while maintaining ultra-fine morphology of MOFs is very technically demanding. Herein, high mass loading binder-free NiCo-MOFs with mixed organic linkers (1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate, BTC and p-benzenedicarboxylate, PTA) have been in-situ grown on Ni foam (NF) using Co(OH)2 as the template. The designed NiCo-(PTA)0.8(BTC)0.2 nanosheets achieved an areal capacitance of 5.84 F cm−2 (2.92 C cm−2) at a current density of 1 mA cm−2. The origin of the excellent electrochemical performances is carefully explained. The fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) using NiCo-(PTA)0.8(BTC)0.2 nanosheets and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as the positive and negative electrodes presented an excellent specific capacitance of 113 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. Besides, an outstanding energy density of 40 Wh kg−1 was achieved at the power density of 800 W kg−1. The assembled ASC device can retain as high as 97.7% of the original capacitance after 10,000 cycles, manifesting an excellent cycle stability. This work may provide a strategy for the preparation of high mass loading dual metal MOFs electrodes with ultra-fine morphology for high-performance supercapacitors.
