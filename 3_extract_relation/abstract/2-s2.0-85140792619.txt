The aim of this paper is developing and validating the sliding mode control application (SMC) for hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) featuring stand-alone and on-grid operations modes. The proposed system composed by a photovoltaic (PV) and wind turbine (WT) as principal sources. The PV is connected to the overall system via boost converter which controlled using MPPT algorithm depending to Adaptive Perturb and Observe (APO) method managed by SMC to extract maximum of power of PV modules. The WT depends to a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) and a controlled rectifier to maximize the operating point of the WT. Therefore, the battery and supercapacitors are connected to the system via a bidirectional converter to ensure the charging modes operations. The voltage source converter (VSC) is controlled by SMC had an aim to control the frequency and amplitude of the system outputs injected into the grid and load utility. To expose the performance of the proposed sliding mode control approach, we propose a different comparatives tests include a conventional PI control and hysteresis current control under two operating grid modes depending to different climate scenarios. The developed control strategy for HRES have shown great results such as the control performance, effectiveness and delivers low harmonic distortion values (Max of THD are 3,43% and 4,88%) compared with hysteresis current controller (Max of THD are 4,63% and 10,98%) and PI control (Max of THD are 4,92% and 12,86%) featuring OFF and ON grid, respectively. Finally, the proposed control enhances the HRES quality and stability
