Graphene oxide based electrode materials show remarkable electrochemical properties due to the improved specific surface area and electrical conductivity for supercapacitor applications. Hydrothermally synthesized graphene oxide based aluminum sulfide nanowalls on nickel foam (NF) have revealed excellent pseudocapacitive behavior with the specific capacitance 2362.15 F g-1 at 2 mVs-1 as observed through cyclic voltammetry. The galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements confirmed a specific capacitance 2373.51 F g-1 at 3 mAcm−2. Hexagonal phase of the graphene oxide (GO) based Al2S3 nanowalls also showed good discharge time of 820 s and energy density 118.68 WhKg−1 at 3 mAcm−2. Moreover, the fabricated electrode material exhibited good power density 2663.58 W kg-1 at 20 mAcm−2. The impedance results also confirmed the pseudocapacitive characteristics and revealed weak contact and Warburg resistances for the electrode material in half cell. Hence, GO based Al2S3 nanowalls performed as a prominent electrode material for asymmetric supercapacitors. Additionally, electrode material also exhibited excellent symmetric behavior, which again suggested a good electrode structure for supercapacitor applications.
