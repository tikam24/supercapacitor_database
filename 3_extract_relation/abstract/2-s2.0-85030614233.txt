Currently, energy storage with superior efficiency, inferior cost and environmentally benign is a solemn matter for the humanity worldwide because of constantly escalating demands of energy. Considering this crisis, many productive approaches were proposed to meet the current and future necessities. However, research is still continuous to develop innovative pathways and to improve the existing methodologies. Supercapacitors have taken the superior position among the talented devices for energy storage. Nanomaterials based on graphene (GN) and metal oxides/hydroxides have emerged as much more pertinent and beneficial resources for supercapacitor devices. In this review, we consider advanced research steps towards various versatile designing strategies for GN-metal oxide/hydroxide composite materials. We portray here very recently demonstrated (latest research of years 2013â€“2015) supercapacitive manners of GN-metal oxide/hydroxide nanocomposites in terms of specific capacitance and cyclic stability. Furthermore, we accentuate the fabrication challenges and future perspectives of such materials for energy storage.
