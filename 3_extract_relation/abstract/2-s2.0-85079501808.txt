The macroscopic assembly of two-dimensional materials into a laminar structure has received considerable attention because it improves both the mechanical and chemical properties of the original materials. However, conventional manufacturing methods have certain limitations in that they require a high temperature process, use toxic solvents, and are considerably time consuming. Here, we present a new system for the self-assembly of layer-by-layer (LBL) graphene oxide (GO) via an electrohydrodynamic (EHD) jet printing technique. During printing, the orientation of GO flakes can be controlled by the velocity distribution of liquid jet and electric field-induced alignment spontaneously. Closely-packed GO patterns with an ordered laminar structure can be rapidly realized using an interfacial assembly process on the substrates. The surface roughness and electrical conductivity of the LBL structure were significantly improved compared with conventional dispensing methods. We further applied this technique to fabricate a reduced graphene oxide (r-GO)-based supercapacitor and a three-dimensional (3D) metallic grid hybrid ammonia sensor. We present the EHD-assisted assembly of laminar r-GO structures as a new platform for preparing high-performance energy storage devices and sensors.
