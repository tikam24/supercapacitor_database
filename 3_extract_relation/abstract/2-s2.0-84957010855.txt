Based on the discussion about the basis of the thermal decomposition of NH4VO3: three pure phase products of V2O3, VO2, V6O13 and their morphological evolution, mesoporous variation, improved electronic conductivity caused by an O vacancy mechanism over temperature, electrochemical measurements show that the V6O13, the VO2, and the V2O3 all exhibit high specific capacitance and energy density, and possess a potential window of -1 V to +1 V in an aqueous solution of Na2SO4. This potential window is similar to that of C materials, which can be used as positive electrodes, also negative. Symmetric electrochemical supercapacitors (ESs) of V2O3//V2O3, VO2//VO2, V6O13//V6O13 and quasi symmetric ESs of V2O3//VO2, VO2//V6O13, V6O13//V2O3 have been assembled, clearly manifest upper energy density and steady cycling charge-discharge ability.
