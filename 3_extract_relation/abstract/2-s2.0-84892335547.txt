Electrochemical double layer capacitors are fabricated using carbon nanotube (CNT)/paper flexible electrodes. An extensive electrode fabrication study was conducted, resulting in single electrode specific capacitances in excess of 100 F/g. Surfactants and dispersants in the CNT suspension prior to CNT deposition onto paper substrates was found to be detrimental to electrode performance. Following electrode fabrication,three full cell packaged supercapacitor architectures were investigated. One architecture used a liquid KOH electrolyte, while the other two architectures used a PVA:KOH gel electrolyte. Devices were tested under static bending conditions, and proved to function under bending. Â© 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.
