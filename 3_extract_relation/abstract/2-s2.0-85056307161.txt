A simple, cost-effective, and ultrafast microwave method for preparing ternary Cu-Co sulfides (CuCo2S4) is reported for the first time. The electrochemical tests demonstrate the highest specific capacitance of 580 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, and an good cycling stability demonstrated by a 80% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles at a current of 5 A g−1. An asymmetric supercapacitor based on CuCo2S4 as the positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as negative electrode is successfully assembled, the CuCo2S4//AC-ASC demonstrates good cycle performance (∼99.5% capacitance after 6000 cycles) and high energy density (15 W h kg−1 at a power density of 400 W kg−1) in the wide voltage region of 0–1.6 V. Meanwhile, two asymmetric supercapacitors links in series cannot only light a red light-emitting diode, but also drive a rotating motor.
