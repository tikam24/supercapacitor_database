In this paper a wafer-level process is proposed to fully integrate carbon-based micro-supercapacitor onto silicon substrate. This process relies on the deposition of apaste containing carbon, PVDF and acetone into cavities etched in silicon. After electrolyte deposition in a controlled atmosphere, a wafer-level encapsulation is realized. Cyclic voltammetry performed on non-encapsulated microcomponents showed specific energy of 257 mJ cm -2 for 336 lm deep cavities. The specific encapsulation rocess developed was tested separately and proved to be efficient in terms of resistance to organic electrolytes and mechanical strength. Â© 2012 Springer-Verlag.
