Doping heteroatoms is an effective means of modifying the electrochemical properties of reduced graphene oxide (rGO). In this work, we propose the modification of rGO via microwave-assisted synthesis with different concentrations of sulfur at 140 °C for 30 min. Characterization using X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared, and Raman spectroscopy revealed successful doping with sulfur to alter the physical properties of rGO. The morphology of doped S-rGO samples exhibited wrinkling and folding of graphene sheets. Electrochemical evaluation revealed S-rGO with 0.25 M of sulfur (S-rGO-0.25) to have excellent electrochemical performance, with a specific capacitance of 237.6 F g−1 compared to the S-rGO with 0.15 M (S-rGO-0.15) and S-rGO with 0.50 M (S-rGO-0.50) with 98.2 and 61.7 F g−1 respectively. Furthermore, S-rGO-0.25 was validated as having an outstanding capacitance retention of 106% after 10,000 cycles signifying that it has promising potential as an electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
