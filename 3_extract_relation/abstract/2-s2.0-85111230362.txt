In this study, nickel oxide nanoparticles have been synthesized via precipitation method and calcinated at 500, 600, 700 and 800°C, respectively. TG/DTA curves expose the thermal stability of the prepared/asprepared product. The XRD results revealed that NiO nanoparticles have cubic structure. Crystallite sizes increase with increasing calcination temperatures by using two different methods via Scherer's method and W-H method. The SEM and TEM images confirmed that the NiO nanoparticles have a spherical morphology with high agglomeration. The photoluminescence (PL) and FT-IR spectra give details of the crystal defects and functional groups present in the prepared samples. The energy bandgap of the prepared products was observed to be decreasing (3.59 to 3.01 eV), respectively. The VSM study confirms the occurrence of weak ferromagnetic behaviour. The highest specific capacitance of 555.62 F g-1 at 10 mV/s was obtained for NiO (800°C) nanoparticles.
