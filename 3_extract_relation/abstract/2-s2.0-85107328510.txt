In the article, the supercapacitors (ionistors) application for lifting equipment induction electric drives is considered. Electric lifting equipment is widely used in industry, construction, municipal services. The lifting equipment efficiency is insufficient, therefore the research topic is relevant. At the moment, an induction electric motor with a frequency converter with a DC link is used to regulate the mode of lifting and lowering loads. To smooth out the ripple and use the braking energy of the moving masses when lowering the load, it is proposed to use a supercapacitor as a DC bus storage. A supercapacitor has three to four degrees more capacity than an electrolytic capacitor and can store more electricity. The paper provides simulation modeling of the electric drive of the lifting equipment. Stern's equation is used as a supercapacitor mathematical model. According to the simulation results, the power consumption of an electric drive with a supercapacitor is 41.02% less than that of an electric drive with an electrolytic capacitor.
