Pyrite FeS2 nanospheres was synthesized through a simple solvothermal method in one step, and the electrochemical performance as the electrode material of supercapacitor was studied. The structure, morphology, specific surface area and pore volume of the material were characterized and measured experimentally, and its supercapacitor performances in three common electrolytes (6 M KOH, 6 M NaOH and 1 M Na2SO4) were tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results show that the product is homogeneous pyrite FeS2 nanospheres with a diameter of about 300-600 nm, showing obvious pseudocapacitance characteristics in all three electrolytes. When the electrolyte is KOH, it shows the highest specific capacitance, reaching 732.9 F/g at the current density of 2 A/g and 307.1 F/g at the current density of 20 A/g with the capacity retention rate of 41.9%. It is demonstrated that the synthesized FeS2 nanospheres is an excellent electrode material for supercapacitors.
