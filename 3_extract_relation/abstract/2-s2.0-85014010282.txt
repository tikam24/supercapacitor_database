Laminar-structured flexible carbon cloth composed of alternating graphene and nitrogen-enriched carbon/graphene hybrid nanofibers was prepared via alternated electrospinning and graphene oxide coating, followed by stabilization, carbonization and post-thermal oxidization process. The multilayered graphene-coating and post-thermal treatment can exert great influence on microstructure of the as-prepared composite cloth, synergistically resulting in the increased conductivity and specific surface area, optimized pore structure and improved surface contents of nitrogen and oxygen species. Hence, the composite exhibits significantly enhanced supercapacitive performance, such as a high specific capacitance of 241 F g −1 (294 F cm −3 ) at 0.2 A g −1 , a high retention rate of ca. 64% at a current density of up to 50 A g −1 . Additionally, the resulted composite shows no significant capacitance degradation after 2000 charge/discharge cycles at 5 A g −1 , indicating its superior cycling stability for energy storage application.
