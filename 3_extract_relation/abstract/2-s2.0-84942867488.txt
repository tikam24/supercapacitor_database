In this article, we report a novel electrode of NiCo2O4 nanowire arrays (NWAs) on carbon textiles with a polypyrrole (PPy) nanosphere shell layer to enhance the pseudocapacitive performance. The merits of highly conductive PPy and short ion transport channels in ordered NiCo2O4 mesoporous nanowire arrays together with the synergistic effect between NiCo2O4 and PPy result in a high specific capacitance of 2244 F g-1, excellent rate capability, and cycling stability in NiCo2O4/PPy electrode. Moreover, a lightweight and flexible asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device is successfully assembled using the hybrid NiCo2O4@PPy NWAs and activated carbon (AC) as electrodes, achieving high energy density (58.8 W h kg-1 at 365 W kg-1), outstanding power density (10.2 kW kg-1 at 28.4 W h kg-1) and excellent cycling stability (89.2% retention after 5000 cycles), as well as high flexibility. The three-dimensional coaxial architecture design opens up new opportunities to fabricate a high-performance flexible supercapacitor for future portable and wearable electronic devices.
