Two-dimensional (2D) graphene materials have attracted great interest as promising electrode materials in supercapacitors due to their high electrical conductivity derived from sp2-cabon network. These 2D layered materials, however, tend to stack with each other, which largely decreases the surface area. Here we report the design of highly graphitic macroporous carbon with large surface area suitable for supercapacitor applications. When benchmarked with other carbon materials, such as amorphous macroporous carbon, activated carbon, graphite or exfoliated graphene oxides, our graphitic macroporous carbon show superior capacitance.
