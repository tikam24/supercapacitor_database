Graphene modified polyimide films are partial carbonized between 500'C and 900'C in nitrogen atmosphere. Meanwhile, the structure, mechanical, thermal and electrochemical behaviors were comparatively investigated. It was shown that there was stable lamellar graphite crystal structure in part resin matrix after carbonized at 900'C. Meanwhile, according to the TG and gas adsorption experiments, there was pore structure formed in the carbonization material during the pyrolysis process above 600°C. Furthermore, the membrane carbonized at 900°C is employed as the supercapacitor electrode in the 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte solution, which exhibits a specific capacitance of 179.5 F gr-1. It also exhibits excellent stability, and the energy density was stable with the increase in the power density, suggesting it an promising electrode material for supercapacitor.
