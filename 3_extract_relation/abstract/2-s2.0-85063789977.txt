Polymer science has been designated as "the gateway to the future," as it deals with our capability to develop ever-more sophisticated materials to suit the desires of society and the planet. Polymers are already playing a critical role in saving energy and resources across a variety of applications, such as transport, packaging, healthcare, and buildings. Appreciations to their versatility, polymers have and will continue to enable a sustainable lifestyle. Polymer scientists are conducting a great deal of research into the potential for polymers to provide cutting-edge renewable energy technologies. Such avenues are photovoltaic, fuel cell, polymer semiconductors, LED (light-emitting diode), etc. This chapter elucidates some important polymers thoughtful effort of elaborating various such energy application schemes in line with the energy assembly, energy storage, dye sensitized electric cell, light emitting and sensing, perovskite electric cell, thermoelectrical generator, polymer composite for thermoelectrical generator, piezoelectric, triboelectric generator, and supercapacitor have been discussed for better understanding of the readers.
