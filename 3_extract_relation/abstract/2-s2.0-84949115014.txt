The proliferation of novel types and designs of electrochemical capacitors makes it necessary to obtain a better understanding of the behavior of these systems together with a more systematic classification of them. In this study a rational classification of supercapacitors based on the charge storage mechanism and the active material of each electrode is proposed. The internationally accepted terminology - the terms symmetric, asymmetric and hybrid - is also clarified in an attempt to standardize the current definitions and facilitate the systematic classification of each device. Additionally, the selection of suitable mathematical expressions to calculate the capacitance of each kind of system is rationalized throughout the discussion taking into account the behavioral characteristics of each electrode. An examination of the potential evolution profile of each electrode during the galvanostatic cycling of the supercapacitor is presented as a key tool for understanding the fundamental behavior of these devices.
