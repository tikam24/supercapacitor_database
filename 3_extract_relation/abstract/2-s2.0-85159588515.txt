Mn3O4@CC electrodes were synthesized via a fast one-step molten salt method for flexible quasi-solid symmetric supercapacitors. Mn3O4 grows rapidly in a high polarity molten salt system and strongly anchors to carbon cloth. The molten salt method can realize sodion embedded in Mn3O4 and then improve the conductivity and capacitance. The results show that the Na-0.9-based supercapacitor exhibits a high capacitance of 1225.7 mF cm−2 at 5 mA cm−2. The preparation method, design strategy on structure of composition in this work will provide a novel route to realize high-performance flexible supercapacitors.
