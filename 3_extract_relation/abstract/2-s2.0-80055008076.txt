Polypyrrole (PPY) films were obtained on stainless steel substrates by anodic electropolymerization using sulfosalicylic acid (SSA) as an anionic dopant. SSA adsorption prevented anodic oxidation of stainless steel during electropolymerization, provided efficient charge transfer and enabled the formation of adherent films. It was shown that poly[2,5-bis(3-sulfonatopropoxy)- 1,4-ethynylphenylene-alt-1,4-ethynylphenylene] sodium salt provided efficient dispersion of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and allowed the formation of composite PPY-SWNT films. The PPY-SWNT films showed improved capacitive behavior compared to PPY films due to lower resistance and higher porosity. The highest specific capacitance of 295 Fg - 1 was obtained at a scan rate of 2 mVs - 1. The composite films are promising materials for application in electrochemical supercapacitors.
