In the present work, we have synthesized Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)-silver nanoparticles (AgNP) electrode by a simple and cost effective dip coating technique for supercapacitor application. Surface morphology of the films is examined by scanning electron microscopy, which revealed presence of bright spots of Ag nanoparticles on to the smooth surface of PEDOT:PSS. The supercapacitive behavior of the electrodes is tested in three electrode system with 0.1 M H2SO4 electrolyte by using cyclic voltammetry. Specific capacitance about 140 Fg-1 at 20 mVs-1 is obtained for the PEDOT:PSS-AgNP electrode. Present work demonstrates an easy way of improving specific capacitance of the polymer electrodes.
