Wideband filters employing OP Amplifiers (OP Amps) are required in sensing devices. A low-voltage 4th-order Switched-Capacitor Low-Pass Filter (SC LPF) employing 3-V power Low-Voltage Folded-Cascode CMOS OP Amps with a Dynamic Switching Bias circuit (LV DSBFC OP Amps) capable of processing video signals, which enables low power consumption and operation in wide bandwidths, is proposed. This SC LPF consists of two-stage biquadratic circuits cascading two 2nd-order SC LPFs to achieve the sufficiently sharp roll-off. In this circuit, dynamic charging operations through two-phase clock pulses during the on-state period of the OP Amps and non-charging operation during their remaining off-state period are separated. A load capacitance of the OP Amps, and a sample-hold circuit consisting of sampling switch and holding capacitor in this SC LPF, were optimized. Through SPICE simulations, it was shown that the 4th-order SC LPF with an OP Amp switching duty ratio of 50 % is able to operate at a 14.3 MHz high speed dynamic switching rate, allowing processing video signals. The roll-off response of this 4th-order SC LPF was greatly improved compared to that in the 2nd-order SC LPF. At over 5 MHz within the stop-band, a gain below -31.5 dB, which is suitable, was achieved. The power consumption of this 4th-order SC LPF reduced to 67 % of that observed in the static operation of the OP Amps, and decreased to 56.9 % of that in the 4th-order SC LPF with conventional 5-V power DSBFC OP Amps. Thus, the simulation results confirmed that the two-stage biquadratic SC LPF circuit configuration with the increased filter order of the fourth using 3-V power LV DSBFC OP Amps is useful for achieving a wide stop-band with a high attenuation and low power consumption.
