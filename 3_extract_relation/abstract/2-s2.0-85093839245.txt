The increasingly severe global energy crisis has brought great challenges to the energy field, and renewable energy power generation system has been widely concerned because of its characteristics of green and inexhaustible. However, renewable energy also has some limitations in its specific application, and affects the grid-connected power generation of new energy. In this paper, based on the background of photovoltaic power station, the intelligent energy storage control method for single inverter is put forward to assist a single inverter, and the DC component of fluctuating power is extracted by using the moving average function; furthermore, the intelligent energy storage control method for the bidirectional DC/DC converters both the lead-acid battery side and the super capacitor side is put forward to ensure the stability of the voltage. Then, by using the Ethernet communication technology of the computer, the energy of the station-level intelligent energy storage is allocated reasonably to preserve the energy of the battery in a reasonable boundary. Finally, the system verification and experimental analysis illustrates that the intelligent energy storage control methods with Ethernet communication proposed in this paper can effectively achieve the intelligent control performance.
