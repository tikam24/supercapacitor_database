The proceedings contain 132 papers. The topics discussed include: hybrid electromagnetic and electrostatic micromachined suspension with adjustable dynamics; simulation and experimental validation of a selective magnetization process for batch-patterning magnetic layers; ferrofluid-based stretchable magnetic core inductors; printable on-chip micro battery for disposal bio-sensing device; rapid fabrication of supercapacitor electrodes using bio-nanoscaffolds in capillary microfluidics; a low frequency vibration energy harvester using dual Halbach array suspended in magnetic springs; experiments on power optimization for displacement-constrained operation of a vibration energy harvester; and can integrated micro-optical concentrator technology revolutionize flat-plate photovoltaic solar energy harvesting?.
