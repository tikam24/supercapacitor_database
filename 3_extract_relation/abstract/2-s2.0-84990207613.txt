A three-dimensionally stretchable supercapacitor is created by designing a novel pyramid structure without the use of an elastic substrate. Compared with previous stretchable supercapacitors that may deform in plane on elastic substrates, these pyramid-structured supercapacitors can be stretched in three dimensions with high stability. Their electrochemical performances are well maintained after stretching in three dimensions for thousands of cycles, and they show both higher energy and power densities compared with the other reported stretchable supercapacitors. In addition, they are breathable due to the designed grooves that produce the pyramid structure, which is particularly promising for many emerging applications such as wearable electronics. This work further provides an effective strategy for developing next-generation flexible electronic devices with high performances.
