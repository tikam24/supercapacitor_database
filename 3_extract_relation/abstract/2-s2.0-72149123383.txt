The rapid development in batteries chemistry and technology allows preparing the lithium or Ni-MH cells with energy density over 360kJ/kg. Plug-in hybrid vehicle PHEV mass production is prepared with operating range up to 100km and for longer trips the engine-generator running at optimal efficiency supplies with constant power battery and motor. The supercapacitor SC gives better dynamics and efficiency due to recuperation. The SC based on high voltage and extra high permittivity dielectric with nanometers thickness can with better power density (up to 1200kJ/kg), lifetime, efficiency and power replace batteries. The TiO2 research discovered the enormous energy densities (up to 8MJ/kg) comparable to gasoline or explosives in Quantum battery. High power density and fast charging early make the generator useless and plug-in hybrid may be only short episode in electric vehicles history. Â© 2009 IEEE.
