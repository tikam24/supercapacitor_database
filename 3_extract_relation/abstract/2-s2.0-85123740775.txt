Devices such as DVR and HPQC require supercapacitor energy storage units. Traditional supercapacitor energy storage units use constant current and constant power modes for charging, and there is a problem that the DC bus voltage cannot be stabilized. This article proposes a simple high-voltage supercapacitor charging circuit and its control scheme. The scheme uses a circuit that combines an isolation transformer, a three-phase uncontrolled rectifier bridge and a Buck converter, and uses a composite control mode that combines DC bus voltage feedforward and Buck circuit voltage and current loop. The simulation results show that the compound control mode can suppress the output current jump and reduce the DC bus voltage jump.
