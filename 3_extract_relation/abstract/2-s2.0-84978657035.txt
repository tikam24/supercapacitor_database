Vertically aligned conducting polymer nanowire arrays had great potential applications in supercapacitor electrode material and exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic behavior towards the reduction of nitrite. In this paper, a facial template-free approach to synthesize large arrays of vertically aligned polyaniline (PANI) nanowires on electrochemically pretreated glassy carbon electrodes was reported by using a galvanostatic current method. The as-prepared large arrays of PANI nanowires had very narrow diameters and were oriented perpendicular to the substrate, which was a benefit to the ion diffusion when being used as the supercapacitor electrode. The highest specific capacitance of PANI nanowire arrays was measured and kept high at a large charge-discharge current density. Furthermore, it also can detect nitrite with ultrahigh sensitivity of 62.99 µA mM−1 cm−2 and a remarkable fast response time of less 1 s. The results indicated that the vertically aligned PANI nanowires could dramatically enhance the electrochemical performance.
