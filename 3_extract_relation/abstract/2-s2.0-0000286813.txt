The challenge to the use of electronically conducting polymers as electrode active materials in supercapacitors is to outperform high-power, double-layer carbon supercapacitors (DLCSs). The present study demonstrates that a hybrid supercapacitor with p-doped poly(3-methylthiophene) (pMeT) as the positive electrode and an activated carbon as the negative electrode outperforms the specific power of the DLCSs without reduction in specific energy while maintaining good performance cyclability over 10,000 cycles. Impedance spectra and cyclability data of galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles of C//pMeT hybrid supercapacitors are presented and discussed. Â© 2001 The Electrochemical Society.
