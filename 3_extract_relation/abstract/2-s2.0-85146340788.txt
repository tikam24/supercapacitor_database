For pseudocapacitive electrode materials (PseEMs), despite much progress having been made in achieving both high power density and high energy density, a general strategy to guide the enhancement of intrinsic capacitive properties of PseEMs remains lacking. Here, we demonstrate a universal charge-compensating strategy to improve the charge-storage capability of PseEMs intrinsically: i) in the electrolyte with anion as charge carriers (such as OHâˆ’), reducing the multivalent cations of PseEMs into lower valences could create more reversible low-to-high valence redox couples to promote the intercalation of the anions; ii) in the electrolytes with cation as charge carriers (such as H+, Li+, Na+), oxidizing the multivalent cations of PseEMs into higher valences could introduce more reversible high-to-low valence redox couples to promote the intercalation of the cations. And we demonstrated that the improved intrinsic charge-storage capability for PseEMs originates from the increased Faradaic charge storage sites.
