In pursuing excellent supercapacitor electrodes, we designed a series of MoS2/CoS2 composites consisting of flower-liked MoS2and octahedron-shaped CoS2 through a facile one-step hydrothermal method and investigated the electrochemical performance of the samples with various hydrothermal time. Due to the coupling of two metal species and a big amount of well-developed CoS2 and MoS2the results indicated that the MoS2/CoS2composites electrodes exhibited the best electrochemical performance with a large specific capacitance of 490 F/g at 2 mV/s or 400 F/g at 10 A/g among all samples as the hydrothermal time reached 48 h (MCS48). Furthermore, the retention of MCS48 is 93.1% after 10000 cycles at 10 A/g, which manifests the excellent cycling stability. The outstanding electrochemical performance of MCS48 indicates that it could be a very promising and novel energy storage material for supercapacitors in the future.
