We report on the fabrication of an all solid-state micro-supercapacitor using patterned photoresist-derived porous carbon electrodes and an ionogel electrolyte. The interdigitated finger electrodes are synthesized via pyrolysis of the SPR-220 photoresist, which results in high surface area porous carbon via a highly scalable technique. The ionogel electrolyte is formed using 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ionic liquid hybridized with fumed silica nanopowder. The fabricated device has an excellent long-term cycling stability. The maximum energy density obtained is about 3 mW h cm-3, higher than that of commercial Li-ion thin film batteries, with the maximum achieved power density of 26 W cm-3. Our results indicate that the novel combination of the pyrolyzed photoresist with an ionogel electrolyte holds promise for applications in integrated energy storage for all solid-state microsystems technologies.
