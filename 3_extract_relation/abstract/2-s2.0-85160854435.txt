Al3+ and Cr3+ ions substituted ZnNiFe2O4 nanoparticles were successfully synthesized by sol-gel method followed by annealing treatment at 1000 °C. X-ray diffraction technique was used to determine the single phase cubic structure of nickel ferrite phase and its jumping length and average crystallite size of AlyCrxZn(0.4-y)Ni(0.6-x)Fe2O4 (N1–N6) nanoparticles. Ni2+ and Zn2+cations were decreased with the increase of Al3+ and Cr3+ ions in nickel ferrite crystalline nanoparticles and the combinations (x + y = 0 − 0.375) initiate considerable influence on the magnetic and electrical response of the nickel ferrite core materials. The vibrational modes and bond coordination of the atoms were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Grain size and shape of the nanoparticles were examined by using field emission scanning electron microscopy technique. The broad uv–visible light absorbance and band gap values of the samples were obtained from UV-DRS. Raman spectroscopy shows that the surfaces of ZnNiFe2O4 material possess stretching vibrational peaks at 195, 331, 488, and 688 cm−1. The increase in permeability and soft magnetism were determined from the calculated magnetic parameters using vibrating sample magnetometer. The variations in complex impedance values of the samples were recorded from 8.2 × 106 Ω to 1.2 × 105 Ω and it confirms the possibility to develop the storage, charging and discharging of supercapacitor and battery materials.
