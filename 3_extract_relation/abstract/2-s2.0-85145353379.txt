This paper designs an adaptive fuzzy logic controller (AFLC)for power management of a hybrid energy-storage system (HESS) containing a vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) and a supercapacitor (SC). The studied hybrid wind-PV microgrid (MG) is connected to the IEEE 14-bus multimachine system using optimal designed capacity of the proposed HESS. The main research includes the design of an AFLC for the HESS and the design of the optimal capacity for the HESS. A probability approach is used to determine the rated power and capacity of the HESS, while an AFLC for power distribution of the HESS is designed to effectively utilize individual ESS's characteristics. Different cases of the studied system are analyzed to investigate the effects of the selected capacity joined with the designed AFLC on smoothing power for the studied system.
