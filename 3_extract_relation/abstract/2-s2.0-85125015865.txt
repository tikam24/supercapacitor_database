Supercapattery the high-performance device for energy storage purposes, is a combo of best rate capability and exceptional specific power of electrochemical supercapacitor and outstanding specific energy of the battery. In this work, one of the electrode's material for supercapattery is synthesized by blending PANI, the best conducting polymer, highly conductive and stable graphene and (Sr3(PO4)2) Strontium phosphate. Structural and elemental study reveals the presence of a multiphase structure of Sr3(PO4)2 and a chain of flakes of PANI and graphene. The blending of these three into one another greatly enhances the performance of the device which can be depicted via the electrochemical characterizations. To optimize the quantity of these materials in a blend is an important factor to be considered. The ternary composite of Sr3(PO4)2, PANI and Gr reveals the excellent increase in specific capacity (Qs) from 220 to 422C/g as depicted by GCD measurements. These enhanced results are obtained due to promising electrochemical features as rate capability, redox active sites and controlled internal resistance. To examine the real-time performance of Sr3(PO4)2/PANI/Gr electrode, supercapattery is assembled by employing activated carbon treated as negative electrode. The assembled device exhibits a specific power of 4100 W/kg and specific energy of 42.1 W h/kg with degradation of just 13% after continuous 10,000 GCD charge discharge cycles. Finally, the device b-values are calculated and their comparison with the theoretically predicted values are demonstrated. Therefore, Sr3(PO4)2/PANI/Gr composites can be utilized as a novel electroactive electrode material for supercapattery applications.
