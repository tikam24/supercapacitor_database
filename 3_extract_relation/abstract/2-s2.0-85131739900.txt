In this study, α-MnO2 and Fe2O3 nanomaterials are prepared on a carbon fiber modified with carbon nanotubes to produce the nonbinder core–shell positive (α-MnO2@CNTs/CC) and negative (Fe2O3@CNTs/CC) electrodes that can be operated in a wide voltage window in ultrafast asymmetrical flexible supercapacitors. MnO2 and Fe2O3 have attracted wide research interests as electrode materials in energy storage applications because of the abundant natural resources, high theoretical specific capacities, environmental friendliness, and low cost. The electrochemical performance of each electrode is assessed in 1 M Na2SO4 and the energy storage properties of the supercapacitors consisting of the two composite electrodes are determined in Na2SO4 and EMImBF4 electrolytes in the 2 V and 4 V windows. The 2 V supercapacitor can withstand a large scanning rate of 5000 mV S−1 without obvious changes in the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves, besides showing a maximum energy density of 57.29 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 833.35 W kg−1. Furthermore, the supercapacitor retains 87.06% of the capacity after 20,000 galvanostatic charging and discharging (GCD) cycles. The 4 V flexible supercapacitor shows a discharging time of 1260 s and specific capacitance of 124.8 F g−1 at a current of 0.5 mA and retains 87.77% of the initial specific capacitance after 5000 GCD cycles. The mechanical robustness and practicality are demonstrated by physical bending and the powering of LED arrays. In addition, the contributions of the active materials to the capacitive properties and the underlying mechanisms are explored and discussed.
