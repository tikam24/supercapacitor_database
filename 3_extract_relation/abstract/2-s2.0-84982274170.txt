Abstract: We report on the fabrication of graphene/Zno nanocomposite supercapacitor electrodes. Laser-scribing process was implemented in order to reduce the graphene oxide (GO)/ZnO mixture on a DVD disk. With reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/ZnO composite prepared by a mass ratio of 1:25 of Zn(NO3)2Â·6H2O to GO constituents, nanoparticles of ZnO with sizes ranging from 20 to 50 nm are obtained. Consequently, 12 times improvement in the specific capacitance was achieved at a current density of 0.1 mA/cm2 compared with pristine rGO electrodes. In addition, flexible microsupercapacitor was fabricated by spin coating of the gel electrolyte, showing high stack capacitance of 9 F/cm3 at a current density of 150 mA/cm2. This microsupercapacitor delivers power density of 70 mW/cm3 and energy density of 1.2 mWh/cm3. Furthermore, the performance of device was investigated at different bending angles. The resulted characteristics demonstrate that LSG/ZnO nanocomposite is a promising electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors. Graphical Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
