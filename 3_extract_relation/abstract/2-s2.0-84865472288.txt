In this study, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)-modified graphene composite materials have been shown to exhibit excellent energy storage and conversion properties. Flexible, conducting and porous carbon cloth (CC) and graphene paper (GP)-modified CC (GP/CC) were used as substrates for comparison in all experiments. PEDOT was electrodeposited on these substrates, and their capacitance properties were measured for supercapacitor applications. Furthermore, the adsorption of size-selected Pt colloidal nanoparticles has also been performed using two substrates to form the electrode materials for fuel cell applications. We found that the PEDOT/GP/CC is the excellent flexible electrode material for both supercapacitors and fuel cells. Highlights: PEDOT was electrodeposited on the graphene paper-modified carbon cloth (GP/CC). The highest specific capacitance of the PEDOT on the GP/CC was 714.93 F/g. The size-selected Pt colloidal nanoparticles has been adsorbed on GP/CC. Â© 2012 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.
