A highly conductive polypyrrole (PPy)-reduced graphene oxide (RGO) composite with an electrical conductivity of 610 S m -1 was successfully synthesized by the in-situ photopolymerization of pyrrole in a graphene oxide suspension. Graphene oxide (GO) played the role of an electron acceptor and was reduced as it accepted electrons. The reduction of GO was confirmed by the increase in the C/O ratio of RGO with the UV irradiation time as well as the high electrical conductivity of PPy-RGO composite. Through the thermogravimetric analysis, it has been found that the PPy-RGO composite exhibited high thermal stability compared to the GO and PPy. This material was used as an electrode in a supercapacitor cell and showed excellent performance for electrical energy storage. The composite exhibited a specific capacitance of 376 F g -1 at a scan rate of 25 mV s -1. Â© 2011 Korean Institute of Chemical Engineers, Seoul, Korea.
