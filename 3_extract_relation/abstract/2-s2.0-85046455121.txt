The CuSxSe1-x thin films were deposited on conducting substrates using copper sulphate sodium thiosulfate and selenium dioxide as a source of Cu, S, and Se by electrodeposition(ED) technique. The effect of the change in composition S and Se the structural and electrical properties of the CuSxSe1-x thin films was studied. The crystallite size, composition, microstructure, contact angle and capacitance studied using XRD, EDAX, SEM, CA, and CV. The X-Ray diffraction (XRD) graph reveals that the CuSxSe1-x films were polycrystalline in nature and CuS0.6Se0.4 shows crystallite size of 34 nm, Energy dispersive analysis X-Ray (EDAX), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) show the elemental composition and microstructures were changes with S and Se composition. The CuS0.6Se0.4 film show 31Â° contact angle and specific capacitance of 159 F/g.
