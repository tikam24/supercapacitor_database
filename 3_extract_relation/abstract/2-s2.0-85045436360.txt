A Hâˆž controller was proposed aiming at the control scheme of bidirectional DC/DC converter applied to super capacitor. Firstly, comprehensive state space model of bidirectional DC/DC converter was built, including different static working point of super capacitor, and it can guarantee the output without static error by integrator. Secondly, in view of the dynamic response, the poles of closed-loop system were configured optimally. And the inductor current observed by Kalman filter was considered as an input of the state feedback, which can effectively reduce the noise, then we optimized control parameters based on the established comprehensive state space model by linear matrix inequality (LMI). The proposed control algorithm has the advantages of high stability margin, favorable static and dynamic performance, simple parameter-designing and less calculation etc. Finally, super capacitor charging and discharging experiments verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.
