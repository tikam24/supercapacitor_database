The composite materials of conductive polymer@nickel and aluminum double metal hydroxide were prepared using the simple and mild hydrothermal conditions, constructing the nano-channels for high-speed transmission of electrons and electrolyte. The morphologies and microstructures of the composites were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results of electrochemical performance showed that the conductive polymer could provide some pseudocapacitance for the composite material, promote the rapid transfer of charge, and improve significantly the capacitive performance of CP@NiAl-LDH. The polypyrrole@LDH had the best performance of capacitance, the specific capacity could reach 3 010.3 F • g-1 at the current density of 1 A • g-1, and the specific capacitance remained 73.1% when the current density increased to 20 A • g-1, exhibiting excellent rate performance. Furthermore, it also displayed excellent cycling stability with a specific capacity retention rate of 88.8% after 10 000 times of charge-discharge cycles at the current density of 10 A • g-1. These were mainly ascribed to the synergetic enhancement effect among NiAl-LDH and conductive polymer.
