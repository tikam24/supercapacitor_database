Supercapacitor and energy storage is the main target of the current work, modified copper oxide nanorods captured on the decorated graphene oxide surface via zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. The various instruments such as potentiostat measures the electrochemical performances as well as the optical activities through the detection of electron transfer. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data utilize to study the supercapacitor's efficiency of the fabricated nanocomposite (NCP) based on copper oxide nanorod (CuO) that accumulates on the graphene oxide (GO) surface. EIS authorize the construction development of the electron transfer and surface modification that supported supercapacitors and energy storage applications. The NCPs capacitance values related to carbon paste electrode (CPE) (26.47 nF/cm2), GO@CuO (11.87 nF/cm2), GO@ZnO (6.44 nF/cm2), GO@CuO.ZnO (21.37 nF/cm2), GO@CuO.TiO2 (21.51 nF/cm2), GO@ZnO.TiO2 (13.79 nF/cm2), and GO@CuO.ZnO.TiO2 (11.3 nF/cm2). At 100 cycles, the capacitance retention ended; it also showed good cycle stability. According to the findings, the manufactured NCPs electrodes are a strong contender for use in manufacturing supercapacitors, energy storage, and water treatment.
