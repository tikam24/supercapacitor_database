This work presents the manufacturing and evaluation of a CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskite-based supercapacitor. Devices were pressed from chemically synthesized powders. Pressed perovskite powders were found to exhibit properties favorable for use in supercapacitors. Furthermore, physical properties of the pellets are controllable through the sintering process, allowing for broad device tunability. It is demonstrated that the electrical performance of characterized 1 mm pellets are temperature, frequency, and cell potential difference dependent. The device under study exhibited an energy density of 34.2 Wh/kg at 100 Hz at room temperature. The high performance of the device is attributed to perovskite's ability to operate at potential differences of up to 10 V. A mean areal capacitance of 432 mF/cm 2 was recorded for a broad range of frequencies at 300 K. A significant drop in performance is observed at operating frequencies above 10 5 Hz. This is caused by the operating frequency exceeding the lead-iodide stretching mode. Work herein demonstrates that perovskite materials are suitable for use as energy storage devices in applications demanding wide ranging thermal and electrical properties.
