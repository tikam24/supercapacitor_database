Heteroatom-doped porous carbon materials with distinctive surface properties and capacitive behavior have been accepted as promising candidates for supercapacitor electrodes. Currently, the researches mainly focus on developing facile synthetic method and unveiling the structure-activity relationship to further elevate their capacitive performance. Here, the B, N co-doped porous carbon sheet (BN-PCS) is constructed by one-pot pyrolysis of agar in KCl/KHCO3 molten salt system. In this process, the urea acts as directing agent to guide the formation of 2D sheet morphology, and the decomposition of KHCO3 and boric acid creates rich micro- and mesopores in the carbon framework. The specific capacitance of optimized BN-PCS reaches 361.1 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 in an aqueous KOH electrolyte. Impressively, the fabricated symmetrical supercapacitor affords a maximum energy density of 43.5 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 375.0 W kg−1 in 1.0 mol L−1 TEABF4/AN electrolyte. It also achieves excellent long-term stability with capacitance retention of 91.1% and Columbic efficiency of 100% over 10 000 cycles. This study indicates one-pot molten salt method is effective in engineering advanced carbon materials for high-performance energy storage devices.
