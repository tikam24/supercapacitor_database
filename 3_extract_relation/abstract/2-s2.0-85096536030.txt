Metal-Organic frameworks are the advanced electrode materials for supercapacitors due to their controllable structures and large surface area. Here Ni-MOF has been prepared by hydrothermal method for their application as electrode material in supercapacitors. The prepared material is characterized with the help of X-ray diffraction and Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy. The electrochemical performance of the prepared material has been studied in 1M LiOH aqueous electrolyte using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge methods. We get the different values of specific capacitance at different scan rates. The prepared Ni-MOF shows maximum specific capacitance of 309.05 Fg-1 at 5mVs-1 scan rate.
