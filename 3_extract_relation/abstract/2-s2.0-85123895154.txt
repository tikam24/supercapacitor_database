Biomass porous carbon has received widespread attention due to its application as electrode material for supercapacitors and adsorbent for difficult-to-degrade organic dyes. In this paper, biomass porous carbon KGL is prepared using ginkgo leaves as the precursor and KOH as the activator. Capitalizing on the adsorption property of porous carbon, an azo dye Congo red (CR) is confined into the nanopores of KGL to fabricate the KGL/CR electrode. The result suggests that KGL has good adsorption performance for organic dye and KGL/CR has excellent capacitance performance. When the CR concentration is 500 mg l-1, the adsorption capacity of KGL is 495 mg g-1. KGL/CR-500 displays elevated specific capacitance of 393 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and excellent rate performance (76.3% capacitance retention at 10 A g-1). The capacitance retention after 10000 cycles maintains 99%. The symmetric supercapacitor has power density of 699.8 W kg-1 at an energy density of 16.4 Wh kg-1 and can power a light emitting diodes (LED). Our work provides the information that one is the treatment of organic dye wastewater, the other is development of electrochemical energy-storage materials, and may be expanded to the resource-utilization of other versatile effluent containing the redox groups.
