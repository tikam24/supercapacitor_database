In view of the global development and use of environmentally friendly energy materials and devices, exploring natural polymer-based gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) for preparing supercapacitors (SCs) is highly desirable. Here an earth-abundant, renewable, biodegradable natural lignocellulose (LC) membrane with 3D network porous structure is synthesized by a simple solution-casting method. The synthesized LC membrane possesses a good thermal stability of 270 °C, a high porosity of 86.2%, and reasonable mechanical property. LC membrane soaked in potassium hydroxide solution is first used as a GPE (LC-GPE) and exhibits an ultrahigh liquid electrolyte uptake of 948 wt % and an excellent ionic conductivity of 32.6 mS cm -1. The solid-state electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) assembled with the LC-GPE and activated carbon electrodes demonstrates a high specific capacitance of 120 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 with a rate capacity of only 8.4% capacitance loss as the current density increases from 1 to 10 A g-1, and a long cycling life of 10 000 cycles with 92.5% capacitance retention and nearly 100% coulomb efficiency. More importantly, the planar soft EDLC composing of LC-GPE and activated carbon electrodes is easily bent to 180° without breaking and still remains good electrochemical performance. Those results indicate that this kind of LC-GPE not only meets the green/sustainable demand but also retains good electrochemical performance of SCs. Therefore, the prepared LC-GPE is a potential candidate for assembling green and wearable/portable SCs.
