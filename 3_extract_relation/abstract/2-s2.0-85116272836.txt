Porous carbon aerogel material has gained an increasing attraction for developing supercapacitor electrodes due to its cost-effective synthesis process and relatively high electrochemical performance. However, the environmental performances of supercapacitor electrodes produced from different carbon aerogel materials are never comparatively studied, hindering our knowledge of supercapacitor electrode production in a sustainable pattern. In this study, nitrogen-doped biochar aerogel-based electrode (BA-electrode) produced from Entermorpha prolifera was simulated to investigate the environmental performance by using life cycle assessment method. For comparison, the assessment of graphene oxide aerogel-based electrode (GOA-electrode) was also carried out. It can be observed that the life cycle global warming potential for the BA-electrode was lower than that of GOA-electrode with a reduction of 53.1‒68.1%. In comparison with GOA-electrode, the BA-electrodes endowed smaller impacts on environment in majority of impact categories. Moreover, in comparison with GOA-electrode, the environmental damages of BA-electrode were greatly decreased by 35.8‒56.4% (human health), 44.9‒62.6% (ecosystems), and 87.0‒91.2% (resources), respectively. The production stages of GOA and graphene oxide and stages of nitrogen-doped biochar aerogel production and Entermorpha prolifera drying were identified as the hotspots of environmental impact/damage for the GOA-electrode and BA-electrode, respectively. Overall, this finding highlights the efficient utilization of algae feedstock to construct a green and sustainable technical route of supercapacitor electrode production.
