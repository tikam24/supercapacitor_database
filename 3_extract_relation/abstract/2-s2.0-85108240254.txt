The rapid development of supercapacitor (SC) technology leads to increased demand for nanofabrication of novel and effective electroactive hybrid materials for next-generation energy storage devices. Herein, nickel tetradecavanadate, K2H5[NiV14O40](NiV14), is doped into porous activated carbon (AC), for the first time, in different wt.% in order to investigate the homogeneous loading of the inorganic metal-oxide component on the AC matrix. The resulting complex, AC-NiV14, is found to have possessed an enhanced electrochemical characteristic (for both symmetric and asymmetric SC cell), which operates at a significantly higher potential of 1.2 V. The combination of the double-layer capacitance (EDLC) and the redox-active polyoxometalate cluster leads to an intrinsic increase in specific capacitance (capacity) (from 45.3 Fg−1 (54.4 Cg−1) for AC to 316 Fg−1 (379.2 Cg−1) for 15 wt.% AC-NiV14 at a current density of 1 Ag−1). It was also observed that there is an increase of 20% in the operating voltage compared to conventional AC supercapacitors with acidic aqueous electrolytes. Firstly, symmetric supercapacitor's electrochemical performances of various wt.% of NiV14 composition were studied in acidic aqueous electrolyte (0.5 M H2SO4) solution. We observed that the 15 wt.% of AC-NiV14 hybrid electrode showed remarkable specific energy value (~63.2 Wh kg−1) compared with pristine AC and NiV14 electrodes, separately. Besides, the asymmetric layout (AC//AC-NiV14) increased the potential window up to 1.5 V and enhanced the specific energy and power values (90.1 Whkg−1 and 2400 Wkg−1, respectively), with 98% coulombic efficiency. Meanwhile, the AC-NiV14//NiV14 asymmetric cell possesses a specific capacitance (capacity) of 375 Fg−1 (450 Cg−1) with a maximum power of 3140 Wkg−1 at the high current density of 2 Ag−1.
