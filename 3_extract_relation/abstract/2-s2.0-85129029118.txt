In this study, we modified graphene sheets with polydopamine, used abundant oxygen-containing groups to adsorb metal ions in a hydrothermal process, and obtained graphene-supported NiMoO4 nanorod composite materials after pyrolysis. NiMoO4 nanorods were uniformly dispersed on the surface of a reduced graphene oxide layer under strong electrostatic adsorption. The specific capacitance of the composite material measured at a current density of 1 A g−1 was 856 F g−1 (514 C g−1), and an asymmetric supercapacitor composed of activated carbon exhibited an energy density of 48 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 800 W kg−1. After 5000 cycles of charging and discharging, a capacitance retention rate of 73% was achieved. Therefore, PDA-rGO@NiMoO4 composite materials are promising candidate materials for supercapacitor electrodes.
