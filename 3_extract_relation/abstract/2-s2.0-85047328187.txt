This paper proposes an ultra-low-power supercapacitor voltage monitoring system (VMS) for low-voltage energy harvesting. The proposed VMS consists of a voltage divider, control logic circuit, multiplexer (MUX), sample-and-hold circuit, nano-ampere current reference (IREF), and 4-bit successive approximation register analog to digital converter (SAR ADC). The proposed VMS monitors the supercapacitor voltage and converts it into digital codes. We employ power gating technique and a nano-ampere current reference circuit to achieve ultra-low power operation. Simulation results showed that our proposed VMS achieved the DNL/INL of 0.15/0.21LSB. Its ENOB was 3.83bit at 100 Hz and the average power dissipation was 58.0 nW.
