The present work reports the synthetization and characterization of polymer Polyaniline/zinc oxide (PANI/ZnO) nanocomposites and was successfully fabricated by chemical oxidation method of ZnO via in situ polymerization method of PANI. Nowadays, the studies on conducting polymers are focus toward increasing the conductivity of the polymer that can be approached in many strategies such as doping the polymer with suitable nanoparticle in order to create highly packed and dense materials. Here, ZnO is doped into the polymer PANI with four different weight percentages of ZnO (2, 4, 6 and 8 wt %). The effect of the ZnO in terms of DC conductivity of the nanocomposites are observed through the four-point probe method. The highest conductivity reported is 1.25 × 101 S cm−1 at 8 weight percentage (wt %) of zinc oxide nanoparticles. The molecular structures had been studied using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR), and the spectra of (PANI/ZnO) nanocomposites were formed in emeraldine salt form which consists of the benzenoid and quinoid ring. The conductivity of the nanocomposites increases as the weight percentage of the nanocomposites increase. This high-conductive material can be used as a supercapacitor.
