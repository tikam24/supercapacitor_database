The PANI/porous ZFO composites were successfully prepared via an in situ method. The phase structures and the morphologies of the samples have been characterized. The electrochemical properties of the samples were assessed according to the cyclic voltammetry (CV), constant current charge–discharge measurements and electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tested in 1 M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. The PANI/porous ZFO composites exhibit higher specific capacitance compared to the pure PANI and porous ZFO, which is due to the fact that the depositing PANI on porous ZFO increases the electrical conductivity according to the EIS results. The PANI/porous ZFO composite with the mass ratio of 10:1 possess a specific capacitance of 328 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and increased 8.5% of its initial specific capacitance after 2000 successful CV cycles.
