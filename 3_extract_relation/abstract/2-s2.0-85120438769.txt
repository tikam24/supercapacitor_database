Tailoring hierarchical hybrid core-shell electrodes with impartial microstructural features and excellent electroactive constituents is crucial for the design of high-performance supercapacitors (SCs). Herein, for the first time, we fabricate uniformly aligned porous ZnFe2O4 (ZFO) nanosheet arrays onto reduced graphene oxide-garnished conductive Ni foam (rGO-NF) substrates and subsequently embellish the first layer of ZFO nanosheets with morphology-controlled secondary NiMoO4 nanosheets to achieve a hierarchical 3D core-shell structure of ZnFe2O4@NiMoO4 nanosheet arrays (NSAs) onto rGO-NF for SC applications. Improving the synergistic effect of the core-shell nanoarchitecture with a conductive rGO-NF substrate, the hierarchical 3D ZFO@NMO NSAs tend to have superb electronic conductivity, tailoribility, effective nanoporous channels, and appropriate roadways for rapid ion/electron transfer, which are required for rapid reversible redox reactions, thus reflecting the excellent electrochemical features, including the excellent specific capacitance, good rate performance, and prolonged cyclic performance of the three electrode assemblies for SCs. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device composed of ZFO@NMO NSAs@rGO-NF as the cathode and MOF-derived hollow porous carbon (MDHPC) as the anode exhibits a high energy density of 58.6 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 799 W kg-1 with prolonged cyclic durability (89.6 % after 7000 cycles), thus indicating its potential applicability towards advanced hybrid SCs.
