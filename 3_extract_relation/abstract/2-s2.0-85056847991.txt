A hollow rod-like hybrid of Co2CrO4/Co1−xS is synthesized via a facile two-step hydrothermal process, and the mass ratio for Co2CrO4–Co1−xS in the hybrid is optimized. The Co2CrO4/Co1−xS electrode exhibits excellent properties with high specific capacitance of 1580 F g−1 at current density of 1 A g−1 and possesses good rate performance. An asymmetric supercapacitor of Co2CrO4/Co1−xS//AC is assembled, which can be operated within a voltage range of 0–1.6 V, demonstrating specific capacitance of 92.3 F g−1, energy density of 32.8 Wh kg−1 and highest power density of 4003.3 W kg−1. Moreover, the specific capacitance of the device remains 88% after 5000 cycles. The good characteristics of Co2CrO4/Co1−xS//AC can be ascribed to the hollow rod-like structure and the positive synergistic effects of Co2CrO4 and Co1−xS components in the hybrid. The unique structure and superior performances render Co2CrO4/Co1−xS hybrid as a promising candidate for energy storage device.
