This paper aims to assess the enhancements of the electric vehicle (EV) energy storage systems by hybridizing Lithium ion (Li-ion) battery with a supercapacitor, based on their operation efficiency and the aging of the overall storage system. The hybrid energy storage system brings desired improvements due to the high power density and small internal resistance of supercapacitors. However, the energy density of a supercapacitor is lower than that of a typical EV battery, making the combination of the two storage systems a promising breakthrough to increase both EV mileage and battery lifetime. Accordingly, MATLAB/Simulink tools are used in this work to set-up simulation scenarios to investigate the operation of the proposed hybrid storage system.
