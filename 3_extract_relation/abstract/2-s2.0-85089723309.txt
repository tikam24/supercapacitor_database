In recent years, due to the continuous optimization of the preparation process, biomass carbon materials have been rapidly developed as an electrode material for electronic components (lithium ion batteries, supercapacitors, lithium sulfur batteries, etc.). At the same time, due to the low of the first coulomb efficiency, large irreversible capacity, voltage hysteresis, weak current charging and discharging capacity, the development of biomass materials as electrode materials were greatly hindered. By doping biomass carbon with elements(especially heteroatom doping), which can effectively improve the wettability and electron conductivity of the carbon materials, increase defects in carbon materials and active sites, and results in excellent electrochemical performance for carbon materials. This review offers a retrospection of the research progress of element-doped biomass carbons, and gives an introduce on their preparation methods, applications and prospects in the energy fields of lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors, lithium-sulfur batteries, respectively.
