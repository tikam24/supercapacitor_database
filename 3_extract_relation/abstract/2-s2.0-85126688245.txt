Egyptian power generation is mostly based on fossil fuels and hydraulic stations that draw water from the Nile River; nevertheless, renewable energy, which occupies the majority of the country, does have an impact on governments and policymakers. As a result, the primary goal of this research is to devise a viable strategy for accommodating wave energy conversion systems (WEC) while lower the rate of fossil fuel consumption. In this research, a study to investigate the practicability of the WEC system at the Mediterranean Sea of the Egyptian water is conducted. In terms of the wave amplitude and period, the monthly available energy is estimated. An optimal PI via particle swarm optimization controller linear permanent magnet synchronous generator (LPMSG) is investigated. The proposed on-grid system relies on the Archimedes wave swing tool, which is mechanically coupled to the LPMSG. The WEC system is connected to the grid via a transformer, transmission line, and an inverter. Meanwhile, the LPMSG output power is rectified and fed to a supercapacitor. In order to cover the transient stability, the d-axis current and dc-link voltage regulators are established in terms of the PI scaling factors to smoothen the extracted intermittent WEC power. The developed WEC system is validated through annualized real historical data and is checked via MATLAB/Simulink environment.
