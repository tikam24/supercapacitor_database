Taking PV converter system with super capacitor as the energy storage as the research object, an improved nonlinear coordinated control method was put forward to carry out charge and discharge control of super capacitor, and a bidirectional DC-DC converter was used to coordinate the energy transfer between the PV power bus and the super capacitor, the voltage stability of PV system bus was greatly enhanced. The Matlab/Simulink simulation analysis and experimental verification of the control scheme were carried out. The research results show that the improved nonlinear coordinated control method with integral terms and setting parameters online adjusting can effectively improve the ability of the DC side of the microgrid to adapt to the random fluctuation and gap of PV power generation, overcome the disadvantages of large variation of terminal voltage, unstable operating point, and non-linear nature of the DC/DC converter in the charging and discharging process of the super capacitor, thereby avoiding power grid failure caused by voltage fluctuations. After the emergency special failure of light intensity suddenly becomes zero W/m2 and super capacitor voltage has a sharp decline, the system has fast dynamic recovery effect. This method is simple, strong anti-interference, suitable for the super capacitor DC energy storage unit.
