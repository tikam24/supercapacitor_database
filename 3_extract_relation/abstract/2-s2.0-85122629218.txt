Energy storage systems include not only a charge/discharge bidirectional converter but also a separate voltage equalizer. This paper proposes a bidirectional converter with an integrated voltage equalizer, which saves a DCâ€“AC converter, thus significantly reducing the size, cost, and complexity of the equalization circuit. In addition, integrating the equalizer into the bidirectional converter also has a positive impact on the realization of ZVS operation. Analytical models have been established that can be used for accurate prediction, optimal design, and effective control of the proposed converter. A control strategy is proposed, which not only enables the cells to be automatically balanced when the cell string is charged/discharged but also enables ZVS operation within a wide range of voltage changes and minimizes the RMS value of the primary current. An experimental prototype of 60 W applied to nine supercapacitors (SCs) in series was built, and the experimental results verified the theoretical analysis and demonstrated the characteristics of the proposed converter.
