The cell voltage imbalance of series-connected energy storage cells, such as supercapacitors (SCs) and lithium-ion cells, causes premature deterioration and a decrease in the available energies of the cells. Various equalization techniques have been developed for diminishing such imbalances. However, since the number of switches, sensors, and/or multiwinding transformers present in conventional equalizers is directly proportional to the number of series connections of the cells, the circuit complexity and cost of the equalizers are prone to increase with the number of series connections. In this paper, single-switch cell voltage equalizers using multistacked buck-boost converters, such as the single-ended primary inductor converter (SEPIC), Zeta, and uk converters, are proposed. These equalizers consist of passive components and a single switch, significantly reducing the complexity of the circuit when compared with that of conventional equalizers. In addition, when the proposed equalizers operate in discontinuous conduction mode, feedback control is not required to limit currents flowing through cells and circuit components. The proposed equalizers are compared with conventional topologies in terms of the number of active and passive components required. Operating analyses were conducted under both cell-voltage-balanced and -imbalanced conditions. Experimental equalization tests were performed for four series-connected SCs using the SEPIC-based single-switch equalizer. The energies of the series-connected SCs were preferentially redistributed by the equalizer to the cell(s) having the lowest voltage, resulting in the elimination of the cell voltage imbalance and subsequent uniformity of the cell voltages.
