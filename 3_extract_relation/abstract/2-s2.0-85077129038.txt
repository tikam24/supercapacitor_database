At present, the ultra-capacitor energy storage system(UESS) is widely used in Metro-Transit systems to recycle braking energy. In order to realize the recovery of the braking energy generated by high-power traction motors of the Metro vehicles and reduce the power of the UESS, this paper proposes a control strategy of UESS based on V-I droop characteristics. Compared with the traditional master-slave control, this strategy has no influence on the ability of UESS to stabilize the DC bus voltage and does not require any communication between modules, so that the system owns complete modular features. At last, the experimental results have verified the proposed strategy.
