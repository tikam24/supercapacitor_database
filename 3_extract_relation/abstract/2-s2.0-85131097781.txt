Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) have great potential for applications utilizing their unique mechanical, electrical, and magnetic properties in numerous applications, including fuel cells, catalyst support and supercapacitor material. This research addresses the effect of adding indium nitrate and nickel nitrate at a ratio of 2:1 over a polyacrylonitrile (PAN) precursor solution to produce CNF webs using an electrospinning and pyrolysis process. The ferromagnetic behavior was examined by a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The carbon nanofibers prepared from 25 wt% of indium nitrate and nickel nitrate over PAN exhibited ferromagnetic behavior with a magnetization of 105.6 m-emu/g at room temperature. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic chargeâ€“discharge (GCD) analysis were used to examine the electrochemical properties of the sample. The specific capacitance of the sample at a current density of 1 A/g was 195 F/g with a specific surface of 277.5 m2/g and the average pore size was 2.43 nm. The energy density of the sample was 27 Wh/kg, and the power density was around 498.4 W/kg. The cycle stability indicated excellent usability at 95.7% after 1000 cycles at a current density of 5 A/g.
