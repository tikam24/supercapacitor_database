A new carbon material (NCM-R) was studied, which has a number of unique properties: a high specific surface area according to the BET (SBET = 3270 m2/g), a high micropore volume (~1.7 cm3/g), and a very high specific capacity of 870 F/g. The NCM-R is obtained by carbonizing a mixture of dextrin and graphene oxide and activating the carbonizate with potassium hydroxide. Based on the charging and discharge characteristics, it was established that the NCM-R is a promising material for supercapacitor electrodes with very small (diapason of a few seconds) discharge times and anodes of asymmetric supercapacitors with high specific energy. It is assumed that a large specific capacity is due to the reversible chemical attachment of hydrogen atoms to the carbon skeleton when the NCM-R charge is in the cathode region of the potentials.
