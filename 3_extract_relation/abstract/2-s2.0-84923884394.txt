This paper deals with inversion-based control of EVs with Hybrid Energy Storage System based on battery and supercapacitors. Using inversion rules of Energetic Macroscopic Representation (EMR), a systematic control structure can be deduced. However, it points out the possibility of an algebraic loop issue. Furthermore, it may result in computation problems. This paper aims to exhibit some solutions to avoid this problem in an efficient way.
