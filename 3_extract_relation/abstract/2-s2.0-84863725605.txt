Here we demonstrate the fine tuning of the supercapacitive performance of nanoporous carbon electrodes with different pore diameters and found that pore diameter of the electrodes, which maintain better electrochemical performance with excellent cycle life, dictates the value of specific capacitance that increases significantly from 108 to 186 F g -1 with increasing the pore diameter from 3 to 6.5 nm.
