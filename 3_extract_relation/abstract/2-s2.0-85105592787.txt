Hexagonal nanostructured cobalt oxide @ N-doped MWCNT /polypyyrole (Co3O4/PPy@N-MWCNT) composite was produced by an ultrasonication-mediated solvothermal method for electrochemical supercapacitor and glucose sensor applications. The structural and electrochemical properties of the Co3O4/PPy@N-MWCNT were confirmed by various spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The as-prepared electrode showed an excellent capacitance of ∼872 F/g at 0.5 A/g with a capacitance retention of 96.8 %, even after 10,000 cycles. In addition, analysis of the sensing activity of the composite materials towards the glucose detection showed excellent electrochemical sensing performance that includes the glucose linear limit of (10 to 0.15) μm, detection sensitivity of 195.72 μA/cm2/mM, and lower detection value of S = 0.07327 μA/cm2 @ R2 = 0.99. The as-prepared composite material can be a promising candidate for the electrochemical supercapacitor and the efficient sensing of glucose.
