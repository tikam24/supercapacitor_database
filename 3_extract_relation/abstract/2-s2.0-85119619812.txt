To ensure enhanced supercapacitor performance, materials with good electrical conductivity, high porosity, and large surface area are required. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) satisfy these requirements. The proposed bimetallic MOFs exhibit good electrical conductivity and can be expected to produce electrodes comprising Ni-Zn MOF yolk-shell structures for symmetric devices, yielding energy and power densities of 33.25 Wh Kg−1 and 900 W Kg−1, respectively, in a 6 M gel electrolyte. These results will aid in the design of custom MOFs as electrode materials in energy storage devices.
