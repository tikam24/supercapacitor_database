The synergetic effects of mixed transition metal compounds have demonstrated great potential in improving the electrochemical performance of materials. In this work, large scale of ammonium/bimetallic phosphates (NH4CoxNi1−xPO4·H2O) with layered nanostructures are synthesized by a facile one-step solvothermal method. The tuning effects of Co/Ni molar ratios on the crystal structure and morphology of NH4CoxNi1−xPO4·H2O are systematically studied by XRD, FTIR, SEM, TEM. It is revealed that the synergistic effects of cobalt and nickel may significantly influence the crystal structure and morphologies of NH4CoxNi1−xPO4·H2O, exposing more CoO6 and NiO6 octahedra active sites for redox reactions, improving the surface coverage of the redox species. Electrochemistry tests prove that the sample with a Co/Ni ratio of 2:3 which has layered nanoplate structure and abundant uniform pores, and exhibits the highest specific capacitance of 1567 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and long-term cycling stability of 97.6 % compared with single-component ammonium nickel or cobalt phosphate hydrate. An asymmetric cell is constructed using NH4CoxNi1−xPO4·H2O (Co/Ni 2:3) and activated carbon with an operation potential from 0 to 1.65 V. This asymmetric device presented a high energy density of 37.4 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 826 W kg−1. More importantly, the device also displayed a good long-term cycling stability with 91.2 % capacity retention after 5000 cycles.
