Graphene ink was produced using graphene, polyvinylidene fluoride, and acetylene black with 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone in a ball mill and the thickness and viscosity of the ink were characterized. Afterwards, the conductive silver ink was screen printed and thermally cured onto a poly(ethylene terephthalate) substrate. In addition, the prepared graphene ink was screen-printed onto the conductive silver layer and dried to create a flexible supercapacitor electrode. A PVA-H2SO4 gel was coated onto the flexible electrode as electrolyte. Finally, a symmetric supercapacitor was successfully assembled and shows a specific capacitance of 190.6 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 and a maximum energy density of 16.94 W h kg-1. The three devices connected in series to light up a light-emitting diode. The printed flexible electrodes created using a simple process could play an important role in the energy storage field.
