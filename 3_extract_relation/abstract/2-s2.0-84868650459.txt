Polyaniline (PANI) has been deposited on a carbon template by chemical oxidation of aniline chloride in acidic aqueous medium using sodium persulfate as oxidant. Two kinds of templates were used: array of aligned multiwall carbon nanotubes (CNTs) grown on silicon substrate and ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) material. Electronic structure of composites was examined using near-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Analysis of the spectra showed that PANI developed on the CNT surface is mainly protonated while it contains a marked amount of imine (=N-) nitrogen when deposited into the porous of OMC. Testing of electrochemical cell indicated enhancement of performance of composite electrodes as compared with unsupported PANI. Â© 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
