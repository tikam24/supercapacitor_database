Nowadays our modern society is demanding flexible, low cost and lightweight electrochemical energy storage systems, which are very applicable in various fields ranging from portable consumer electronics to large industrial areas and energy management sectors. Among the various energy storehouse systems, flexible supercapacitors are amazing devices due to their high surface area, flexibility, lightweight, shape versatility and significant energy density compared to traditional energy storage systems with unique properties of being environmentally friendly. Also, many research articles to date are based on research papers published in reputed journals. But patent-giving studies are rarely published. So in this research article, we have tried to publish a study of patents published on supercapacitors. In this regard, this review article summarizes the latest research advances on various carbon and polymer-based materials, describing the fabrication methods of electrodes, designing concepts and characterization values of their materials in high-efficiency flexible supercapacitors with relevant applications in the public sector, electronics department, medical field that has reported here.
