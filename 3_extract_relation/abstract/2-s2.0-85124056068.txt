Pure and varying weigh ratio of Sm2 O3-TiO2 modified polyaniline nanocomposite has been successfully synthesized using in situ polymerization of aniline solution with Sm2O3-TiO2 binary oxide. The nanocomposite have been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-photoelectron microscopy (XPS), Field emission-scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and LCR meter. The XRD results show synthesis anatase TiO2 phase with tetragonal structure and (monoclinic and cubic) mixture structure of Sm2 O3. The FE-SEM and TEM measurements appear preparing spherical nanoparticles that covered fiber morphology of polyaniline and successfully in situ polymerization process. The TGA measurements are obtain high thermal stability for polyaniline after incorporation by Sm2O3-TiO2 binary oxide nanoparticles. LCR measurement is obtained that the DC conductivity, dielectric constant and dielectric loss of nanocomposite is larger than pure polyaniline and the electric properties increase with increasing the concentration of nanoparticles.
