Adenosine triphosphates (ATP) are excellent energy-carrying molecules due to their phosphate functional groups that link through phosphodiester bonds, while halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) are layered mineral materials which exist naturally and have a large number of active sites for energy storage reinforcement. The use of HNTs and ATP in combination will provide a new approach to producing advance electrode materials for energy storage devices. Herein, a simple and cost-effective chemical method is introduced to fabricate a composite electrode of functionalized halloysite nanotubes (FHA) loaded with a pyridinium-based ionic liquid (PyPS) and conductive polymer, poly ortho amino phenol (FHA-PyPS-POAP) for use in supercapacitor. The prepared FHA-PyPS-POAP electrode exhibited outstanding electrochemical behavior with a capacitance being up to 626 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in a 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte while preserving remarkable rate capability and indicating superior cycle stability. Besides, the FHA-PyPS-POAP electrodes employed in the two-electrode system with a capacitance of 306 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and possessed an energy density of 20.8 W h kg−1 at 350 W kg−1. Also, the symmetrical supercapacitor shows capacitance retention remaining 93.9% for FHA-PyPS-POAP//FHA-PyPS-POAP at 8 A g−1 over 5000 cycles. Thus, these promising findings demonstrated a high potential as a significant application in developing energy storage devices with enhanced energy and power concentrations.
