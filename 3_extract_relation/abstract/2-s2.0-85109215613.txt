As micro-supercapacitors are more and more widely used in the field of energy storage, how to fabricate micro-supercapacitors simply and quickly is very important. We demonstrated a one-step and effective method for the fabrication of flexible micro-supercapacitors. Irradiated by the double-pulse femtosecond laser, the polyimide was converted to a conductive holey carbon with uniform pore size distribution. At the same time, the scribing of the electrode is completed. Compared with the single-pulse femtosecond laser, the specific capacitance of holey carbon electrode prepared by double-pulse femtosecond laser was higher than that by single-pulse femtosecond laser. This one-step approach of the fabrication of holey carbon electrodes with excellent capacitive properties makes it possible to integrate micro-supercapacitors as miniaturized energy storage units with other micro/nano portable electronic devices in the future.
