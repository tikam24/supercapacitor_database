As the world moves towards renewable and sustainable energy sources, the need for systems that can quickly and safely store this energy is also rising. Supercapacitors (SCs) are among the most promising alternatives to conventional lithium-ion batteries. SCs are more stable, have higher-power densities, and can be charged much faster. However, SCs have their issues, and three of the main drawbacks of current SCs are 1) lower energy densities, 2) high cost of production, and 3) safety concerns in wearable devices. In this review, we discuss recent progress made in supramolecule-based SCs (SSCs). In supramolecular systems, molecules are held stable using non-covalent-type bonds. This allows for a flexible system in which the molecular interaction sites can easily break and reform at low energy, allowing for exposure of highly active sites and self-healing. When heterometal atoms are introduced into these supramolecular systems, this allows for further activation of the metal sites through the metal-metal interaction along with the metal-ligand interactions. This review discusses different types of SSCs (carbon-based and metal-incorporated) that have been utilized in recent years depending on their synthesis process. The working principle of SSCs and the utilization of different supramolecular elements that enhance the performance of SCs have also been discussed.
