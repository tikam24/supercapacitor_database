A hierarchical nanostructure consisting of graphene sheets intercalated by clusters of Fe3O4 nanocystals is developed for high-performance supercapacitor electrode. Here we show that the negatively charged graphene oxide (GO) and positively charged Fe3O4 clusters enable a strong electrostatic interaction, generating a hierarchical 3D nanostructure, which gives rise to the intercalated composites through a rational hydrothermal process. The electrocapacitive behavior of the resultant composites is systematically investigated by cyclic voltammeter and galvanostatic charge-discharge techniques, where a positive synergistic effect between graphene and Fe3O4 clusters is identified. A maximum specific capacitance of 169 F g-1 is achieved in the Fe3O4 clusters decorated with effectively reduced graphene oxide (Fe3O4-rGO-12h), which is much higher than those of rGO (101 F g-1) and Fe3O4 (68 F g-1) at the current density of 1 Ag-1. Moreover, this intercalated hierarchical nanostructure demonstrates a good capacitance retention, retaining over 88% of the initial capacity after 1000 cycles.
