The present knowledge regarding the reasons why solutions of conductive polymers (ICP) can not be made and the most recent status of insight into feasibility and properties of dispersions is being reviewed. Dispersions are now available with conductivity values exceeding 200 S/cm. New applications in the supercapacitor field are becoming accessible.
