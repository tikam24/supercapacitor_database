Chitosan/Graphene Oxide-MWCNT/polyaniline (CS/GM/PANI) ternary nanocomposite has been synthesized via in situ polymerization of aniline in the presence of CS/GM. The Morphology of nanocomposites was studied by Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, as well as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Futthermore, the supercapacitive behavior of the CS-based samples was investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (CD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques in 0.5 M Na2SO4. It is found that the CS/GM/PANI nanocomposite displays much higher specific capacitance along with better cycle stability than those of CS and CS/GM. The specific capacitance of 609.2 F g−1 (48.5 m F cm−2) was obtained for the CS/GM/PANI at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. In addition, the synthesized nanocomposite retained 96% of the initial capacitance after 500 cycles of charge-discharge at a current density of 5 A g−1. The improvement in the supercapacitive behavior of CS/GM/PANI may be attributed to the porous structure and pseudocapacitive mechanism of charge-storage.
