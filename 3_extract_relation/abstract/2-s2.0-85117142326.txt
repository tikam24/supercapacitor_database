A flexible nickel foam (NF) based reduced Holey Graphene Oxide (rHGO) wrapping on NiO@NF hybrid supercapacitor electrode is fabricated using facile hydrothermal reaction followed by HGO dispersion dipping to achieve an efficient, bendable and scalable supercapacitor with high capacitance for wearable smart device usage. The sample electrode reveals a typical wrapping morphology of porous rHGO spreading on uniform nickel oxide crystal layer while exposing crystals through recurrent rHGO slits. Benefiting from this morphology and optimization of fabrication parameters, the sample electrode gains better electrochemical performance from higher electric double layer capacitance incorporation and more efficient electrolyte ion transportation, with less than 0.1 Î© equivalent series resistance (ESR), 752.9 F/g of capacitance, and 90% capacitance retention under 10 A/g current density. The sample electrode is then made into an all-solid-state supercapacitor device possessing 0.267 Wh/m2 energy density at a power density of 8.14 W/m2, and the bendable fact of the device endows it 97% capacitance retention after 500 times of curving, making it especially suitable as flexible energy provider. This simple fabrication method should shed light on flexible hybrid supercapacitor development.
