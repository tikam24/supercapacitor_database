Nanocomposites consisting of carbon materials and metal oxides are generally preferred as anodes in electrochemical energy storage. However, their low capacitance limits the achieved energy density of supercapacitors (SCs) in aqueous electrolytes. Herein, we propose a rapid combustion strategy to construct a novel electrode architecture—ultrasmall Fe2O3anchoring on carbon nanotubes (FeO-CNT)—as a superhydrophilic and flexible anode for SCs. In 1 M Na2SO4aqueous electrolyte, such an FeO-CNT-20 anode presents a high capacitance of 483.4 mF cm-2(326 F g-1) at 1 mA cm-2. The aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor devices (ASCs) assembled by FeO-CNT-20 and MnO2present a maximum operating potential of 2.0 V with a high areal energy density of 0.11 mWh cm-2at a power density of 0.5 mW cm-2. The flexible solid-state ASCs display an energy density of 0.99 mWh cm-3at 14.3 mW cm-3. The rapidly prepared FeO-CNT not only offers an attractive electrode for SCs but also would open up exciting new avenues to the rational design and large-scale preparation of Fe2O3-based nanocomposites for electrochemical energy storage.
