Nickel oxide-titania nanotube array hybrid grown on titanium substrate (NiO-TiO2/Ti) is designed as supercapacitor electrode for energy-storage application. The electroactive NiO is fully incorporated into independent titania nanotubes to form NiO-TiO2 nanotube array hybrid through differential pulse voltammetry electrodeposition process and thermal dehydration process. NiO nanoparticles are uniformly anchored on TiO2 nanotube walls to keep open pore mouth of nanochannels. The charge transfer resistance at the interface of electrode/electrolyte is highly declined from 76.3ω of TiO2/Ti to 1.1ω of NiO-TiO2/Ti. The electrochemical performance is highly improved from the electrical double-layer capacitance of 0.16mFcm-2 for TiO2/Ti to Faradaic capacitance of 18.75mFcm-2 for NiO-TiO2/Ti in 1.0M KOH electrolyte due to high electroactivity of NiO. The capacitance retention after 1000 cycles achieves 83.86% for NiO-TiO2/Ti and 97.49% for TiO2/Ti. The highly electrochemical stability of TiO2/Ti contributes to high cycling stability of NiO-TiO2/Ti in a continuous charge-discharge process. The superior capacitance of NiO-TiO2/Ti nanotube array hybrid is mostly attributed to its accessible redox reactive sites of NiO nanoparticles on TiO2 nanotube walls. NiO-TiO2/Ti nanotube array hybrid can act as a promising energy-storage electrode material.
