Porous carbon is widely used as an electrode material in energy storage due to its large specific surface area, high durability and unique internal structure, but the development of new energy storage systems requires renewable, low-cost and environmentally friendly electrode materials. And biomass, as one of the most widely used renewable resources on earth, has great value for exploitation. At present, in the field of energy storage, biomass carbon based supercapacitors are favored by researchers for their excellent performance. This paper classifies biomass-derived carbon according to the source of carbon precursors, highlights the latest research results on biomass-derived carbon as electrode materials for supercapacitors, and finally discusses the challenges faced by biomass-derived carbon materials in building efficient energy storage systems.
