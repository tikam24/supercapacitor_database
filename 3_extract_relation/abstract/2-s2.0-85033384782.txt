Three-dimensional (3D) poly-rowed copper hydroxide [Cu(OH)2] nanorods nanostructures have been synthesized on copper foam slices, using copper foam as copper source, current collector and 3D substrate, through a facile and scalable one-step anodization method. The synthesized products can be directly used as binder free electrodes of supercapacitors. The synthesized material exhibited a 3D connect and quasi connect network structure which can facilitate ion mobility and increase the amount of active sites for redox reactions. These merits together lead to a high areal specific capacitance of 1.889 F cm−2 at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1, excellent rate capability (75.39% retention upon increasing the current density by 15 times), low intrinsic resistance (0.792 Ω cm−2) and good cycling stability (87.23% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles), demonstrating a good potential for high performance energy storage devices applications.
