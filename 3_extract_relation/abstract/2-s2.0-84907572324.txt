Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with a honeycomb arrangement were designed onto graphene as the electrochemical electrodes. The honeycomb arrangement provided a relatively larger surface area to store more ions with a stronger structure to maintain long-term surface morphology. The combination of CNTs and graphene exhibited robust durability during electrochemical performance. The pseudo-capacitive property of IrO2was coated onto the CNT surface to enhance the capacitance. Cyclic voltammetry and charging-discharging measurements were used to examine the electrochemical behaviors. The CNTs/graphene and IrO2/CNTs/graphene capacitances were 3.93 and 129.40 F/g, respectively. The designed electrode demonstrates excellent characteristics and is appropriate for electrochemical applications.
