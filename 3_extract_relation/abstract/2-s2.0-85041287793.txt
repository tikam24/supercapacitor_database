A MoS2-coated CoS2 composite has been prepared successfully via a one-step hydrothermal method. This CoS2@MoS2 hybrid material has a distinct morphology with few-layer MoS2 wrapping the CoS2 nanoparticles. Serving as a supercapacitor electrode, the obtained CoS2@MoS2 hybrid material exhibits a remarkable specific capacitance of 1038 F/g, a high rate capability of 71.7%, and excellent cycling stability of 84.76% retention after 10000 cycles. The superior electrochemical properties of the CoS2@MoS2 nanocomposite are attributed to the synergistic effects between the layered MoS2 and conductive CoS2.
