The electrification of modern aircrafts is becoming a major objective due to increased reliability of electromechanical actuators replacing mechanical, hydraulic and pneumatic actuators. Thus, a local DC Power Distribution System has to be able to sustain unidirectional or even bidirectional power flow to and from electromechanical devices. Because the mechanical source (Turbine Engine) is unidirectional, some storage and dissipation systems are necessary to store or/and dissipate the returned energy to maintain the DC bus voltage to the reference value. Different power management strategies are proposed and compared. The development of experimental test benches is necessary to validate these strategies. In this paper, we present a 3kW test bench, emulating a unidirectional source that supplies a bidirectional load with the help of a hybrid system using supercapacitors and a dissipation system.
