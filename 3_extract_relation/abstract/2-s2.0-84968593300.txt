This paper considers the issue of controlling a fuel cell and a supercapacitor connected to a DC bus through converters. The controller objectives are to regulate the DC bus voltage and the supercapacitor current must track a given reference. The controller is designed using Lyapunuv stability tools. A supervisory system is designed for providing a supercapacitor current reference in order to achieve a control strategy aiming the power split between the power sources accounting for the fuel cell limited dynamics and rated power and on other hand, the recovery power at a braking or a decelerating mode must be stored in the SC device., It is formally shown, using a theoretical analysis and simulation results, that the proposed controller and power management system meet all the objectives.
