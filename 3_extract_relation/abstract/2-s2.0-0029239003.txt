Supercapacitors are now attracting much attention as an electric vehicle power source. The present study focuses on redox supercapacitors with electronically conducting polymers as electrode materials. Performance data of a symmetric supercapacitor based on p-doped poly(pyrrole), of an unsymmetric supercapacitor based on p-doped poly(pyrrole) and poly(3- methylthiophene), and of a symmetric sypercapacitor based on p- and n-doped poly(dithieno[3,4-b:3′,4′-d]thiophene) are here compared.
