Specific requirements in the design of modern electronic devices have increased popularity of flexible printed circuits. In recent years, with the application of new materials and their printing on a flexible substrate, a large number of new flexible sensors have been developed. In this paper, the implementation of a device made by ink-jet printing on a flexible substrate is described. Fully flexible prototype is composed of sensors, microcontroller, wireless communication and energy harvesting power supply, which is suitable for wearable applications. Ultra-low-power microcontroller is used for reading data from sensors and for managing short range wireless communication. Supercapacitor and energy harvesting from photovoltaic cell are used to power device. The designed prototype is mounted on the back side of solar panel, which is also flexible. The paper describes the procedures used in design process and gives basic explanation of electronic subsystems. The first prototype proved to be a functional solution and can be efficiently used in applications with flexible sensors.
