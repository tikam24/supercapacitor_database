Charging a capacitor is different to supplying power to a resistive load. With an ideal voltage source a fully discharged capacitor takes five time constants to reach its full charge. From a current source this depends on the current rating. Therefore a capacitor charger can be characterised by the associated total charge. Due to supercapacitors' (SC) large time constant fast charging becomes problematic. The charging topology presented uses a coupled inductor and a voltage source rated higher than the capacitor rated voltage to charge a SC bank divided in to two parts. One part is charged by the higher voltage source and the other by the energy stored in the inductor. Power factor correction can be achieved without using any additional components. This paper presents results from a 3000 joule proof of concept prototype.
