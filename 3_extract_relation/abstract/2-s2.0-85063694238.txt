The present research work aimed to study the electrochemical performance of the rGO/PPY/PANI ternary nanocomposite electrodes for supercapacitor applications. The nanocomposites have been prepared by physical blending of rGO with conducting polymers PANI and PPY in five different ratios. The prepared nanocomposites were examined by XRD, IR, Raman, SEM, and XAS characterizations, and from the results, it was found that ternary nanocomposites formed in cauliflower shape, in which PPY and PANI nanoparticles are decorated on to the rGO matrix. In addition, the electrochemical performance of the prepared nanocomposites were studied using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic studies. The highest values of capacitance, energy density, and power density values achieved were 317.5 F/g, 254 Wh/kg, and 1508.9 W/kg for nanocomposite, respectively, as expected from the synergistic properties of two types of electrode materials resulting in the nanocomposites with hybrid and improved properties. Further, the cyclic stability was also analyzed by performing 4000 long cycles, and the retained capacitance during such long cycles indicates the high potential of rGO/PPY/PANI ternary nanocomposites as electrodes for future energy requirement.
