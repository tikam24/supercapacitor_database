The lithium trivanadate (LiV3O8) thin films were deposited over stainless steel (SS) substrates by spray pyrolysis method. The material deposited at an optimized substrate temperature of 350°C and at an annealing temperature of 500°C (LV350_500/SS) performed better in electrochemical properties. The structural and surface morphological characteristics of the as deposited materials were determined using the X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) analyses. The stable V5+ state was observed for the as-prepared LiV3O8 thin film in the X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectrum. The electrochemical performance of the thin films were characterized using a three-electrode configuration with Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, thin film material as the working electrode, and the platinum wire as the counter electrode. The 1 M LiNO3 aqueous solution was taken to be the electrolyte. LV350_500/SS made using a Li/V molar concentration of 0.1: 0.3 displayed an initial specific discharge capacitance value of 695 Fg−1 at a current density of 0.25 Ag−1, in the voltage range of -0.4 V to 0.4 V. But, the LV350_500/SS prepared using Li/V molar concentration of (0.05: 0.15) showed a low specific capacitance value of 181 Fg−1. A symmetric supercapacitor device made with the LV350_500/SS thin film as the electrodes and poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene)/2D Graphene Oxide (PVdF-HFP/GO) composite polymer membrane as the electrolyte showed an excellent specific discharge capacitance value of 31 Fg−1 for a current density of 0.25 Ag−1. The calculated specific energy density and specific power density values were found to be 69 Whkg−1 and 1002 Wkg−1 respectively, for the above symmetric device.
