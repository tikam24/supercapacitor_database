Following the thread of the adsorption-doping principle, low-cost precursors of chicken egg and polymeric adsorbent are used to synthesize heteroatom-doped porous carbon for electrochemical capacitors. Organics contained in the egg play role of an accelerant to promote the breaking up of the spherical adsorbent derived carbon spheres. The obtained carbon contains >93 at.% of carbon and not <5 at.% of oxygen. A small amount of nitrogen, and a trace amount of sulfur and phosphorus are also identified. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area is calculated to be 1514 m2 g−1, and vast majority of that is contributed from micropores with size of 0.38–0.65 nm. In three-electrode and symmetric-two-electrode configurations, electrodes show 354.6 and 289.7 F g−1 specific capacitances in aqueous electrolyte, respectively. Energy density of 9.9 W h kg−1 at power density of 125 W kg−1 is yielded from the super-capacitor device. After 5000 cycles at 3 A g−1, more than 96% residual capacity suggests a good cycling stability. Results further demonstrate the feasibility of the adsorption doping strategy. Findings of present scheme also show that a low-cost precursor of egg can be used to prepare cost-effective electroactive carbon for promising supercapacitors via the strategy.
