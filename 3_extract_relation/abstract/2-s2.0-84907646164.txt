Present investigation reports, spray pyrolytic deposition of Mn: Co3O4 thin films onto the stainless steel by spray pyrolysis, at the deposition temperature 573 Â± 2 K via aqueous route. Prepared electrodes were characterized structurally and morphologically by means of XRD and SEM. Also optical and electrochemical characterizations were carried out in depth. Structural characterization confirms face centered cubic and tetragonal body centered crystal structures for Co3O4 and Mn3O4 respectively. The rough granular morphology is observed form SEM. Electrochemical study reveals the pseudo capacitive as well as double layer behavior with optimum specific capacitance 485.29 F/g at the scan rate 1 mV/s in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Specific energy, specific power and columbic efficiency were calculated using chronopotentiometric technique. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was carried out in the frequency range 1 mHz-1 MHz. Randles equivalent circuit parameters associated with the operative cell are reported.
