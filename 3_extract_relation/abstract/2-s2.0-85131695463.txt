We have synthesised a novel ternary composite GO/PANI/CuFe2 O4 byoxidative-polymerisation technique with enhanced electrochemical performance. The analysis like XRD, FTIR, HR-SEM and EDS confirm the successful formation of material. The ternary supercapacitor electrode material GO/PANI/CuFe2O4 consists of GO which acts as a substrate, PANI polymer and CuFe2 O4 that provides a more conducting nature. The GO/PANI/CuFe2O4 ternary gives the highest specific capacitance value of 790.12 F/g and 357.28 F/g at 1 mV/s and 1 A/g from 3E and symmetric 2E device system. The system exhibits a wide 1.2 V potential window. From the symmetric system, GO/PANI/CuFe2O4 had high specific energy of 71.45 Wh/kg at 1 A/g and 5983.90 W/kg specific power at 20 A/g with 78.77% retention of its original capacitance after 5000 cycles. The ternary system exhibited the least R ct value of 8.72 Î©. The synergistic effect between the individual components is the primary key for its outstanding electrochemical performance.
