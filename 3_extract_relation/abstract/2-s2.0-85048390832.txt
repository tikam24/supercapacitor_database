A novel NiFe-LDH/RGO/CNFs composite was produced by using a facile one-step hydrothermal method as electrode for supercapacitor. Compared with NiFe-LDH/CNFs, NiFe-LDH/CNTs and NiFe-LDH/RGO, NiFe-LDH/RGO/CNFs demonstrated a high specific capacitance of 1330.2 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and a super rate capability of 64.2% from 1 to 20 A g-1, indicating great potential for supercapacitor application. Additionally, an asymmetric supercapacitor using NiFe-LDH/RGO/CNFs composite as positive electrode material and activated carbon as negative electrode material was assembled. The asymmetric supercapacitor can work in the voltage range of 0-1.57 V. It displayed high energy density of 33.7 W h kg-1 at power density of 785.8 W kg-1 and excellent cycling stability with 97.1% of the initial capacitance after 2500 cycles at 8 A g-1. Two flexible AC//LDH-RGO-CNFs ASC devices connected in series were able to light up a red LED indicator after being fully charged. The results demonstrate that the AC//LDH-RGO-CNFs ASC has a promising potential in commercial application.
