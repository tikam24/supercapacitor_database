The polymer-based flexible substrates have contributed to the development of flexible supercapacitors. The polymer-based flexible supercapacitor had significantly enhanced the energy storage performance and opens the possibility of supercapacitor commercialization toward practical application. Supercapacitors with conducting polymer-based showed unparalleled advantages compared to other electrode materials. The application of conductive agents (i.e., conducting polymer) and linkers burden and weaken the energy produced by the devices compared with metal oxides. Thus, this chapter mainly explains the preparation of polymer-based electrode materials and understanding the intercorrelation between physicochemical and performance properties via various prominent characterization techniques. Besides, the recent findings on the capacitance of three types of polymer reinforced flexible materials, including electrochemical double-layer capacitor (EDLC), pseudocapacitor, and hybrid capacitor, have been highlighted and discussed.
