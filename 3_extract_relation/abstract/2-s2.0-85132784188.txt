To compensate for the slow dynamic response of fuel cell system (FCS) in fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles (FCHEVs), battery and supercapacitor are widely used as auxiliary supply energy sources in FCHEVs. How to reasonably allocate the required power among the three energy sources, reduce the fuel consumption and the SOC fluctuations of auxiliary energy sources becomes a tough problem to be solved. In this paper, we propose an energy management strategy (EMS) based on fuzzy control, considering the multiple constraints of hydrogen consumption and auxiliary energy SOC fluctuations of FCHEV. In this paper, the ant colony algorithm (ACA) is used for the first time to optimize the membership functions parameters of the dual fuzzy controller. The results obtained are verified in Matlab/Simulink. The proposed ACA optimized EMS can effectively reduce the equivalent hydrogen consumption and the SOC fluctuation of battery and supercapacitor by proving in four typical driving conditions.
