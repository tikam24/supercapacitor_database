This study focused on the preparation and electrochemical properties of bamboo-based activated carbons (ACs) through carbonization and subsequent activation with steam and non-aqueous electrolyte solutions. The specific surface areas and the capacitances of samples ranged from 445 to 1,025 m 2/g and from 5 to 60 F/g, respectively, depending on the activation conditions. The sample activated at 900 Â°C for 60 min under our experimental conditions exhibited the highest capacitance and the largest specific surface area.
