The exceptional and unusual properties of hierarchically structured inorganic materials have led to a major push forward in related research and development. In the present study, a simple modified version of the room-temperature one-pot co-precipitation method was employed to synthesize Mn3O4 nanoparticles which then self-aggregated into mesoporous microstructures. The obtained structures were used as for the electrodes in electrochemical capacitors. The as-obtained Mn3O4 microstructures exhibited acceptable specific capacitances of 260 and 180 F g-1 at current densities of 1 and 5 A g-1, respectively, with 98% capacity retention after 2000 cycles.
