Ni1-xCuxO1-δ (where x = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15 and 0.20) nanoparticles were prepared by chemical precipitation method. The XRD patterns revealed the formation of well-crystalline single phase FCC geometry. From FTIR spectra, the peaks appeared at 3400 − 3700 cm−1 are assigned to O-H bonds and the peaks appeared at 500 cm−1 are due to M-O vibration bonds. SEM photographs indicated the presence of spherical grains in the samples. The electrochemical characteristics of the materials were studied by cyclic voltammetry in 6 M KOH. The highest capacitance of 1269.5 Fg−1 was obtained for Ni0.80Cu0.20O1-δ electrode at the scan rate of 10 mVS−1.
