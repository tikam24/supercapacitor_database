In this paper, a new control method for DSTATCOM (Distribution STATIC Compensator) applied in IEEE 13-bus industrial distribution system is proposed. The operation of this control method enables D-STATCOM to mitigate every type of voltage distortions caused by Single Line to Ground (SLG), Double Lines to Ground (DLG) and Three Lines to Ground (TLG) faults. This new method is based on two factors; firstly, integrating D-STATCOM and supercapacitor energy storage system and secondly, using of feedback in controller system and determining proportional gain of Proportional-Integral (PI) controller, intelligently. In addition, the 12-pulse DSTATCOM configuration with IGBT is designed and the graphic based models of the D-STATCOM are developed using the PSCAD/EMTDC electromagnetic transient simulation program. As a case study, a 13-bus IEEE industrial distribution system is simulated to verify operation of proposed D-STATCOM.
