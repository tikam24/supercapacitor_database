In this study, reduced graphene oxide- Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> (RGO-Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>) nanocomposite is fabricated using simple electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method followed by an electrochemical reduction process. It is characterized using atomic force microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> nanoparticles with 20-50 nm in diameter are uniformly formed on RGO. Electrochemical properties of nanocomposite are characterized by cyclic voltammetery, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. According to the galvanostatic charge/discharge analysis, RGO-Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>/SS presents specific capacitance (C<inf>s</inf>) of 154 F g<sup>-1</sup> at current density of 1 A g<sup>-1</sup>, which is higher than that of RGO/SS (81 F g<sup>-1</sup>) in Na<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> electrolyte. Also, the electrochemical behaviors show that addition of three kind of surfactant, i.e. sodium dodecyl sulphate, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, t-octyl phenoxy polyethoxyethanol (Triton X-100) to Na<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> aqueous solution can improve the C<inf>s</inf> of RGO-Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>/SS electrodes. RGO-Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>/SS in Na<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> electrolyte containing Triton X-100 shows maximum C<inf>s</inf> of 236 F g<sup>-1</sup> at 1 A g<sup>-1</sup> which retains 97% of initial capacitance after 500 cycles.
