Considerable efforts have been given on the advancement of the electrical energy storage system. Supercapacitor-an electrochemical energy storage device gains significant interest over batteries and fuel cells because of its high-power density, excellent cyclic stability, and easy handling. However, the poor energy density of supercapacitors has accelerated the research to explore different types of material for the betterment of the device. Various combinations of materials used for the electrode, electrolyte, separator, and current collector are developed for the supercapacitors to achieve good performance. The choice of electrolyte influences the working electrochemical potential window of the device. Different types of electrolytes such as aqueous, organic, and ionic liquid have been discussed with their merits and demerits. Among all other components of the supercapacitor, the choice of electrode material mainly determines the electrochemical behavior of the device. In this vein, various types of material ranging from carbon-based electric double-layer capacitor electrode to transition metal oxide and conducting polymer-based pseudocapacitor electrode materials are discussed in detail. Apart from commonly studied material, few recent emerging electrode materials such as metal-organic framework and MXene have been also discussed, considering the potential application soon. It also discusses the various types of current collectors and separators used in supercapacitors.
