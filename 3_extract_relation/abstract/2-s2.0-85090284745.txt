Supercapacitors (SCs) are promising for bridging the power/energy gap between conventional capacitors and batteries/fuel cells. However, challenges remain in the improvement of electrode materials toward high capacitive performance. Electrospun nanofibers, prepared via facile and low-cost electrospinning techniques, exhibit superior electrochemical performance in SCs due to their unique morphology and intriguing properties, demonstrating great potential for improving the performance of SCs. Herein, we review the recent progress in electrospun one-dimensional nanofibers as electrode materials for SCs. Three categories of electrospun electrode nanomaterials (i.e., carbon nanofibers, carbon nanofiber composites, and carbon-free transition metal oxides) are discussed with design and optimization strategies. Moreover, critical insights into the electronic conductivity, electrochemical response and durability of electrospun nanofibers are reviewed. Finally, we conclude with an outlook on how these discussions and insights open opportunities for electrospun nanofibers (as electrode materials) to expand their potential application in next-generation SCs.
