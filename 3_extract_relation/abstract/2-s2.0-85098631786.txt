The concept of multifunctional hybrid composites has generated considerable research interest in the past two decades. A very significant advancement in this area has been the development of truly multifunctional components, which can simultaneously handle structural and nonstructural functionality in composites. Success in the development of stiff, strong and lightweight continuous fiber structural composites with the capability of energy storage has led to the evolution of “structural power composites.” Among the many structural power composites studied, significant progress has been made in recent years in structural supercapacitor (SSC) composites. The ability of SSCs to carry mechanical loads while simultaneously storing/releasing electrical energy has enabled their potential applications in many fields, such as portable electronics, electric vehicles and aerospace vehicles. In this review, we assess state-of-the-art advances in SSC composites in terms of the development of carbon fiber-based electrodes, solid polymer electrolytes and separators. The fabrication process and performance characterization of SSCs are discussed. Finally, the challenges and future opportunities in SSC composites research are presented.
