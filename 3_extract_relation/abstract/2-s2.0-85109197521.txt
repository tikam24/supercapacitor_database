In this study, thin film samples of undoped and Co-doped titanium oxide (TiO2) nanostructures were deposited on conducting ITO glass substrate. Influence of Co-dopant on TiO2 thin film for potential application in optoelectronic and supercapacitor devices was investigated. Microstructural studies revealed Co-doped TiO2 films possess fewer and narrower pores. Particles of the Co-doped TiO2 films are relatively larger, closely packed without any observable pin hole or crack. Increased dopant concentrations also improved the crystallinity and average grain sizes of the films but with slight distortions in their crystal lattices. Films’ crystal sizes lied between 47.51 and 57.23 nm. Elemental composition study confirmed the presence of all elements attributable to the films accordingly. Optical studies demonstrated the films’ high transparency across the visible light spectrum and that it is dependent on dopant concentration. Red shift towards higher wavelengths is observed in the absorption band edges upon dopant increasing concentration. The result also led to tunning of bandgaps and Urbach energies of TiO2 structure from 3.28 to 3.22 eV and 2.37 to 1.95 eV, respectively. The electrochemical properties of the deposited Co-doped and pure TiO2 thin films were investigated with the aid of analyses of cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) studies. The study showed that the film electrodes demonstrated appreciable high-rate energy storage capability and stability. It also revealed enhanced areal capacitance and capacity of 15.86 mF cm−2 and 9.19 mAh cm−2, respectively. The study demonstrated successful coating of the Co-doped TiO2 nanostructures on ITO glass substrate and unveiled the influence of cobalt dopant on some properties of TiO2 thin film suitable for application in optoelectronics and supercapacitor.
