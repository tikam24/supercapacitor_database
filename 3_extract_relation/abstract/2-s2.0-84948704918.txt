Considerable efforts have been paid to develop electrochemical capacitors with energy storage capability in order to meet the demands of multifunctional electronics. Here we report a facile method to fabricate C-doped porous anatase TiO 2 . This technique involves the preparation of monodisperse cationic polystyrene nanoparticles (CPN), following sequential deposition of tetrabutylorthotitanate (TBT), and directly carbonizing of CPN. Interestingly, during the process of carbonizing CPN, a phase transition of TiO 2 will be happened and whist C-doped porous anatase TiO 2 is in situ formed. When this porous C-doped TiO 2 is used as electrode material to prepare electrochemical capacitor, it manifests a higher capacitance than the commercial P25, effectively broadening it potential for many practical applications.
