The pineapple flower-like hierarchical Co3O4@CoAl-layered double hydroxides (Co3O4@ CoAl-LDH) with 3D mesoporous network structure were designed and in-situ synthesized on nickel foam (NF) through a facile two-step hydrothermal route for supercapacitors. The Co3O4@CoAl-LDH displayed a greater specific capacitance of 949.7C g−1 (1899.4 F g−1) at 1.0 A g−1, better rate capability and higher cycle stability comparing with the pristine Co3O4 and CoAl-LDH on NF. At the same time, the as-fabricated Co3O4@CoAl-LDH//activated carbon (Co3O4@CoAl-LDH//AC) device delivered outstanding energy densities of 77.58 and 36.03 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 754.83 and 7813.73 W kg−1, respectively, and excellent rate capability and outstanding long-term cycle stability (84.99% retention of the initial value at 5 A g−1 after 20,000 cycles). The superior electrochemical performances showed that the Co3O4@CoAl-LDH was a promising candidate as electrode materials for high-performance energy storage devices.
