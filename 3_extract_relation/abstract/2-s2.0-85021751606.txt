Three-dimensional porous graphene hydrogels have been prepared by a green and facile but very efficient approach using glucose as an assistant. Based on a one-step hydrothermal reaction with optimal experimental conditions such as the reaction time and temperature, the graphene hydrogels exhibit a superior electrical conductivity (95.3 S/m) and can be used as supercapacitor electrode without any binder or conducting additives but showing a high specific capacitance of 384.6 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g. The results show that addition of glucose can not only greatly decrease the reaction temperature but also shorten the reaction time. The superior performance of the three-dimensional porous graphene hydrogels as electrode for supercapacitor suggests its promising potentials in the field of energy storage devices.
