To describe the accurate electrical characteristic in the working process of supercapacitor with aqueous electrolyte and asymmetrical electrode, a new model and parameter identification method that can adopted to supercapacitor with aqueous electrolyte and asymmetrical electrode was presented on the basis of analyzing the principle of storage and characteristics of this kind of supercapacitor by taking example of two-branch network model which was used in double layer capacitor.In this paper, circuit anylasis method is adopted to identify the parameter in two-branch network model. Then the classic equivalent circuit model and two stage network model were simulated and verified with the experimental data. The result prove that the two-branch network model has highly precision and can accurately describe the dynamic characteristics of supercapacitor with aqueous electrolyte and asymmetrical electrode.
