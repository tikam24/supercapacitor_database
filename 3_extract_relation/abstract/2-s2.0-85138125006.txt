Graphene/polyaniline/manganese dioxide ternary composites (rGO/PANI/MnO2) were prepared by hydrothermal method, followed by freeze-dried in vacuum treatment in this paper. The composites prepared by this simple and efficient method had self-supporting properties. The composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results show that the prepared ternary composites had an interconnected network structure. During the reaction MnO2 and polyaniline formed an irregular block structure and co-deposited on the network layer formed by graphene self-assembly. The composite electrode showed good capacitive properties, with a specific capacitance of 388 F·g-1 (0.5 A·g-1), which was better than that of graphene (rGO, 234 F·g-1) and polyaniline (PANI, 176 F·g-1). In addition, an asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled using the composite as the positive electrode and rGO as the negative electrode. The asymmetric capacitor could be reversibly cycled in the range of 0~1.6 V. When the power density was 17.48 W·kg-1, the maximum energy density could reach 13.5 Wh·kg-1.
