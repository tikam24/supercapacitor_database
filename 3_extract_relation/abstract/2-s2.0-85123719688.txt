The lithium-ion capacitor (LIC) is developed for advanced energy reserve systems, which can fulfill the requirements of long cycling capability and high power and energy density. Herein, a bamboo powder-derived porous carbon-supported ZnO composite (denoted as CZK1) was prepared and applied as an anode for the LIC. The obtained porous foam carbon (denoted as BLZACK1) acquired by acid washing of CZK1 was used as a cathode for the LIC. The assembled CZK1//BLZACK1 LIC by using CZK1 and BLZACK1 as the anode and cathode, respectively, exhibited excellent electrochemical performance. It possesses a high energy density of 134.98 W h kg-1 with a power density of 9793.58 W kg-1. Besides, after 8000 cycles at 5 A g-1, the capacitance retention is 83.90%, suggesting its outstanding cycling stability. This study shows that bamboo can be used as a derived high-performance carbon material with great potential in the field of energy storage.
