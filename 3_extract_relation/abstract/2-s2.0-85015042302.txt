The proceedings contain 430 papers. The topics discussed include: Parameter Estimation of an Electrochemical Supercapacitor model; modeling and control of a two-tank molten salt thermal storage for a concentrated solar plant; control of a solar furnace using active cooling; absorption heat pump parameter identification using a micro genetic algorithm; modeling and simulation of parabolic trough solar fields with partial radiation; control configurations in distillation columns: a comparative study; steady-state parameter estimation of an experimental vapor compression refrigeration plant; stepwise commissioning of a steam boiler with stability guarantees; self calibrating flow estimation in waste water pumping stations; blended control allocation and lateral-directional stability of the reusable launch vehicles; and enhanced nonlinear model and control design for a flexible wing.
