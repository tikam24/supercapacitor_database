Wind technology has developed sustainably in recent decades, becoming the primary source of renewable energy integrated into the power system. The high penetration levels of wind energy involve technical problems because of the intermittent power injected by wind turbines, caused by the variability of wind speed. This means a significant challenge in the operation of power grids reliably. This paper presents the intermittent power control in wind turbines based on direct-drive permanent magnet synchronous generator technology (DD-PMSG) integrating through the DC link a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) composed of lithium-ion electrochemical batteries (BESS) and supercapacitors (SESS), to convert a wind power plant into a dispatchable energy source. To ensure the stable operation of the wind turbine and HESS system, a new algorithm is developed to manage the state-of-charge (SOC) of the HESS to avoid its full charge/discharge. This is achieved by considering the mutual support between the batteries and the supercapacitors. The simulation results illustrate the power variation of the wind turbine integrated to the HESS, with different wind speed profiles and different initial state-of-charge for the BESS and SESS. Furthermore, it is shown how the algorithm manages the state-of-charge of the HESS under both normal and critical operation, demonstrating a good performance during the system operation. In this way, the power output of the wind turbine becomes stable and controllable, even in adverse situations, thanks to the control of the algorithm. Finally, new concepts related to wind turbine inertia and wind turbine rotational speed have been introduced from the point of view of the generator and the grid, which could be useful for electrical studies. The whole dynamic model has been developed in MATLAB/Simulink.
