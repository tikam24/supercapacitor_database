The constant current charging/discharging experiments of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), modified electrodes in room temperature ionic liquid, for instance 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, were performed for two types of cell configurations, three and two-electrode cells. In each case, a linear variation of the voltage with respect to time was observed. The electrochemical responses were analyzed in term of a series combination of a resistance R and a capacitor C. Accordingly, the capacitance of the modified electrodes was determined. One observed a linear variation of the capacitance as a function of the amount of PEDOT. This capacitance described the chemical capacitance of PEDOT that reflected the capability of the system to accept or release additional charge carriers on a given variation of the chemical potential. Also, the electrochemical response during constant current charging/discharging experiments for two-electrode cell in which the same amount of PEDOT was deposited on each electrode showed a type I electrochemical supercapacitor response. This kind of an electrochemical chain allowed us to mimic and to analyze the electrical responses of an electrochemical actuator based on an interpenetrating polymer networks containing PEDOT that was able to work in air.
