The supercapacitor is an emerging technology that promises to play an important role in meeting the demands of electronic devices and systems, both now and in the future. Supercapacitor has properties which can be integrated with properties of other energy storage technologies in the hybrid electric energy system. Due to behavioral characteristics of supercapacitor like fast charging and discharging ability as well as high power density, a supercapacitor and battery can operate efficiently to avoid charging and discharging of the battery. This helps to achieve longer battery life and enable higher system peak power performance thus improves the efficiency of the system. In the work carried out, efforts are put to fabricate a cost-effective model/prototype of supercapacitor using steel wire mesh, polyethylene, isopropyl alcohol, potassium sulfate, and manganese dioxide. The results are obtained in the laboratory to find out capacitance of the supercapacitor. To get the best result in terms of capacitance and internal resistance best carbon is selected. Various trials on the concentration of the electrolyte, effect of wetness of the separator on capacitance and internal resistance have been presented in the paper.
