This review paper highlights the recent developments in supercapacitors by pointing out the significance of appropriate electrode and device designs. We reported ten extremely high-performance supercapacitors with specific capacitance values among the highest available until now to the best of our knowledge. These state-of-the-art designs employing innovative electrode materials have been discussed along with their short descriptions. The supercapacitors collected here possess the most promising potential for facilitating next-generation systems in energy harvesting and storage. This review is just the surface that can help provide a pathway for supercapacitor research, which is still wide open for exploring and developing new advanced materials for energy applications of the future.
