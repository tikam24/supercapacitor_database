Deformation-tolerant devices are vital for the development of high-tech electronics of unconventional forms. In this study, a highly compressible supercapacitor has been fabricated by using newly developed polypyrrole-mediated graphene foam as electrode. The assembled supercapacitor performs based on the unique and robust foam electrodes achieves superb compression tolerance without significant variation of capacitances under long-term compressive loading and unloading processes.
