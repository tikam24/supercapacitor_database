A La2CoNiO6 inorganic nanofiber supercapacitor electrode material was successfully prepared from a polyvinylpyrrolidone/lanthanum nitrate-cobalt acetate-nickel acetate (PVP/LCN) precursor by electrostatic spinning. Its surface morphology and structure were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We found that the fibers were connected through rhombohedral La2CoNiO6 nanoparticles resulting in a linear spatial network structure. The electrochemical performance of the as-prepared inorganic nanofibers was characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronopotentiograms (CP), and cycle life tests. The results show that the La2CoNiO6 nanofiber electrode material has good capacitor performance. For the three-electrode system the electrode achieved a respectable specific capacitance of 335.0 F∙g-1 at 0.25 A∙g-1. For the symmetrical two-electrode system the electrode achieved a specific capacitance of 129.1 F∙g-1 at the same current density.
