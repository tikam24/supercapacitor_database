In this study, Ta nanopillar array was prepared using Anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) nanotemplate assisted method. Ta nanopillars are approximately 80 nm in width and 150 nm in length. In electrochemical measurements, the electrons in the Ta nanopillars and ions in the H2SO4 electrolyte formed the electrical double layer supercapacitor (EDLC). The specific capacitance of the Ta nanopillar array electrode was 640 Fgâˆ’1. Ta nanopillar array electrode has 86% retention after 1000 cycles. The results reveal that the Ta nanopillar array-based electrode is a potential candidate electrode material for supercapacitors.
