The present work deals with the structural, thermal, morphological, optical, electrochemical and magnetic behavior probes of tetragonal tin dioxide (SnO2) nanoparticles (NPs) that were synthesized via chemical precipitation technique. The thermal, crystallinity, grain size, optical, magnetic and capacitive behaviors of the product were investigated by TG-DTA, XRD, SEM, HR-TEM, UV–vis DRS, PL, CV and VSM studies at 700 °C. The X-ray diffraction result shows the well-crystallized tetragonal structure and SEM with HR-TEM results shows the spherical morphology. The broadband visible emission band is noted in the luminescence spectrum and also the predictable band gap energy is concerning 3.94 eV. The magnetic properties were studied with the high value of magnetic moment 0.7488 × 10-3 emu g−1 at RT for SnO2 NPs displaying superparamagnetic behavior. The electrochemical performance was deliberated by cyclic voltammetry. A Specific capacitance value of 176F g−1 is obtained at a scan rate for 5 mVs−1 in SnO2NPs at 700 °C.
