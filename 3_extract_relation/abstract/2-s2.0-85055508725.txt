Sodium copper chlorophyllin (SCC) is an ideal candidate electronic material for environmentally benign and low-cost devices. In this work, SCC is used as electrodes, PVA/KOH gel as solid state electrolyte and cellulosic as a separator to fabricate all-solid-state supercapacitors (SCs). The experimental results show that the SCs have ultra-high rate capability up to 100 V/s and fast frequency response (Ï„0 = 7 ms), which imply an excellent capacitive behavior and fast charge propagations within the electrodes. The bending tests indicate the good bend ability and flexibility of SCC-based SCs. This study demonstrates the potential uses of SCC in green, renewable, low-cost and flexible SCs.
