Cost-effective solutions for improved performance, activity, and stability are the main concern for the development of energy-storage devices. Generally, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) supported cobalt ferrite (CoF) based electrodes possesses enhanced electrochemical properties in supercapacitor applications such as high specific capacitance (CS) and long cyclic stability due to the presence of multiple oxidation states of cobalt ions, high surface area, and porous nanostructure that enables fast ion-diffusion. Herein, we report a one-pot solvothermal synthesis of glycol functionalised CoF nanoparticles and the composite with rGO for the supercapacitor electrode. Further, bare CoF was annealed at 300 and 500 Â°C to evaluate the dependency glycol functionalization on the electrochemical behaviour. The CoF-rGO nanocomposites in alkaline (2 M KOH) electrolyte exhibit better electrochemical behaviour compared to bare and annealed CoF. CoF-rGO exhibits high CS of 551 F/g at a scan rate of 2 mV/s with 98% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles. The power law and Trasatti method provide a qualitative analysis of the diffusivity of the nanoparticles at the electrode/electrolyte interface.
