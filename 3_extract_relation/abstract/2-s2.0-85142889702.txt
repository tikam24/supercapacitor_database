A unique approach has been applied for the synthesis of 1D boron carbon nitride nanotubes (BCN-NTs) using MnO2 nanowires as templates. BCN-NTs have been evaluated in Na-ion batteries, Li-ion batteries, and supercapacitors as electrode material and exhibited excellent and stable electrochemical performance. BCN-NTs as an anode for Na-ion battery has been shown to be highly stable up to 3000 cycles with capacity retention of 95 mAh g−1, at a high current density of 1 A g−1. In the case of the Li-ion battery, these BCN-NTs show a specific capacity of 563 mAh g−1 at a current density of 50 mA g−1. Finally, when used as an electrode for a supercapacitor, BCN-NTs display a specific capacity of 221 F g−1 at a current density of 3 A g−1 and 168 F g−1 even at a very high current density of 30 A g−1 exemplifying the excellent rate performance. The multifunctionality and stable performance of BCN-NTs among various electrochemical energy storage systems highlight the robustness of the material and make it an excellent candidate for scalable production and commercialization.
