Polyaniline (PANI) particles were prepared by reflux assisted chemical oxidative polymerization method with the aid of ammonium per sulfate/ferric chloride as oxidants and HCl/H2SO4 as the medium. Amorphous nature and the emeraldine state of PANI were revealed from X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared analysis. Moreover, ultra violet-visible spectra attributes to the polaron band - π∗ transition of polyaniline. The scanning electron microscopic image shows that the particle size is in the range of 0.2-2 μm. The electrochemical performances of the material were investigated in 1 M H2SO4 and 0.08 M K4[Fe(CN)6] added 1 M H2SO4 aqueous electrolytes. Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge studies were carried out to find its suitability as a supercapacitor electrode material. The charge discharge analysis of the fabricated symmetric supercapacitors revealed the fact that the electrolyte containing redox additive (0.08 M K4[Fe(CN)6]) delivered an enhanced specific capacitance of 228 F g-1 (∼912 F g-1 for single electrode) than that of 1 M H2SO4 (100 F g-1) at 1 mA cm-2. Further cycling stability is performed at 5 mA cm-2 ensures the durability of the supercapacitor.
