Reduced graphene oxide/cryptomelane (RGO/KMn8O16) composites are successfully synthesized from α-MnO2 nanorods and GO using a water-bathing precipitation method. The unique structure of KMn8O16 nanorods, with a length of 2-4 μm, dispersed on the surface of RGO leads to a much enhanced electrical conductivity and ionic transport, finally achieving composites with an improved electrochemical performance. Electrochemical measurement results show a specific capacitance of 222.3 F/g at a current density of 0.2 A/g, much higher than that of the original α-MnO2. After 500 cycles at 2.0 A/g, the RGO/KMn8O16 composite electrode still retains 92.6% of its initial specific capacitance. The excellent electrochemical performance and durability observed for this composite electrode suggest its potential application for electrochemical capacitors.
