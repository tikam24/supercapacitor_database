A facile hydrothermal method has been employed for the synthesis of stannous sulfide nanoparticles for the electrochemical supercapacitor application. The microscopic, optical and surface property of the synthesized material was characterized using different analytical techniques. The electrochemical performance of the synthesized material was reinforced by introducing carbon black. The electro-capacitive properties of the hybrid material were investigated by cyclic-voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge methods where the system exhibited highest specific capacitance value of 201 F g−1 at the current density of 0.1 A g−1.
