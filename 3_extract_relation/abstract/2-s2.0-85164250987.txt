The application of conductive hydrogels in flexible electronics has attracted much interest in recent years due to their excellent mechanical properties and conductivity. However, the development of conductive hydrogels combining with superior self-adhesion, mechanical properties, antifreeze, and antibacterial activity is still a challenge. Herein, inspired by the structure of the ligament, a multifunctional conductive hydrogel is constructed to address the issue by introducing collagen into the polyacrylamide. The obtained conductive hydrogel exhibits outstanding conductivity (52.08 mS/cm), ultra-stretchability (>2000%), self-adhesion, and antibacterial properties. More significantly, the supercapacitor based on this hydrogel electrolyte achieves a desirable capacitance (514.7 mF·cm-2 at 0.25 mA·cm-2 current density). As a wearable strain sensor, the obtained hydrogel can rapidly detect different movements of the body such as finger, wrist, elbow, and knee joints. It is conceived that this study would provide a potential approach for the preparation of conductive hydrogels in the application of flexible electronics.
