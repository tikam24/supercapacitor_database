For the first time, poly-o-phenylenediamine (PoPD) bulk material was electrochemically synthesized using an electrochemical method. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was added to o-phenylenediamine (oPD) solution and PoPD with different morphologies were obtained. The as-prepared materials were applied as the electrode materials in supercapacitors. The specific capacitance (SC) of the resultant PoPD was determined to be 106.4 F g-1 in 1 mol L -1 KNO3 electrolyte from CV test. The electrochemical stability of PoPD electrode was investigated by charging and discharging the electrode for 1000 times in the potential range of -0.2 to 0.6 V versus SCE at the current density of 500 mA g-1. The electrode exhibits a good cycling stability, retaining up to 82% of its initial specific capacitance at 1000th cycle. This novel technique enables PoPD non-film material for supercapacitor application. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
