The goal of the current research is to create a unique nano-combination by decorating metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) for building novel nanoelectrodes to increase the supercapacitor efficiency of graphene oxide-titanium dioxide (GO@TiO2) nanocomposite (NCP). The nanocomposites are made using the sol/gel process, and several features are measured, including UV-Vis spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Zeta potential, and x-ray diffraction. The potentiostat device measures the electrochemical performances as well as the optical activities through the transfer of charges and electrons that are detected using various approaches. Impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data are used to study the supercapacitors of the manufactured unique NCP that embellish the graphene oxide (GO) surface and validate the development of the electron transport and surface structure that make it a promising candidate for supercapacitors applications. the charge transfer resistance was calculated at 117.5, 94.36, 282.5, 54.6, 34.17, and 84.35 kÎ©.cm2 for GO@TiO2, GO@TiO2. Co3O4, GO@TiO2. MgO, GO@TiO2. SiO2, GO@TiO2. V4O7, and GO@TiO2. MoS2, respectively. The NCPs capacitance values were displayed as related to CPE (C= 9.404 nF/cm2), GO@TiO2 (C= 42.78 nF/cm2), GO@TiO2. Co3O4 (C= 23.61 nF/cm2), GO@TiO2. MgO (C= 45.5 nF/cm2), GO@ TiO2. SiO2 (C= 18.41 nF/cm2), GO@TiO2. V4O7 (C= 18.62 nF/cm2), and GO@TiO2. MoS2 (C= 52.82 nF/cm2). According to the findings, the manufactured NCPS electrodes are a good option for use in producing supercapacitors as well as other applications including solar cells and water treatment.
