Here we report a high capacitance all-solid-state micro supercapacitor (MSC) based on thick interdigital electrodes of 2D Transition Metal Carbides (MXene). Ti3C2Tx, one type of MXene, features high pseudocapacity, great conductivity and cyclability. By MEMS technologies, the 300 Î¼m thick interdigital fingers composed of Ti3C2Tx and polymer electrolyte (PE) acts as the electrodes of a MSC, which can provide a large mass loading. The high performance electrode material and thick electrode structure contribute to the MSC with the high specific capacitance of 276 mF/cm2 and 95% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles. Moreover, the fabrication is compatible with microfabrication technologies and the devices have the potential for the integration with other electronic devices on a chip.
