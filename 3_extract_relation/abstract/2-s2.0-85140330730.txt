Development of surfactant incorporated high-performance ternary hybrid composite via one-pot chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline with metal hydroxide and surfactant (sodiumlaurylsulfate, SLS) wrapped graphene oxide as symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) electrode is reported. The composite materials are characterized well and unveiled an exceptional specific capacitance of 1982 F g−1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Furthermore, the fabricated symmetric supercapacitor displayed excellent specific capacitance of 662 F g−1, with a specific energy of 29.4 Wh kg−1 at 1 A g−1. The enhanced electrochemical performance of the developed system is attributed to its good surface-to-volume ratio achieved by the incorporation of the surfactant and the homogeneous morphology of the composite in favor of the strong pseudocapacitance of doped PANI. The synergy between the faradaic and nonfaradaic counterparts maintained a capacitance retention of 80.2 % for the fabricated SSC after 5000 CD cycles and a coulumbic efficiency of 98.9 %. The results demonstrate that the surfactant incorporated hybrid composite is an ideal candidate for supercapacitor applications.
