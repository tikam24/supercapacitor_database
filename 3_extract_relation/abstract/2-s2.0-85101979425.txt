The lower cost and greener synthesis of metal oxides nanomaterial is highly investigated for efficient electrochemical devices. In this regard, we have synthesized facile MoO3/PdO NPs by sol gel synthesis method using extracted foliar fuel of E. cognata. The phase analysis of MoO3/PdO was carried out by X-ray diffraction whereas nanostructures were observed by electron microscopy-FESEM. The foliar fuel introduced functional groups were revealed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The Tauc plot revealed low optical band gap energy of MoO3/PdO to 2.55 eV which could be favorable for its electrochemical properties. Henceforth organic framework derived MoO3/PdO nanomaterial was scrutinized by electrochemical characterizations to evaluate the capacitance, electronic and ionic conducting behavior. The specific capacitance of 127 F/g with low internal resistance of 1.9 Î© was observed in the current study, suggesting the moderate supercapacitor potential with efficient diffusion of electrons and ions. Therefore, good electrochemical behavior of MoO3/PdO nanomaterial was revealed, which was further demonstrated by prominent redox behavior via cyclicvoltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge.
