Long-term cycle performance is a key factor for the supercapacitors that used pseudocapacitive materials. It is known to all that the morphology structures have direct influences on the electrochemical performance of the supercapacitors. In this work, shape-controlled Co3O4 electrode materials are successfully prepared and used as electrode materials for the supercapacitors. The different morphologies are Co3O4 nano-spheres and Co3O4 nano-rods, respectively. Among these two Co3O4 electrode materials, the Co3O4 nano-spheres shows more excellent electrochemical performance, with 96% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at the high current density of 5 A g-1.
