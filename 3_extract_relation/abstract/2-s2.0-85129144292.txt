Sodium-ion hybrid capacitors (SICs) combine two merits of high energy density of batteries and superior power density of supercapacitors. Currently, metal sulfides are potential anode materials for SICs owing to their high theory specific capacity. Nevertheless, metal sulfides with low electronic conductivity and sluggish reaction kinetics suffer from inferior rate capability and poor circulation stability as anodes. Therefore, improving electronic conductivity and Na+ diffusion kinetics for metal sulfides are some effective promotion strategies. Herein the Zn-doped CoS2 nanospheres embedded on two dimensional reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (Zn-CoS2/rGO) composites are prepared by a simple hydrothermal method. The optimized Zn-CoS2/rGO deliver high specific capacity of 544.3 mA h g−1 at specific current of 0.1 A g−1 after 100 cycles. Impressively, Zn-CoS2/rGO display an excellent rate capability of 286.8 and 226.1 mA h g−1 at 2000 and 5000 mA g−1, respectively. Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) analysis demonstrates that Zn-CoS2/rGO composites possess higher diffusion coefficient than CoS2/rGO. The SICs assembled by Zn-CoS2/rGO anodes and Walnut shells-derived porous carbon cathodes exhibit outstanding specific energy and power. This work confirms that Zn-CoS2/rGO are promising anodes to prepare high-performance SICs.
