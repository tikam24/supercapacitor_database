Activated carbon is the most widely used electrode material in electrochemical double-layer capacitors. Cashew nutshell-derived activated carbon (CNSAC) exhibits a highly porous structure with reasonable surface area and high pore volume, which indicates that it is a good electrode material. Electrochemical characterizations confirmed the formation of the electric double layer in the system with high specific capacitance and excellent retention in capacitance even after thousand cylces of charge/discharge. It is found that CNSAC has great potential as a low-cost and environmentally friendly electrode material for highly efficient supercapacitors.
