A hydrothermal method is adopted to develop ultrathin MoSe2 nanosheets(MoSe2 NSs) on multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT). When used MoSe2/MWCNT composite as a supercapacitor anode materials, the composite exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 927.25 F g −1, and it can maintain 70.08% of the initial capacity after 3000 cycles at the current density of 1 A g−1. The morphology and structure of MoSe2/MWCNT composite are characterized by SEM, TEM and XRD and it further prove that MoSe2 NSs are successfully grown on MoSe2/MWCNT composite. The asymmetric supercapacitor (ACS) is assembled with MoSe2/MWCNT as anode material and activated carbon(AC) as the cathode material. This novel ACS demonstrates outstanding electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance of 233.3 mF cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2 and an excellent rate performance of 101 mF cm−2 can be achieved at 10 mA cm−2. When the current density is 1 mA cm−2, asymmetric supercapacitor displays a specific energy of 72.9 μWh cm−2 at a specific power of 849.3 mW cm−2, together with good cyclic life with 67.4% capacitance retention over 3000 cycles. And a high power density of 5980 mW cm−2 can be reached at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. These results prove that MoSe2/MWCNT composite can be a potential energy storage battery material.
