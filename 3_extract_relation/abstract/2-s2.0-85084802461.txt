The lithium-ion capacitor is a recent energy storage component. Although it has been commercialized for several years, its hybridization still requires further investigation to characterize it. The literature has studied some of its characteristics focusing on experimentation at positive temperatures. This paper aims to enlarge the tests to include very low temperatures, showing the difference between Nyquist plots at 65 and −30 ˚C. It also presents the Ragone plot for several temperatures, with a comparison between three storage systems: a battery, a supercapacitor, and the lithium-ion capacitor. Finally, a model of the LIC is proposed, for low and high temperatures, with experimental validation.
