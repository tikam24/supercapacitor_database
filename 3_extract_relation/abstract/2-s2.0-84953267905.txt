In this study, graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized through chemical ex-foliation process from graphite flakes. GO was further covalently functionalized with Levofloxacin (LOF) by Steglich esterification reaction. Herein, we describe a method for the chemical functionalization and in-situ reduction of GO using LOF as a reducing agent. GO was reduced and remained well dispersed after reduction in the solution even after 6 months. The functionalized and reduced GO was characterized through range of analytical techniques. Functionalized GO was further used as a supercapacitor (SC) electrode material and its electrochemical behavior was compared with GO and reported. Capacitance of functionalized GO was found to be four times the capacitance of GO, indicating significantly enhanced electrochemical performance of functionalized GO as compared to pure GO.
