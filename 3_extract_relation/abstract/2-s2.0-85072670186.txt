In this paper, the various types of passenger public transport are analyzed. In a study, the diagram of the change in the specific energy consumption of a trolleybus during its annual operation was obtained. The dependence of specific fuel consumption on the ambient temperature has been established based on collected data. In addition, a comparison of initial and operating costs for bus, trolleybus and hybrid with the same capacity was conducted.
