Pseudocapacitive materials can synergistically achieve the aim of both high energy as well as high-power density. However, the cycling stability is usually not satisfactory. To overcome this drawback, a carbon coating method is employed. Herein, we report a simple one-step method for the fabrication of Co3V2O8@C composite structures. Such Co3V2O8@C anode materials exhibit superior long cycle performance, which can deliver a discharge capacity of ∼835 mAh g-1 at a current density of 4.0 A g-1 for more than 500 cycles with a capacity retention of ∼100%. Moreover, a notable rate performance of 808, 712, 307, and 101 mAh g-1 under current densities of 5, 10, 20, and 30 A g-1 is also achieved, respectively. The experimental data clearly demonstrate that the intriguing electrochemical properties can be ascribed to the synergistic effects of pseudocapacity and carbon coating. To be specific, the pseudocapacity ensures the rate performance, while carbon coating ensures the cycling performance. This may pave the way for the development of lithium-ion batteries with high power and energy density. Moreover, this synthetic strategy can be an instructive precedent for fabricating ternary metal oxides with excellent electrochemical performance.
