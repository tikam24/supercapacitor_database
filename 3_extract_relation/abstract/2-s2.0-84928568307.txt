Highly ordered metal oxide nanorods (MnO<inf>2</inf>, SnO<inf>2</inf>, NiO) inside mesoporous silica supported carbon nanomembranes have been applied for electroactive materials to fabricate symmetrical supercapacitors. Maximum specific capacitance of the obtained cells reaches up to 964 F g<sup>-1</sup> in aqueous electrolyte with energy density of 33.5 Wh kg<sup>-1</sup> for a 1 V voltage window, which are among the highest values in two electrodes supercapacitor cells employing similar metal oxide/carbon materials. This high performance is attributed from the synergic effect of the conductive carbon nanomembrane and well-ordered pseudocapacitive metal oxide nanorods.
