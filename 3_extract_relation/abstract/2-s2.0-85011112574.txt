A hybrid powertrain which composes of multiple power sources including two proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) systems, two batteries and two supercapacitors (SCs) is presented for 100% LF-LRV tramway with two motor units and one trailer unit. A hybrid system model of LF-LRV tramway is developed, and then a coordination control approach is proposed to coordinate the power demand to each power source appropriately for the energy management system of the tramway. Furthermore, the proposed energy management strategy is evaluated with a real driving cycle of tramway to verify the rationality and validity.
