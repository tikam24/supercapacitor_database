Two-dimensional mesoporous carbon nanosheets (CNSs) have been prepared via simultaneous activation and catalytic carbonization route using macroporous anion-exchange resin (AER) as carbon precursor and ZnCl2 and FeCl3 as activating agent and catalyst, respectively. The iron catalyst in the skeleton of the AER may lead to carburization to form a sheetlike structure during the carbonization process. The obtained CNSs have a large number of mesopores, a maximum specific surface area of 1764.9 m2 g-1, and large pore volume of 1.38 cm3 g-1. As an electrode material for supercapacitors application, the CNSs electrode possesses a large specific capacitance of 283 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 and excellent rate capability (64% retention ratio even at 50 A g-1) in 6 mol L-1 KOH. Furthermore, CNSs symmetric supercapacitor exhibits specific energies of 17.2 W h kg-1 at a power density of 224 W kg-1 operated in the voltage range of 0-1.8 V in 0.5 mol L-1 Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte, and outstanding cyclability (retains about 96% initial capacitance after 5000 cycles).
