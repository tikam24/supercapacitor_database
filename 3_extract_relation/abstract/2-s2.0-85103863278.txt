Cathodes for supercapacitors with enhanced capacitive performance are prepared using MnO2 as a charge storage material and carbon nanotubes (CNT) as conductive additives. The enhanced capacitive properties are linked to the beneficial effects of catecholate molecules, such as chlorogenic acid and 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzamide, which are used as co-dispersants for MnO2 and CNT. The dispersant interactions with MnO2 and CNT are discussed in relation to the chemical structures of the dispersant molecules and their biomimetic adsorption mechanisms. The dispersant adsorption is a key factor for efficient co-dispersion in ethanol, which facilitated enhanced mixing of the nanostructured components and allowed for improved utilization of charge storage properties of the electrode materials with high active mass of 40 mg cm−2 . Structural peculiarities of the dispersant molecules are discussed, which facilitate dispersion and charging. Capacitive properties are analyzed using cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry and impedance spectroscopy. A capacitance of 6.5 F cm−2 is achieved at a low electrical resistance. The advanced capacitive properties of the electrodes are linked to the microstructures of the electrodes prepared in the presence of the dispersants.
