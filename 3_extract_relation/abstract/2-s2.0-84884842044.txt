A facile hydrothermal method is developed for large-scale production of three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical porous nickel cobaltate nanowire cluster arrays derived from nanosheet arrays with robust adhesion on Ni foam. Based on the morphology evolution upon reaction time, a possible formation process is proposed. The role of NH4F in formation of the structure has also been investigated based on different NH4F amounts. This unique structure significantly enhances the electroactive surface areas of the NiCo2O4 arrays, leading to better interfacial/chemical distributions at the nanoscale, fast ion and electron transfer and good strain accommodation. Thus, when it is used for supercapacitor testing, a specific capacitance of 1069 F g-1 at a very high current density of 100 A g-1 was obtained. Even after more than 10000 cycles at various large current densities, a capacitance of 2000 F g-1 at 10 A g-1 with 93.8% retention can be achieved. It also exhibits a high-power density (26.1 kW kg-1) at a discharge current density of 80 A g-1. When used as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), it presents a high reversible capacity of 976 mA h g-1 at a rate of 200 mA g -1 with good cycling stability and rate capability. This array material is rarely used as an anode material. Our results show that this unique 3D hierarchical porous nickel cobaltite is promising for electrochemical energy applications.
