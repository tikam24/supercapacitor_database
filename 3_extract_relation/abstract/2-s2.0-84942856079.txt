A low ESR supercapacitor could be easily used as a lossless voltage dropper in applications like linear voltage regulators to significantly enhance the end to end efficiency of the converter. Useful examples of 12-5 V, 5-3.3V and 5-1.5 V linear converters with extra low frequency based energy circulation with single supercapacitor or supercapacitor arrays are discussed with experimental details. Technique is called supercapacitor assisted low dropout (SCALDO) regulator.
