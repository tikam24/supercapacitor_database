Heteroatom-doped carbon materials with a high specific area, a well-defined porous structure is important to high-performance supercapacitors (SCs). Here, S and N co-doped three-dimensional porous graphene aerogel (NS-3DPGHs) have been synthesized in a facile and efficient self-assembly process with thiourea acting as the reducing and doping agent solution. Operating as a SC electrode, fabricated co-doping graphene, i.e. the sample of NS-3DPGH-150 exhibits the highest specific capacitance of 412.9 F g−1 under 0.5 A g−1 and prominent cycle stabilization with 96.4% capacitance retention in the back of 10 000 cycles. Furthermore, based on NS-3DPGH-150, the symmetrical supercapacitor as-prepared in 6 M KOH displays a superior energy density of 12.9 Wh kg−1 under the power density of 249 W kg−1. Hence, NS-3DPGHs could be considered as an excellent candidate for SCs.
