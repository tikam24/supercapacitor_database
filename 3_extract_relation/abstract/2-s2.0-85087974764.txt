Lithium ion capacitors (LICs), combining with the advantages of supercapacitors and batteries, are considered as one of the most attractive energy storage devices. The key point of constructing high-performance LICs is to address the sluggish kinetics behavior of battery-type anode. Herein, we demonstrate that nano-MnO with low Li-ion insertion voltage and fast kinetics can be favorably used for LICs. Self-standing hollow carbon-encapsulated MnO nanofibers film (MnO@HCF) is synthesized through a morphology-inheritance route, exhibiting high electrical conductivity, good structural stability, and continuous open channels to facilitate electrolyte ion transportation. Such a synergistic structure endows MnO@HCF with excellent electrochemical properties including a considerably enhanced capacity of 586.8 mAh g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. The LIC based on the MnO@HCF anode and activated carbon cathode deliver a high energy density of 87.4 Wh kg−1 at 215 W kg−1, under a high mass loading of 7.1 mg cm−2. Even at an ultrahigh power density of 10750 W kg−1, the energy density can still reach 50.6 Wh kg−1. Additionally, the LIC exhibits a remarkable capacity retention of 98.6% after 3000 cycles at 1075 W kg−1.
