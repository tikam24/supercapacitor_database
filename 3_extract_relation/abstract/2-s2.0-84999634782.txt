The article explores the morphological and electrochemical properties of carbon electrode materials derived from D-lactose by mixing of carbon precursor with activating reagent selected from a number KOH, K2CO3, ZnCl2, SnCl2·2H2O, and calcining the composite mixture at 800 °C. After dissolution and removal of K2O, ZnO or SnO from volume of prototypes specific surface of carbon materials increases in 1,7-4,2 times, and electrical conductivity - in 1,4-2,8 times. The activating reagents for effective influence on the properties of carbon structures can be placed in the following order: ZnCl2 > KOH > K2CO3 > SnCl2·2H2O. It is set that the highest specific capacity as an electrode material for supercapacitor has a sample with the highest electrical conductivity (78 Ohm -1·m -1) obtained using KOH activating reagent. The electrode material capacity was 176-157 F·g -1 at discharge currents of 10-100 mA. It was found that the difference in the values of capacitance of prototypes caused by different chemical state of their surface.
