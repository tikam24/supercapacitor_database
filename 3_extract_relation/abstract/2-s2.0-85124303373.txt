Supercapacitors (SCs) possesses high energy density, high power density and long cyclic performance. This review details the application of transition metal oxides and chalcogenides (TMOs and TMChs) in pseudo-capacitors and hybrid supercapacitors (PCs and HSCs). TMOs and TMChs with layer and spinel crystal structure are discussed. The layer materials exhibit excellent capacity and rate performance but inferior cycling performance; On the contrary, spinel materials have a more stable structure and perform better cyclic performance. TMOs suffer sluggish electrochemical kinetics and poor conductivity; TMChs can make up the defects of their TMOs counterparts. Next, strategies to improve the electrochemical performance of PCs and HSCs based on TMOs and TMChs are detailed, mainly from two aspects: designing the composition, optimizing the structures/morphologies of materials, and improving the conductivity of materials in materialsâ€™ aspects; increasing the mass-loading of electrodes, fabricating free-standing electrode and assembling flexible SCs in technical aspects. Furthermore, in/ex situ techniques and theoretical calculation are discussed to explorer the fundamental mechanism of TMOs and TMChs. Lastly, the future research orientations of SCs are also timely concluded. HSCs based on TMOs and TMChs are the hotpot in the future.
