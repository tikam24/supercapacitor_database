A study for heave compensation system of super capacitor energy storage devices, which uses the bidirectional DC/DC converter for connecting DC bus and super capacitor, and aims at solving problems of heave compensation feedback electricity use. The three-phase half bridge of isolated bidirectional DC/DC converter as the transmission circuit with the change of the DC bus voltage as reference is selected, the double closed loop control strategy of bidirectional DC/DC converter is designed, for achieving stability of bus bar voltage. As the DC bus voltage rises, super capacitor is charged, as the DC bus voltage reduces, the super capacitor is discharged. Experiments verify the effectiveness of the control strategy for the proposed bidirectional DC/DC converter based on DSP of super capacitor energy storage device.
