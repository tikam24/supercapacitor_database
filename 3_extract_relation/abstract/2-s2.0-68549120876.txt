Polyaniline was deposited potentiodynamically on a stainless steel substrate in the presence of an inorganic acids (sulfuric acid). The electrochemical characterization of the electrode was carried out by means of cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in the organic acids (p-toluene sulfonic acid) solution. The results show that polyaniline has a high specific capacitance of ∼431.8 F g-1 at 1 mV s-1, high coulombic efficiency of ∼95.6% at 20 mV s-1, and exhibits a high reversibility. This indicates the promising feasibility of the polyaniline used as an electrochemical capacitor material in the electrolyte of p-toluene sulfonic acid solution especially at high charge-discharge process. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
