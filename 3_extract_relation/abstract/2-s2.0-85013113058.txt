Fullerene C60 whisker (FW)/polyaniline emeraldine base (PANI-EB) composite with corrugated surface morphology is prepared by mixing toluene suspension of FW and PANI-EB/N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone colloid directly. A mechanism for the formation of charge transfer complex (CTC) between FW and polyaniline emeraldine base is proposed and proved by FTIR, UV–vis spectra, XPS and measuring its energy gap data. CTC can improve the electron transfer efficiency, which is benefit for the performance when materials work as supercapacitor. Electrochemical properties are analyzed by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectra. The performance of FW/PANI-EB obtained from these methods indicates its high specific capacitance (813 Fg−1 at a current density of 1 Ag−1), low electrical resistance and good cycling stability (85.2% capacitance retention after 1500 cycles).
