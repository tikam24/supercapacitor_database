High-capacity, high-mass-loading yet low-cost electrodes are highly desirable for flexible energy-storage devices. However, previous research on flexible electrodes was mainly limited in low mass loadings of nanostructured materials, and the promising properties will be seriously degraded in practical levels of mass loadings. Taking advantages of the fantastic colloidal interactions of graphene, microsized commercial particles were processed into high-mass-loading yet flexible electrodes by using graphene as the dispersant and flexible conductive adhesives. Involved liquids can not only ensure the easily accessed pathway for electrolytes but also help to relieve the stress and strain under deformation. This electrode exhibits a superb areal capacitance of 8.6 F cm-2 at the mass loading as high as 40 mg cm-2, and ultrahigh power/energy density (50000 μW cm-2/377 μWh cm-2). This work provides a universal approach to fabricate flexible electrodes for various energy storage devices and highlight irreplaceable roles of colloidal interactions in this flexible electrode.
