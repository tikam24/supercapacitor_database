This work proposes a design methodology that allows designing the energy storage unit of an electric vehicle in order to minimize the required energy and the resulting losses. A simple analytical model of the vehicle losses is derived. Driving conditions and solar production scenarios are obtained from stochastic processes; they are employed to generate a number of vehicle power profiles. Candidate supercapacitor arrangements are classified in terms of losses and energy capacity, leading to the associated Pareto minimum. Â© Copyright 2011 IEEE - All Rights Reserved.
