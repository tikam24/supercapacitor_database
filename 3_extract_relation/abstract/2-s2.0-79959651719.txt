Dynamic model of a wind generation system with a supercapacitor based energy storage system is developed. The supercapacitor system has been interfaced with the wind generation system through a STATCOM. Decoupled P-Q control of STATCOM is implemented by introducing suitable transformation on its injected current. The controller parameters are obtained through a search based optimization technique. The effectiveness of the STATCOM supercapacitor energy storage was examined for very low voltage situations. Simulation studies demonstrated that the STATCOM supercapacitor control can achieve significant withstand capability for reasonable low voltage duration. System transients are adequately suppressed and normal conditions are quickly restored. Â© 2011 IEEE.
