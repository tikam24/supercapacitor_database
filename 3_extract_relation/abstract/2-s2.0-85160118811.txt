Flexible ceramic materials are useful in various advanced fields like thermal protection systems and energy storage devices like supercapacitors. For better efficiency of an energy storage device, it must maintain flexibility and mechanical stability after prolonged cycles with high power and energy deliverability. Though metal oxide semiconductor is a very good choice, their electrical conductivity is poor. Carbon fiber-reinforced ceramics showed excellent results in terms of flexibility, fracture toughness values of ceramics composite, and electrical conductivity. Researchers developed a carbon fiber ceramics composite supercapacitor that showed high specific capacitance and energy efficiency after many cycles. The magnitude of Young’s modulus of carbon fibers is a few hundreds of GPa when tested under tensile testing. They are vastly used for preparing carbon/carbon, carbon/SiC composite materials other than flexible ceramic composites. Carbon/carbon composites have many sophisticated applications in strategic sectors, especially in space research. A typical carbon/carbon composite is made up of a graphite matrix with different types of carbon fiber reinforcement. This lightweight composite has important applications in thermal protection systems and high-performance braking systems in aircraft. Different types of carbon/carbon composites have been investigated so far by researchers across the globe. The data available in various literatures show that the mechanical response of carbon/carbon composite is highly elastic. The orientation of fibers in the matrix plays an important role in determining the mechanical response of the material. The Young’s modulus varies in the range of 1GPa to a few tens of GPa depending on the orientation of the fiber in the matrix. The different orientations of the fibers in the matrix not only create regions with different mechanical responses even in the same composite.
