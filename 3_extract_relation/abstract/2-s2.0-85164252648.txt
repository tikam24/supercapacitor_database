With the increasing proportion of wind power generators, the control needs to be further enhanced. Besides, the grid has a more flexible reactive power requirement. The speed of the doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) is decoupled from the grid frequency, which makes it difficult to provide fast and accurate support during the frequency and voltage fluctuations of the grid. To enhance the stability of the grid connection DFIGs, this subject connects the supercapacitor energy storage unit to the DC bus of the DFIG to participate in the primary frequency regulation of the grid and discusses. Discuss the array configuration according to the energy storage requirements. Through the addition of grid side converter (GSC) voltage droop control, the doubly-fed induction generator set has a primary voltage regulation function. Through the establishment of the wind farm-synchronous machine system model, it is proved that it can improve the stability of the system; finally, the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed control strategy are verified through the 10 kW doubly-fed induction generator experimental platform.
