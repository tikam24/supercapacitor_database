In the present study, we prepared polypyrrole thin films by electrochemical polymerization method. The deposited films were characterized by different physical and chemical methods. Structural study was made by FTIR spectroscopy, the surface morphological study was made with the help of Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the optical study and band gap energy was studied with the help of UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy. Supercapacitor testing was made with the help of cyclic voltammetry in the 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The SEM picture revealed the formation of well-adherent and cauliflower structure. Electrochemically synthesized Polypyrrole thin film showed the band gap energy value of 1.8 eV. The value of specific capacitance was found to be 540 F/g in the potential window of -0.2 to 0.8 V vis-a-vis SCE in 0.1 M H2SO4 as an electrolyte with the scan rate 25 mV/sec. Â© 2013 IEEE.
