In this paper, an interleaved converter has been studied. The control system structure, the modelling and the implementation of step-up/step-down have been simulated and presented. The whole system has been simulated with the PLECS/Simulink simulation software in order to validate the theoretical model. A 10 kW proof-of-concept prototype has been designed, built and tested using a Texas Instruments C2000 processor. Â© 2012 IEEE.
