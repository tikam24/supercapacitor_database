The new GeMo complex (namely GeMo) was prepared by mild hydrothermal method and has the molecular formula of C54H36GeMoN6O8. The compound is crystallised in the P-1 space group, with a triclinic symmetry. After two different graphene (namely G) modification methods GeMo-G and GeMo/G are obtained. Among them GeMo-G shows better performance both in lithium ion batteries and supercapacitors. As the electrode material of lithium ion battery, after 100 cycles, the specific capacity of 333.8 mAh g−1 was obtained when the current density was 100 mAg−1. When serving as the electrode material for supercapacitor, the specific capacitance was 1230 F g−1 at a current of 1 A g−1. After 10,000 charge/discharge cycles, 90.8% of the initial specific capacitance has been maintained.
