Conductive hydrogels have shown great promise in flexible electronics, but their practical applications may be impeded by the time-consuming and energy-consuming polymerization process. We proposed a sodium lignosulfonate-Fe (SLS-Fe) strategy to address this challenge and took advantage of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and poly(acrylic acid) to prepare the CMC/PAA/Fe3+/LiCl interpenetrating conductive hydrogels with good self-healing properties, antifreezing properties, and a 6-fold increase in conductivity in this study. The hydrogel-based flexible strain sensors demonstrated a broad detection range (400%), high sensitivity (GF = 6.19 at 200-400%), and human motion detection capability. The hydrogel-based supercapacitor exhibited a single-electrode specific capacitance of 122.36 F g-1 which successfully powered LEDs. Furthermore, the supercapacitor showed a single-electrode specific capacitance of 83.16 F g-1 at -23 °C (68% of the one exhibited at 25 °C). Therefore, the multifunctional performance of the CMC/PAA/Fe3+/LiCl hydrogel is anticipated to play an exemplary role in a new generation of flexible electronics.
