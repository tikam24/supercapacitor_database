In this paper, nickel oxide/graphene aerogel composites (NiO/GA) have been synthesized by a simple solvothermal route starting with graphene oxide (GO). The morphology, composition and microstructure of the as-obtained samples are systematically characterized by Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Moreover, the electrochemical performances of composites were evaluated by cyclic voltammogram (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge. The nickel oxide was electrochemically deposited into the highly porous GA to form NiO/GA composites. NiO/GA electrodes exhibit excellent electrochemical performance with a maximum specific capacitance of 489.9 F g-1 at the charge/discharge current density of 1 A g-1 in 2 M KOH electrolyte.
