Self-discharge is a significant issue in electric double layer energy storage, which leads to a rapid voltage drop and low energy efficiency. Here, we attempt to solve this problem by changing the structure of the electric double layer into a de-solvated state, by constructing a nano-scale and ion-conductive solid electrolyte layer on the surface of a carbon electrode. The ion concentration gradient and potential field that drive the self-discharge are greatly restricted inside this electric double layer. Based on this understanding, a high-efficiency graphene-based lithium ion capacitor was built up, in which the self-discharge rate is reduced by 50% and the energy efficiency is doubled. The capacitor also has a high energy density, high power output and long life, and shows promise for practical applications.
