Spinel LiCrTiO 4 oxides to be used as electrode materials for a lithium ion battery and an asymmetric supercapacitor were synthesized using a soft-chemical method with and without chelating agents followed by calcination at 700 °C for 10 h. Structural and morphological properties were studied with powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy. Particles of 50–10 nm in size are observed in the microscopic images. The presence of Cr and Ti is confirmed from the EDS spectrum. Electrochemical properties of LiCrTiO 4 electrode were examined in a lithium ion battery. The electrode prepared with oxalic acid-assisted LiCrTiO 4 shows higher specific capacity.This LiCrTiO 4 is also used as anode material for an asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor. The cell exhibits a specific capacity of 65 mAh/g at 1 mA/cm 2 . The specific capacity decreases with increasing current densities.
