Since the beginning of this century, considerable research efforts have focused on solid supercapacitors that leverage hydroxide (OH−) ion conducting polymer electrolytes as a high performance, safe energy storage technology, capable of lightweight and flexible architectures. Here, we present an overview of the state-of-the-art solid supercapacitors enabled by OH− ion conducting polymer electrolytes. We found that progress regarding OH− ion conducting polymer electrolytes is slow compared with others such as proton conducting electrolytes. Furthermore, their role in the capacitance, rate capability, and long-term reliability of solid supercapacitors is unclear. This has resulted in many demonstrations of materials that are excellent in OH− media, but there is no clear road map moving forward due to the limited availability of viable polymer electrolyte chemistry. In this review, we briefly introduce the fundamentals of supercapacitors, and the mechanisms for OH− ion conduction in a polymer matrix while identifying several important relationships between the properties of the polymer electrolyte and the performance of the solid supercapacitor. We categorized OH− ion conducting polymer electrolytes into two types: anion exchange membranes and alkaline polymer electrolytes based on composition and synthesis. The performance and shortcomings of solid supercapacitors enabled by these classes of electrolytes are discussed. Some perspectives are offered to address the areas of improvement. Finally, we propose key research directions to facilitate robust contributions for advanced solid supercapacitors based on OH− ion conducting polymer electrolytes.
