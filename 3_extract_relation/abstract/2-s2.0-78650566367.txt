The paper presents a control strategy for a wind energy conversion system (WECS) for an optimal extraction of power from the wind. The topology of the system consists of a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG), a diode bridge rectifier, a hybrid dc-dc converter which lowers the dc voltage, a supercapacitor and an inverter. However, the grid side inverter is not subject to this paper research. The tracking method is simulated in Matlab/Simulink and the results are presented and discussed. Â©2010 IEEE.
