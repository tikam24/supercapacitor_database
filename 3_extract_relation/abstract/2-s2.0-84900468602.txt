A highly capacitive fullerene polymer is prepared electrochemically and its use in a high power supercapacitor is presented. Using the fullerene polymer as a negative charge-accepting electrode and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) as a positive electrode, it has an operating potential of 2.2 V and a power density that is a factor of five greater than a symmetric PEDOT supercapacitor.
