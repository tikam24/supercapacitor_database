Three dimensional (3D) hybrid nanoarchitecture of two-dimensional (2D) reduced graphene oxide/one dimensional (1D) multiwalled carbon nanotube and zero-dimensional (0D) zirconium oxide (ZrO2) nanoparticles (rGO/MWCNT/ZrO2) was synthesised by a simple hydrolysis method for high performance supercapacitors. To unlock the properties of individual materials to the maximum, binaries of ZrO2 with GO and MWCNT were also synthesised. The increased wettability, integrated structure, and the synergistic effect of rGO, MWCNT, and ZrO2 in rGO/MWCNT/ZrO2 (GMZ) offer a capacitance of 357 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with excellent capacitance retention of 98% across 5000 cycles. 1D structure of MWCNT creates an exceptional conductive network with rGO due to the confinement of electrons and ions without disturbing its electronic structure. The intriguing supercapacitor performance of differently dimensioned framework with ZrO2 emphasises the engineered orientation and tuning of a designed environment for its appropriateness, uniqueness, and sensitivity to push up enhanced performance.
