A comparative study of two Hybrid Energy Storage Systems (HESS) for automotive applications in terms of weight, volume and cost is undertaken. Main source is a High Energy (HE) density battery while secondary source can be an Ultra High Power (UHP) battery or a Super capacitor (SC). Simulation results show that gains in weight and volume are obtained when HESS uses an UHP secondary source instead of a SC. Drive range is found to have no effect on HESS sizing. Sizing algorithm is used to find an 'optimal' solution that improves electric vehicles performance.
