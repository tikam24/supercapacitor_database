Here we synthesize novel asymmetric all-solid-state paper supercapacitors (APSCs) based on amorphous porous Mn3O4 grown on conducting paper (NGP) (Mn3O4/NGP) negative electrode and Ni(OH)2 grown on NGP (Ni(OH)2/NGP) as positive electrode, and they have attracted intensive research interest owing to their outstanding properties such as being flexible, ultrathin, and lightweight. The fabricated APSCs exhibit a high areal Csp of 3.05 F/cm3 and superior cycling stability. The novel asymmetric APSCs also exhibit high energy density of 0.35 mW h/cm3, high power density of 32.5 mW/cm3, and superior cycling performance (<17% capacitance loss after 12Â»000 cycles at a high scan rate of 100 mV/s). This work shows the first example of amorphous porous metal oxide/NGP electrodes for the asymmetric APSCs, and these systems hold great potential for future flexible electronic devices.
