Porous nanopetals of MnMoO4 with oxygen vacancies were prepared by hydrothermal synthesis and a hydrogenation reduction method. MnMoO4-OV porous nanopetals have a higher specific surface area together with a more diverse pore size distribution than MnMoO4 nanopetals. The density functional theory calculation results reveal that MnMoO4-OV has a lower energy band gap (0.642 eV) than MnMoO4 (1.095 eV). The electronic density of states plots reveal that MnMoO4-OV displays more electron state distribution at the Fermi energy level than MnMoO4. The MnMoO4-OV porous nanopetals achieve a higher specific capacitance (1920 g-1) than MnMoO4 (921 F g-1) at 1 A g-1. They also achieve a superior capacitance retention rate (85.5%) to that of MnMoO4 (69.1%) with the current density increasing from 1 to 10 A g-1. The introduction of oxygen vacancies can increase the carrier density, accelerate the electron transfer, enhance the electrical conductivity, and accordingly strengthen the redox reactivity of MnMoO4-OV. An asymmetric supercapacitor was also constructed by using MnMoO4-OV as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode. It achieves a high energy density of 59.8 W h kg-1 at a power density of 750 W kg-1, together with a good cycle life. Both experimental measurements and theoretical calculations were conducted to prove the promotive role of oxygen vacancies in achieving the supercapacitive performance of MnMoO4-OV. This journal is
