Due to high theoretical capacitor, cobalt hydroxide (Co(OH)2) is an ideal candidate in application of supercapacitor. A facile strategy was introduced to synthesize Co(OH)2 nanoplates as cobalt chloride was used as cobalt source, branched polyethyleneimine (BPEI) as a stabilizer, and octylamine as a hydrolyzing agent. The reaction was carried out at 90 Â°C for 30 min. In the application of supercapacitor, the synthesized Co(OH)2 electrode possessed a 227.6 F/g of specific capacitance at 1 A/g of current density. Meanwhile, Co(OH)2 possessed high capacitive retention, with around 93.5% after 1000 cycles of charge-discharge process at 6 A/g.
