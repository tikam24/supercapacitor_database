A supercapacitor based on a biodegradable gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) has been fabricated using guar gum (GG) as the polymer matrix, LiClO4 as the doping salt and glycerol as the plasticizer. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the gel polymer showed an unusual tubular array type surface morphology. FTIR, DSC and TGA results of the GPE indicated good interaction between the components used. Highest ionic conductivity and lowest activation energy values were 2.2 × 10-3 S cm-1 and 0.18 eV, respectively. Dielectric studies revealed ionic behavior and good capacitance with varying frequency of the GPE system. The fabricated supercapacitor showed a maximum specific capacitance value of 186 F g -1 using cyclic voltammetry. Variation of temperature from 273 K to 293 K did not significantly influence the capacitance values obtained from AC impedance studies. Galvanostatic charge-discharge study of supercapacitor indicated that the device has good stability, high energy density and power density. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
