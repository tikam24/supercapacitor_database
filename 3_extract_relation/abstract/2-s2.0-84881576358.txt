Nanocomposite of manganese oxides/Au thin films were electrodeposited on ITO glass substrate by the potentiostatic method in KMnO4/AuCl3aqueous solution. The thickness of the thin films was about 50~100nm composed of manganese oxide nanoparticles. MnOOH formed as the primary phase under electrodeposition without Au addition. The films exhibit the mixture of amorphous MnO2·nH2O and MnOOH phases under electrodeposition with Au addition. The nanocomposite thin films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy. The electrodes with 0.8% Au showed excellent capacitive behavior in the 0.1 M KNO3 electrolyte, with highest specific capacitance of 1230 Fcm-3 at a scan rate of 20mVs-1. The nanocomposite films became looser with lots of small crevices when Au was added from the SEM surface morphology observation. This gives smaller diffusion impedance and larger capacitance through the interconnected pores for proton diffusion. © 2013 by ESG.
