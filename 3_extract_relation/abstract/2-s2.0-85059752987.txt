Agricultural waste banana peel (BP) as a sustainable biomass resource is used to produce porous carbon (PC) and activated carbon (AC) materials. Sulphur-doped banana peel-derived AC (S-BP-AC) was successfully prepared for supercapacitors. The results show that the S-BP-AC presents a high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of 2,224.9 m2/g, a large pore volume of 0.77 cm3/g, and a suitable pore-size distribution of approximately 0.8 nm. It is easy to bring S-BP-AC into contact with an electrolyte. The S-BP-AC electrode had great specific capacitance of 162.5 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g in a 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. The results indicate that the S-BP-AC can be applied to use in high performance supercapacitors.
