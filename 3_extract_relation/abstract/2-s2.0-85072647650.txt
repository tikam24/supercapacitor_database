In this study, iron oxide, nickel oxide, and nickel-iron oxide nanostructured particles were produced by the hydrothermal method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and SEM measurements were performed to investigate the physical properties of these nanostructured particles. According to the XRD results, the crystal properties of these particles were determined. From the SEM images, these particles understood to be nano-structured. The electrodes were examined for electrochemical properties by using these nanostructured particles. Electrochemical measurements of the produced electrodes were performed, and capacitance values and impedance spectra of the electrodes were determined. The specific capacitance values of the iron oxide, nickel-iron oxide, and nickel oxide nanostructured particles, respectively are 30 F/g, 55 F/g, and 67 F/g. Also, the photocatalytic activities of nanostructured particles were investigated. This examination methylene blue (MB) was used and made under a xenon lamp. In light of our findings, it was observed that high photocatalytic degradation rate. Nickel-iron oxide nanostructured particles, the degradation of MB were found to be about 87%.
