The analysis of different components of a grid-linked hybrid energy system (HES) comprising a photovoltaic (PV) system is presented in this work. Due to the increase of the population and industries, power consumption is increasing every day. Due to environmental issues, traditional power plants alone are insufficient to supply customer demand. In this case, the most important thing is to discover another approach to meet customer demands. Most wealthy countries are now concentrating their efforts on developing sustainable materials and investing considerable amounts of money in product development. Wind, solar, fuel cells, and hydro/water resources are among the most environmentally benign renewable sources. To control the variability of PV generation, this sort of application necessitates the usage of energy storage systems (ESSs). Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are the most often used ESSs; however, they have a short lifespan due to the applied stress. Hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs) started to evolve as a way to decrease the pressure on Li-ion batteries and increase their lifetime. This study represents a great power management technique for a PV system with Li-ion batteries and supercapacitor (SC) HESS based on an artificial neural network. The effectiveness of the suggested power management technique is demonstrated and validated using a conventional PV system. Computational models with short-term and long-term durations were used to illustrate their effectiveness. The findings reveal that Li-ion battery dynamical stress and peak value are reduced, resulting in longer battery life.
