Supercapacitor electrodes based on pyrrole treated-functionalized single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) were developed. High values of capacitance (350 F/g), power density (4.8 kW/kg), and energy density (3.3 kJ/kg) were obtained in 6 M KOH, and the capacitance is almost 7 times that of the control buckypaper. Specific capacitance of these materials has a strong dependence on the macropore surface area. The double layer capacity of pyrrole treated-functionalized SWNT electrodes is 154 μF/cm 2 based on the BET model, and even higher based on the DFT model. © 2005 American Chemical Society.
