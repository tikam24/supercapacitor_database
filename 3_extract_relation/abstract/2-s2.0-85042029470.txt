Heteroatom doping is an effective strategy to modify the surface properties of carbon electrode, thus boosting its electrochemical performance. In this work, phosphorus (P)-doped porous carbons with high specific surface are prepared by KOH pre-activation of ultrapure anthracite and further H3PO4 activation. H3PO4 post-activation not only generates more mesoporous for a rapid ion diffusion, but also provides potential P-source for the P-doping on carbon scaffold. The increase of P-doped content significantly restrains the formation of unstable quinone and carboxylic groups, and then enhances oxidation stability of P-doped porous carbon. When evaluated as electrodes in 1 M Et4NBF4/PC, the resultant material exhibits excellent rate capability of 75% retention at 30 A g−1, extraordinary stability of 90% capacitance retention after 20000 cycles and low leakage current of less than 1.2 μA. More importantly, due to the blockage of active oxidation sites by phosphate groups, the P-doped porous carbon can stably operate at higher voltage of 3.0 V in Et4NBF4/PC compared to that of undoped porous carbon, so as to deliver a high energy density of 38.65 Wh kg−1 at 1500 W kg−1. The study offers insightful material chemistry for industrial application of H3PO4 activated porous carbon in advanced electrochemical energy storage.
