To push the upper limit of capacitive materials, the integration of multi-modal capacitive materials has emerged as a potential solution. In this regard, we reported the novel binary composite of self-suspended polyaniline (S-PANI) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs). Compared with conventional polyaniline, S-PANI offers higher porosity and fibrillar polymeric network, which was achieved by doping long-chain protonic acid during in situ polymerization. S-PANI was loaded on oxidized carbon nanotubes (OCNTs) and sulfonated carbon nanotubes (SCNTs) to prepare S-PANI/OCNT and S-PANI/SCNT composite electrodes, respectively. The conductive and exclusive fibrillar S-PANI provide unobstructed channels for charge transport and electrolyte infiltration. Preliminary electrochemical studies revealed that the capacitance of the composite electrode reached 316.8 F g−1 and 345.4 F g−1, and established exceptional capacitance retention rates of 92.8% and 93.7% after 5000 cycles for S-PANI/OCNT and S-PANI/SCNT composite, respectively, making it a potential candidate for imminent energy storage devices.
