Due to their unique architectures and outstanding electrical properties, three dimensional graphene-based frameworks (3DGFs) have attracted extensive attention in wide fields. However, recently reported techniques always require complex processes and high cost, which severely limit their large-scale application. In this study, the massive preparation of macroscopically porous 3DGFs from the inherently inexpensive graphite paper is for the first time realized by simply combining the modified Hummer's method with freezing technique. The as-prepared 3DGFs that consist of well exfoliated, high-quality reduced graphene oxide (RGO) exhibit a mesoporous structure and superior conductivity. Such unique features enable the 3DGFs to be directly used as a supercapacitor electrode and as ideal 3D scaffolds to create PANI@3DGFs, Pd@3DGFs, and Pt@3DGFs composites, which hold great potential applications in supercapacitors and catalysts.
