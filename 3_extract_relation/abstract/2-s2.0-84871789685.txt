As a crucial constituent in tri-generation application, electric energy storage and power system plays an important role regarding efficient utilization of electrical energy in tri-generation. This paper presents the results showing that the optimization of electrical energy storage is able to promote the performance of tri-generation. Initial investigation, including laboratory tests and computational simulation using Dymola software, have been carried out. A case study exemplifies how diverse hybrid systems accommodate domestic power demands. The outcomes validate that the hybrid electric system consisting of generator, batteries and super capacitor can satisfy the electricity requirements for the household. it is also found that the hybrid system can supply the peak electricity demands where the integration of super capacitor can alleviate the overcharge of batteries in this application.
