Flexible supercapacitors are attracting interest in wearable technologies as they can withstand mechanical deformations while delivering their energy storage function. Among frequently investigated electrode materials for flexible supercapacitors, polyaniline/graphene composites are favorable due to their synergistic properties that assure excellent specific capacitance, cycling stability, and high rate capability. This review highlights recent strategies to advance structural designs and synthesis methods of polyaniline/graphene electrodes for flexible supercapacitors. Firstly, the general mechanism and feature of the flexible supercapacitor will be discussed, followed by current challenges that focus on two key aspects, structural design and synthesis of the electrode. Next, by sorting the composites based on their morphological dimensionalities (i. e., one-, two-, and three-dimensional), and focusing the discussion on the two key aspects, we evaluate recent and effective strategies to develop flexible supercapacitors with polyaniline/graphene composite electrode. Finally, future perspectives are given for broader applications of the flexible supercapacitors.
