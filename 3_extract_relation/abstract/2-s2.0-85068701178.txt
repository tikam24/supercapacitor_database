To obtain the better performance of Hybrid Electric Vehicles/Electric Vehicles (HEVs/EVs), are implemented with Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS), in that Battery is main source and UltraCapacitor (UC) is the auxiliary source. The battery is connected to DC Bus through Boost Converter and UC is connected through Buck-Boost Converter. Battery and UC voltage levels are maintained less than the DC bus voltage. The main aim of this research is to design an intelligent controller for a smooth transition between the sources in the HESS. A Math Function Based (MFB) Controller is modeled and implemented to an electric motor for HEVs/EVs application. The MFB controller has to work based on the motorâ€™s speed and this controller creates the closed loop operation of the overall system with smooth operation between the energy sources. Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller is used here to maintain the constant voltage profile for various loads at the terminals of the electric motor. Combination of PID and MFB controllers have given closed loop operation of the entire model with smooth switching between the sources. HESS with proposed controller has been applied to four different types of loads and another type with consecutive load changes are simulated in MATLAB/Simulink and obtained satisfactory results.
