This study presents the development of a novel inverse dynamic analysis-maximum power point tracking (IDA-MPPT) scheme in a hybrid energy harvesting system between thermoelectric module (TEM) and solar array (SA). The proposed method initially changes the harvested voltage response from both sources to be the third-order exponential function. This input function selection is based on the capability of this function to stabilize the initial response system and maintain its final position despite a prolonged response time. The mV voltage value from TEM is easily boosted up to nearly 5 V using this method. With this hybridization, the total obtained voltage is doubled to become 9.7 V, which results in a total power of 0.722 W. Furthermore, the method also allows for a fast tracking system, which enables faster voltage boosting and supercapacitor charging. The supercapacitor only requires less than 5 min to complete charging and boost the voltage to almost 5 V. Thus, a satisfactory value is obtained as compared with that of the TEM system with a chosen MPPC board.
