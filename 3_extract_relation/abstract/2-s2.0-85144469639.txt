The Energy Storage System (ESS) is geared toward sophisticated systems with increased operating time for a variety of real-time applications such as an electric vehicle, a WSN (Wireless Sensor Network), a Capa bus, and so on. Its primary focus is on supplying these kinds of systems with additional capacity in recent development, and this will continue to be its primary focus. Because of their exceptionally high specific power, rapid charging, and low ESR (Effective Series Resistance), electric double-layer (EDLC) capacitors or supercapacitors are encouraged for use because they can be integrated more easily with battery technology that can be used in electric vehicles and other electronic devices. The supercapacitor calls for a precise and accurate characterization in order to facilitate the development of improved applications and more effective energy storage devices and technologies. In this article, we studied various supercapacitor electrode components, electrolytic solutions, analogous circuit models, electrical energy storage properties, and some real-time supercapacitor applications in the automotive, manufacturing, construction, and consumer electronics industries. In addition, we have discussed on hybrid material that was just recently developed with the goal of enhancing the conductivity and effectiveness of supercapacitors. Aside from this, we have discussed about the behaviour of supercapacitors in terms of how their behaviour is dependent on current and voltage with detailed analysis.
