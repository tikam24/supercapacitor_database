Using concentrated sulfuric acid as the solvent, nanocomposites of iron (II) phthalocyanine and graphene oxide (denoted as FePcGOn) are rationally and facilely fabricated by self-assembly via π-π interactions. The unique structure of FePcGO2 renders the nanocomposites greatly improved conductivity and accelerated rates of both charge transfer and electrolyte migration. The tightly π-π stacking between FePc and GO bestows the materials structural stability. The molecularly dispersive FePc contributes much pseudocapacitance to elevate the energy density of supercapacitor. Three-electrode test reveals a high specific capacitance of 514 F g−1 for FePcGO2 at a current density of 1 A g−1. A capacity of 90 F g−1 sustains at an ultrahigh current density of 500 A g−1. Symmetrical two-electrode supercapacitor also demonstrates excellent supercapacitive properties of FePcGO2 and delivers a capacitance of 235.5 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 over 1 V with an energy density of 8.2 Wh kg−1. A steady capacity of 200.2 F g−1 sustains at 5 A g−1 after 60,000 cycles. Symmetrical FePcGO2 supercapacitor achieves high capacity of 308.6 F g−1 and energy density of 21 Wh kg−1 over 1.4 V at 1 A g−1. The present work provides insights into high-performance supercapacitive materials.
