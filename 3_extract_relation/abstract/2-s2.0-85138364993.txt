With the rapid development of wearable electronic devices, medical simulation equipment, and electronic textile industries, their energy storage devices need to maintain stable chemical properties after undergoing multiple tensile deformations. Flexible supercapacitors have long cycle life and mechanical properties due to their own strong, green, low-cost, and many other excellent performances; it has been widely concerned by the society. So far, the research on flexible supercapacitors has achieved excellent results. This paper focuses on the preparation process of flexible supercapacitor electrode materials and the different properties and characteristics of various electrode materials and summarizes the structure of flexible supercapacitors. The component methods, and the applications that have attracted much attention, compare the advantages of different flexible supercapacitors that exist at this stage. Finally, this paper gives a bright prospect for the development of flexible supercapacitors.
