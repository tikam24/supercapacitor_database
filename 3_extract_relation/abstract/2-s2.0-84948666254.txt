Ultralong cobalt sulfide (CoS1.097) nanotube networks are synthesized by a simple one-step solvothermal method without any surfactant or template. A possible formation mechanism for the growth processes is proposed. Owing to the hollow structure and large specific area, the novel CoS1.097 materials present outstanding electrochemical properties. Electrochemical measurements for supercapacitors show that the as-prepared ultralong CoS1.097 nanotube networks exhibit high specific capacity, good capacity retention, and excellent Coulombic efficiency.
