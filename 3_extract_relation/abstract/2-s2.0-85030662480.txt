Binderless electrodes of activated carbon monoliths (ACMs) and its composites with graphene are prepared by carbonization and activation of green monoliths consisting of self-adhesive carbon grains and 0–10 wt% KOH-treated graphene. Compared with ACMs, the optimized composite containing 6 wt% graphene exhibits more ordered micro-structures with increased crystallite height, and graphitic sp2 carbons (ID/IG = 0.49 vs. 0.91) along with enhanced porosity; as revealed by X-ray diffraction, Raman, and N2 adsorption-desorption studies. These modifications lead to increased electrical conductivity (13 vs. 9 S cm−1) through improved interconnections of carbon particles by graphene, and surface area ~ (800 vs. 456 m2 g−1) due to increased inter-particle spacing. Further, contrary to ACMs, the composite electrodes can offer faster delivery of energy in almost 50% less response time (5 vs. 8 s) due to reduced equivalent series resistance (1.67 vs. 2.65 Ω) and charge transfer resistance (0.55 vs. 1.33 Ω).
