Bismuth-Yttrium Oxide Bi3YO6 (BYO) is well-known among researchers for its potential applications in different fields but its use as an electrode for asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) has not yet been discussed and uncovered. As high energy and power densities could be well achieved with the aid of optimum potential. In the current scenario, BYO is used as an electrode material for ASCs for the first time. The material is prepared by a solid-state reaction method and its structural, morphological, and electrochemical properties have been explored by using different characterization tools. Structural analysis declared the flourite based structure of BYO having a cubic phase without any visible impurity. In a morphological analysis, a mesoporous thin film with a high surface area (~ 36.6 m2 g−1) with a narrow pore width of (~ 5–18 nm) has been observed. The as-prepared BYO employed as an electrode material for SCs delivers a high specific capacitance of (388 F g−1 at 100 m Vs−1 in the three-electrode system) with excellent cycling stability (5% loss after 6000 cycles). Essentially, an ASC is assembled using BYO and rGO as a positive and negative electrodes operating in a stable and wide potential window up to 2.2 V. Moreover, a high energy density of 11 Wh kg−1 along with a power density of 648 W kg−1 is obtained and maintained a high power density of 888 W kg−1 with the downfall of energy density to 3.7 Wh kg−1. The results prove electrode material as an alternative promising candidate for ASCs.
