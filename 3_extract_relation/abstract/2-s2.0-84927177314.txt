This study describes the capacitor behavior of carbon nanohorn (CNH)/graphene nanoplate (GNP) hybrid (CNGN). The well-CNH-decorated GNP-plate electrode materials show high capacitance value (â‰ˆ677 F/g) and can be extensively used in new generation for energy storage. In the hybrid (CNGN), two nanofillers jointly affect the capacitance behavior and increase the capacitance value of the CNGN hybrid. Homogeneous coating of CNH over the GNP plate plays an effective role to enhance the capacitance behavior of the composite. Field emission scanning electron microscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis of the composite confirmed the CNH coating on the GNP plate.
