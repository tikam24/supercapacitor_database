Nanoflake bismuth ferrite thin film was synthesized by means of electrodeposition technique at room temperature. The morphology and phase evaluation of the synthesized electrode were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and surface wettability techniques. Specifically, the bismuth ferrite nanoflake electrode exhibited high specific capacitance of 72.2 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, and high rate capability with 37 % retention of capacitance even up to 20A g−1, and excellent cycling stability with 82.8 % retention of the initial capacitance after 1500 charge/discharge cycles, supporting that the bismuth ferrite thin-film electrode could be a potential candidate for supercapacitor application.
