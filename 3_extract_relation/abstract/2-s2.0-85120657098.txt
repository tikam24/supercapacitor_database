Electrochemical capacitors or supercapacitors (SC) include electric double-layer capacitors which rely on ions adsorption for charge storage whereas pseudocapacitors depend on rapid surface redox reaction for charge storage. The energy storage capabilities of SC are much higher as compared to traditional dielectric capacitors, however, are significantly lower as compared to rechargeable batteries. SC generally has high power density, long cycle stabilities, and enhance safety and therefore may be perceived as a substitute to secondary batteries in applications that require high output power or rapid generation of energy. Several analytical methods are being utilized to characterize the size, structures, compositions, and numerous other properties of electrode materials. In numerous circumstances, more than one characterization method can be employed to assess the physical and electrochemical properties of electrode materials. The main objectives of this review are to summarize current data about the use, progress, benefits, and limitations of a variety of experimental techniques that are available to characterize the electrode materials. The characterization methods are categorized based on the principle of the technique employed, the data they can deliver, or the materials for which they are intended.
