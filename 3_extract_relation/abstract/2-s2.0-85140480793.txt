In this study, we have reported the effect of different activating agents, temperatures, and impregnation ratios on the porosity of mangosteen shell-derived activated carbons (M-S AC). The sample's characterization comprised of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and N2 physisorption analysis. The M-S AC synthesized with K2CO3 as the activating agent displayed a high specific surface area of 2802.6 m2 g−1 and a flower-like morphology. Electrochemical measurements of the M-S AC synthesized with K2CO3 revealed a specific capacitance of 298.13 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in a potential window of −0.9–0.0 V vs Ag/AgCl using 2.5 M KNO3 electrolyte in a three-electrode measurement. An initial symmetric supercapacitor assembled with the optimized M-S AC as electrode material and 2.5 M KNO3 as the electrolyte delivered a specific energy of 11.5 Wh kg−1 corresponding to a specific power of 0.4 kW kg−1 at 0.5 Ag−1 in a potential window of 1.6 V. A second assembled symmetric device using the same M-S AC as electrode material and 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium-bis(fluoroSulfonyl)imide (EmiFSI) ionic liquid as the electrolyte demonstrated high specific energy of 28.03 Wh kg−1 corresponding to a specific power of 0.7 kW kg−1 at 0.5 Ag−1 in a wider potential window of 2.8 V.
