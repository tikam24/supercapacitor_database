A high-performance and flexible fiber-shaped supercapacitor (FSC) with organic-inorganic hybrid structure was fabricated. After adding a thin layer of conductive polymer polyaniline (PANI) as both active material and electron transport path on the manganese oxide (MnO2)-coated carbon fiber thread (CFT) electrode, the capacitance of the electrode was increased by 2530 %. These CFT-MnO2-PANI hybrid electrodes were further assembled into a solid-state FSC. The as-prepared FSC device revealed excellent performance such as high volumetric capacitance, good rate capability and excellent mechanical stability in both electrochemical test and bending test. These promising results demonstrate the proposed FSC has great potential as an efficient energy storage device for wearable electronics.
