Constructing rational structure and utilizing distinctive components are two important keys to promote the development of high performance supercapacitor. Herein, we adopt a facile two-step method to develop an in-situ heterostructure with NiCo-LDH nanowire as core and NiOOH nanosheets as shell on carbon fiber cloth. The resultant NiCo-LDH@NiOOH electrode exhibites a high specific capacitance of about 2622 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and good cycling stability (88.5% remain after 10000 cycles). This reinforced electrochemical performance is benefit from the distinct core-shell structure, and takes advantage of the synergetic effect to supply more electrochemical active spots and pathways to accelerate electron and ion transport. Furthermore, the fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor of optimized NiCo-LDH@NiOOH//AC device displays a high energy density of 51.7 Wh kg−1 while the power density is 599 W kg−1 and presents a satisfying cycling performance.
