Flexible carbon nanofiber/graphene composite paper (CGCP) was fabricated by vacuum-assisted filtration of aqueous suspension of phenolic nanofibers and graphene oxide, followed by one-step thermal treatment. CGCP displayed a carbon nanofiber/graphene sandwich structure, excellent flexibility, high bulk density (0.59 g cm-3) and excellent conductivity (7.6 S cm-1), and could be used as supercapacitor electrodes free of binder. Electrochemical measurement results revealed that CGCP had high volumetric capacitance (112 F cm-3), much higher than that of traditional electrospun carbon nanofiber paper (30 F cm-3).
