Three-dimensional graphene-based aerogels (3D GAs), combining the intrinsic properties of graphene and 3D porous structure, have attracted increasing research interest in varied fields with potential application. Some related reviews focusing on applications in photoredox catalysis, biomedicine, energy storage, supercapacitor or other single aspect have provided valuable insights into the current status of Gas. However, systematic reviews concentrating on the diverse applications of 3D GAs are still scarce. Herein, we intend to afford a comprehensive summary to the recent progress in the preparation method (template-free and template-directed method) summarized in Preparation Strategies and the application fields (absorbent, anode material, mechanical device, fire-warning material and catalyst) illustrated in Application of 3D GAs with varied morphologies, structures, and properties. Meanwhile, some unsettled issues, existing challenges, and potential opportunities have also been proposed in Future Perspectives to spur further research interest into synthesizing finer 3D GAs and exploring wider and closer practical applications.
