Carbon materials possessing porous structure as well as high heteroatom doping content gradually become critical components in various electrochemical storage applications. Here, a facile route based on boric acid catalysis synthesis process was proposed to prepare hierarchical boron-doped graphene sponge. The hydrolyzed intermediate B(OH)+ 4 from boric acid acts as porous forming agent precisely making contribution to the macro-porous structure of graphene. Benefiting from unique structure and boron doping (2.4%), the obtained graphene sponge exhibits a significant improvement in capacitance (369.2 F g−1 at 2 A g−1) and maintains an outstanding rate capability (174.9 F g−1 at 30 A g−1). After 1500 cycles at 5 A g−1, the sponge electrode still possesses 91.7% of capacitance retention, revealing the promising future as a high-performance electrode material for supercapacitors.
