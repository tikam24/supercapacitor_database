Carbon nanotube prepared by catalytic pyrolysis method have been considered as active electrode materials for the storage of energy in super capacitors. The value of capacitance obtained from nanotubes reaches 42F·g-1. The electrochemical performance of double layer capacitors based on two identical carbon nanotube electrodes have been discussed in this paper. The nickel hydroxide films were prepared through the electro-deposition. A cyclic voltammetric (CV) technique was used to study the effect of the annealing temperature on pseudo-capacitance of thermal annealing treated nickel hydroxide. The nickel oxide thermally treated in air at 250°C behaves as an electrode of super capacitor with a specific capacitance (210F·g-1) superior to most active carbon electrodes. The fabrication and characterization of nickel oxide/KOH/carbon nanotubes hybrid supercapacitor have been described. Nickel oxide and carbon nanotubes prepared were applied to the positive and negative electrodes respectively. The maximum operational voltage of the capacitor was improved to 1.6V and excellent characteristic of high power discharge was attained in this way. This type of hybrid supercapacitor exhibited much lower self-discharge rate than ultra capacitor composed of two identical carbon nanotube electrodes.
