Wearable supercapacitors have broad application prospects in emerging portable devices. To realize the large-scale application, it is necessary to develop a low-cost and large-scale method to fabricate wearable electrode with high electrochemical performance. Here, polyaniline supported by graphene coated polyester textile (PANI/GPT) electrode is prepared through a simple and low-cost method. First, graphene ink with high concentration is prepared, and then the polyester textile is coated by graphene through a repeatedly soaking-drying process. Subsequently, PANI/GPT electrode is prepared by electrochemical deposition of polyaniline (PANI) on graphene coated polyester textile. The ratio of PANI in the textile electrode has been systematically modified and the obtained textile electrode possesses good energy storage performance with specific capacitance reaching 896.50 F gâˆ’1 and good rate capability. The assembled flexible supercapacitor also owns excellent flexibility with capacitance retention of 95.10% after bending for up to 5000 cycles. Such high-performance textile electrodes and the low-cost method can be widely applied to develop other wearable energy storage devices.
