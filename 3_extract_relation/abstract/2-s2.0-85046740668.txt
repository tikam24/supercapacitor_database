Transition metal oxides as Li-ion batteries (LIBs) anodes have attracted much attention because of their high theoretical capacity. However, the large volume change and low electrical conductivity still hinder their application in LIBs. In this work, a new strategy is proposed to enhance the electrochemical performance by anchoring ultrafine MnFe2O4 and MnCO3 (5nm) on amorphous carbon-coated carbon nanotubes. Benefiting from the unique structure, the electrode displays excellent cyclability with a reversible specific capacity of 1012mAh g-1 at 0.1A g-1 after 100 cycles and outstanding rate performance accompanied by a high specific capacity of 568mAh g-1 at 5A g-1 as anode for lithium batteries. When evaluated as supercapacitors, the electrode delivers the specific capacitance of 588.9F g-1 at a current density of 1A g-1 and maintains the capacitance retention 94.7% after 4000 cycles at 5A g-1.
