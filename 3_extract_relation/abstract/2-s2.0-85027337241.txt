Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has been successfully synthesized from graphite powder using Hummer’s Method. The epoxy group in GO structure was reduced using hydrazine 80 wt% at a temperature of 70, 80, and 90 °C. The optical properties of produced rGO were characterized by using UV-Vis and FTIR spectrometer. From UV-Vis spectroscopy we observe that the absorbance of rGO decreased as increasing the reduction temperature because the higher reduction temperature yields a high degree of rGO defect. The rGO produced at a reduction temperature of 70 °C has very close similiraties absorbance spectrum with rGO produced by Sigma Aldrich Company.The UV-Vis absorbance of rGO was used to calculated optical constant, and by using Kramers-Kronig relation we got refractive index values of rGO. The decreasing of absorbance may also stem out from the reducing of C=C bonding with sp2hybridization due to the presence of energetic Hydrazine as indicated by the decrease of FTIR spectrum at ~1600 cm–1. Our produced rGO then used to fabricated the supercapacitor device with a mass of 0,03 gram using Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) as a binder. From cyclic voltammetry measurement, we obtain the specific capacitance of our rGO-based supercapacitor is 2.45 F which is still in the category of supercapacitive although the optimization of rGO and PVA composition is still required. Our result shows the exciting potential of rGO based supercapacitor as electrical energy storage.
