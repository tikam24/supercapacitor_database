Typical layered transition-metal chalcogenide materials, in particular layered molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanocomposites, have attracted increasing attention in recent years due to their excellent chemical and physical properties in various research fieldsHere, a general overview of synthetic MoS2 based nanocomposites via different preparation approaches and their applications in energy storage devices (Li-ion battery, Na-ion battery, and supercapacitor) is presented. The relationship between morphologies and the electrochemical performances of MoS2-based nanocomposites in the three typical and promising rechargeable systems is also discussed. Finally, perspectives on major challenges and opportunities faced by MoS2-based materials to address the practical problems of MoS2-based materials are presented.
