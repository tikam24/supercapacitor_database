Constructing efficient thermal management system to settle the thermal runaway of energy storage devices via employing phase change microcapsules (MEPCMs) is of great significance. However, it is still a challenge that the conventional MEPCMs go against the electrochemical performance and hardly be homogenously fixed in the electrodes. In order to conquer these long-standing critical issues, we designed a novel electrochemically active double-shell phase change microcapsule by introducing polypyrrole on the surface of dense amine resin shell of the conventional inert MEPCM. The active MEPCMs@PPy are uniformly immobilized on the surface of the electrode material using reduced graphene oxide to ensure the stable and efficient operation of the flexible supercapacitor. The assembled all-solid-state supercapacitor containing MEPCMs@PPy (SCs@MEPCMs@PPy) lagged 103 s to 55 °C than the SCs@00 without the added phase change material. At a high temperature of 55 °C and a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, SCs@MEPCMs@PPy exhibits an areal specific capacitance of 110.6 mA cm−2, which is higher than that of the original SCs@MEPCMs. A capacitance retention of 79.8 % and coulombic efficiency of 98.4 % can be reached after 3000 cycles. This study opens a new avenue for developing applicable microencapsulated phase change materials in temperature-regulated electrode systems for supercapacitors and alkaline-ion batteries.
