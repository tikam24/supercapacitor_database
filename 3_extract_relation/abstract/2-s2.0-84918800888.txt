In the current study, we present a new hybrid material of double layer capacitive material graphene (GNS), pseudo capacitive polypyrrole (PPY) and highly conducting silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). Graphene/Silver nanoparticles/polypyrrole (GNS/AgNPs/PPY) composite has been synthesized by in situ oxidative polymerization of pyrrole in the presence of GNS and AgNPs. The different mass concentrations of AgNPs were utilized to improve the capacitive performance of supercapacitor. Characterization of the electrode material has been carried out by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, Thermal methods, Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Transmission electron microscopy. SEM images showed that PPY nanoparticles uniformly coated on graphene sheets along with AgNPs. Electrochemical characterization of the electrode surface has been carried out by means of cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Remarkably, GNS/AgNPs/PPY exhibits specific capacitance of 450 F g-1 at current density of 0.9 mA g-1, which is far better than GNS/PPY (288 F g-1), AgNPs/PPY (216 F g-1) and PPY (153 F g-1). Furthermore, GNS/AgNPs/PPY shows high charge-discharge reversibility and retaining over 92.0% of its initial value after 1000 cycles. The cyclic stability of the composite is improved due to the synergistic effect of GNS, AgNPs and PPY.
