Based on the characteristics of CAES(Compressed Air Energy Storage)'s high energy density and SC(Supercapacitor)'s high power density, a hybrid energy storage system has been designed. Much quicker dynamic response can be reached by using auto power modulation mode. In addition, high efficiency of cycling compression can be kept. Rules-based energy management strategy was designed for the operating of hybrid energy storage system. The cycle and the global hybrid storage system's efficiency were analyzed. Energy management methods of the hybrid storage system are studied. Auto-frequency modify power control and rule based control were present. The simulation and test of a designed 15 kW level hybrid storage system was verified the validity of the design.
