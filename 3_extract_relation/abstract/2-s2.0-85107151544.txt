Boron carbide powders were synthesized by mechanically activated annealing process using anhydrous boron oxide (B2O3) and varying carbon (C) sources such as graphite and activated carbon: The precursors were mechanically activated for different times in a high energy ball mill and reacted in an induction furnace. According to the Raman analyses of the carbon sources, the I(D)/I(G) ratio increased from ~ 0.25 to ~ 0.99, as the carbon material changed from graphite to active carbon, indicating the highly defected and disordered structure of active carbon. Complementary advanced EPR analysis of defect centers in B4C revealed that the intrinsic defects play a major role in the electrochemical performance of the supercapacitor device once they have an electrode component made of bare B4C. Depending on the starting material and synthesis conditions the conductivity, energy, and power density, as well as capacity, can be controlled hence high-performance supercapacitor devices can be produced.
