2D layered graphene and inorganic graphene analogue structures are attracting considerable research interest as electrode materials of energy storage devices due to their intrinsic electronic properties. Herein, we report the preparation of few-layered MoS2 nanosheets by exfoliation from bulk for electrochemical application. A nanocomposite containing MoS2 and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has been prepared by simple physical mixing. The as-prepared MoS2 nanosheets and the MoS2-rGO nanocomposite have been characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, Transmission Electron microscopy, Scanning Electron microscopy, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy analyses. The electrochemical properties of the MoS2 nanosheets and MoS2-rGO nanocomposite have been analyzed in 3-electrode configuration. At a scan rate of 10 mV s−1, the MoS2 nanosheets and the MoS2-rGO nanocomposite exhibit specific capacitance values of 375 Fg-1, and 739 Fg-1 respectively. MoS2-rGO nanocomposite electrode retains a stability of 96% ven after 5000 cycles of continuous charge-discharge at a current density of 6 A g−1.
