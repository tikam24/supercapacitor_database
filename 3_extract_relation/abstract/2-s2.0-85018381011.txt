This piece of work focuses on wind power generation with hybrid storage system, e.g., hydrogen (fuel cell) and supercapacitor. The wind power has the priority to meet the demand. The fuel cell is added as a backup to ensure long-term energy balance while the supercapacitor is utilized as a buffer and/or backup source during transient. The complete architecture is connected to the utility through various power converters to improve the overall system stability, continuity and reliability of power. The operation of the proposed system is performed through Power Management and Control Strategy (PMCS). The PMCS works in such a way as to maximize the use of wind/fuel/supercapacitor and reduce stress on the utility. The performance of the system is tested for complete one day under different weather and load conditions. MATLAB/Simulink results are shown to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model.
