Heteroatom doping is a promising strategy for improving the electrochemical performance of carbon materials. Herein, we spotlight an advantageous, simple, and efficient CVD synthesis of P-doped 3D cubic ordered mesoporous carbon (POMC) for the first time. The POMC was prepared by pyrolysis of acetylene/triphenylphosphine (C2H2/Ph3P) mixture at relatively low temperature over Fe-KIT-6 as a sacrificial template. The ensuing P-doped OMC showed an enhanced porous texture than an undoped counterpart with a specific surface area of 403.5 m2/g, pore volume of 0.545 cm3/g, average pore size of 4.64 nm and suitable heteroatom functionalities with P and O contents of 0.13% and 9.83%, correspondingly. The obtained POMC exhibited a much higher specific capacitance of 288F/g at 0.2 A/g (175F/g for OMC), good cyclic stability of 97.6 %, and good rate capability than pristine OMC in 6 M KOH. It is equivalent to or improved than various stated mono doped and even dual doped porous carbon electrodes. Furthermore, a symmetric supercapacitor (POMC//POMC) was fabricated with 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous neutral electrolyte exhibits high cycling stability (89.3%) even with a wide potential window (2.0 V) and offers a relatively high energy density (10.01 Wh/kg) with a power density of 300 W/kg.
