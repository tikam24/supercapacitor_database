To solve the problem of low energy density in supercapacitor devices, enhancing the specific capacity of the anode is essential and urgent. FeS2 nanoellipsoids have been prepared using a rapid microwave-assisted method as an anode for supercapacitors. The anode possesses a wide working potential (-1.2 to 0 V), and a high specific capacity (515 C g-1 at 1 A g-1) in 2 M KOH, showing obvious improvement over conventional carbon materials used for supercapacitors. As a consequence, the maximum energy density reached 64 W h kg-1 at 271.2 W kg-1 thanks to the high specific capacity of the FeS2 anode, and the as-fabricated brand new device was able to retain 91% of its initial capacitance after 5000 cycles. Moreover, the as-prepared FeS2 ellipsoids also exhibit efficient electrocatalytic oxygen evolution in 1 M KOH with an overpotential of 370 mV at 10 mA cm-2 (vs. RHE). Therefore, the as-prepared FeS2 electrode holds huge potential for use in energy storage and conversion applications in the future.
