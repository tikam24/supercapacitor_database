The paper discusses on a control algorithm applied to a hybrid PV power system. The hybrid power system is constituted by directly connecting an Electric Double Layer Capacitor (EDLC) device on the dc output bus of the PV Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT) converter. The aim of this paper is to propose a control approach applied to the dc power converter able to assure a double set-point regulation, which takes into account the operational constraints of both the PV power source and storage buffer. Control design is based on a cascade strategy. The controller parameters are synthesize basing on the State Space Averaging (SSA) method and low perturbation approach. A numerical simulator is set up in Â®Matlab. The results of simulations aim to validate the features of the proposed approach.
