In this paper, we report a facile template-free method to prepare the T-Nb2O5/CNTs composite. The addition of ammonia induces the electrostatic interaction between functionalized CNTs and niobic acid colloids during hydrothermal process, resulting in CNTs homogeneously distributed in the T-Nb2O5phase. The obtained T-Nb2O5/CNTs composite shows high rate Li+storage ability with typical intercalation capacitive behaviour. The presence of well-dispersed CNTs in Nb2O5can apparently reduce the limitation from diffusion process and increase the high rate charge-discharge capability. From the galvanostatic tests, a capacity of ∼180 mAh g−1at 1 A g−1and ∼130 mAh g−1at 5 A g−1is attained.
