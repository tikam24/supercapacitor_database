In the present work, we have prepared polymeric nanocomposites of various weight levels of polymer along with metal oxide. Further, the crystallographic and basic examinations were finished. In continuation, after the anode development of the readied tests, the electrical measurement were performed. This test work has demonstrated the better outcomes in all space, viz. structural and electrical properties, which will make it appropriate for different electrical and mechanical applications. The best instances of such arranged structures are supercapacitor, high energy storing devices, and multi-layered capacitors etc.
