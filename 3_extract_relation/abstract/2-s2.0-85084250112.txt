The N-doped mesoporous carbon materials (CNM) had been synthesized with hard template method. Benzoxazine (BOZ) was adopted as a precursor and SBA-15 as template. The electrochemical performance of carbon materials prepared by different ultrasonic time, different benzoxazine concentration and different carbonization temperature were conducted by a three-electrode system. In order to further explain electrochemical behaviour of the obtained carbon materials, the corresponding characterizations were also done. CNM-800 had a highest specific capacitance value, 428.8 F g−1 (0.25 A/g) in the three-electrode system. After 20,000 cycles of CNM-800 at the current density of 5 A g−1, CNM-800 still had 98.5% of the original capacitance, which showed that CNM-800 had a good cycling stability. In order to investigate the application value of supercapacitors, a two-electrode system was also adopted, a maximum energy density was 11.2 Wh kg−1. The prepared carbon material (CNM-800) have the higher specific capacitance than the related literatures. This kind of N-doped mesoporous carbon material would have a potential application value as supercapacitor.
