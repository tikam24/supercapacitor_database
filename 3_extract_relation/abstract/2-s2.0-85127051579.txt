In this work ferric oxide (Fe3O4) based carbon nanocomposite were studied as anode material for supercapacitor applications. A comparison between the structural, optical and electrochemical properties of carbon nanotube (CNTs) and their composites with different ratio of Fe3O4 are reported. The synthesized nanohybrids are characterized via X-ray diffractometry (XRD), Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS), UVâ€“Vis, Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scaning field electron microscopy (SEM). The cyclic voltammetry was employed to study electrochemical supercapacitor performance of the hybrid.
