Supercapacitors are energy storage devices that have the ability to be charged and discharged much faster than batteries but suffer from low energy density. In researching the influence of pore dimensions of activated carbon to increase energy storage, we reported earlier that there can be a significant fraction of charge held in activated carbon that has a very long redistribution time constant, at least for the carbon source with which we were working. This implies that the energy density could be increased if we can understand the reasons for charge redistribution. In this paper, the research has been extended to include other commercial carbon sources and similar charge redistribution phenomenon has been found. The effect of temperature has been studied to understand the phenomenon of charge redistribution in activated carbon supercapacitors. Â© The Electrochemical Society.
