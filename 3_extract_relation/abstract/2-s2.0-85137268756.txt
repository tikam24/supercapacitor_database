The objective of our project is to propose a novel regeneration-braking scheme for an electric vehicle (EV) driven by a BLDC motor and to comment upon the control technique to discuss effective regenerative braking. One of the drawbacks of the EV is the range between the two charging stations. The efficiency and the drive-range of an EV can drastically be increased by improving the regen- braking and properly utilizing the energy because of it. The proposed work implements regenerative braking incorporating a supercapacitor along with a Li-ion battery. The major advantage of this proposal is the simultaneous usage of both battery, super capacitance as the battery has relatively greater energy density and lesser power density, and the supercapacitor has lesser energy density but very high-power density. When climbing, the electric vehicle needs more power, depending on the load and the power required a supercapacitor's energy storage system is activated. Integration of the battery pack and super capacitator is carried out using bidirectional converters. The simulation work is carried out using Matlab software and the results prove the effective regenerative braking action incorporating supercapacitors.
