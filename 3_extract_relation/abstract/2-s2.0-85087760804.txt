A solid-state supercapacitor was designed based on conjugated polymerâ€“quantum dots composite synthesized by the in-situ chemical method. The polypyrrole-graphene quantum dots composite (PGC) was used to preparation of flexible supercapacitor electrode with various PVA/KOH, PVA/H3PO4, PVA/H2SO4, PVA/KCl gel electrolytes. It is observed that PPY-GQDs exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 730 F/g for PVA/H3PO4 gel electrolyte. The Nyquist plots of supercapacitors have been measured. The optimization of concentrations of electrically conducting substances in polymer gel enhanced the electrochemical properties of the supercapacitor. This shows the latest accomplishment in this field and provides insight advancement in supercapacitor.
