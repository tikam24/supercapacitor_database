The first part of the paper offers an overview of the state-of-art of microgrids, their architectures and the control of AC microgrid. Its second part focuses on the dynamics of the DC microgrid control taking into account an ideal and a nonlinear model of supercapacitors. It compares the transient processes obtained by simulation by using the two different supercapacitor models. Â© 2012 IEEE.
