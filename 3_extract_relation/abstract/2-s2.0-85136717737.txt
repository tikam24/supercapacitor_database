As an energy storage component of wearable electronics, planar micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) hold great advantages in terms of flexibility, miniaturization, and integration. However, the preparation process of MSCs is rather cumbersome. A simple, fast, and efficient technique for preparing MSCs is still of strong desirability. Herein, a fast and efficient laser direct writing technique is proposed to in situ fabricate NiO nanoparticles anchored on N-doped laser-induced graphene (NiO/NLIG) composite electrodes on account of the formation principle of the polyimide (PI) film, which are subsequently assembled into high-performance flexible planar MSCs. The as-assembled NiO/NLIG MSCs can achieve a remarkable areal specific capacitance of 25.11 mF cm-2, a superior energy density of 1.88 mW h cm-2 at a high power density of 0.02 mW cm-2, excellent bendability, and good cycling performance. Furthermore, due to advantages of consistency and stability of laser direct writing, the proposed high-performance planar NiO/NLIG MSCs with consistency and stability can be easily modularized and integrated to provide customized requirements and are the most promising crucial micro-power energy storage components for flexible integrated electronics.
