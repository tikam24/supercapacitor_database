Biomass activated carbons used as electrode materials for supercapacitors were prepared from shaddock peel via preliminary carbonization coupled with KOH activation. The microstructures including pore structure and surface morphology and the surface chemistry property of biomass activated carbons were characterized by low temperature N 2 adsorption, scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The electrochemical characteristics of biomass activated carbons applied as electrode materials were also investigated using galvanostatic charge-discharge, cyclic voltammetry and leakage current. The results show that high quality biomass activated carbons with specific surface area of 1 347-2 269 m 2 /g, total pore volume of 0.642-1.283 cm 3 /g, mesopore percentage of 23.83%-48.90% were obtained from shaddock peel through preliminary carbonization coupled with KOH activation routes. The as-prepared biomass activated carbons exhibited well-developed specific surface area with "macropore-mesopore-micropore" three dimensional interconnected hierarchical pore structure and contained some oxygen-containing functional groups such as carbonyl, phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl on the surface of these activated carbons, which might become a promising electrode materials for supercapacitors. Biomass activated carbon electrode materials exhibited an excellent capacitance characteristics and superior cycling performance in KOH aqueous electrolyte. The maximum gravimetric specific capacitance of biomass activated carbon electrode materials was as high as 243 F/g at a current density of 50 mA/g and still remained 175 F/g even at a current density of 5 000 mA/g, the leakage current was only 0.006 3 mA and 93.34% of the initial specific capacitance was retained after 1 000 cycles. The superior electrochemical performances of biomass activated carbons were strongly depended on their well-developed specific surface area, macropore-mesopore-micropore three dimensional interconnected hierarchical pore structure, reasonable pore size distribution as well as unique oxygen-enriched surface chemistry property.
