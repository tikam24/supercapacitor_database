Advancement in technology enhances the need for quick and efficient ways of charging electric devices. Increased need for portability has motivated us to make use of Wireless Power Transfer technology (WPT). In this paper, Magnetic Resonant Technique (MRT) based WPT system has been used to transfer the power wirelessly over larger airgaps. The conventional electric vehicles uses a battery as the main source and it suffers from large 1charging time and also it requires huge amount of space for the charging station. This paper illustrates various methods to implement WPT-MRT and supercapacitor based two-wheeler type electric vehicle (EV) to diminish the charging issues in the system. In this paper, 3-phase Permanent Magnet Brushless DC Motor (PMBLDC) is also used as a traction motor since it is energy efficient, has high torque per volume and greater ease of control compared to other motors. A TI controller is used as a central control unit to monitor the control variables of the system. This paper presents experimental interpretations of various compensation topologies and proves the supreme topology to achieve highest coupling coefficient to make maximum power transfer possible in the system. In this paper, the investigations and experimental study are further extended to provide a durable solution to facilitate fast / frequent charging for short commuting electric vehicles of the future.
