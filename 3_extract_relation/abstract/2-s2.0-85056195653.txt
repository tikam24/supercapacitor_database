Cobalt vanadates and their composites have drawn tremendous attention because of their outstanding cycling stability. Rational design of 3D micro/nano-structures using a facile strategy has a promising potential for supercapacitor applications. Herein, we propose a 3D porous Co 2 V 2 O 7 ·3.3H 2 O microflowers electrode as a cathode for pseudocapacitor via a simple co-precipitation technology. The resultant Co 2 V 2 O 7 ·3.3H 2 O with microflowers structure exhibits a high specific capacitance of 351 F g −1 at a current density of 1 A g −1 , and an ultralong cycle lifetime with 103% capacitance retention after 30,000 cycles. An asymmetric supercapacitor device is also successfully assembled consisting of Co 2 V 2 O 7 ·3.3H 2 O cathode and rGO anode. The optimized ACS device with a potential window of 0–1.5 V delivers a high energy density and an excellent cycle lifetime. These superior electrochemical properties will render the 3D porous Co 2 V 2 O 7 ·3.3H 2 O microflowers material as an attractive material for promising application in energy storage systems.
