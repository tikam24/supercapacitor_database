We report a novel highly sensitive and pseudocapacitive transparent nickel oxide (NiO) thin film based electrode material fabricated on a conductive glass substrate using a facile binderless electrodeposition process. Effect of the incorporation of Mo-dopant ion on some surface structural and electrochemical properties of the electrode was examined for high performance optoelectronic and charge storage potentials. The material showed some uniqueness in some microstructural features and enhanced degree of crystallinity, suitable for charge extraction and transport with Mo doping. The deposited NiO film demonstrated red shift in band structure by exhibiting optical band gap narrowing from 3.88 to 3.61 eV with increasing Mo content. The degree of disorder as revealed from Urbach response of NiO film was found varying with Mo-content. The material also exhibited enhanced Ni2+ electronic transition states with increasing Mo content which quenched at a critical dopant concentration of 2.4 %. The fabricated NiO thin film electrode showed increased supercapacitive specific capacitance and areal capacity up to a peak value of 1412 Fg−1 and 101 mAh m−2 for 3 % Mo dopant content at 5 mVs−1 scan rate and 0.5 mA cm−2, respectively, but returned diminished at higher dopant content. Excellent cycling stability at ∼ 85 % after 5000 cycles, was also exhibited. Impedance spectroscopic features of Mo-doped NiO electrode indicated fast electrolytic ion transfer response with high rate charge storage capability. The study presents successful fabrication of Mo-modified NiO nanostructured electrode film and demonstrated the influence of Mo impurity on tailoring the properties of NiO host film as suitable electrode in high performance photocatalytic and supercapacitor devices.
