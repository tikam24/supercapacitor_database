A sensitivity analysis method with single factor variation was presented in order to study the relationship between the configuration of lithium battery and supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system (HESS) and the performances of the electric vehicle (EV).In addition,a simulation model of lithium battery and supercapacitor HESS was developed based on the power follower energy management strategy.What＇s more,the effects on the EV＇s performances by the HESS configuration were investigated.Simulation studies show that the number of lithium batteries in series has little effect on the EV＇s performances and the sensitivities are between -0.041 to 0.099.However,the numbers of supercapacitors in series and in parallel have great effect on the EV＇s maximum speed with the sensitivities between 0.180 and 0.277.The number of supercapacitors in series has the greatest effect on the EV＇s acceleration performance,and the sensitivity is between -0.862 and -0.650.The number of supercapacitors in parallel also has great influence on the EV＇s acceleration performance and the sensitivity is between -0.289 and -0.154.The HESS configuration has little effect on the EV＇s energy consumption and the sensitivities are between -0.041 and 0.057.The conclusions are verified by experimental results,which can become a design reference for improving the EV＇s performance.
