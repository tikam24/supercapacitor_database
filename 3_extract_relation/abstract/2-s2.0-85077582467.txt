Environmental pollution is one of the significant area under discussion that the world is facing nowadays and it is increasing day by day and leading to serious and dangerous consequence to this world. Electrical energy storage (EES) plays a very important part in everyday life because of our reliance on various transportable devices. Nano- and atomic-level two-dimensional (2D) materials have broad applications in optoelectronic devices. This review deals with the cutting edge of EES devices, highlights advances to overcome present restrictions, and helps us to go further to get future advanced EES technology based devices, whose uniqueness symbolizes an exact hybridization of batteries and capacitors. The essential features of 2D materials are illustrated, and their energy storage systems are also reviewed. Secondly, energy storage performances of 2D materials-based batteries and supercapacitors (SC) will also be highlighted. At last, a few efficient schemes for boosting their performance based on 2D materials are also explained. The prospect and challenges of the 2D-material-based energy storage at commercial level are also provided.
