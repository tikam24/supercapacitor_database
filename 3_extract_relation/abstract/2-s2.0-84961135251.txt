Hetero atom doped few layers of reduced graphene have been synthesized by single step approach called solar power modified electrochemical technique and investigated for supercapacitor applications. The structure and morphology of nitrogen doped graphene nanosheets (S-NGNS) was characterized with powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), SEM, HR-TEM, FTIR, Raman and XPS. The electrochemical activity of the S-NGNS was evaluated using CV, chargeâ€“discharge and impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte solution. From X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, it was confirmed that the trace amount (0.48 %) of N doping in the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets. As an electrode for supercapacitor the proposed S-NGNS showed the specific capacitance (Scp) values of 85 F/g at constant current density of 0.125 A/g.
