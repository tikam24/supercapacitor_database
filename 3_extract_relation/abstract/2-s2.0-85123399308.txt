In this work, we have used solution cast technique method to Synthesize an ionic liquid incorporated PVP with ammonium iodide doped solid polymer electrolyte. There was an inclination of one order conductivity in PVP-NH4I complex after addition of ionic liquid in it which was justified by complex impedance spectroscopy. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Polarized optical microscopy was also done to check the blending nature and amorphousity of the polymer electrolyte. At last, we have successfully developed a supercapacitor using IL doped polymer electrolyte shows a reasonable and stable efficiency.
