Coplanar supercapacitors on textiles have received much concern with the development of flexible and wearable energy-storage-devices because this configuration can remarkably enhance the mechanical deformation and facilitate the integration with other devices as compared with conventional stacked configuration. However, the low energy density limits their applications. Here, in-plane hybrid supercapacitor (IHSC) on textile with special positive electrode is put forward to improve the energy density. The battery-type electrode is incorporated by combining the high capacity of metallic layer double hydroxide (NiCoAl-LDH), the high conductivity of Ti3C2Tx MXene and Ag nanowires, with the skeleton function of Ti3C2Tx MXene, which displays high capacity of 592C g−1 at 1 A g−1, high-rate performance, and long cycle life over 10,000 cycles. Based on this composite material and active carbon (negative electrode), screen-printed IHSC device on textile presents high areal energy density of 22.18 μWh cm−2 and power density of 3.0 mW cm−2, which is outstandingly superior to those conventional carbon-based in-plane supercapacitors on textiles. In addition, the device shows the excellent bending capability. These remarkable properties of textile based IHSCs demonstrate their promising potential as effective and printable power sources used in flexible and wearable electronics.
