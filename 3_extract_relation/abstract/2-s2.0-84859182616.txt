A new type of Li-ion supercapacitor was fabracatied with activated carbon as cathode and graphite pre-intercalated Li ion as anode. The electrochemical characterization was also conducted with cyclic voltammetry and AC impedance methods. By this unique cell design, the capacitance of Li-ion supercapacitor keep the same level to double elecric layer supercapacitor ,But the voltage window of supercapacitor can be enhanced from 2.5V to 4.2V.So the energy density of Li-ion supercapacitor can be enhanced 4 times of common carbon-based supacapacitor. There is above 99% capacitance retention for Li ion supercapacitor after 200 cycles at 200mA discharge current. A pure capacitance behavior can be found at the frequency below the knee in its AC impedance spectroscopy. Â© (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
