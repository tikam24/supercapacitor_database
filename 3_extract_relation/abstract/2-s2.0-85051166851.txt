The flower-like NiMnO3/Ni(OH)2 growing on multifunctional nickel foam is designed for the first time though a facile, eco-friendly and straightforward hydrothermal method, in which nickel foam acts as substrate, reductant and the nickel resource. The concentration of bivalent nickel ion plays a key role for the component and capacitive performance of composite. Without outside nickel resource, NiMnO3 are obtained, and their specific capacitance is 750 F g−1 at the current density of 1 mA cm−2. Under the high consistence of bivalent nickel ion, the flower-like NiMnO3/Ni(OH)2 is produced. Its specific capacitance is up to 3800 F g−1 at the current density of 1 mA cm−2. Such exceptional capacitive performance is attributed to the unique flower-like structure, excellent contact of active materials with nickel foam substrate and the synergistic effect of constituents. This method can be extended to the synthesis of other bimetallic oxides and other more extensive composites. And the flower-like NiMnO3/Ni(OH)2 provides a feasible and potential candidate of practical applications of supercapacitor.
