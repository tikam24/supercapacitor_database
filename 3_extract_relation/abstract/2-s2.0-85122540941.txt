In the context of carbon peak and carbon neutrality targets, high-proportion new energy power systems exhibit low inertia and weak damping characteristics. The frequency stability of the new power system has become a major problem for the safe and stable operation of the power grid. The traditional primary frequency modulation technology based on thermal power units or hydropower units has the defects of slow response speed and long frequency detection delay time. Therefore, we propose a multi-functional multiplexing super capacitor fast power control system, which has the functions of frequency stability control and voltage sag management. In the meantime, we proposed a fast frequency detection algorithm for cascaded signal delay, and the frequency detection delay is less than 10 ms. The system uses a high-speed communication ring network, and the communication delay is less than two milliseconds. Finally, we built a super capacitor energy storage system with a capacity of 50kW to verify that the super-capacitor has the ability to quickly and actively support the power system under frequency disturbances.
