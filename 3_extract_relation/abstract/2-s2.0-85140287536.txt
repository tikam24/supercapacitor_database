Hard carbons (HCs) are an ideal anode materials for lithium ion capacitors (LICs). However, its power capability is limited by low conductivity and poor ion diffusion kinetics. Optimized graphitic degree, appropriate hierarchical pore structure and efficient heteroatom doping can enhance the rate capability from different dimensions. But it is very difficult to achieve simultaneously through simple synthetic strategies. Herein, an ingenious self-assembly strategy is presented for the preparation of N/P co-doped hierarchical porous graphitic HCs (DGPCs). In the self-assembly process, chitosan was cross-linked with Ni2+ and phytic by chelation and esterification reactions, respectively. Benefiting from the double reaction design, different active sites are separated and thus coupling of multiple modifications is achieved. Optimal sample presents excellent power performance and good cycling stability. Kinetic analysis demonstrates that the Li ion diffusion rate is effectively increased. GDPC-1//AC LIC delivered a high energy density of 50.5 Wh kg−1 at an ultra-high power density of 20 kW kg−1. The outstanding power capability is attributed to the synergistic effect between catalytic graphitization, hierarchical porous structure and N/P co-doping, which comprehensively improves the diffusion kinetics of Li+. This work provides a simple and effective strategy for realizing multiple modifications to improve the power capability of hard carbons.
