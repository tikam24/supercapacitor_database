The article discusses fast-charging systems for supercapacitors as promising power storages. Analyses of constant voltage charging systems, constant current systems and constant power systems have been conducted. Selected network solutions and controlling algorithms were compared based upon performed simulations results. The mutual impact between electrical transformers utilized in the charging process has been taken into consideration. The higher THD factor has been selected as the criterion. A short comparison of few autonomous power storages has been presented, namely supercapacitorâ€™s, flywheel's and fuel cell's. To the needs of the research, the mapping of currents and voltage in the supercapacitor, in the proxy circuit as well as in the electrical network has been registered. The impact of the entire charging system on the electrical network has been evaluated and calculated according to the harmonic THD factor.
