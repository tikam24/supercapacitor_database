The activated carbon was obtained from casuarina bark skin (CBS). CBS were carbonized by 9 M concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and activated by a chemical activation process by adjusting the concentration of KOH in simple microwave pyrolysis. Obtained activated carbon sample has a defined surface area of about 4588 m2/g. In this study, the activator was KOH solution, is used to synthesise activated carbon from biomass. The activated carbon is created from casuarina bark skin in a 3 wt% KOH solution, and the resulting activated carbon material had a high specific capacitance of 333 F/g and a current density of 0.5 A/g. After 5000 cycles of testing, the produced activated carbon show extreme durability. According to the findings, biomass such as casuarina bark may be utilized to produce activated carbon, which can be used as a substitute for traditional anode materials in supercapacitor applications.
