In this paper, a super capacitor charging management integrated circuit (IC) based on reconfigurable photovoltaic cells array is proposed. This IC is based on a novel maximum power point tracking (MPPT) method that arranges photovoltaic (PV) cells into different combination networks in order to optimize the charging efficiency dynamically. With the reconfigurable PV array, various voltage outputs of PV cells charge the super capacitor without inductor based switching regulator. The MPPT circuit is designed according to the I-V characteristics and P-V characteristics of the PV cells. Depending on the charging stage of the super capacitor, different series/parallel combination networks of the PV cells are selected to make the PV cells work in the vicinity of the maximum output power to achieve a higher charging efficiency. Charging current of a single PV ranges from 10μA to 100μA, the charging efficiency from a small PV cells array to IF-5V super capacitor can reach more than 80%, up to 94%.
