In recent years the research on electrospun nanofibers (NFs) has captured considerable attention, owing to their high specific areas, unique electron and mass transfer capability, strong plasticity, and easy preparation. A large variety of metal oxides, including ruthenium (Ru), manganese (Mn), vanadium (V), nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), titanium, and (Ti) oxides, in terms of NFs, porous NFs, hollow NFs, tubular NFs, and core-sheath NFs, have been fabricated via electrospinning and posttreatment methods, which have been broadly applied as electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors. In this chapter we will highlight the development of the electrospun metal oxides and their composite NFs for supercapacitor electrodes. The synthetic strategies for these materials and the influence of the compositions and architectures on the electrocatalytic performance are discussed. In addition, the symmetrical or asymmetrical supercapacitors are highlighted to reveal their exciting promise.
