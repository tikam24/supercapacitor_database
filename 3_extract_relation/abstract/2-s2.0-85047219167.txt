Nozzle-free electrospinning was investigated as a facile technique for producing nanoscale materials for supercapacitors. MnO2 nanofibers and their composites with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were synthesized in a single step, using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and Mn(CH3COO)2Â·4H2O as starting materials, followed up by heat treatment in ambient air. Nanofibers of relatively uniform diameter were produced at high rates. The nanofibers exhibited good electrical contact between MnO2 and MWCNT without degradation, which was attributed to the improved stability of MWCNTs in PVP solutions. Electrochemical testing of the composites demonstrated a high capacitance of 1.43 F cm-2 at a scan rate of 100 mV s-1 in the three-electrode tests. Electrodes and devices produced by nozzle-free electrospinning are promising for practical energy storage applications.
