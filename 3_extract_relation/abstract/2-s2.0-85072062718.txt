This paper presents a “full green” version of a rubber tyre gantry (RTG) crane with a fuel cell (FC) unit and supercapacitors (SCs) as energy storage system (ESS), instead of using the conventional RTG powered by a diesel engine. The SCs provide the required high current peaks and power demands when accelerating the load in the hoisting-up movement. Once the power demand reaches a steady level (hoist up constant speed), the FC provides the energy needed for the rest of the movements. The SCs are also charged when the hoist down movement is taking place. In this case, the regenerative energy can be stored in the SCs instead of being burnt in the braking resistors as in the conventional RTG crane. The new hybrid powertrain based on FC and SCs is designed and evaluated from the real driving cycle of the RTG crane. Simulation results, which include a comparative study with the current configuration of the RTG crane (powered only by diesel engine), demonstrate the technical viability of the RTG crane powered by FC and SCs. This hybrid powertrain is more expensive than the diesel powertrain, but more energy-efficient, and a better solution from the environmental point of view.
