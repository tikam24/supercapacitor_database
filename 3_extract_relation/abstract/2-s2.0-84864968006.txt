We report a high energy supercapacitor device that utilizes hybrid carbon electrodes and the ionic liquid, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMIMBF4) as an electrolyte. The hybrid electrodes were prepared from reduced graphite oxide (rGO) and purified single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). A simple casting technique gives a hybrid structure with optimum porosity and functionality that provides high energy and power density. The combination of SWNT and rGO in a weight ratio of 1:1 was found to afford specific capacitance of 222 F/g and energy density of 94 Wh/kg at room temperature.
