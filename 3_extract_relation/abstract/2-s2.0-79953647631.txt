We reported the realization of assembling compact-designed supercapacitors using large-scaled free-standing and flexible single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films as both anode and cathode. A prototype of the processing procedures was developed to obtain the uniform spreading of the SWCNT films onto the separators serving as both electrodes and charge collectors without metallic current collectors, leading to a simplified and lightweight architecture. The area of SWCNT film on a separator can be scaled up and its thickness can be extended. High energy and power densities (43.7 Wh kg -1 and 197.3 kW kg-1, respectively) were achieved from the prepared SWCNT film-based compact-designed supercapacitors with small equivalent series resistance. The specific capacitance of this kind of compact-designed SWCNT film supercapacitor is about 35 F g-1. These results clearly show the potential application of free-standing SWCNT film in compact-designed supercapacitor with enhanced performance and significantly improved energy and power densities.
