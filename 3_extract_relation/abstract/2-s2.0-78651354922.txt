A fully soft-switched bidirectional converter to interface an ultra-capacitor (UC) and a battery is proposed. The proposed converter acts as a buck zero current transition (ZCT) to charge the UC and acts as a boost zero voltage transition (ZVT) to discharge the UC. The ZVT and ZCT techniques guarantee soft-switching condition for all power switches. The proposed converter has high efficiency (above 95%), requires fewer components and has a small footprint. The analysis of the switching technique is validated by simulation. In addition, a 100 W experimental converter is constructed. The results from simulation and experiment are in good agreement with each other. Â© Institution of Engineers Australia, 2010.
