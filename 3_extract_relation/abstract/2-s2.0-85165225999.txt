In this work, we have developed a series of materials AFe1−xMnxO3 (A= La0.67Ca0.13Ba0.2) with x = 0, 0.03 and 0.06 by the self-combustion method using glycine and annealed at 1173 K. Analysis of X-ray diffractograms shows that these compounds crystallize in the same cubic structure with the same space group Pm3̅m. Morphology and EDS analysis confirm the presence of all the elements and attests to the purity of these compounds. Electrical measurements show that at low temperatures, these compounds obey Jonscher's modified law, whereas above 420 K they obey Jonscher's classical law. The adjustment of the Nyquist diagrams leads to modeling these samples at low temperatures by two electric circuits connected in series (Rg//CPEg) + (Rgb//CPEgb) reflecting the contributions of the grains and the grain boundaries. Dielectric analysis indicates high permittivity and low loss suggesting that these compounds are good candidates for use in the electronic systems industry and supercapacitor applications.
