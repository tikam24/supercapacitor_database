A double-switch cell voltage equalizer using a parallel-resonant-inverter (PRI) or series-parallel-resonant inverter (SPRI) and voltage multiplier is proposed for series-connected supercapacitors (SCs), such as electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and lithium-ion capacitors. The double-switch operation without the need for a multiwinding transformer offers simpler circuitry as well as better modularity than conventional equalizers requiring multiple switches and/or a multiwinding transformer. Furthermore, the inherent constant current characteristic of the PRI/SPRI at a fixed frequency, not only removes the need for feedback control to limit currents under desired levels but the proposed equalizer can also operate safely, even when some cell voltage is 0 V. Detailed operation analyses were separately performed for the voltage multiplier and PRI/SPRI, and a dc equivalent circuit for the proposed equalizer was mathematically derived. A 10-W prototype for 12 cells connected in series was built, and an experimental equalization test was performed for EDLCs from an initially voltage imbalanced condition. Voltage imbalance of the series-connected EDLCs was successfully eliminated by the equalizer, demonstrating the equalization performance of the proposed equalizer. Â© 1986-2012 IEEE.
