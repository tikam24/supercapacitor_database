This paper proposes a novel modular equalization architecture using inter-module and intra-module equalizers for energy storage systems comprising multiple cells/modules connected in series. In the proposed equalization architecture, cells in a module is equalized by a series-resonant voltage multiplier (SRVM)-based intra-module equalizer while module voltages are unified by a switched capacitor converter (SCC)-based inter-module equalizer. A square wave voltage generated at a switching node of the SCC-based inter-module equalizer is utilized to drive the SRVM-based intra-module equalizer so that the SRVM-based intra-module equalizer can be totally switchless topology. The required switch count of the proposed equalization architecture can be dramatically reduced compared to conventional architectures, allowing simplified circuitry. The proposed equalization architecture is modular and allows different equalizer topologies to be used for inter- and intra-module equalizers, offering good modularity and design flexibility. The derivation procedure of the proposed equalization architecture is explained, followed by separate analyses for the SCC-based inter-module equalizer and SRVM-based intra-module equalizer. An experimental equalization test for three supercapacitor (SC) modules, each consisting of four cells in series, was performed from an initially voltage-imbalanced condition. Module and cell voltages were equalized at different rates, and the equalization performance of the proposed modular equalization architecture was successfully demonstrated.
