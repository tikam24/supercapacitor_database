Prominence of current work mainly conveys synthesis of α-MnO 2 nanofibers on 3D-graphene foam (GF) by solution growth (SG) method and its proficient influence in electrochemical supercapacitors' performance. The α-MnO2 nanofibers are synthesized on graphene surface by using MnSO4 and ammonium persulfate as an oxidant. The results show formation of aggregated bundles (size about 15-30 nm) of 1D α-MnO 2 nanofibers on the graphene surface. In supercapacitor, the unique nanofibrous morphology of MnO2 on 3D GF electrode exhibits higher specific capacitance (670 F g-1) than on the conventional current collector (CC) electrode (440 F g-1). © 2014 Elsevier B.V.
