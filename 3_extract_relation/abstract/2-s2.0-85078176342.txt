In this project, a simple hydrothermal method was used to successfully prepare CoV-LDH electrode material on porous nickel foam, and characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, FT-IR, BET and other methods. In a typical three-electrode system, CoV-3 achieves a high specific capacitance of 3540 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and has a retention rate of 85.8% after 5000 cycles. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was assembled from CoV-3 as a positive electrode material and activated carbon (AC) as a negative electrode. The ASC has a specific capacitance of 114.13 F g−1 at the operating voltage of 0–1.6 V at 1 A g−1, and an energy density of 40.6 Wh·kg−1 at the power density of 800.4 W kg−1. After 10,000 cycles, the ASC has a capacitance retention rate of 87.5%.
