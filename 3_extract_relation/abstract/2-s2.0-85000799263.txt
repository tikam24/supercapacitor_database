Nanostructured anilino-functionalized reduced graphene oxide intercalated with Pt metal nanoparticles was successfully synthesized. Graphene oxide nanosheets were synthesized using a modified Hummers method with simultaneous in-situ functionalization with aniline and ionic Pt reduction and dispersion through sonication. The nanomaterial was characterised with FTIR, UV-visible, SEM, TEM, EDX, XRD and Raman spectroscopy to ascertain surface, chemical, elemental and crystalline properties, composite structures, size, morphology and successful entrapment of metal nanoparticles while the electro-conductivity of the nanomaterial was interrogated using CV. The graphene oxide was successfully functionalized with aniline with new peaks belonging to the N-H and C-N group being present and calculated band gaps of 5.35 eV and 4.39 eV which are attributed to functionalization of graphene oxide. The functionalized graphene oxide was successfully loaded with platinum nanoparticles as TEM revealed that the Pt particles are spread out on the graphene sheets and when magnified a uniform distribution of the nanoparticles can be observed. The material (functionalized graphene oxide loaded with platinum nanoparticles) was used in the design of an asymmetric supercapacitor cell using 6M KOH aqueous electrolyte. On testing by galvanostatic charge/discharge, a high specific capacitance value of 605 F/g with a corresponding energy and power densities of 0.021kWh/Kg and 0.372kW/Kg respectively, were obtained.
