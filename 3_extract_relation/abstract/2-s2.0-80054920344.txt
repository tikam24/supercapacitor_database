In this paper, the control approaches of linear proportional-integral (PI) and nonlinear flatness-based estimation for dc link stabilization for fuel cell/supercapacitor hybrid power plants are compared. For high power applications, 4-phase parallel boost converters are implemented with a switching interleaving technique for a fuel cell (FC) converter, and 4-phase parallel bidirectional converters are implemented with a switching interleaving technique for a supercapacitor converter in the laboratory. As controls, mathematical models (reduced-order models) of the FC converter and the supercapacitor converter are given. The prototype small-scale power plant studied is composed of a PEMFC system (the Nexa Ballard FC power generator: 1.2 kW, 46 A) and a supercapacitor module (100 F, 32 V, based on Maxwell Technologies Company). Simulation (by Matlab/Simulink) and experimental results demonstrate that the nonlinear differential flatness-based control provides improved dc bus stabilization relative to a classical linear PI control method.
