A layer-by-layer (LBL) composite of polypyrrole/graphene oxide/multi-walled carbon nanotube| polypyrrole/manganese oxide (PGM|PMnO2) was fabricated potentiostatically. The PGM|PMnO2 composite unveiled outstanding supercapacitive performance with a maximum specific capacitance of 755.99 F g−1 and remarkably retain 110% of its initial capacitance for 5000 cycles compared to PGM (49%) and PMnO2 (32%). The specific energy of as high as 66 Wh kg−1 and specific power of 726 W kg−1 were achieved on account of the synergistic effect between each material. The LBL composite also manifested the highest electronic conductivity with the lowest ESR value (40.01 Ω) compared to PGM (47.78 Ω) and PMnO2 (43.02 Ω). Thus, PGM|PMnO2 LBL composite is a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.
