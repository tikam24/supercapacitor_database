In this work, template-free Chestnut-like MnCo2O4 microspheres are synthesized using a straight-forward hydrothermal process succeeded by calcination. Urea as a reducing/precipitating agent can play an essential role in controlling the morphology of the material without using any additional surfactants or templates. The effect of reducing agent (Urea) on the structural and morphological evolution of MnCo2O4 has been studied. The electrochemical performance of the synthesized materials is investigated in a real device two-electrode cell configuration (symmetric and asymmetric system) rather than a three-electrode configuration. The two-electrode system gives more accurate and practical evaluation of the capacitive behavior of the material. The MnCo2O4 displayed the highest capacitance of 245.34 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 for 0–1 V in a symmetric cell configuration. It also held an energy density of 22.24 Wh kg−1 at 1500 W kg−1. The optimized sample showed outstanding cyclic performance with only 3% of capacitance loss after 5000 cycles. Based on the structural and electrochemical findings, a charge storage mechanism has been proposed for the symmetric SC. Furthermore, a hybrid asymmetric supercapacitor with MnCo2O4 as a cathode and the previously synthesized MnO2/AC as an anode is also fabricated which exhibited an energy response of 30.12 Wh kg−1 for a power of 7000 W kg−1. For practical applications, different colored LEDs (red, yellow, green, and blue) and a panel with six red LEDs have been illuminated. The panel with six red LEDs is illuminated for 12 mins. for symmetric supercapacitor and 18 mins. for asymmetric supercapacitor. All these remarkable outcomes suggested that the synthesized material has wide potential for supercapacitors.
