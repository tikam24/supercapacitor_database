The research and development of new carbon materials of electrochemical capacitors cause a huge interest in chemical power sources causes. The appropriate modification of carbon materials leads to an increase in supercapacitor capacitance. Therefore, activated carbon was modified by ozone treatment. The process of ozonation was carried out for 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 min. Moreover, activated carbon was also modified by cobalt(II) hydroxide impregnation in order to construct asymmetric electrochemical capacitor. The performance of electrochemical capacitors has been examined by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge in 1 M H2SO4, 1 M Na2SO4 and 6 M KOH.
