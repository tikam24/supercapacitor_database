A novel silver fungus-like CoS (SFC) with multiple electrochemically active sites was successfully fabricated by a simple mixed solvent thermal method. Benefiting from the unique porous silver fungus-like microstructure and the good shrinkage characteristics of the fluffy structure, the fabricated SFC electrode demonstrates ideal electrochemical performance for supercapacitors through electrochemical analysis. The material exhibits an outstanding capacitive performance of 350.4 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor with SFC and active carbon (AC) as positive and negative electrodes, respectively, achieves a high specific energy of 45.2 Wh kg−1 at a specific power of 1500.0 W kg−1. The study shows that the mixed solvothermal method used to synthesize CoS with a specific porous structure can potentially be extended to other transition metal sulfide-based electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors.
