The parameter matching of composite energy storage systems will affect the realization of control strategy. In this study, the effective energy and power utilizations of an energy storage source were defined. With the miniaturization of a composite energy storage system as the optimization goal, the linear programming simplex method was employed to obtain the optimized masses of Li batteries and supercapacitors under the constraints of maximum speed, climbing gradient, acceleration time and cost-effectiveness. As the module numbers shall be integers, the matching results were modified in combination with the graphical method. Owing to the influences of parameter matching schemes on the overall performance and battery life, the critical points of constraints were analyzed and the most appropriate matching numerical points of the composite energy storage system were identified. Simulation and experimental analysis were conducted under practical urban road conditions in China. The results show that the proposed matching method delivers accurate results. Compared with conventional electric buses, the mileage and overall performance of the prototype bus are improved.
