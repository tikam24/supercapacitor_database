The effect of dispersing single walled carbon nanotubes and fumed alumina in a polyvinylidene fluoride matrix was carried out to identify the thermal and electrical properties for flexible supercapacitor electrode applications. Addition of CNTs helped improve the polymer's conductive and charge storage capabilities. Characterization was carried out to understand the thermal characteristics of the nanocomposites using TGA and DSC which indicated a lowering in thermal stability upon addition of the nanofillers. Electrochemical tests were also conducted in the form of cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy using 1M H2SO4 electrolyte, yielding specific gravimetric capacitance values close to 72.88 F/g. Results also identified the improvement in specific capacitance of the composite upon addition of very low (1wt%) of fumed alumina.
