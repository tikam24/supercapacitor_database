Single crystals of cobalt coordination compounds were obtained by one-pot hydrothermal reaction. Nickel ion exchange was used to produce the Ni-Co hetero-metal compound with tunable chemical composition. Using a nickel-exchanged compound as the precursor, we developed a simple chemical reaction to synthesize large-scale 3D hierarchical NixCo3-xS4 (x = 0.15-0.42) microflowers under ambient conditions. As an electrode material for supercapacitors, the discharge capacitance of Ni0.42Co2.58S4 microflowers is approximately one and a half times higher than the discharge capacitance value of Ni0.15Co2.75S4 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1.
