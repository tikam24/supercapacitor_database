Flexible supercapacitors are highly demanding due to their wearability, washability, lightweight property and rollability. In this paper, a comprehensive review on flexible supercapacitors based on conductive polymers such as polypyrrole (PPy), polyaniline (PANI) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxtthiophne)-polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). Methods of enhancing the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS polymer using various composites and chemical solutions have been reviewed in detail. Furthermore, supercapacitors based on carbonized banana peels and methods of activation have been discussed in point. This review covers the up-to-date progress achieved in conductive polymer-based materials for supercapacitor electrodes. The effect of various composites with PEDOT:PSS have been discussed. The review result indicated that flexible, stretchable, lightweight, washable, and disposable wearable electronics based on banana peel and conductive polymers are highly demanding.
