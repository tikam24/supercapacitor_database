The rational design of a multicomponent electrode material with hollow structures grown on the conductive substrate is an effective approach to boost the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors (SCs). However, there is still a challenge in the in situ construction of such unique structures on the conductive substrate. Herein, a heterostructured multicomponent electrode material, a Zn-Mo-Ni-O-S hollow microflower (Zn-Mo-Ni-O-S HMF) in situ grown on a Ni foam (NF), is fabricated by a simple top-down strategy. Based on the ion-exchange and Kirkendall effect, the microflowers are composed of numerous hollow nanosheets, which are covered by uniform ZnS nanoparticles with a robust adherence. Profiting from the structural merits and the synergistic effect of multiple components, the Zn-Mo-Ni-O-S HMF electrode exhibits a high areal capacitance of 4.39 C cm-2 (6.27 F cm-2) at 1 mA cm-2, which is 3.6 times higher than the 0.86 C cm-2 (1.72 F cm-2) of the Zn-Mo-O precursor and 1.7 times higher than the 2.65 C cm-2 (3.79 F cm-2) of Ni3S2/NiMoO4 (Mo-Ni-O-S). The Zn-Mo-Ni-O-S HMF displays an excellent cycling performance (maintaining 87.9% after 3000 cycles). The hybrid supercapacitor device is assembled by the Zn-Mo-Ni-O-S HMF as the positive electrode and active carbon (AC) as the negative electrode. The device delivers a high energy density of 60.8 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 750.2 W kg-1. The synthetic route provides a reference to the in situ construction of a heterostructured multicomponent electrode material for high-energy SCs.
