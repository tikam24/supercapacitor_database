CoMoO4 material has great advantages in the application of supercapacitors, but the low conductivity and reactivity of CoMoO4 limit its capacity and energy density severely, resulting in a certain gap between the actual value and the theoretical value of specific capacitance. As an electrode material, the performance of CoMoO4 electrode material with spinel structure is directly related to the microstructure of the material. In this paper, CoMoO4 material grown in situ on nickel foam was synthesized by hydrothermal method. Through electrochemical performance tests, the best electrochemical performance belong to the materials using ammonium molybdate and cobalt nitrate as raw materials, synthesized at hydrothermal temperature of 140 °C for 10 h, and calcined at 250 °C for 1 h. The discharge capacity of the material is up to 11.112 F/cm2 at the current density of 3 mA/cm2. The XRD characterization shows that the material has good crystallinity, and it belongs to the orthorhombic structure. The SEM characterization shows that the synthesized material is in cuboid rod structure with loose folds on the periphery. According to EDS analysis, the atomic proportion of each element is close to that in the molecular formula. The positions of absorption peaks in the infrared spectrum are consistent with that of CoMoO4 material.
