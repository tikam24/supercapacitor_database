Three-dimensional (3D) microelectrode is a promising energy-storage microstructure with higher aspect ratio and better electrochemical performance of the structure than the conventional two-dimensional (2D) microelectrode. A novel method of fabricating 3D microelectrode arrays on silicon substrate is presented, which is prepared by MEMS technologies including lithography, inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching and RF magnetron sputtering. Ruthenium oxide functional film is prepared on the surface of 3D microelectrode arrays by electrochemical cathodic deposition. Morphology and electrochemical performance of 3D microelectrode are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to study the influences of current density and time of cathodic depositon, and "micro mask" on the surface of silica-based microelectrode on supercapacitor performance of 3D microelectrode. The specific capacitance of 3D microelectrode amounts to 1.57 F/cm2, obviously higher than that of 2D microelectrode, which is 0.42 F/cm2, while the electrochemical impedance of the 3D structure is much lower than that of 2D structure. The experimental results show that the electrochemical capacitance characteristics of 3D microelectrode in the MEMS process are greatly improved compared with those of 2D microelectrode.
