We report a 'dual nanostructures' where MnO2 nano-hairs cover NiCo2O4 nano-needles forming NiCo2O4@MnO2 double nanostructures. The NiCo2O4@MnO2 double nanostructures were synthesized by simple two-steps hydrothermal synthesis on the etched surface of nickel (Ni) wire. These structures were applied to form high capacity of fiber-shaped super-capacitor which was fully fabricated and demonstrated in this work.
