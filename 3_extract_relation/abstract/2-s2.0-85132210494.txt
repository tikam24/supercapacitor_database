In this study, zeolite imidazole framework 67 (ZIF-67)-derived Co2NiO4 cubes decorated with flower-like g-C3N4 nanosheets (CN) were reported as novel electrode materials for supercapacitors with excellent capacitance and cycling stability. The prepared composite material was synthesized by a simple solvothermal method, and its structural characteristics were revealed by XRD, SEM and FT-IR spectroscopy. Moreover, cyclic voltammetry, constant current charge/discharge test and AC impedance test were used to study the electrochemical behavior of composite materials. The results showed that by combining Co2NiO4 cubes with good redox reactions with flower-like g-C3N4 nanosheets, adding different amounts of g-C3N4 nanosheets during the reaction can effectively improve their electrochemical performance. As expected, Ni/Co-5 %CN exhibits an excellent specific capacitance of 1701 F·g−1 at 1 A·g−1 when the CN addition is 5 %. Besides, constructed asymmetric supercapacitor (Ni/Co-5 %CN//AC ACS) showed a high energy density of 49.37 Wh·kg−1. After 5000 cycles at 5 A·g−1, it can achieve nearly 91.5 % capacitance retention rate. The results showed that Ni/Co-CN had great potential to build safe and high-performance energy storage devices.
