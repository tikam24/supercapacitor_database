Constructing orderly nanostructures and modifying surfaces are two important ways to improve the electrode materials of supercapacitors. Herein, 1D dendritic P@NiCo LDH electrode materials were successfully synthesized via phosphatizing a treated Ni/Co hydroxide precursor. We noticed that the 4M-P@NiCo LDH (with 40 mmol of reactant/75 mL for 6 cm2 of Ni foam) exhibited high areal capacitance of 7 F cm-2 at 50 mA cm-2 in a 6 M KOH three-electrode aqueous electrolyte system, which is about 4 times as much as before phosphatization. Also, a 4M-P@NiCo LDH//AC asymmetric supercapacitor obtained a high energy density of 18.1 W h kg-1 at 750 W kg-1 and showed excellent capacity retention of 77.17% after 5000 cycles at a 10 A g-1 current density, indicating its great application potential.
