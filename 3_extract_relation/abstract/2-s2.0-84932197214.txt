Aniline is oxidized by ammonium persulfate oxidant with a weak organic acid, 1,3-(6,7)-napthalene trisulfonic acid (NTSA), via an aqueous polymerization pathway to polyaniline (PANI) salt. The effects of the sodium lauryl sulfate surfactant, mineral acid [sulfuric acid (H2SO4)], and a combination of surfactant with mineral acid in the aniline polymerization reaction are also carried. These salts were designated as PANI-NTSA-dodecyl hydrogen sulfate (DHS), PANI-NTSA-H2SO4, and PANI-NTSA-DHS-H2SO4, respectively. Interestingly, PANI-NTSA-DHS showed a highly ordered crystalline sample with a nanosphere morphology. These PANIs were used as electrode materials in supercapacitor applications. Among the four salts, the PANI-NTSA-DHS-H2SO4 material showed higher values of specific capacitance (520 F/g), energy (26 W h/kg), and power densities (200 W/kg) at 0.3 A/g. Moreover, 77% of the original capacitance was retained after 2000 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of 98-100%. PANI-NTSA-DHS-H2SO4 was obtained in excellent yield with an excellent conductivity (6.8 S/cm) and a thermal stability up to 235Â°C.
