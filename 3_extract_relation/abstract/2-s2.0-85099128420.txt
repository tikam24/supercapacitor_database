An approach to smoothing the fluctuations of large-scale wind power is investigated using vehicle-to-grid (V2G) systems. First, an energy management and optimization system is designed and modeled. By using the wavelet packet decomposition method, the target grid-connected wind power, the required electric vehicle (EV) power, and supercapacitor power are determined. The energy management model for EVs is then developed by introducing a knapsack problem that can evaluate the needs of an EV fleet. Furthermore, an optimized dispatch strategy for EVs and wind power is developed by using a dynamic programming method. A case study demonstrates that the energy management and optimization method for V2G systems achieves noticeable performance improvements over benchmark techniques.
