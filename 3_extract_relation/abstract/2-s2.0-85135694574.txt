Developing electrode materials with high specific capacitance within both positive and negative potential window is an effective way to obtain aqueous supercapacitors with high energy density. In this work, P doped Fe-Co-S binary metal sulfides (Fe-Co-S/P) was demonstrated to show high specific capacitance within a wide potential window from − 1–0.55 V. When used as cathode, it exhibited a specific capacitance of 0.8 F cm−2 (320 F g−1). After 20,000 cycles at 20 mA cm−2, it even increased to 242.3% of the initial capacitance. When used as anode, it also had a specific capacitance of 1.34 F cm−2 (536 F g−1) and satisfied cyclic performance (71.4% of the initial capacitance after 20,000 cycles). Moreover, the symmetric supercapacitors (SSCs) assembled with the Fe-Co-S/P electrodes delivered high energy density of 106.42 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 800 W kg−1 and exhibited excellent cyclic stability by preserving 93.9% of the initial capacitance after 5000 cycles. This work not only establishes Fe-Co-S/P as a high-performance supercapacitor electrode material, but also provides a new strategy to design and construct high-performance aqueous SSCs.
