In this paper, hierarchical WO3 nanofibers are synthesized on a flexible carbon cloth by a facile hydrothermal route. The as-prepared products as supercapacitor electrodes show high discharge areal capacitance (1716.92 mF cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2) and cycling stability (20.9% loss after 6000 repetitive cycles at 10 mA cm−2). These superior performances of hierarchical WO3 structures indicate their promising applications in supercapacitor electrode materials.
