One of the most important applications for porous material with high surface area is the supercapacitor. For supercapacitors, power density and energy density are the most significant metrics. However, currently no dominant, established standard exists, and research papers often report these two metrics differently. A standard for reporting power and energy density is proposed here for objective comparison. This paper also discusses a common flaw in current supercapacitor power density calculations.
