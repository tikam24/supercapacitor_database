Supercapacitor is a device which is currently being researched. Research on supercapacitors can be done from various aspects, including the supercapacitor electrodes, electronic materials or dielectric materials as well as the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors. In the research that has been done, has been obtained rGO material that has a specific capacitance value of 485.97 F / gram with calcination temperature of 1000Â°C and an ultrasonication time of 2.5 hours. The reduction of Graphene Oxide has fulfilled the standards as a supercapacitor. Another characteristic that must be fulfilled as a supercapacitor is porosity, to determine the ability of adsorption and desorption, as well as electrochemical performance. The results of BET characterization for rGO produced from coconut shells that the largest distribution in the adsorption process was 0.00192 cc/nm/g at a pore diameter of 35.68 nm, while the largest desorption distribution was at 0.00211 cc/nm/g at pore diameter 35.63 nm. So that it can be categorized that rGO is a mesoporous category with a pore diameter of 35.63-35.68 nm. Cyclic Voltammetry characterization results obtained that rGO has a reversible curve and is very wide in rGO with 2.5 hours ultrasonication.
