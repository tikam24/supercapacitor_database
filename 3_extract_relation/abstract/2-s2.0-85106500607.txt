Herein, we delineate the one-pot preparation of nickel cobalt telluride nanorods (NiCoTe NRs) by the hydrothermal method using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and ascorbic acid as reducing agents. The Ni0.7Co0.3Te NRs (NCT-1 NRs) were investigated with different characterization techniques, such as X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Magnetic measurement shows the paramagnetic behavior of the prepared samples with the saturation magnetization. The NCT-1 NR-modified electrode is employed into the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction and hybrid supercapacitor applications. NCT-1 is demonstrated as a good electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction at the onset potential of 244 mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode and delivered a high current density of 1 mA/cm2. NCT-1 displays a specific capacity of 433 C/g at 0.5 A/g current density and 100% capacity retention, even after 5000 cycles. Furthermore, a hybrid asymmetric supercapacitor device was fabricated on the basis of NCT-1 as a positive electrode and orange-peel-derived activated carbon (OPC-700) as a negative electrode. It delivered a high energy density of 43 Wh/kg and a power density of 905 W/kg with long cyclic stability of 91% after 25 Â»000 cycles.
