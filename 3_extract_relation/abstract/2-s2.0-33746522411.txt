Two activated carbons (AC) with different pore size distribution were selected to impregnate with seven species of metals, which were used as electrode materials of a supercapacitor in an aqueous electrolytic solution. The effect of loaded metals on the characterization of AC as polarizable electrodes was investigated. The porous structures and electrochemical double-layer capacitance of activated carbons were investigated using nitrogen gas adsorption and constant current cycling (CCC) methods. It was found that Cu and Mn had obvious pseudo-capacitance effect, and Co and Ni could improve the discharge capacitance of mesopore activated carbon, but Mo, Fe and Y had not contribution to discharge capacitance. The increased extent of the capacitance of mesopore activated carbon was higher than that of micropore activated carbon. The capacitances of Cu/mesopore activated carbon increased with the increase of the loaded weight of metal Cu.
