The most employed technique to mimic the behavior of lithium-ion cells to monitor and control them is the equivalent circuit model (ECM). This modeling tool should be precise enough to ensure the system’s reliability. Two significant parameters that affect the accuracy of the ECM are the applied current rate and operating temperature. Without a thorough understating of the influence of these parameters on the ECM, parameter estimation should be carried out manually within the calibration, which is not favorable. In this work, an enhanced ECM was developed for high-power lithium-ion capacitors (LiC) for a wide temperature range from the freezing temperature of −30 °C to the hot temperature of +60 °C with the applied rates from 10 A to 500 A. In this context, experimental tests were carried out to mimic the behavior of the LiC by modeling an ECM with two RC branches. In these branches, two resistance and capacitance (RC) are required to maintain the precision of the model. The validation results proved that the semi-empirical second-order ECM can estimate the electrical and thermal parameters of the LiC with high accuracy. In this context, when the current rate was less than 150 A, the error of the developed ECM was lower than 3%. Additionally, when the demanded power was high, in current rates above 150 A, the simulation error was lower than 5%.
