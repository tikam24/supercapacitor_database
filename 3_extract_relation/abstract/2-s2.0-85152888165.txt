Spinel oxide nanomaterial based on pseudocapacitor electrodes is a superior remedy for the present energy problem. In this study, CuCo2O4 and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) are mixed utilizing a clean hydrothermal strategy. The characteristics of synthesized electrocatalysts were examined by employing microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. Galvanostatic charge-discharge techniques (GCD), cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and chronoamperometry (CA) were used to analyze the electrocatalytic behavior of all synthesized materials. The electrochemical analysis showed that the incorporation of rGO rises the discharge duration interval resultant enhances the specific capacitance (Cs) and improves the overall stable behavior of the CuCo2O4 electrocatalytic materials. At 2.0 A g−1, the electrochemical findings of spinel/rGO nanohybrid show Cs of 1372.93 F g−1, energy density (Ed) of 70.02 Wh Kg−1 and power density (Pd) of 606 W Kg−1 at 2 A g−1. The nanohybrid showed 96.35 % capacitance retention over 5000th cycles and remained stable for 40 h. However, adjustments to the electrical and structural arrangement, morphology, or doping technique improved the capacitive activity of the produced electrode.
