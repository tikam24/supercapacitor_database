The multirotor drones have been used extensively in modern farming. This device can help to tackle many tasks that is limited to human such as planting, watering, and so on. Hence, it can save farmer's time and energy. Drones mostly use battery or supercapacitor as their power supply. It means that they cannot fly forever without charged. Battery recharging takes time. Hence, some researches have already conducted to make the battery charging easy to do the drone can continue to do the tasks without the need to stop the operation. In this research, we propose a concept model for battery recharge without stopping the drone from operation. It converts sounds from multirotor drone's motor into current by using piezoelectric sensor. Based on calculation and analysis on frequency spectrum, ideal fundamental frequency is 120 Hz that yields length of piezoelectric sensor's resonator 11 cm.
