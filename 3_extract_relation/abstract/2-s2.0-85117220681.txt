This study aims at demonstrating the comparative effect of variation in synthesis route on supercapacitive behavior of nanostructured ZnCo2O4 spinel metal oxide. ZnCo2O4 microspheres and nanosheets were deposited on a stainless steel substrate using two different chemical synthesis routes, hydrothermal synthesis and electrodeposition. When used as an electrode for a supercapacitor, the electrochemical performance of ZnCo2O4 electrodes were studied and compared through cyclic voltametry, charge-discharge studies, and impedance spectroscopy experiments. The specific capacitance of hydrothermally grown ZnCo2O4 electrode was 430.75 F g-1 at a scan rate of 5 mV sec-1 while that of electrodeposited ZnCo2O4 electrode was 171.03 F g-1 at the same scan rate. These results suggest that ZnCo2O4 microspheres deposited via hydrothermal route exhibit enhanced electrochemical performance compared to ZnCo2O4 electrode deposited through electrodeposition. This improved electrochemical performance of hydrothermally deposited ZnCo2O4 microspheres makes them a better choice for supercapacitor applications compared to electrodeposited nanosheets.
