The carbon materials used for electrochemical capacitors were reviewed and discussed the contribution of the surfaces owing to micropores and other larger pores to the capacitance and rate performance of the electric double-layer capacitors. The necessity to have an internationally accepted specification for the measurement of capacitor performance was emphasized. Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
