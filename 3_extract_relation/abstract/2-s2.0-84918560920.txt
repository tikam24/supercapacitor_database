Hybridization of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) and ultra capacitors (UC) are considered as an alternative way to implement high autonomy, high dynamic, and reversible energy sources. PEMFC allow high efficiency and high autonomy, however their dynamic response is limited and this source does not allow recovering energy. UC appears to be a complementary source to fuel cell systems (FCS) due to their high power density, fast dynamics, and reversibility. A direct hybridization of these sources could allow reducing the number of power converters and then the total cost of the hybridized system. Simulations show the behavior of the hybrid source when the fuel cell and ultra capacitors are interconnected and the natural energy management when a charge is connected. The results show that the magnitude of the transient current supplied by the fuel cell to charge the UC can be much higher than its nominal value. An experimental setup is implemented to study the effects of these high currents in a PEMFC. This is done by imposing a controlled short-circuit between the electrodes. The PEMFC degradation is quantified by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.
