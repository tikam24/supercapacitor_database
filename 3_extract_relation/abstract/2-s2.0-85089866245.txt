A conceptually simple route has been designed for the preparation of flexible plate by utilization of biodegradable cellophane film through addition of NaHCO3 powder into structure of Polypyrrole-Multiwalled carbon nanotube-Cellophane (PMC) composite and then by chemical treatment in acidic solution. A homogeneous conductive-porous structure was formed as a result of release of NaHCO3 from the composite bulk in acidic solution as well as CO2 (g) evolution. The porous PMC plate exhibited a specific capacitance of 244 mF cm−2 at a current density of 0.5 mA cm−2 and favorite rate capability. The assembled symmetric supercapacitor device showed a high areal capacitance of 309 mF cm−2 at 2.5 mA cm−2, excellent flexibility and a long cycle lifetime (89% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles). The strategy presented in this work opens a new door for environmentally friendly preparation of flexible-biodegradable supercapacitor devices with high mechanical strength.
