A new redox-active organic molecule, naphthalene diimide derivative (NDI), is synthesized through the condensation reaction for electrochemical energy storage, in which 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride and 4-aminophenol are used as skeleton and substituent, respectively. The NDI is acted as a guest molecule to non-covalently modify reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and to form an organic molecular electrode (OMEs). The resultant electrode exhibits outstanding performance under the three-electrode configuration, including specific capacitance (354 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1) and cycling performance (87.2% after 8000 cycles). Furthermore, the electrochemical behaviors of the OMEs are mainly controlled by surface reactions and pseudocapacitance contribution is up to 93% of the total capacity at 100 mV s−1. In addition, a positive electrode (graphene hydrogel-2,6-dihydroxynaphthalene (GH-DN)) is formed by hydrothermal method. At last, an asymmetric device (GH-DN//rGO-NDI, ASC) is assembled and a specific capacitance of 111.3 F g−1 is reached. The ASC can deliver a high energy density of 26.3 Wh kg−1 at power density of 0.6 kW kg−1. Moreover, two ASC devices in series may light 81 light-emitting diodes. It is believed that organic molecule electrodes are candidates for new green energy storage materials.
