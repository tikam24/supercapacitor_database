Polypyrrole/conductive mica (PPy/CM) composites were prepared by coating polypyrrole (PPy) onto the surfaces of the conductive mica (CM) via the in situ chemical oxidative polymerization method. The encapsulating morphologies were revealed with the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique. The PPy/CM composites were characterized with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The composites possess high electrical conductivity at room temperature, the weak temperature dependence of the conductivity. Based on the cyclic voltammetry and the charge/discharge behavior of the PPy/CM composites, it was found that the composites performed typical electrochemical supercapacitor behavior.
