It is very necessary to design electrodes with satisfactory electrochemical performance and robust mechanical properties for flexible energy storage devices. Herein, a self-supporting electrode with Negative Poisson's Ratio (NPR) structure was fabricated by combining electrospinning and laser direct writing technology, which overcame the limitation that the traditional carbon-based materials cannot be stretched and avoided the integration problem of rigid electrodes and soft substrates in the conventional stretchable devices. Furthermore, a quasi-solid-state asymmetric micro-supercapacitor with NPR structure was assembled by an as-spun separator coated with gel electrolyte and two composite electrodes composed of carbon nanofibers and nanoarrays (CNF@Fe2O3 nanorods and CNF@MnO2 nanosheets). The apparatus not only reached an extended voltage window of 2 V, but also achieved an area energy density of 26 μWh·cm−2 at a power density of 0.55 mW·cm−2, which was superior to other wearable micro-supercapacitors.
