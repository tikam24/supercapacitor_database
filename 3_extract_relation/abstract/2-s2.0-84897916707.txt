A versatile route has been demonstrated for the preparation of hierarchical porous carbon films derived from nanofibrillar alginic acid extracted from brown seaweeds. An acetic acid-sodium acetate buffer was used to adjust pH of the nanofibrillar alginic acid gels, giving rise to a stable aqueous homogeneous suspension at the concentration of 5.0wt% and pH ∼4.5. A crack-free nanofibrillar alginic acid film with a diameter of several centimeters was cast from the suspension. Self-condensing silica around nanofibrillar alginic acid formed silica-alginic acid composites that were carbonised and then etched the silica to generate mesoporous carbon films. The aligned mesochannel carbon was originated from the hierarchical parallel organisation of the self-assembled nanofibrillar alginic acid. The introduction of mesoporosity into the carbon structure afforded the high-surface-area mesoporous carbon film-based supercapacitor that exhibits an ultrahigh-rate capability and highly electrical capacitance. © 2014 Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering.
