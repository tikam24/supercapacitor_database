A rational and hierarchical Diatom@CuO@MnO 2 hybrid was fabricated via a facile electroless copper plating technology, following by a one-pot hydrothermal reaction with KMnO 4 . Such unique architecture acts as a supercapacitor electrode, which exhibits a high specific capacitance (240 F g −1 at a current density of 0.5 A g −1 ), good rate capability (58.3% retention when the current density increases from 0.5 to 5 A g −1 ), and excellent electrochemical cycling stability (91.2% retention of the initial specific capacitance after 4000 cycles at a current density of 2 A g −1 ). The impressive electrochemical performance of this Diatom@CuO@MnO 2 electrode ascribed to the synergistic effect between the CuO particles and MnO 2 nanosheets. Therefore, it can be expected that this unique Diatom@CuO@MnO 2 electrode may have great promise for the application in supercapacitors.
