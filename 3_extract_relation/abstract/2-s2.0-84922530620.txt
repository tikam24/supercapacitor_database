Nanoporous 3D graphene was fabricated using NH2-SiO2 particles as a sacrificial template. For further capacitance boost, MnO2 was firstly deposited onto the nanoporous 3D graphene through the reaction between KMnO4 and graphene via the hydrothermal method. Owing to the synergistic effect between the unique nanoporous 3D graphene and the high specific capacitance of MnO2, the MnO2/nanoporous 3D graphene electrode demonstrated excellent electrochemical performance, including a high specific capacitance and an extended long cycle life. This work showed that the MnO2/nanoporous 3D graphene could present significant potential for energy storage applications.
