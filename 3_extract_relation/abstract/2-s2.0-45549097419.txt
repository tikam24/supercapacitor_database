Lithium-ion intercalated compound λ-MnO2 was used as positive electrode in asymmetric supercapacitor with activated carbon used as negative electrode in 1 mol L- 1 Li2SO4 aqueous electrolyte solution. Phase composition, morphology and particle sizes of λ-MnO2 were studied by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Electrochemical capacitive performance of the asymmetric supercapacitor was tested by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests. The results show that the asymmetric supercapacitor has electrochemical capacitance performance within wide potential range of 0-2.2 V. The specific capacitance is 53 F g- 1 at a constant current density of 10 mA cm- 2. The energy density is 36 W h kg- 1 with a power density of 314 W kg- 1. It is obvious that λ-MnO2 is a potential electrode material for asymmetric supercapacitor. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
