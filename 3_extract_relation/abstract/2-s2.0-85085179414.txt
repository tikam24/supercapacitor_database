This work aims to develop an energy management approach (EMA) for a fuel cell vehicle whose main role is to reduce the fuel consumption of the main element source. To achieve this goal, the proposed technique and whose main role is to guarantee the configuration of the most optimized system in order to manage the flow of energy between the different sources. Thus, the integration of storage device as solution guarantees continuity of energy production and in order to benefit as much as possible to minimize the hydrogen consumption. The results obtained by simulation show the effectiveness of the EMA and also proves an almost 51 % gain in hydrogen consumption.
