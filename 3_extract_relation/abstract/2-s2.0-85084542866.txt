Electrodes that combine energy storage with mechanical performance are desirable for structural and flexible applications. However, conventional electrodes fail to address mechanical performance. Here, noncovalent bonding of graphene/aramid nanofiber electrodes with tannic acid yields a significant improvement in tensile strength and Young's modulus while maintaining good energy storage.
