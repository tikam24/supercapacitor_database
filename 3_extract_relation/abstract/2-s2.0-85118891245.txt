Porous carbon materials are important in electrochemical applications due to their unique nanostructures and remarkable physicochemical stability. In this work, nitrogen-doped porous carbons were fabricated using the self-templating networks of pyridyl conjugated microporous polytriphenylamine. The prepared nitrogen-doped porous carbons show a high content of nitrogen (4.6–11.5 wt%) with fine performance of CO2 capture (store 14.0–17.0 wt% at 273 K and 1 bar) and high specific surface area up to 1059 m2 g−1 that surpasses materials prepared using other polymer networks. More importantly, the nitrogen-doped porous carbons exhibit great potentialities as electrode materials of supercapacitors with a specific capacitance of up to 238 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 that retained almost 100% after 1000 cycles (three-electrode supercapacitors). The prepared nitrogen-doped porous carbons underwent electrochemical activation during cycling measurement, which exhibits a high energy density (27.7 Wh kg−1) and power density (7000 W kg−1) in symmetric two-electrodes supercapacitors assembled using nitrogen-doped porous carbons after 10,000 cycles.
