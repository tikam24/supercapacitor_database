Planar micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) are one key micropower source for microelectronics. However, the pseudocapacitive regulation strategies of extraordinarily multiplying capacitance and energy density of electric double-layer MSCs are underdeveloped. Herein, a versatile strategy for boosting the capacitance of graphene-based planar MSCs by highly concentrated water-in-salt ambipolar redox electrolyte (ZnI2 + ZnCl2) is proposed, which can serve as an ambipolar redox mediator to contribute remarkable pseudocapacitance for positive and negative electrodes simultaneously. The high volumetric capacity of 106 mAh cm-3, unprecedented energy density of 111 mWh cm-3 that outperfoms the reported graphene-based MSCs, and long-term cycling stability with 92.1% retention after 5300 cycles are acquired. The good performance results from the frustrated self-discharge by suppressing the formation and diffusion of polyiodide ions of I3- and I5-, as confirmed by in situ characterizations. Therefore, this work will open a new avenue of introducing ambipolar redox mediators into highly concentrated electrolytes for high-performance MSCs.
