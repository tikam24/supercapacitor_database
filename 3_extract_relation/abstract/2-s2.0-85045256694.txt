Owing to large specific surface area and high electrical conductivity, nanostructured electrodes exhibit improved electrochemical activity for supercapacitor applications. In the present study, structure and morphology of hydrothermally synthesized strontium sulfide and graphene oxide based Strontium sulfide nanorods have been investigated by using XRD and SEM, respectively. Introduction of graphene oxide thin film improves specific surface area and result in the excellent electrical conductivity of Strontium sulfide nanorods. Due to this, graphene oxide based strontium sulfide nanorods illustrate excellent specific capacitance and energy density of 1831.14 F g−1 and 91.56 WhKg−1, respectively, at the current density of 3 mAcm−2, as measured by employing three electrode galvanostatic charge discharge system. Moreover, electrode of graphene oxide based strontium sulfide nanorods also shows good electrochemical performance, according to the measurements by symmetric two electrode system. Energy and power density is measured as 10.55 WhKg−1 and 294.35 W kg−1, respectively. The excellent electrochemical performance of graphene oxide based strontium sulfide nanorods reveals its significance as nanostructured materials for supercapacitor applications.
