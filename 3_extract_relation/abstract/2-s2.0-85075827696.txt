In this work, we proposed a porous carbon from waste mangosteen peel as precursor via a facile combined method of carbonization and NaOH treatment processes. The obtained porous carbon has a large surface area of 2,623 m2 g−1 and displays a stone-like morphology with highly ordered hierarchical meso-pores structure. The electrochemical response of the porous carbon was appraised in 6 M KOH solution as electrolyte via three-electrode system. It is shown that the porous carbon offers a superior specific capacitance (357 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and an outstanding rate performance (190 F g−1 at 100 A g−1) which is much higher than the earlier published biomass porous carbon materials. The porous carbon also presents a very low decline rate of 5.5% capacitance after 130,000 cycles at ultra-fast current density of 50 A g−1, which is proved its superb cyclic durability. Furthermore, this porous carbon based symmetric supercapacitor with aqueous electrolyte provides a high capacitance of 76.8 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, an excellent energy density of 17.28 Wh kg−1 at power density of 401 W kg−1 and superb cycling life with keeps 80% of capacitance for 10,000 cycles at 20 A g−1. Similarly, the symmetric supercapacitor assembled with an organic electrolyte also delivers a better capacitance of 38.4 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, a high energy density of 16.69 Wh kg−1 at power density of 631 W kg−1 and good cycling life with retains 84% of capacitance over 10,000 cycles at 20 A g−1. Therefore, this work is providing an important strategy for the reusing of the waste mangosteen peels and a new method for the preparation of a low-cost energetic material for high performance supercapacitor.
