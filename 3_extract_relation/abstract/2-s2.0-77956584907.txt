The polymer of complex [Ni(salen)], (N,N'-ethylenebis (salicylideneaminato) nickel(II)), was prepared on graphite electrode by the route of linear sweep potential method. The nano-micro sheaf/wire structures of poly[Ni(salen)] have been obtained by adjusting the polymerization sweep rate of 5, 20 and 40 mV·s-1. The polymer prepared at 20 mV·s-1 had nanoscaled wire structure of ca.100 nm in diameter. The good electrochemical reversibility of poly[Ni(salen)] was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic test in 1.0 mol/L Et3MeNBF4/acetonitrile solution. The initial specific gravimetric capacitance of poly[Ni(salen)] at the current density of 0.1 mA·cm-2 reached 270.2 F·g -1, however, the cycle stability needs to be improved. © Chinese Chemical society.
