To solve the problem of peak impact of traction load and increasingly significant energy content of regenerative braking, this paper is based on the application of energy storage systems (ESS) in an electrified railway, according to the upper and lower limit threshold constraint method, the multi-application of peak regulation and regenerative braking energy (RBE) utilization and recovery is realized at the same time. Secondly, to make the energy storage configuration in multiple application scenarios more reasonable, taking the optimizes total net proceeds of ESS in electrified railway within its life cycle as the objective function, the energy storage configuration and charge and discharge in each period are studied, and the economic optimal configuration of energy storage is realized on the premise of meeting multi-application requirements. Finally, three kinds of energy storage devices (ESD) - battery, supercapacitor, and flywheel, which are widely used in electrified railway, are simulated by MATLAB platform to verify the feasibility of the proposed model and provide a reference for the planning of different energy storage types in multi-application scenarios of electrified railway.
