A multifunctional magnetic 3D graphene/Fe3O4 architecture (GFA) has been fabricated by a facile and scalable one-pot self-assembled strategy through hydrothermal treatment of a mixed aqueous precursor solution of graphene oxide (GO) and Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs). Benefiting from the 3D porous structure and synergistic effects of the assembled graphene nanosheets and Fe3O4 NPs, the resultant GFA exhibits excellent adsorption capacities of not only organic dyes such as methylene blue (MB), but also toxic solvents such as toluene and chloroform, and improved electrochemical capacitive performances in comparison with pristine graphene architectures and Fe3O4 NPs. The impressive results presented here may have high impact on the future fabrication of functional graphene based architectures for practical applications.
