Lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) are considered as a promising energy storage device possessing large specific energy along with high specific power due to the integration of the merits of electric double-layer capacitors (ELDCs) and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). In the present work, TiO2 nanotubes supported ultrafine MnCo2O4 nanoparticles with the size of 5–10 nm is solvothermally synthesized. It is found that the introduction of TiO2 nanotubes can weaken the aggregation of MnCo2O4 nanoparticles, therefore causing the enhancement in the electrode/electrolyte interfacial contact and the reduction in Li + diffusion path. Benefiting from the synergy effect of MnCo2O4 and TiO2 which can alleviate the volume change of MnCo2O4, the MnCo2O4/TiO2 composite used in LIBs displays a large reversible capacity of 743 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 after 100 cycles and impressive rate performance. This composite as anode is assembled with an activated carbon (AC) electrode as cathode into MnCo2O4/TiO2//AC LIC working in a wide voltage range of 0.5–4 V. This LIC can deliver high specific energies of 89.8 and 44.1 Wh kg−1 at specific power of 0.25 and 3.41 kW kg−1, respectively, and presents outstanding cyclic stability (76.4% of initial capacity at the end of 5000 cycles).
