In this work, a novel mixed-lanthanide metal–organic framework (ML-MOF, ML = La3+, Gd3+ and Tm3+) is synthesized for the first time through a simple reductive electrodeposition procedure onto nickel foam and its charge storage ability is investigated. The as-prepared ML-MOF is characterized through FE-SEM, EDS, XRD, FT-IR and TGA analyses. The results of these analyses confirmed deposition of the crystalline well-defined rod-like ML-MOF with composition of {La2Gd0.5Tm0.5 BTC]. xH2O}n onto Ni foam. The fabricated ML-MOF/NF electrode delivered specific capacity values of 965F g−1 and 594 F g−1 at 5 and 50 A g−1, and capacity retention of 94.5% after 6000 cycles at high current load of 5 A g−1, which confirmed its superior rate ability and excellent cycling performance. Based on the results, the applied electrochemical strategy is introduced as a simple facile way for synthesis of various ML-MOF materials for different electrochemical applications.
