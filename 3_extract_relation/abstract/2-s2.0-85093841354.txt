2D metal organic frameworks (MOFs) with layered structure and much exposed atoms on the surface are expected to be promising electrode materials for hybrid supercapacitors. However, the insulating character strongly hinders their further applications. Herein, we propose a novel MOF//MOF strategy to enhance 2D MOF's conductivity, by which two kinds of 2D MOFs with specific functions are concurrently incorporated into one homogeneous layered MOF with enhanced conductivity and electrochemical performance. The synthesized Ni//Cu MOF shows a triple high capacitance of 1,424 Fg−1 and excellent rate capability compared with the pristine Ni MOF. A hybrid supercapacitor is thereof fabricated, which can provide a maximum energy density of 57 Wh kg−1 and a maximum power density of 48,000 W kg−1. These results not only demonstrate that our strategy can effectively boost the conductivity and redox activity but also pave new routes to synthesize new MOFs for various applications.
