A brief review of carbon nanotube (CNT) research is presented, and some basic definitions relevant to the structure and properties of CNTs are provided. Owing to their tremendous properties, CNTs have been applied in the biomedical industry as well as for conductive coatings, supercapacitor electrodes, hydrogen storage, and electronic devices; some of these applications are discussed herein.
