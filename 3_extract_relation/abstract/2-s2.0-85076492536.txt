Firstly, the energy conversion relationship between battery energy storage, capacitor energy storage of super-capacitors and mechanical kinetic energy of synchronous generator is established in the process of frequency dynamic fluctuation, and the definition of virtual inertia of HESS(Hybrid Energy Storage System)derived from two kinds of static energy is defined. Secondly, based on the charging and discharging characteristics of batteries and super-capacitors, a HESS cooperative control strategy is proposed by using power co-regulation between two energy storage units. By monitoring the frequency fluctuation of the system, the control strategy transfers energy of battery and super-capacitors to imitate inertial response of synchronous generator in consideration of characteristic of power control and SOC(State Of Charging) by monitoring frequency fluctuation. Finally, a photovoltaic micro-grid containing HESS is set up to validate the effectiveness of the control strategy. The simulative results show that the strategy can make full use of the static energy stored in HESS to rapidly virtualize the inertial response and significantly improve the frequency stability of system.
