Porous carbons were prepared by the template method using chrysotile as the template and sucrose as the carbon precursor. The effect of the weight ratio of the template to the carbon precursor on the porosity and electrochemical performance of the porous carbons was investigated. Results indicate that the pore size distributions and specific surface areas of the porous carbons are changed by the ratio. The porous carbon prepared at a ratio of 1:3 exhibits the highest specific capacitance at different current densities, and best rate capability and cycling stability, which are ascribed to its highest surface area, highest percentage of meso-and macropore volume and its hierarchical porous structure.
