Polyaniline (PANI) is one of the most intriguing conducting polymers with ultrahigh specific capacitance. The synergistic effect between PANI and graphene nanosheets (GN) could remarkably diminish their inherent drawbacks, and enhance the capacitance/cycling life of GN-PANI supercapacitors. We review the recent advances in this regard, discuss the effect of synthetic routes used and surface functionalization of GN on the performance of GN-PANI supercapacitor electrodes, and highlight the importance of fabricating hierarchical structure and 3D porous networks.
