Ni7S6 has been synthesised using solvo-thermal route, ethylene diamine (C2H4(NH2)2) and ethylene glycol ((CH2OH)2) were used as solvent. Structural and morphological properties of the prepared sample were studied by X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). Crystallite size of the synthesised sample is 26 nm. Energy band gap of the Ni7S6 is 2.93 eV which was calculated from the ultraviolet-visible spectrometer technique. Electro-chemical properties of the synthesized Ni7S6 were studied by Nqyuist plot and cyclic Voltammetry technique. The measured parameters of the synthesized Ni7S6 indicates that Ni7S6 is the promising electrode material for energy conversion and storage devices.
