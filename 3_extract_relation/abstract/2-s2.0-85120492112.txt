Direct dual Z-scheme heterostructured nanocomposite TiO2-WO3-CeO2 (NC) and pristine metal oxides nanostructures (NSs) were fabricated using a facile co-precipitation route. XRD, FTIR, and Raman data have confirmed the formation of NSs and NC. FESEM images showed quasi-mesoporous morphology of as-grown nanocomposite. EDX analysis confirmed the existence of titanium (Ti), cerium (Ce), and tungsten (W) in grown NC. The energy bandgap of NC was narrow 2.45 eV as compared to NSs. The higher electrical conductivity and lower recombination rate of NC were observed in IV and PL analysis. The photodegradation efficiency of NC was recorded 99.8% after 60 min under sunlight radiation against methylene blue (MB), which was significantly higher than NSs. NC catalyst has shown excellent photodegradation against other organic pollutants and has superior recyclability up to 7th cycle toward MB dye with a ~ 6% deficit in photodegradation efficiency. The antimicrobial activity results indicated the higher inhibition ability of NC against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, P. Vulgaris, and P. aeruginosa with maximum inhibition zone diameter 25, 29, 26, 28, and 27 mm, respectively. The electrochemical tests including CV, EIS, and GCD exhibited the superior capacitive behaviour of NC. These results demonstrate that grown NC is an efficient material for electrochemical devices, water purification, and biomedical applications.
