This paper focuses on a control strategy for the DC-DC converters of a two-level hierarchical control system for power management of a battery/supercapacitor-based electric vehicle hybrid energy storage system. Control strategy and detailed controller design are described. Simulation results are considered for evaluation of the performance of proposed approach regarding different scenarios using standard drive cycle data.
