In this work, firstly, [Zn2(bdc)2(dabco)]n as a metal organic framework (MOF) was synthesized via chemical routes. Finally, for improving electrochemical properties of the poly ortho aminophenol (POAP), we fabricated POAP/chitosan/MOF-1 films by electro- polymerization of POAP in the presence of Chitosan/MOF-1 to serve as the active electrode for electrochemical supercapacitor. The structural and valance state of the prepared samples was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Different electrochemical methods including galvanostatic chargeâ€“discharge experiments, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy are carried out in order to investigate the performance of the system. This work introduces new most efficient materials for electrochemical redox capacitors with advantages including ease synthesis, high active surface area and stability in an aqueous electrolyte.
