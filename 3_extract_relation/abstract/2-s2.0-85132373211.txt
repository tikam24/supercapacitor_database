Mn3O4/MnS electrode material for supercapacitor with a heterostructure was successfully prepared via a facile solvothermal synthesis approach and the electrochemical performance was discussed in this paper. By measuring the 3-electrodes electrochemical properties of the material, this Mn3O4/MnS electrode exhibit maximum area capacity of 176.9 F g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1, respectively, as well as the 68% capacity retention after 40,000 cycles for the 3-elecrode and 80% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles for assembled supercapacitor under high charge/discharge current of 20 mA. DFT calculation results show that the unique heterostructure of Mn3O4/MnS contributes to the enhancement of electrochemical performance.
