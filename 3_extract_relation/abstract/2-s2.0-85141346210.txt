The paper presents a prototype, hybrid automated guided vehicle (AGV) power supply system. The power supply system applies a hydrogen fuel cell as the primary source of energy, fed from a low-pressure metal hydride cylinder. Additionally, the power supply is equipped with two auxiliary energy buffers, a lithium-ion battery and a supercapacitor bank. For best efficiency, the fuel cell works with a power electronic inverter that tracks the maximum power point (MPPT). The prototype power system was tested in simulated operating conditions, based on the power consumption profile determined by measurement in the tests of a real AGV vehicle.
