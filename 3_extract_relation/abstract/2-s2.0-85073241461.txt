Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has been studied extensively for energy storage because of its excellent electrical properties and unique structure. In this work, the freestanding flexible composite films were prepared by reduced graphene oxide (RGO), polyaniline (PANI), and MoS2 via a facile method. The all-solid-state flexible supercapacitor based on the ternary composite film shows good electrochemical properties. The special capacitance of supercapacitor is 643.3 mF/cm2 (âˆ¼2144.3 F/cm3). And the all-solid-state flexible supercapacitor presents no particularly obvious fading after bending 200 times. Furthermore, the ternary composite film electrode has certain waterproof effect due to the high content of MoS2. The ternary composite film remained high capacitance (614.9 mF/cm2) after soaking in water for 8 h. This work not only develops a facile approach to prepare MoS2 composite film with flexibility, but also provides a guideline for preparing functional supercapacitor by utilizing properties of MoS2 such as photoelectric conversion, catalytic function and so on.
