The magnesium phosphate based porous material (MPCPM) was prepared bychemical foaming method using NaHCO3 as an air entraining agent. The MPCPM was characteristic of developed pore structure and high strength, hence it is possible to develop a multifunctional composite which is prepared by the MPCPM supportor and KOH electrolyte. The composite was sandwiched by two graphene electrodes, then a novel structural supercapacitor was fabricated. Experimental results show that electrochemical properties of the structural supercapacitor can be attributed to the pore connectivity of MPCPM. The MPCPM contains a great amount of connected pores which can provide paths for ion motion and ion storage. The effects of the NaHCO3 content and the curing age on the electrochemical and mechanical properties of the structural supercapacitor were analyzed. CV, EIS and CD analyses reveal that the structural supercapacitor exhibits ideal capacitive behavior and charge/discharge performance. The maximum specific capacitance is as high as 62.2 F•g-1with the NaHCO3 content at 2.5%, it is increased by 34.1% compared with the MPCPM without addition of NaHCO3. Moreover, the structural supercapacitor exhibits a specific capacitance of 38.79 F•g-1 and a compressive strength of 18.76 MPawith the NaHCO3 content at 2%. It can achieve a balance between electrochemical performance and mechanical property. And this novel structural supercapacitor may have potential application in multifunctional civil engineering structures.
