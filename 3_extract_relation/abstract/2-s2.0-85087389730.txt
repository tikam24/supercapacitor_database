Ni(OH)2 precursor was prepared using a countercurrent flow micro-channel reactor (CFMCR) and then reduced to Ni2P in the presence of PH3 and purified by acid etching. The effects of varying the CFMCR reaction conditions (including volumetric flow rate, pH and aging time) and the phosphating temperature on the properties of the Ni(OH)2 precursor and Ni2P materials were investigated. The optimal reaction conditions for the preparation of Ni2P materials were determined. The as-prepared Ni2P materials were modified with Co using the CFMCR in an attempt to improve their charge-discharge cycling performance and specific capacitance. The results showed that the optimum Ni2P material prepared using the CFMCR had a maximum specific capacitance of 1 200 F/g and its specific capacitance retention ratio was about 65% after 500 charge-discharge cycles. The Ni-Co-P composite prepared by doping with Co had a maximum specific capacitance of 1 475 F/g and its specific capacitance retention was about 84% after 500 charge-discharge cycles.
