This work exploits the advantage of asymmetric configuration over symmetric supercapacitor in designing high energy density flexible devices from two active electrode materials–keratin-based renewable-resource hierarchically porous carbon and hydrous ruthenium oxide (RuO2). The asymmetric device exhibits significantly high capacitance. Conventional estimation of energy storage parameters, however, cannot be applied for devices with a Faradaic energy storage contribution via redox charge transfer mechanism. Therefore, this work applies a precise measurement of pseudocapacitance contribution at various scan rates to correct the device data that reveals effective capacitance of 120 F g−1 with the energy density of 37 W h kg−1 at 776 W kg−1. It also retains excellent rate capability, >74% at high current density 25 A g−1. The charge storage activity and device stability can be further enhanced by introducing redox-active electrolytes that improve specific capacitance, but the rate capabilities deteriorate at high current densities. Further, the principle of asymmetric electrode design is applied to fabricate a bending-tolerant, flexible device by depositing active electrode material on wire-shaped current collector followed by coupling those separated with polyvinyl alcohol gel containing redox electrolyte; it yields 36.8 mF cm−1 specific capacitance at a 0.2 mA cm−1 current density.
