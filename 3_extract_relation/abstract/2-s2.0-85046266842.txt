This paper presents a power control strategy for a grid connected domestic PV system included hybrid energy storage devices. The strategy aims to minimize utility grid dependency of the users in addition to considering safe working conditions of the storage devices. Battery and ultracapacitor were used respectively for providing high energy density and high power density in hybrid storage system. The proposed model was tested in Matlab/Simulink simulation environment by using measurement values which are presented in literature for PV electric generation and domestic energy consumption. Simulation results reveal that domestic demand is exactly supplied by the hybrid storage system as long as ultracapacitor has stored energy. After the energy stored in ultracapacitor is consumed, battery blanks sustain to support utility grid for meeting the demand.
