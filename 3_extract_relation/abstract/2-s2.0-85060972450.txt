Porous cobalt oxides/carbon foam hybrid materials (CoO x /C) was prepared by a solvothermal method. Owing to the heredity of the interconnected hierarchical porous structure from the carbon foam, the obtained CoO x /C composites had a larger specific surface area and a wider pore size distribution than CoO x , which facilitated the electron and ion transport. Benefiting from the synergistic contribution of CoO x nanoparticles and the porous carbon foam, CoO x /C possessed an excellent supercapacitive performance. When the mass percentage of the carbon foam was 10%, the CoO x /C composite (CoO x /C-10) exhibited a high specific capacity (115 mAh g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 ), an excellent rate capability (73 mAh g −1 at 10 A g −1 ) and a good cycling stability (86% after 6000 cycles at 1 A g −1 ). Meanwhile, an asymmetric device (CoO x /C-10//carbon foam) delivered a maximum energy density of 14 Wh kg −1 at a power density of 9056 W kg −1 as well as excellent cyclic lifetime (87% after 7000 cycles at 1 A g −1 ). In consideration of the excellent supercapacitive performance, the low cost and the facile preparation, CoO x /C-m is a promising electrode material for the supercapacitors.
