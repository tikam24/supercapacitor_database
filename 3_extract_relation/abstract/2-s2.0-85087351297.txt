We have, in this study; used simple, in-expensive and environmentally-friendly successive ionic layer adsorption and reactions (SILAR) deposition procedure to successfully grow GO/Mn3O4 thin film electrode materials. The deposited films were examined for their surface morphology using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) while its morphology and structure was confirmed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and selected area electron diffractometry (SAED) respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to study their structural properties while their supercapacitive studies were obtained using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. All deposited films were scanned in 1 M solution of Na2SO4 electrolyte. The SEM images of the deposited films revealed highly porous interconnected morphology with Mn3O4 densely dispersed among graphene oxide (GO). Individual peaks of Mn3O4 and GO compounds indicating uniform spread of Mn3O4 inside the porous matrix of GO were observed from the XRD. Mn3O4 nanograins well-dispersed on the surface were further confirmed through the TEM images while bright concentric rings confirming the polycrystalline nature of the films were observed from SAED images. The film deposited at 40 cycles yielded the maximum specific capacitance of 532.54 Fg−1at 5 mVs−1 scan rate. The results of the electrochemical studies show that the GO/Mn3O4 composite films synthesized by SILAR could be a promising material for supercapacitors.
