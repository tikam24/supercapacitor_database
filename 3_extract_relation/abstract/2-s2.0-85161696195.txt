In recent decades, supercapacitors have attracted much research as low-cost, reliable, and environment-friendly energy storage devices. However, the low energy density and low operating voltage limit its wide applications. Herein, a novel 1D–2D constructed 3D multicomponent Mox:Vy–S@Co9S8 core–shell nanowires array is designed and fabricated as the cathode material through a simple and economical two-step hydrothermal reaction and electrodeposition process. The constructed 3D Mo0.5V0.5–S@Co9S8 electrode exhibits excellent charge storage capability; an area capacity of 0.91 mA h cm−2 with a corresponding specific capacity of 480.9 mA h g−1 at 2 mA cm−2. Moreover, a solid-state ASC (SS–ASC) is assembled with the as-obtained Fe2O3@CNFs/N–rGO aerogel as the anode, the constructed 3D Mox:Vy–S@Co9S8 NWAs as cathode, and KOH–PVA–gel as a gel electrolyte. As proof of concept, the assembled SS–ASC display an excellent operating voltage window of ~1.7 V and an outstanding energy density of ~108.47 W h kg−1 at ~520.65 W kg−1 power density. Also, when connected in series, the two SS–ASC devices can run an electronic clock for 30 min, demonstrating the practicability of the constructed 3D Mox:Vy–S@Co9S8 NWAs as a promising electrode material for the development of the high energy density ASC.
