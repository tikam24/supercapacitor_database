Supercapacitors as a class of energy storage devices possess high power density, outstanding reversibility and long cycle life. The development of innovative electrode materials and unconventional configurations determine the successful operation of supercapacitors. Owing to controllable porous structure and unique electrochemical behavior, great efforts have been devoted to designing and fabricating innovative metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) based supercapacitors. In this review, recent developments in MOFs related supercapacitors electrodes are summarized. Furthermore, the advances in MOFs composites for supercapactiors application including pristine MOFs, MOFs composites and MOFs-derived composites are systematically discussed by integrating charge storing principle. Finally, future prospects and opportunities in the design of MOFs related electrodes are also delineated.
