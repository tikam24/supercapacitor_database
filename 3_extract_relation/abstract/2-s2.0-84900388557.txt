In this study, longitudinally unzipped carbon nanotubes (L-UCNTs) prepared from multiwalled carbon nanotubes and their electrochemical properties for supercapacitors were investigated after thermal treatment. Thermally treated L-UCNTs (RL-UCNTs) had a specific surface area of 288 m2/g and mesoporous pore characteristics. Also, RL-UCNTs had numerous oxygen heteroatoms, which affected electrochemical performances of RLUCNTs. RL-UCNTs exhibited a specific capacitance of 106 F/g and cycle stabilities over 5000 repetitive cycles. Copyright Â© 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.
