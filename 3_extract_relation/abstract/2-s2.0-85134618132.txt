The close integration of an active layer with a current collector is of significance for the properties of supercapacitor electrodes. Herein, we propose a novel and feasible strategy where graphene hydrogels are implanted onto the carbon cloth on which polypyrrole is electrodeposited to obtain specially constructed electrodes. Particularly, the graphene oxide colloid drop-coated on the current collector undergoes a mild hydrothermal reduction to form a graphene hydrogel film implanted onto the carbon cloth. The integrated graphene/carbon cloth film with a porous graphene framework effectively contributes to the polypyrrole loading and endows the as-prepared electrode with enhanced electrochemical properties. The optimized electrode presents superb specific capacitances (522.3 F g-1at 0.7 A g-1, 1462.5 mF cm-2at 2 mA cm-2), with satisfactory rate capability, cycling lifetime, and bending performance. The corresponding device can achieve a desirable energy density (88.67 Î¼Wh cm-2, 15.8 Wh kg-1) and power density (14.65 mW cm-2, 2.64 kW kg-1). The design method reported in this paper could provide a new pathway toward constructing high-performing electrodes based on graphene materials.
