A facile and low-cost strategy has been demonstrated in this paper for the synthesis of copper sulfides with different shapes and chemical compositions via an one-step hydrothermal method. Various CuSs were fabricated through changing the reaction temperature and further systematically characterized by XRD, EDS, SEM, TEM HAADF-STEM and SAED in details (crooked sheets for CuS-140 (Cu7.2S4), nanoparticles for CuS-160 (Cu7.2S4), tentaculiform for CuS-180 (Cu1.81S)). Encouragingly, the obtained samples also respectively display excellent electrochemical performance as electrodes for supercapacitors and CuS-140 shows the highest capacitance of 1000.2 F/g as compared to 725.8 F/g for CuS-160 and 520.1 F/g for CuS-180 at 1 A/g. The capacitance decreases as the current density range from 1 to 5 A/g and CuS-160 decreased by 80.89% at the current density of 5 A/g, indicating excellent rate property. Particularly, the three as-prepared electrodes also reveal excellent cycling stabilities and the specific capacitance still maintains 94.7%, 90.6% and 100% for CuS-140, CuS-160 and CuS-180 after the completion of 1000 cycles. Therefore, this work provides a promising pathway for the fabrication of high-performance electrode materials for SCs.
