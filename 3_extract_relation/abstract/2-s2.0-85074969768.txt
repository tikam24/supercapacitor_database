In this study, graphene oxide (GO) was chemically reacted with sodium borohydride (NaBH4) to form reduced graphene oxide (rGO). rGO, Montmorillonite nanoclay, and polyvinylcarbazole (PVK) were used to form a ternary nanocomposite via chemical reaction. These nanocomposite qualities were described via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy-attenuated transmission reflectance (FTIR-ATR). In addition, these materials were used in supercapacitor device as an active material to test electrochemical performances via cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The rGO/nanoclay/PVK nanocomposite shows significantly improved specific capacitance (Csp = 168.64 Fg−1) compared to that of rGO (Csp = 63.26 Fg−1) at the scan rate of 10 mVs−1 by CV method. The enhanced capacitance results in high power density (P = 5522.6 Wkg−1) and energy density (E = 28.84 Whkg−1) capabilities of the rGO/nanoclay/PVK nanocomposite material. The addition of nanoclay and PVK increased the specific capacitance of rGO material due to a dopant effect for supercapacitor studies. Ragone plots were drawn to observe energy and power density of supercapacitor devices. The Csp of rGO/nanoclay/PVK nanocomposite has only 86.4% of initial capacitance for charge/discharge performances obtained by CV method for 5000 cycles.
