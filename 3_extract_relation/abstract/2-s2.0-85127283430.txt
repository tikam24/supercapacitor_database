The proceedings contain 74 papers. The topics discussed include: evaluation of fiber orientation of ac and dc electrospun PlCl nanofibrous layers; industrial magnetron sputtering of ZrN/Cu nanostructured coatings for anti-bacterial purposes; mineralized polylactide and polycaprolactone soft foams with hierarchical micro-macro porous structure for tissue engineering; fully-automatic benchtop machine for the production of nanoparticle suspensions; the co-culture of keratinocytes and fibroblasts on a multi-layered polyester nanofibrous membrane enriched with platelet lysate; activated carbon fibers derived from sea balls for the use as supercapacitor electrodes; and plasmon-mediated electrocatalytic activity of tib2 towards water splitting.
