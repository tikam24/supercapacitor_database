Molybdenum oxides with highly tunable structure have attracted increasing interests as their debut and proceeding into the field of electrochemical energy storage, as of their delicate structural and electronic features at the nanoscale, as well as oxygen vacancies. This family includes molybdenum trioxide (MoO3), molybdenum dioxide (MoO2), and their various transition states. In this review, we summarize the physical, chemical, and electronic properties of nanostructured MoO3-x, on the basis of in-depth understanding of a variety of their synthetic methods and characterization. Such merits facilitate the ultimate clarification of the charge-storage mechanisms which thereof catalogues within a wide range of electrochemical energy storage and pinpoints the promising outlook as well as challenges.
