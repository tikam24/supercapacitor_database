In the present study, the solvothermal route is followed to synthesize cobalt doped nanomaterial LaNi0.9Co0.1O3 and reduced graphene oxide reinforced LaNi0.9Co0.1O3 nanocomposite. The electrochemical performance of symmetric and asymmetric energy storage devices is investigated by fabricating the electrodes using LaNi0.9Co0.1O3 active materials and its composite with reduced graphene oxide. The structural phase of samples is associated with rhombohedral structure with agglomerated heterogeneous morphology. The nanocomposite showed the superlative result compared to cobalt doped electrode as evident by specific capacitance 436 F/g and 334 F/g at 1 A/g, respectively. The electrodes achieved 92 and 95% retention for LaNi0.9Co0.1O3 and LaNi0.9Co0.1O3/rGO nanocomposites, respectively, for 1000 cycles. The asymmetric device shows significant improvement in specific capacitance of 86 F/g compared to the symmetric device of 38 F/g at current density 1 A/g. The cyclic test up to 3000 cycles was performed, where the LaNi0.9Co0.1O3 electrode achieved 84% retention and the LaNi0.9Co0.1O3/rGO electrode sustained 86% retention. Overall nanocomposite material exhibits superior quality, which emerges as a promising candidate for future energy storage application. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
