For electric vehicles with supercapacitor and battery storage devices, it is a challenge to achieve real-time global energy optimization and extend the battery lifetime simultaneously. In this paper, a quasi-optimal strategy to allocate energy by combining dynamic programming with long short term memory (LSTM) network is proposed for a semi-active battery/supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system. In this work, the cost function of the vehicle operating cost is constructed, including battery degradation and energy consumption. The optimal current reference is determined by solving the optimization problem by dynamic programming algorithm. According to the result of the solution, we construct the corresponding training data set for LSTM training. The trained LSTM generates the quasi-optimal solution for the SC decision, which is utilized to distribute the load power afterward. Simulation on UDDS data set illustrates that the designed strategy can improve the energy efficiency and extend the battery lifetime while guaranteeing the SC SoC constraints.
