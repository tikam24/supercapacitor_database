Aiming at the problem of energy consumption in the operation of trams in the form of contactless super capacitor power supply, a method of operating and cooperating with train schedules to optimize energy saving was studied. According to the train dynamics model and the energy-saving operation model between train stations, the method is implemented by redistributing the three working conditions of traction, idling and braking under the premise that the distance between train stations remains unchanged and the operating time between stations is within the feasible range. Calculate an energy-saving train target operation curve based on the distance of the train and the output of the train in the traction and braking conditions. Finally, the method is used to optimize the actual running line of Sanya tram T1 line. The simulation results show that the method reduces the operating energy consumption by 4.2% on average during the redundant time, which proves the effectiveness of the algorithm.
