In this paper, the energy characteristics of the charge circuits of a supercapacitor (nonlinear capacitor) and an equivalent linear capacitor from a DC voltage source, which is a lithium-ion battery for such energy storage devices, are analyzed. It is established under what conditions the losses of electricity in the charge circuits of linear and equivalent nonlinear capacitors from the DC voltage source are reduced. The influence of final and initial voltages on similar terminals and capacitance terminals on similar energy losses is analyzed. The regularities of increasing the energy transfer coefficient in the circuits of the aperiodic charge of supercapacitors and equivalent linear capacitors from a DC voltage source (battery) with increasing initial voltages at the capacitor terminals are determined.
