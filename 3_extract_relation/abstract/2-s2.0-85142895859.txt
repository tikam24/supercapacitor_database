Wood processing will produce a lot of sawdust, which will not only pollute the environment but also cause a waste of resources. So, it is still a challenge to make high value-added utilization of sawdust. Herein, we designed a novel method for the preparation of oxygen-enriched hierarchical porous carbons (OHPCs) from sawdust by using magnesium chloride coupled with potassium carbonate activation. The prepared OHPC maintains the natural pore structure of sawdust, which supplies a lot of channels for rapid ion transport. Besides, the abundant oxygen-containing functional groups inside the OHPC generate a pseudo-capacitor by the redox to improve the capacitance of OHPC electrodes. As a result, OHPC shows high electrochemical performance, e.g., high-specific capacitance of 324.9 F g−1 at 0.05 A g−1, excellent rate property of 231.3 F g−1 at 20 A g−1, and outstanding cycle life at 2 A g−1 of 96.9% after 16,000 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance shows that OHPC materials can be used as an electrode for energy storage and conversion devices.
