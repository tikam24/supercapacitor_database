This study demonstrates a method for improving supercapacitive performance of two-dimensional nanosheet-based composite electrode. As a hybridized electrostatic double layer capacitor–electrochemical pseudocapacitor (EDLC–PC) electrode, we synthesized reduced graphene oxide–polyaniline nanofibers (rGO–PANi NFs) composite electrode. For the enhanced supercapacitive performances, insulator silver chloride nanoparticles (AgCl NPs) were intercalated into the interlayer gap of rGO. The AgCl NP intercalation (i) exfoliated rGO layers and (ii) prevented rGO-self-agglomeration that makes it difficult to utilize the high surface-to-volume ratio of ideal mono- (or few-) atomic-thick rGO layers. As a result, (iii) the specific capacitance was improved in accordance with the enlarged specific surface area of rGO. Furthermore, (iv) the well-developed rGO edges, which were opened by the AgCl intercalation, enabled formation of more bonds between PANi and rGO by selective grafting of PANi to the rGO edges. Hence, the bonds of PANi–rGO, as conducting paths, substantially reduced the total electrical resistance. Enhanced specific capacitance, ion diffusion efficiency, and reduced electrical resistance indicated the bi-functional roles of AgCl NP insertion for high performance hybridized EDLC–PC electrodes.
