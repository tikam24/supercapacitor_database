In this paper, we have used solution cast technique to synthesize ionic liquid incorporated PEO (Poly (ethylene oxide) with KI (Potassium Iodide) doped polymer electrolyte. The ionic conductivity enhances rapidly after adding ionic liquid in polymer salt complex and reaches 4.2*10-4 S/cm. Characterization such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and polarized optical microscopy (POM) was also done to check the blending nature and amorphousity of the developed polymer electrolyte. Finally, the supercapacitor has been developed using high conducting ionic liquid (IL) doped polymer electrolyte which shows the specific capacitance 12.28F/g at 5 mV/s.
