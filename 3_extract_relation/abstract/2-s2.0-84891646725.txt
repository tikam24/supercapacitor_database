Supercapacitors are electrical energy storage devices, which offer high power density, extremely high cycling capability. Supercapacitors have a high potential in industrial applications. To improve the performance, reliability, and lifetime of these capacitors, charge-balancing circuits are employed. Once charge-balancing circuits start, it can transfer the energy of high voltage capacitor monomer to low voltage monomer, so as to achieve the dynamic equilibrium of voltage series supercapacitors. In this paper, the influence of the series supercapacitors switching inductive method on several design parameters has been analyzed and simulated. The writer describes the experimental main circuit and control circuit of hardware and software implementations. Through experiments, the balanced effect of the method and are analyzed, and finally the ideal balancing effect and speed are obtained.
