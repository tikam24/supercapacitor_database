Multifunctionality of all-in-one energy storage devices with the properties involving flexibility, interface stability, and wearability are urgently needed for portable electronic equipment. Here, we report a facile method based on interfacial cross-linking for preparing all-in-one energy storage devices, where the same polymer substrate is used in both electrode and electrolyte, while the electrolyte as the cross-linking agent to obtain more stable interface between the components of the all-in-one energy storage devices. This novel strategy endows the storage device small intrinsic impedance effect (RS=1.82 Î©) and mechanical stability; and more importantly it enables the supercapacitors to be used as public module to achieve arbitrary, designable, and multi-dimensional integration for the adaptation with complex power supply systems. The strategy is also successfully extended to aqueous Zn-MnO2 battery. Overall, the strategy provides a universal and simple path for the integrated design of the all-in-one energy storage device as a flexible and switchable power source.
