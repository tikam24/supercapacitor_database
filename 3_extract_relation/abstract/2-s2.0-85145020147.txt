The synthesis of layered nanorod arrays with a core-shell structure is considered to be a viable strategy to improve the electrochemical property of electrode materials. Herein, we have successfully designed and fabricated layered MoO3-MnNi LDH@Cu(OH)2/CF(MO-MN LDH@COH) core-shell nanorods through a handy in-situ oxidation reaction followed by a hydrothermal synthesis, which consist of ordered Cu(OH)2 nanorods and ultra-thin MoO3-MnNi LDHs nanosheets. The MO-MN LDH@COH which is utilized as the cathode in three electrodes exhibits superior electrochemical property. The specific capacity of prepared electrode is 16913 mF cm−2 under a current density of 2 mA cm−2, which is superior to its counterparts of COH, MN LDH@COH-0, MO-MN LDH@COH-0.5 and MO-MN LDH@COH-2. What's more, the cycling stability reaches 83.33 % capacitance retention after 5000 cycles under the current density of 30 mA cm−2. When a solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device (MO-MN LDH@COH//AC) is fabricated, it could keep a household LED screen running for 27 minutes, verifying the immense commercial potential. Overall, this unique MO-MN LDH@COH nanocomposite with excellent electrochemical performance should envision great practical application potential.
