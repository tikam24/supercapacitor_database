Comparisons are made between the material requirements for supercapacitor electrodes and the cathode of a lithium-ion battery. The performances of the battery cathodes Li1+xFe2(SO4)2(PO4) and Li1+xVMoO6 are compared to those for supercapacitor electrodes operating with 5.3 M H2SO4, Nafion 117, or 2 M KCl aqueous solution at pH 6.7. The use of a KCl aqueous electrolyte at mild pH allows stabilization of amorphous, hydrated electrode materials such as a-MnO2nH2O that are not stable in 5.3 M H2SO4 or with Nafion 117. However, the larger K+ ion appears to reduce by a factor of three the theoretical capacity attainable with H+ ions. Â©1999 Materials Research Society.
