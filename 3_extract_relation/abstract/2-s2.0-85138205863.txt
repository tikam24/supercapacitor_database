Supercapacitors are gaining popularity due to their high-power density, long life, and little maintenance. Carbon nanotubes/nickel sulphide/cobalt sulphide (CNTs/NiS/CoS) nanocomposites for supercapacitor applications are developed due to their inexpensive cost and excellent electrochemical properties. A composite material combining carbon nanotubes on CoS, NiS, and nickel foam was employed. All electrochemical tests were carried out in a solution of 3 M KOH. The R ct and R f for the CNTs/NiS/CoS electrode were found to be 1.4 Ω cm2 and 1.2 Ω cm2, respectively, which were significantly lower than the corresponding R ct (42.1 Ω cm2) and R f (47.5 Ω cm2) for the CNTs electrode, indicating that the CNTs/NiS/CoS has a significantly lower overall impedance, which could be one of the key factors responsible for the improved electrochemical performance of the CNTs/NiS/CoS. At current density of 1 A/g, the CNTs/NiS/CoS nanocomposite electrode had specific capacitances of 1249.88 mAh/g. At a current density of 1 A/g, the CNTs/NiS/CoS electrodes retained 97.17% of their specific capacitance after 8000 charge–discharge cycles. The energy density and power density of CNTs/NiS/CoS samples are found to be 624.44 Wh/kg and 8325.87 W/kg, respectively. The CNTs/NiS/CoS nanocomposite exhibits a high specific capacitance and a long cycle life, according to galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements.
