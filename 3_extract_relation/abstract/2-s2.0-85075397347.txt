In this study, a chemically interconnected composite, called EBP-PPY-AgNP, was fabricated to develop high-performance hybrid supercapacitor electrodes. The composite consists of epoxide-functionalized buckypaer (EBP), polypyrrole (PPY), and silver nanoparticles (AgNP). The structure was characterized using Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Also, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic chargeâ€“discharge (GCD) analyses were conducted to estimate the electrochemical performance. The results were more excellent than those of the other electrodes not chemically interconnected. Finally, the energy density was calculated, and the value was higher than in previous studies that examined electrodes with similar materials.
