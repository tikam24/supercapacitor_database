This work develops a facile one-step template-free approach to control the porous morphology of sulfur-doped g-C3N4/Bi2S3 (Sg-C3N4/Bi2S3) for a hybrid asymmetric supercapacitor (HASC). Herein, bismuth nitrate acted as a bismuth source and played an efficient role as a temporary template that generated pores within Sg-C3N4 sheets before transforming into Bi2S3 nanoparticles. This inventive porous construction can professionally boost the electrochemical behavior of the prepared material as electrode material for supercapacitor applications. These results point to the potential of the prepared composite (Bi2S3/Sg-C3N4-II) with a porous structure to be a promising electrode material for highly efficient supercapacitors. Promisingly, the designed device can deliver maximum Es of 6.2 Wh kg−1 at the corresponding Ps of 455 W kg−1 at the current density of 0.8 A g−1. The cycling stability performance of the assembled device retained 80 % of its initial capacity after 3000 cycles, signifying the applicable potential of Bi2S3/Sg-C3N4-II for supercapacitor applications.
