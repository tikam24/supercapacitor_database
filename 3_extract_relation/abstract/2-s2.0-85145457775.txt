The application of rare earth in supercapacitor electrode materials can effectively improve the utilization value of rare earth resources in our country. This paper summarizes the application status of rare earth ions, rare earth oxides, rare earth chalcogenides and perovskite materials containing rare earth elements in supercapacitors. The characteristics of large charge radius and small electronegativity of rare earth ions can significantly improve the ionic conductivity, electrochemical activity and structural stability of electrode materials, and then improve the overall performance of supercapacitors. This not only reflects the important value of rare earth in the design of electrode materials for supercapacitors, but also shows its broad application prospect in the field of energy storage.
