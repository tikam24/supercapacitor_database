We have synthesized N-doped mesoporous carbon by the in-suit doping template method under the carbonized temperature of 900 °C. We found that the electrochemical performance of mesoporous carbon was enhanced by N-doping. So, we tried to increase the content of nitrogen to further optimize the electrochemical performance of the mesoporous carbon as electrode materials. During the process of synthesizing mesoporous carbon, the carbonized temperature played an important role in the formation of the carbon structure and its morphology, as well as in determining the content of nitrogen. We attained a considerable electrochemical performance enhancement by changing the carbonized temperature from 900 to 700 °C. We found the content of Nitrogen decreased with the increase of the carbonized temperature and the content of Nitrogen is 6.11% at 700 °C, 5.39% at 800 °C, 3.9% at 900 °C, respectively. The best electrochemical performance was observed in the product carbonized at 700 °C, which exhibited high specific capacitance (245.6 F/g at 0.5 A/g) and good cycle ability (more than 90% of the initial capacitance after 5000 cycles) in 6 M KOH electrolyte.
