Supercapacitors are novel energy storage elements between traditional capacitors and chemical batteries. In general, supercapacitors possess high power density, fast charge-discharge speed, long working life and low environmental pollution. As a significant component, electrode materials make an important effect on the electrochemical performance and commercial applications on the supercapacitors. In recent years, the novel carbon materials, such as carbon aerogrl, carbon nanotubes, carbon fibers and graphene, have been a research hotspot, which can be promising candidate for the new generation electrode materials. In this paper, the recent advancement and development of the novel carbon materials were reviewed. Moreover, the urgent requirement and the challenges of the carbon materials were proposed as well as the perspective in future, which offered theoretical basis and technique support for the construction of energy internet.
