To achieve high energy density and superior rate capacity of carbon-based supercapacitors, the integration of large specific area, hierarchical porous structure and abundant heteroatom doping is considered to be a powerful engineered strategy. Unfortunately, such porous carbon materials with multiple synergistic effects are difficult to be achieved simultaneously by conventional synthesis methods in few steps. Herein, we report a series of micro-dominant hierarchical porous carbon with rich heteroatom doping amounts derived by hypercrosslinked polymerization approach for high-performance supercapacitors. Among them, the N/S co-doped porous carbon (N, S-MC) exhibits a micro-dominant (77.5%) hierarchical porous structure, a large surface area (1339 m2 g−1), and rich heteroatom doping amount (4.5% for N, 5.8% for S). Remarkably, the N, S-MC (symmetric capacitors in two-electrode system) delivers a specific capacitance as high as 464 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1, hence a high energy density of 16.2 W h kg−1 at 50 W kg−1. Meanwhile, the capacitance retention of N, S-MC remains over 92% after 10,000 cycles. This work reports a hypercrosslinked polymerization approach to construct hierarchical porous N, S co-doped carbon for high-performance supercapacitor device, which is look forward to provide a new strategy to prepare carbon-based materials for ultrafast electron/ion transport supercapacitors.
