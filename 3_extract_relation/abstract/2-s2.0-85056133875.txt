This paper aims to develop a low-cost energy storage system by evaluating reference generation algorithms for dispatching solar power for 1 MW photovoltaic (PV) arrays. Based on battery state of charge (SOC), rule-based algorithms are developed to adjust the grid reference power for each one-hour dispatching period. In this paper, several rule-based algorithms are used to control the SOC of the battery that plays a significant role to design cost-effective energy storage system. The price comparison is made between two kinds of energy storage system (i) Battery only (ii) Battery+ Supercapacitor (SC), where a low pass filter is used to allocate power between battery and SC. The most economical energy storage system is developed through extensive simulations in MATLAB/Simulink environment. The results show that the hybrid energy storage system (HESS), combination of battery and SC, outperforms a battery-only operation.
