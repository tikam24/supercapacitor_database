With the rapid development in portable and wearable electronics, it will be of great convenience if flexible supercapacitors can be easily mounted/disassembled from different substrates at our will, which will largely expand their application scenarios. Herein, inspired by a sticky note, a new family of flexible sticky-note supercapacitors with repeated adhesive performance has been developed by employing a novel kind of sticky aligned carbon nanotube array electrode. The sticky-note supercapacitor demonstrated high capacitance and can be easily and repeatedly attached onto various substrates including cloth, glass, paper, plastic and metal. For up to 200 attaching/removing cycles on different substrates, the capacitance of the supercapacitor note can be well maintained at above 99%.
