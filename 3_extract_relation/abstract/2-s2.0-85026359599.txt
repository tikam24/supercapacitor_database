A green and facile strategy is reported for the synthesis of a three-dimensional (3D) graphene nanosheets (GNS)/Ni(OH)2 composite for use as a supercapacitor material. During this process, graphene oxide was reduced to graphene and Ni(OH)2 was attached in it to form the GNS/Ni(OH)2 composite via a chemical precipitation route without any complicated procedures. The product was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The analyses indicated that the Ni(OH)2 sheets were well interwoven on the surfaces of the graphene nanosheets. Furthermore, the composite was electrochemically tested by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, specific capacitance, and by assessing its cycle life. The GNS/Ni(OH)2 composite exhibited a high specific supercapacitance of 2053 F g-1 at a current density of 0.3 A g-1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte and a long cycle life, along with 97% specific capacitance remaining after 1000 cycles. The GNS/Ni(OH)2 composite had superb electrochemical performance compared to bare Ni(OH)2, which could be attributed to its architecture. These results suggest that the GNS/Ni(OH)2 composite could have potential application as a supercapacitor material.
