This paper has two topics. The first one is development of novel electric vehicle (EV) powered only by "Electrical Double Layer Capacitor (EDLC)". The second one is normal force stabilizing (NFS) vehicle motion control using this experimental vehicle. The vehicle provides us useful experimental environment of EV's motion control, since EDLC power system can shorten charging time. Only 30 seconds-charging enables us 20 minutes driving experiments. The development of small EV and the vehicle control system are shown. Novel vehicle stabilizing control in rolling motion using differential torque is proposed. Normal force has strong connectivity with driving force and its sudden decrease causes tire slip, which makes the whole vehicle motion unstable. The simulation and experimental results are shown and the effectiveness of proposed method is discussed. Â© 2007 WEVA Journal.
