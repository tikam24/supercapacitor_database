In this paper, effect evaluation on Electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC) based energy storage system installed at Seibu Shinjuku Line in Japan has been carried out. Regenerative-braking energy contribution is improved by adjusting voltage setting of start-charging and start-discharging. Proportional relationship of charged energy and ambient temperature is observed which could be depending auxiliary energy consumption by air-conditioner.
