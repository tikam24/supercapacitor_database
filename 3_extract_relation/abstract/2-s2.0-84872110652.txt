Continuous, ultrastrong graphene fibers are achieved by wet-spinning of giant graphene oxide liquid crystals, followed by wet-drawing and ion-cross-linking. The giant size and regular alignment of graphene sheets render the fibers with high mechanical strength and good conductivity. Such graphene fibers promise wide applications in functional textiles, flexible and wearable sensors, and supercapacitor devices. Â© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
