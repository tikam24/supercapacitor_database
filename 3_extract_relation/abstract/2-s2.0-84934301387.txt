A novel supercapacitor module using input-series and output-series configuration of flyback converters is proposed in this paper. First, the working principles under charging and discharging process are analyzed. Second, the design pattern of the flyback converter and the control system of the module are discussed. The proposed control system uses one set of peak current control circuit to control all the flyback converters. Finally, simulation and experiment are introduced. It is proved that this novel module could use one set of DC/DC converters to control the voltage-balancing procedure during charging and the output voltage during discharging. The proposed technology is with the merits of simple structure, flexible expansibility and low cost.
