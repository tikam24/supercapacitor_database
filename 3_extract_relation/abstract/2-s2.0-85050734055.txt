Research and development on all-solid-state, flexible supercapacitors is the prime concern of the scientific community these days due to their various advantages including their easy transportability, miniaturization, and compactness in different appliances. We report the novel configuration of all-solid symmetrical supercapacitors employing free-standing, flexible films of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and its nanocomposite electrodes with graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), separated by ionic liquid (IL) (1-ethyl 3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate (EMITf))-based gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) films. The free-standing and flexible form of PEDOT:PSS/GNP nanocomposite films have been prepared via simple mixing of the two counterparts. Scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, Raman analysis, and thermal and mechanical characterizations have been performed to ascertain the suitability of pristine and nanocomposite PEDOT:PSS films as potential supercapacitor electrodes. The GPE film, comprising of a solution of NH4CF3SO3 (NH4-triflate or NH4Tf) in IL, entrapped in poly(vinylidine fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVdF-HFP), is a promising electrolyte due to its high ionic conductivity and sufficient electrochemical stability window. The supercapacitor with a PEDOT:PSS nanocomposite containing ∼3.8 wt.% of GNP has been found to give an optimum specific capacitance of ∼106 F g-1 (evaluated from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy), and specific energy and power of ∼6.95 Wh kg-1 and 2.58 kW kg-1, respectively (evaluated from galvanostatic charge-discharge). More importantly, the capacitors demonstrate stable performance for more than 2000 charge-discharge cycles, with only ∼10% initial fading in capacitance. Interestingly, the PEDOT:PSS/GNP nanocomposite-based solid-state supercapacitors with the IL-incorporated GPE have shown comparable (even better) performance than other reported PEDOT:PSS-based supercapacitors.
