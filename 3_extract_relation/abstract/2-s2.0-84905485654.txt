An influence of both porous and electron structure on the processes in an electric double layer (EDL) determining the main working parameters of carbon-based supercapacitors has been studied in order to improve them. The investigations involved impedance spectroscopy, X-ray small angle scattering, confocal micro-Raman spectroscopy, infra-red and Mössbauer spectroscopy. Fe2+- and Er2+-intercallative modifications of nanoporous carbon were performed. It was found that the modification process characteristics correlated with the structure parameters of the EDL. © 2014 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.
