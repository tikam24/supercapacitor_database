Bulk doping nickel–cobalt metal–organic framework (NiCo-MOF) nanosheet arrays were prepared by a one-pot hydrothermal method. The NiCo-MOF with Ni/Co molar ratio of 1:1 (NiCo-MOF-1:1) possessed a superior capacity of 151.9 mA h g–1 at 0.5 A g–1, and excellent high-rate property with only reduced 10.8% of the capacity as increasing the current density from 0.5 to 8 A g–1. The assembled hybrid supercapacitor with NiCo-MOF-1:1 as a positive material and activated carbon (AC) as a negative material, exhibited an optimal energy density of 28.6 W h kg–1 at a power density of 433.2 W kg–1, and relatively stable cycling capability after 5000 cycles. A larger exposed active area, lower transfer resistance and rapider ion diffusion induced by the crystal distortion and alteration of morphology and textural structure were primarily responsible for the enhanced electrochemical performance of NiCo-MOF-1:1 in contrast to the monometallic (Ni or Co) MOF.
