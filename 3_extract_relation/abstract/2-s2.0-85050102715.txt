Out of various sources of energy like fossil fuels, solar energy which can be utilized for various demands, electrical energy is most efficient and we convert these various forms of energy to electrical energy to meet our demands. For converting some forms of energy, some storage devices are required for storing energy. Out of all the storage devices, supercapacitor or ultracapacitor is an uprising technology because of its characteristics like fast charging and discharging capability, high power density ensuring long battery life along with it use is used. Ball milling is most commonly used method to reduce particle size of electrode materials. To increase effectiveness of ball milling, inclined ball milling method has been presented in this paper. Inclination and time of ball milling are varied and its effect on capacitance and energy density has been presented in this paper.
