Coconut shell activated carbon (AC) and apricot shell activated carbon (LAPC) were modified by liquid-phase oxidation method using concentrated nitric acid as oxidant, and then were made into the electrodes of supercapacitors in KOH electrolyte to study the influence of oxygen functional groups on the electrochemical performance of electrode material in alkaline electrolyte. The four modified samples were characterized by using N2 adsorption, X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The results showed that, with high concentration HNO2 treatment, the surface area and pore volume of the carbons decreased, while the surface oxygen content increased and the content of oxygen functional groups changed. Under 50 mA/g, after 100 times charge-discharge the specific capacitance of the oxides of AC and LAPC reached 193 F/g and 150 F/g respectively, which are both 30% higher than those of the original samples. According to the results of XPS, the increase of capacitance is mainly due to the increase of hydroxyl. Moreover, it was found that with the increase of current density, the decreasing amplitude of discharge capacitance of the modified carbon samples was much lower than that of unmodified samples.
