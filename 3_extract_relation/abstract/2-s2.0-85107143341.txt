The conducting polymer polyaniline (PANI) has been considered to be a promising pseudocapacitive electrode material for supercapacitors due to its high specific capacitance, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, the poor cycling stability of PANI during the charge–discharge processes limits its widespread practical application. Herein, a facile synthetic method is demonstrated for covalently grafting an aniline tetramer (TANI), the basic building block of PANI, onto 3D graphene networks via perfluorophenylazide coupling chemistry to create a hybrid electrode material for ultralong-life supercapacitors. The design, which substitutes long-chain PANI with short-chain TANI and introduces covalent linkages between TANI and 3D graphene, greatly enhances the charge–discharge cycling stability of PANI-based supercapacitors. The electrode material, as well as the fabricated symmetric all-solid-state supercapacitors, exhibit extraordinary long cycle life (>85% capacitance retention after 30 000 charge–discharge cycles). The capacitance can be further boosted through fast and reversible redox reactions on the electrode surface using a redox-active electrolyte while maintaining outstanding cycling stability (82% capacitance retention after 100 000 cycles for a symmetric all-solid-state device). While conducting polymers are known to be limited by their poor cycling stability, this work provides an effective strategy to achieve enhanced cycle life for conducting polymer-based energy storage devices.
