Polypyrrole (Ppy)-modified graphene oxide (GO) electrodes were synthesized for the first time in a choline chloride-phenol-based deep eutectic solvent at various temperatures via electrochemical methods without the addition of any inorganic or organic catalysts. The surface morphologies and structures of the modified films were assessed via scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction techniques. The electrochemical properties and stability of the modified electrodes were investigated via cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy at various temperatures and scan rates. The results showed that the specific capacitance of the nanocomposites decreased with increasing scan rate during cycling. Additionally, the specific capacitances of the pure Ppy and Ppy/GO films increased with increasing temperature of the electrolyte (monomer-free), attributed to the reduction in viscosity at elevated temperature. The specific capacitances at 5 mV s-1were found to be 1071.78 and 594.79 F g-1for Ppy/GO (20 wt %) at 50 and 25 Â°C, respectively. It was also observed that the resistance in the cell decreased with increasing electrolyte temperature. Ppy/GO at 50 mV s-1was found to have the highest capacitance retention of 85% after 2000 cycles, showing better cycling stability than the pure Ppy film. Herein, the incorporation of GO in the Ppy matrix led to improved specific capacitance and cyclic stability, suggesting that Ppy/GO could represent a promising electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
