Energy generation through the combination of renewable systems is becoming attractive and applied in various applications, principally for water pumping applications. This paper presents the development and real time implementation of a robust power control strategy for a Hybrid Power Generation System (HPGS). The studied system consists of a photovoltaic renewable energy source associated with a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) composed of batteries and supercapacitors to supply a PMDC motor unit for water pumping applications. The control objectives are, to enhance the existing control laws which are based on linear PI controller with others based on non-linear Super-Twisting Algorithm (STA) to regulate the output power of the hybrid system and to satisfy the total demand, on the other hand, to prolong the durability of batteries by maintaining their state of charge in safe margins in order to overcome the ageing problem. For this purpose, a Fuzzy Logic-based Power Management Strategy (FL-PMS) is developed to identify the appropriate mode of operation for the system. Numerical simulations in Matlab/Simulink are performed to prove the effectiveness of the proposed control to reduce chattering and overshoot rates under fluctuating load demand and climatic conditions, as well as the accuracy of the FL-PMS in balancing the power requirements of the batteries and supercapacitors to ensure an optimal energy distribution. Finally, a test bench of the entire HPGS has been implemented and its real-time performance is intended to validate the simulation analysis. The obtained results show that the proposed control and FL-PMS strategies can improve the overall behaviour of the system and ensures a well-guided energy exchange, resulting in batteries protection.
