In this article, heterostructures from graphene (G) and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) were used as electrode materials in a hybrid supercapacitor. A general and facile method for the preparation of a G/MoS2 hybrid supercapacitor has been developed. Using a slurry technique, the G/MoS2 hybrid supercapacitor electrode was fabricated and its electrochemical performances in aqueous solution were investigated. The electrocapacitive behaviors of the hybrids were systematically evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements. It was found that the maximum specific gravimetric capacitance of the obtained G/MoS2 hybrid with composition 60:40 is 48.58 F g−1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte. The results indicated that the G/MoS2 hybrid offers a good supercapacitive performance due to the synergistic effects of both graphene and MoS2, suggesting its potential in energy storage applications.
