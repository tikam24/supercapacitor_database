The greatest challenge for researchers is to develop an energy storage system that is sustainable, secure, long lasting and most importantly cost effective. Supercapacitors are considered to be an efficient energy storage device because of their high power density, fast charge-discharge, long cycling life and the environment friendly nature. Flexible solid-state supercapacitors are playing the role of pacesetters in energy storage devices in the last few decades owing to the increasing demand of portable and wearable electronics. Here a brief description of flexible supercapacitors, gel electrolytes and flexible electrode substrates has been summarized. In the next section there is a concise outline on innovative cell designs for flexible supercapacitors. Asymmetric supercapacitor is a special category of supercapacitor that makes use of two different active materials for anode and cathode that stores energy via two different storage mechanisms. This study includes an overview of anode and cathode materials that has been used in asymmetric supercapacitors. The challenging fact about asymmetric supercapacitors is to balance the mass of active materials between the electrodes and evaluating the electrochemical performance of the cell. Here is an insight into the massbalancing and performance evaluation in asymmetric supercapacitors.
