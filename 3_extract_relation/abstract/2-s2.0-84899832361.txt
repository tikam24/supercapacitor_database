A new ternary composite MnO2 nanosheet array/reduced graphene oxide/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (MnO 2/rGO/PEDOT:PSS) is prepared by a two-step process. Its potential application in supercapacitor electrode materials was evaluated. Electrochemical tests reveal that the MnO2/rGO/PEDOT-PSS material exhibits a high specific capacitance of 169.1 F g-1 at a current density of 0.2 A g-1, good rate capability with a capacitance of 28.3 F g-1 even at a high current density of 10 A g-1, as well as excellent cycle stability with capacitance retention of 66.2% at 2 A g -1 after 2000 cycles. Therefore, this ternary composite material may have great potential in supercapacitor electrode applications. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.
