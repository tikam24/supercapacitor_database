Five polyoxometalate-based compounds were synthesized under hydrothermal conditions, namely, {M2(DEP)2(H2O)6[H2(TeMo6O24)]} (M = Ni 1, Zn 2), {Co(DEP)2(H2O)2[H2(γ-Mo8O26)]}·11H2O (3), {Cu(DEP)[(H2β-Mo8O26)0.5]} (4), [Cu6(DTP)5(OH)2(H2O)6(PWVI10WV2O40)2] (5) (DEP = 3-[1,3,4]triazol-4-ylmethyl-benzylamine, DTP = 1,4-bis(1,3,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)-benzene). Isostructural compounds 1 and 2 are both based on Anderson anions, containing one-dimensional chain with adjacent anions linked by two [M(DEP)]2+ subunits. Compound 3 is based on the γ-Mo8 anion, in which adjacent one-dimensional chains are connected by hydrogen bonding interactions to form a supramolecular two-dimensional structure. In compound 4, the β-Mo8 anions are connected by [Cu2(DEP)2]2+ dimers to construct a chain. Two amino groups of two DEP ligands show abundant hydrogen bonding interactions with an Mo8 anion to form two supramolecular "caps". Compound 5 contains two kinds of Keggin anions. The coordinated anions are linked by tri-nuclear Cu clusters to form a two-dimensional layer. The dissociative PW12 anions are located between adjacent layers. The 1-, 3-, and 5-CPEs show good multifunctional electrocatalytic activities. Also, compounds 2, 3, and 4 modified glassy carbon electrodes (2-, 3-, and 4-GCE) have excellent properties of supercapacitor materials. In addition, compounds 1 to 5 have good photocatalytic activities, which can not only photocatalyze the degradation of organic dyes but also photocatalyze the reduction of Cr(vi). This journal is
