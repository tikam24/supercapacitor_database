Self-healable and flexible all-in-one self-powering smartsensing devices have recently attracted great attention. Herein, a flexible all-in-one solid-state electronic system of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel-based supercapacitors for self-powering ammonia smartsensors has been fabricated. Self-healing supercapacitors are prepared by integrating polypyrrole (PPy) and boron cross-linked PVA/KCl hydrogel as a sandwich configuration, exhibiting large specific capacitance of 244.81 mF cm−2 at 0.47 mA cm−2, and good charging/discharging stability of 2000 cycles, while ammonia sensors are realized by a SnO2/PPy-modified conductive PVA hydrogel film, demonstrating an excellent sensing behavior toward NH3 vapor under 50 ppb–500 ppm. As a result, self-healing supercapacitors could well store energy and then self-power sensing unit for remotely real-time detection via a smartphone, acquiring high flexibility of energy-sensing system. With attractive biocompatibility and self-healing performance toward various environment, this all-in-one flexible energy-smartsensor system would pave the way to novel fabrication process in realization of wearable self-healing smart devices.
