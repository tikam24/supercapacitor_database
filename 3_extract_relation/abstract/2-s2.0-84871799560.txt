Various NH4CoPO4·H2O nano/microstructures (oblong plate, microplate, microflower, hierarchical architectures) have been synthesized through a facile chemical precipitation method without surfactants and templates. More importantly, the supercapacitive performances of NH4CoPO4·H2O nano/microstructures were firstly studied using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy methods in 3.0 M KOH solution. These results indicated that NH 4CoPO4·H2O hierarchical architectures electrodes exhibit effective supercapacitive characteristics in aqueous KOH electrolyte. The specific capacitance of NH4CoPO4· H2O electrode is up to 369.4 F g-1 at a current density of 0.625 A g-1 and the material has a long cycle life which can maintain 99.7% of initial specific capacitance after 400 cycles. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
