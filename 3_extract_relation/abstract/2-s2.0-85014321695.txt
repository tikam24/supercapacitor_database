We use a nitrogen DC-pulse atmospheric-pressure plasma jet to fabricate a flexible reduced graphene oxide (rGO) supercapacitor with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/sulfuric acid (H2SO4) gel electrolyte. An areal capacitance of 47.03 mF · cm-2 (evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) under a potential scan rate of 2 mV ·s-1) is achieved. The supercapacitor can be operated without apparent degradation under bending with a bending radius of 0.55 cm. After a 1000 cycle CV stability test, the capacitance retention rate is 100% when flat and is 98.6% under bending (bending radius = 0.55 cm), indicating promising stability of the APPJ-processed flexible supercapacitor.
