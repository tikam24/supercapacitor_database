Nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon has been prepared via a direct carbonization of pyrrole modified biomass for using as electrochemical double layers capacitance electrodes materials. The hierarchical porous carbon features high specific area (2959 m2 g−1) and porosity, which originated from the etching, gasification and intercalation effect during heat treatment. Based on this unique porous structure, specific capacitance of 270 F g−1 at low current density of 0.1 A g−1 and 232 F g−1 at high current density of 10 A g−1 was obtained in 6 mol L-1 KOH electrolyte. Excellent cycles durability was obtained after initial charge/discharge, the high specific capacitance remained nearly unchanged for total 4000 cycles tested over a broad current density ranging from 0.1 to 10 A g-1. This study indicates that hierarchical porous carbon derived from pyrrole modified biomass is a promising electrode material for symmetric supercapacitors.
