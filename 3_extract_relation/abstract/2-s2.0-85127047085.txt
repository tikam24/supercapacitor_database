The graphene-based nanocomposites have recently attracted much attention in the fields of energy storage devices such as supercapacitor and battery, sensor, photo catalytic and optoelectronics applications. In this paper, graphene oxide (GO) is synthesized via a standard modified hummerâ€™s method, reduced graphene oxide and copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) reduction has been carried out by green chemistry using neem leaves broth. Study the optical, structural properties as well as the electrical response of GO, rGO, CuNPs and rGO-CuNPs. Synthesis of nanocomposite was accomplished by using eco-friendly solvents, cost-effective and without toxic chemicals.
