The homogeneous polyaniline–graphene oxide (PANI-GO) nanocomposites were facilely assembled with a redox system in which cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) and iron dichloride (FeCl2) acted as oxidant and reductant, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that PANI scales coated uniformly on the surface of GO sheets owing to the synergistic effect between the PANI and GO. The obtained PANI-GO nanocomposites exhibited improved electrochemical performance as an electrode material for supercapacitors compared with the pure PANI. The specific capacitance of the PANI-GO nanocomposites was high up to 308.3 F g−1, much higher than that of the pure PANI with specific capacitance of 150 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 in 2 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The Raman and XPS results illustrated that enhanced electrochemical performance might be attributed to the π-π conjugation between the PANI and GO sheets.
