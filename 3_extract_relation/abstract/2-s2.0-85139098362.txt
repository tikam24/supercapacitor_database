Developing high-performance anode materials is necessary for fabricating high-energy–density supercapacitors to conform to the fast-growing cathodes. In the present study, a thin-film electrode of Fe2O3/MnO2 deposited on TiO2 was synthesized using the facile controllable electrodeposition of MnO2 and Fe2O3 on TiO2 supported on stainless steel (SS) substrate for a high energy density hybrid supercapacitor. The composite deposited on TiO2 was electrochemically characterized. The materials were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The TiO2/Fe2O3/MnO2 electrode showed significantly enhanced cycling stability and improved a real capacitance of 173.91 Fg−1 at 10 mV indicating that the trijunction electrode material has a high electrochemical property owing to its large surface area, porous structure, and low resistance to charge transfer. It also exhibits capacitive in 1 M KOH electrolyte, demonstrating a promising electrode material for high energy density hybrid electrochemical supercapacitors.
