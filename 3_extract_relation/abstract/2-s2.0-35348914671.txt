Because of their appropriate characteristics (huge capacitance, weak serial resistance), of direct storage (energy ready for use) and of easy control through the power electronic conversion, the use of supercapacitors as a storage element is quite suitable to the embarked electrical energy management. This new supercapacitive device of storage having high dynamic performances offers the possibility of the peak load shaving but also the compensation of the intrinsic limitations especially when it is joined to a main sources as an auxiliary power unit as for example its combination with fuel cell devices. This paper deals with the conception of an embarked power source using supercapacitors which are charged by means of the combination of a photovoltaic source and an aerogenerator. These supercapacitors ensure the power supply of a miniature train of 150W of power. The design of this device, its control strategy and the obtained simulation with some experimental results are presented. Â© 2007 IEEE.
