This study aims to the modeling and simulation of a production hybrid source. This source comprises a photovoltaic generator (PV), an alkaline water electrolyzer (ELZ), a storage gas tank, a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), a Super-capacitor bank (SC) and power conditioning unit (PCU) to give different system topologies. Electricity is generated by a PV generator to meet the requirements of a user load. An alkaline high pressure water electrolyzer is powered by the excess energy from the PV generator to produce hydrogen. A proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is used to keep the system's reliability by working as auxiliary generator when the PV generator energy is deficient. SC bank is used to satisfy the fast load transients and smooth ripples. Power conditioning unit is appropriate for the conversion. To ensure harmony between different components, a power strategy based on PI controllers is used. Besides, detailed numerical scaled simulations are considered to test the performance of the production unit. This accurate analysis may be helpful for evaluating the viability of grid-independent renewable energy systems for remote area. Â© 2012 IEEE.
