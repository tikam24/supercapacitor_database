A hierarchically porous carbonmircrosphere material was prepared by direct carbonization of metal biological macromolecular complex precursor, which was supramolecular self-assembledby zinc(Zn) ions coordinated to ellagic acid(EA). The microstructure and electrochemical properties of as-obtained carbon microspheres were studied by means of TG, FTIR, Raman, XRD, SEM, TEM and electrochemical test. The results show that carbonization temperature plays an important role in determining the structure, specific surface area and electrochemical performance of the carbon microsphere electrode materials. Carbonization at 1000â„ƒ under nitrogen produced a micro-mesoporous carbonaceous microsphere material exhibiting lamellar graphene-like structure and high specific surface area of 1238 m2/g, and achieves a specific capacitance of 216 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV/s in 6 mol/L KOH electrolyte. When the scan rate increased from 5 mV/s to 100 mV/s, the specific capacitor remained 84.67%. Moreover, the porous carbon shows less than 3% decay in specific capacitance values over 5000 cycles at a current density of 1 A/g. The porous carbon microsphere material has excellent electrochemical performance as an electrode material for supercapacitor.
