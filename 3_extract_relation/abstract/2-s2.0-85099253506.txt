Considering the connected function, high conductivity and electrochemical double layer capacitance properties of reduced graphene oxide (RGO), the NiMoS4 nanosheets were anchored on RGO coated Ni foam by a facile hydrothermal method to obtain the NiMoS4@RGO/Ni foam self-supporting electrode without the extra binders. Surprisingly, the prepared NiMoS4@RGO/Ni foam with unique hierarchical lamellar structure can exhibit the high specific capacity of 408 mAh/g at 0.5 A/g, which can be compared with all relevant NiMoS4 reports. In view of the good supercapacitor performances and practical application feasibility of NiMoS4@RGO/Ni foam, the NiMoS4@RGO/Ni foam//AC hybrid supercapacitor device also can show the comparable energy density of 67.4 Wh/kg at 562.5 W/kg to that of all NiMoS4 based hybrid supercapacitors, as well as the good cycle stability. This work can indeed improve the supercapcaitor properties of NiMoS4 based materials, and be also treated as an important attempt of NiMoS4 based materials for supercapacitors.
