Flexible micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) as power suppliers are important for portable and wearable electronic devices. Despite enormous efforts made, a simple, inexpensive high-throughput technique of graphene-based MSCs is still challenging. In this work, flexible MSCs are fabricated through commercial laser printing of the interdigital configuration of reduced graphene oxide-graphene oxide-reduced graphene oxide (rGO-GO-rGO) where the conductive rGO works as the electrode and the insulated GO serves as the separator. We demonstrate that the as-fabricated MSC devices show high-energy storage capacities, good cyclic stability and remarkable flexibility. The relationship between the geometric parameters (integration level and coverage fraction) and the capacitive performance of the MSCs is studied systematically to build better theoretical guidance for the design of future in-plane MSCs.
