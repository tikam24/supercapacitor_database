Free-floating, and copper-supported, few-layer graphene sheets were spontaneously modified from an aqueous solution containing nitrobenzenediazonium ions. The infrared spectra of the chemically modified (copper etched) free-floating graphene were measured in transmission mode by manipulating the sheets onto a KBr disc. The major advantage to this method is the ability to release the graphene sheets off the disc to refloat on a water bath, allowing the graphene to be further modified or deposited onto a new substrate suitable for other analysis. In this study, graphene sheets were then mounted onto highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) for atomic force microscopy imaging and electrochemical measurements. The results show there are at least two reaction pathways for spontaneous film grafting to graphene: the commonly accepted aryl radical leading to films containing -C-C- linkages and a direct reaction of the diazonium cation with graphene to give films containing -N=N- linkages. The ability to manipulate modified graphene sheets onto electrodes with two orientations, with the film exposed to electrolyte solution or sandwiched between graphene and HOPG, leads to different estimates of the surface concentration of electroactive groups. When the film is sandwiched between graphene and HOPG, two electroreduction signals for the nitro group are seen and much larger surface concentrations are measured. This is the first account of such a signal and is tentatively attributed to different peak potentials for reduction of nitro groups at graphene and HOPG. The solution permeability through the graphene sheet and attached films has important electrochemical consequences for systems of this type employed in supercapacitor applications.
