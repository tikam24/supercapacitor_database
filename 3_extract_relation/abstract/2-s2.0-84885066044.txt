The main objective of this work is to synthesize polyaniline/ferric chloride composite and to measure the conductivity of the as prepared composite. And also, to analyze the ability of using Ferric Chloride doped polyaniline as an electrode material for the fabrication of supercapacitor application. By in-situ polymerization method, polyaniline in pure form and doped form with the ferric chloride were synthesized using ammonium persulfate as initiator in HCl medium. Polyaniline nanoparticles and its composite are characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, FTIR, XRD and Conductivity meter. Â© (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
