The development of high-performance micro-supercapacitors is conducive to the growth of modern micro-electronic systems. However, it is still a great challenge to fabricate micro-supercapacitors with high output potential/current for integration. Here we demonstrate the whole fabrication of planar on-chip micro-supercapacitors (POMSs) based on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) films, produced by photolithography techniques, with whole series/parallel configuration. The RGO films have good surface morphologies, uniform thickness (6 ± 1.073 nm) and high conductivity (649.8 S cm−1) after hydroiodic acid treatment. Moreover, the operating potential of the RGO-POMS with whole series configuration has been obviously improved, which is two times that of a interdigital unit. The RGO-POMS with whole parallel configuration has larger current and better electrochemical performance than a single unit. Therefore, POMSs with whole series/parallel configuration have a good application foreground in the continuous development of integrated micro-devices.
