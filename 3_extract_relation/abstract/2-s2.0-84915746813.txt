Cellulose-based carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with high mechanical strength and electrochemical stability were nitrogen-doped and functionalized with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) via two different methods. The diameter of incorporated CNTs was in the range of 1-20 nm. The doping with nitrogen atoms and incorporation of CNTs into the CNFs improved conductivity, while CNTs also increased surface area of the produced material. As a result, the composite materials with capacitance values up to 241 F/g were obtained.
