In this paper, porous Fe–CeO2 with abundant oxygen vacancies was prepared by calcination of hexagonal bipyramidal prussian blue analogue (CeFe-PBA), and then CeO2@NiFe-LDH composite was synthesized by hydrothermal method. The morphology of the composite remain roughly cubic and biconical. The loading of LDH makes the surface of the cube grow abundant nanosheets. The synergistic effect of porous materials and nanosheets can improve the properties of the composites. The specific capacitance of the material is 516.524 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. At the same time, the capacitance retention can reach 83.442% after 5000 cycles. In particular, asymmetric supercapacitors (ASC) of CeO2@NiFe-LDH//AC have outstanding energy density (21.167 Wh kg−1) and high power density (7500 W kg−1).
