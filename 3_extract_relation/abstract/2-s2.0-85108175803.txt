A novel MoO3, MoO3/GO, and MoO3/GO/MnO2 ternary nanocomposites have been prepared by hydrothermal technique. The samples are characterized to identify the various performances such as structural, morphological, elemental, and surface area analysis. XRD data reveals that the MoO3 nanoparticles show orthorhombic crystal structures and their miller indices are in good agreement with the standard value (0 2 0), (1 1 0), (0 4 0), and (0 2 1) crystalline planes of MoO3. SEM images show the formation of stacked graphene oxide (GO) and spherical nanocrystallites. The presence of molybdenum (Mo), manganese (Mn), and oxide (O) are confirmed from the EDS spectrum. BET result exposing high surface area with more active sites for redox process of the materials, which giving rise to a better catalytic activity. Electrochemical performances of MoO3/GO/MnO2 ternary nanocomposite exhibited a tiny area of hysteresis, clearly revealing the enhanced specific capacitance of the material. The calculated specific capacitance value is 89.5 F gâˆ’1. Thus, the prepared ternary nanocomposites give a gateway for new potential industrial applications.
