Aiming to explore the capacitance fading mechanism of the conductive polyaniline (PANI) in supercapacitors, we prepared the PANI film on stainless steel mesh substrate via electropolymerization method. The results reveal that the specific capacitance of PANI film reaches 75.9% and 55.5% retention after 500 and 2000 cycles under 2 A gâˆ’1, respectively. The surface morphology, chemical structure, and element content change of PANI film are observed after subjecting to the subsequent certain charge/discharge cycles. As a consequence, we identify the fading mechanism of the capacitance performance of PANI material, which includes the structure evolution and partial degradation. The morphological regularity of polyaniline film gradually deteriorates from the volume expansion/shrinkage in continuous doping/undoping process, accompanying with the increase of surface sulfur element content and decline of C/O output ratio. Besides, the hydrolysis oxidation decomposes the polymer chains, weakening the conjugation interaction between molecular chains and resulting in the partial degradation into the electrolyte. The study provides a comprehensive understanding and strong evidence of the structure evolution, supporting a better design of the conductive PANI electrode materials.
