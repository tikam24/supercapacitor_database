Ni foam can be directly used as supercapacitor electrode after chemical or electrochemical treatments. However, most of the treatments required relatively stringent reaction conditions. In this work, a facile CV activation method was adopted for the anodization of Ni foam. The fresh Ni hydroxide formed on the surface showed good capacitive performance. CV activation method also revealed great potential in improving the performance of oxide/Ni foam electrode. By CV cycle at 0â€“0.8 V, the MnCo2O4.5/Ni foam electrode showed a seven-fold increase of capacitance, and the rate performance of the electrode was significantly improved. The application of activation strategy to boost the capacitive performance of electrode based on Ni foam would have a wide significance in the development of high-performance electrode for energy storage.
