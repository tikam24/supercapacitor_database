Herein, we report an electrochemical property of giant dielectric quaternary oxide CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO) nanocubes. Single crystalline nanostructures of CCTO are synthesized by simple molten salt method. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), High resolution transmission electron microscopic (HRTEM) techniques are used to study the structural and morphological properties. XRD and HRTEM analysis confirm the formation of phase pure and single crystalline CCTO nanocubes. Detailed electrochemical performance of as synthesized samples has been carried out by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. Electrochemical properties of three different CCTO nanstructure synthesized at 800 °C for three different holding time (30 min, 1 h and 5 h) has been compared. CCTO nanocube electrodes provide maximum areal capacitance of 1185 mF cm−2 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in aqueous KOH solution. An all-solid-state symmetric device has been fabricated by using CCTO nanocubes. The device delivers maximum areal capacitance 76 mF cm−2 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Furthermore, the electrodes exhibit an excellent cycling stability with 94.8% capacitance retention even after 3000 cycles of charging discharging at a current density 10 mA cm−2. The present investigation explores possible use of single crystalline CCTO nanocubes as next generation supercapacitor material having a double perovskite structure.
