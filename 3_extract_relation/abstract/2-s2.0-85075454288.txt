The present manuscript deals with one photosynthesis of cobalt molybdate for multifunctional application as supercapacitor and photo catalyst. The cobalt molybdate is synthesized by various concentration of urea as precursor. Nanostructured transition metal has been synthesized by hydrothermal method from spent catalyst leach liquor. Different physico-chemical characterization techniques are obtained to illustrate the nanomaterials followed by X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm for surface area analysis. Nanorod cobalt molybdate is proved as efficient photocatalyst for Rhodamine B dye under visible light irradiation, which possess a high degradation rate of 98% after 15 min. Electrochemically active cobalt molybdate shows high specific capacitance value of maximum specific capacitance of 175.34 F g-1at three-electrode system and 74.2 F g−1at two-electrode system. It also revealed excellent rate capability and superior cycling stability with long cycle life (92.7% retention in specific capacitance after 5000 cycles) along with high energy and power densities.
