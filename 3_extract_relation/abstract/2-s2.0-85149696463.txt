The role of electrode materials is crucial for determining the energy storage capacity of supercapacitors. The use of active nanostructures fabricated on conducting substrates to achieve good conductivity and high surface area augments the energy storage ability of supercapacitors. The fabrication techniques for the assimilation of hierarchical nanostructures on a large electrode surface area without using binders are expected to enhance the energy and power densities of supercapacitors. The fabrication techniques should be simple, scalable, and of low-cost. In this work, a simple process for developing high-surface morphological nickel sulfide (NiS) nanostructures on commercial nickel foam at ambient temperature is developed. Further, these electrodes are used in the fabrication of supercapacitors. The surface morphological and electrochemical studies have demonstrated high energy density values of 27.58 Wh/kg and ultralong stability of 97 % even after 5000 cycles. Moreover, the fabricated electrode material exhibited properties such as quicker electron and ion transfer, a larger surface area, and superior structural integrity. The galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) study of the fabricated device has shown a high specific capacitance of 613 F/g. Such electrodes exhibit their suitability in supercapacitors for enhanced energy storage applications.
