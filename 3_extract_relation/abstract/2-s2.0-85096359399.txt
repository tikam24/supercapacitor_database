An electron donor-acceptor covalent organic framework (TTF-COF1) was constructed by the imine condensation of electron donor tetraformyl-tetrathiafulvalene (TTF-fo) and electron acceptor 2,6-diaminoanthraquinone (DAQ). TTF-COF1 has intramolecular charge transfer, offering capacitance of 752 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and an energy density of 57 W h kg-1 at a power density of 858 W kg-1. This journal is
