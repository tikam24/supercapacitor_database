Supercapacitors are considered reliable devices for energy storage. However, supercapacitor has some limitations, such as relatively low capacitance and low energy density, which affect it as a promising energy storage device. In this context, carbon based nanocomposites have been widely studied in the past few years due to their excellent physical, mechanical and electrical properties. A lot of studies have been reported on carbon based materials with different 0D, 1D, 2D and 3D carbon nanostructures. The unique combination of pseudo-material with carbon material greatly improves the electrochemical performance of the composite as compared to individual candidate. However, developing high energy density supercapacitor devices with high cycling stability in a simple and cost effective way is still a challenge. This review provides the current progress on the carbon based pseudo-material composites for supercapacitor application in a well-systematic and easy manner which can guide the early researchers and emerging scientists dealing with or interested in supercapacitor.
