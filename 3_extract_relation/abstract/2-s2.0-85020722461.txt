In this paper, two different charging methods were discussed and experimental test using potentiostat were done. Self-discharge behavior were observed in each test applications in an open circuit for 24 hours. Supercapacitors were charge in a constant-current (CC) and constant-current, constant-voltage (CCCV) and both discharge in an open circuit (OC). Equivalent series resistance (ESR) and leakage current were extracted. Finally, a proposed mathematical formula to compute the self-discharge time of supercapacitor was presented. A two commercial supercapacitors with 4.7F and 3.3F capacitance and 2.5V were set-up in potentiostat using two-electrode mode.
