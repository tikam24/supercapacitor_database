The activated carbon without addition of adhesive materials from banana stem fibers has been successfully synthesized by using ZnCl2activator as a supercapacitor electrode. The physical properties analysis such as density, surface morphology, degree of crystallinity, elemental content, and specific surface area of the activated carbon electrode were carried out by using measurements of mass and volume, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and Brunaeur-Emmet-Teller (BET). The carbon electrode has a density of 0.63 g.cm-3, surface morphology consists of carbon particles and carbon fiber, amorphous structures seen in scattering (2?) angle range of 23.59° and 44.41° for d002and d100diffraction planes, carbon content reaches as high as 100% and the specific surface area was found 788.09 m2.g-1. The electrochemical properties were analyzed by using cyclic voltammetry method with two electrodes system in H2SO4electrolyte solution. The specific capacitance, energy density, and power density of the supercapacitor cells were 179F.g-1, 6.19 W.h.Kg-1, and 44.67 W.Kg-1respectively. This study exhibits that banana stem fibers potentially to be developed as carbon electrodes in supercapacitor cell.
