In this study, we report the hierarchically nanoporous activated carbons syntheses from most abundant bio-weed source of Ipomoea carnea stems by nickel foam template assisted with chemical and thermal activation method. The mixture of ferric chloride and diethyl ether of the activating agent and the impregnation ratios are investigated under constant temperature at 800 Â°C for 2 h. The effective novel synthesized scheme and hierarchical nanoporous carbon structure with large specific surface areas of 1264.9 m2 g-1 and mean pore diameter of 2.1628 nm. The electrochemical performance of prepared nanoporous structured carbon electrode is studied in non-aqueous (TEABF4) electrolyte, which exhibits high specific capacitance of 257 Fg-1 maximum energy density of 61.46 Wh kg-1 and power density of 13.32 kW kg-1 at 1 Ag-1 with remarkable capacity retention of 90 % for 10000 cycles. Therefore the present results show the suitability of synthesized material for use in energy storage applications. The representing promising application as a green route to synthesis advance nanoporous carbon materials from Ipomoea carnea biomass for high-capacity supercapaciors.
