The possible practical limits for the specific surface area and capacitance performance of bulk sp2 carbon materials were investigated experimentally and theoretically using a variety of carbon materials. We find the limit for the specific surface area to be 3500-3700 m2 g-1, and based on this, the corresponding best capacitance was predicted for various electrolyte systems. A model using an effective ionic diameter for the electrolyte ions was proposed and used to calculate the theoretical capacitance. A linear dependence of experimental capacitance versus effective specific surface area of various sp2 carbon materials was obtained for all studied ionic liquid, organic and aqueous electrolyte systems. Furthermore, excellent agreement between the theoretical and experimental capacitance was observed for all the tested sp2 carbon materials in these electrolyte systems, indicating that this model can be applied widely in the evaluation of various carbon materials for supercapacitors.
