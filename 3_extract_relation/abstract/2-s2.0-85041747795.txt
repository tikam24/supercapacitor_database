Composites of ion and electron conducting phases allow for interfacial storage of a neutral component via space charge effects. The present contribution considers the rate of transport-controlled incorporation and excorporation in such artificial mixed conductors. The upper limit of the relaxation time is determined by interfacial job-sharing diffusion which is analyzed in greater detail. In general cases bulk phases assist by migration processes (dual phase transport). For more complex morphological situations, the considerations are complemented by numerical calculations. Thus the treatment also offers a pertinent approach with respect to the kinetics of solid state supercapacitors. Selected experimental results are included in the discussion.
