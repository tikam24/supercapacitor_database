Ternary Ni-Co-Mo oxy-hydroxide nanoflakes grown on carbon cloth was successfully fabricated based on a facile hydrothermal method. This composite product consists of three components: Ni-Co double hydroxide and Mo oxide. As a novel electrode material for pseudocapacitors, the Ni-Co-Mo oxy-hydroxide nanoflakes on carbon cloth exhibit excellent electrochemical properties, with a specific capacitance of 2562 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, and a good cycling stability. The excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to the large specific surface area and the enhanced conductivity achieved through incorporating of Mo. By virtue of simple fabrication procedures and enhanced electrochemical performance, such ternary oxy-hydroxide nanoflakes have highly promising potential for energy storage devices.
