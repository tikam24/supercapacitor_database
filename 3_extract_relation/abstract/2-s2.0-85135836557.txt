In this paper, using titanium carbide, nickel chloride hexahydrate, cobalt chloride hexahydrate and thiosemicarbazide as raw materials, a kind of electrode material for supercapacitor was prepared by hydrothermal method. The composition and microstructure of the composite material were analyzed by XRD and SEM, and the electrochemical performance of the material was tested by electrochemical workstation. It includes cyclic voltammetry curve, constant current charge-discharge curve and impedance test. The electrochemical test results show that the specific capacitance of the prepared TiO2-NiCo2S4-Ti3C2 electrode can reach 1527.5 F/g at the scanning rate of 5 mV/s, which is higher than that of the contrast Ti3C2, TiO2-Ti3C2 and NiCo2S4-Ti3C2 electrode materials.
