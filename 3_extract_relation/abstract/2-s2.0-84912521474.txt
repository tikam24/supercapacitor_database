Herein we present a green and facile approach to the successful reduction of graphene oxide (GO) materials using molten halide flux at 370Â°C. GO materials have been synthesized using a modified Hummers method and subsequently reduced for periods of up to 8 h. Reduced GO (rGO) flakes have been characterized using X-ray-diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), all indicating a significantly reduced amount of oxygen-containing functionalities on the rGO materials. Furthermore, impressive electrical conductivities and electrochemical capacitances have been measured for the rGO flakes, which, along with the morphology determined from scanning electron microscopy, highlight the role of surface corrugation in these rGO materials.
