The polyaniline(PANI) nanoparticles were synthesized with alcohol solvent at first. The microstructure of PANI nanoparticles were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transfer infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The electrochemical performances of the samples were tested. The results showed that the diameters of PANI nanoparticles were 50-200nm. As the supercapacitor materials, PANI nanoparticles were suitable for the green energy materials. Â© (2010) Trans Tech Publications.
