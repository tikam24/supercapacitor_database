Among hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs), battery-ultracapacitor systems in active topology use DC/DC power converters for their operations. HESSs are part of the solutions designed to improve the operation of power systems in different applications. In the residential microgrid applications, a multilevel control system is required to manage the available energy and interactions among the microgrid components. For this purpose, a rule-based power management system is designed, whose operation is validated in the simulation, and the performances of different controllers are compared to select the best strategy for the DC/DC converters. The average current control with internal model control and real-time frequency de-coupling is proposed as the most suitable controller according to the contemplated performance parameters, allowing voltage regulation values close to 1%. The results are validated using real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HIL). These systems can be easily adjusted for other applications such as electric vehicles.
