Among the various Mn compounds, both MnO2 and Mn(OH)2 are electrochemically active in supercapacitor studies. MnO2 and Mn (OH) 2 are simultaneously deposited, through a one-pot method, on the anode and cathode, respectively, of a galvanostatic electrolysis cell consisting of aqueous Mn (NO3) 2 electrolyte. MnO2 and Mn(OH)2 coated stainless steel (SS) electrodes are found to exhibit a capacitive behavior with a high specific capacitance. MnO2 /SS and Mn(OH)2 /SS electrodes are used as the negative and positive electrodes, respectively, in assembling nonsymmetrical capacitors and testing. The results indicate that both Mn-based electrodes prepared simultaneously in a single electrolysis possess interesting electrochemical properties for supercapacitor application.
