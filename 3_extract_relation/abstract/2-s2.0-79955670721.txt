Supercapacitors based on two ideally polarizable microporous carbide-derived carbon electrodes and different mesoporous electrospun and commercially available separators in acetonitrile as the solvent for the 1.0 M (C2H5)3CH3NBF4 electrolyte have been completed and tested by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance methods. The limits of ideal polarizability, low-frequency limiting capacitance and series resistance, time constant, complex power components and other characteristics have been established. Influence of the separator chemical composition, thickness, density, specific surface area, total pore volume and pore size distribution on the slope of the cyclic voltammetry curves at higher potential scan rates ν ≥ 10 mV s-1 has been established explained by the different specific conductivity of ions in mesoporous separator. ©The Electrochemical Society.
