High energy density storage device exhibiting a reliable lifecycle is needed in the 21st century. Hence, energy storage research is critical for reducing energy consumption. Supercapacitors exhibit such characteristics via interfacial ion electrosorption and fast redox reactions. They are a feasible solution for transportation applications, among others, due to their superb characteristics. In this paper, we provide a background on supercapacitors, review public data on commercially available supercapacitors for performance characteristics, and finally summarize their performance in terms of energy density, equivalent series resistance, and device time consistency.
