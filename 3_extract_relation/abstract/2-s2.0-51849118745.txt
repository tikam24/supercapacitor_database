Energy storage is an important issue in today's technology development and also a key for using alternative energy sources. Thus, a great responsibility lies with the Universities who educate researchers and scientists for the future. Every young scientist or electrical engineer should have at least a basic knowledge of modern energy storage technologies. An innovative teaching topic of ultracapacitors was worked out at Tallinn University of Technology. This paper explains the idea behind the topic and describes the structure of the teaching topic. Finally, a sample laboratory work is presented. Â©2008 IEEE.
