It is now clear that growing flat graphene nanostructures from the gas phase on planar substrates is possible. One of the keys to success —particularly in producing a very large specific surface in a reduced space— is the use of 3D carbon nanostructures (i.e., vertical graphene nanowalls, VGNWs) over a planar substrate as a growth template for the deposition of electrochemically active materials (as, for example, transition metal oxides (TMO)). Vertical graphene nanowalls, also known as petal-like, vertical graphene flakes or vertical graphene, can achieve a very large specific surface area of 1100 m2/g, which is comparable to or greater than that of carbon nanotubes —the reference material for its use in high-performance supercapacitors or in other energy-related applications requiring a large active surface area. Vertical graphene nanowalls also exhibit high vertical and in-plane electrical conductivity when grown on metal electrodes, which benefits their use in electrochemical applications. Here, we focus on the growth of VGNWs on flexible stainless-steel substrates (SS310), in principle suitable for applications to electrodes of electrochemical systems (batteries, supercapacitors, catalysts), by inductively coupled plasma chemical vapour deposition (ICP-CVD), from methane as a carbon precursor, in a wide range of temperatures (575 to 900 °C). We will discuss the effect of growth temperature on morphological and structural characteristics of VGNWs based on the results of Raman spectroscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) analysis. Because the nanostructures of graphene nanowalls reported to date are, for the most part, based on multi-layered graphene, here we seek to highlight the effect of temperature on the number of atomic layers of VGNW. In the 700–750 °C range, and under the plasma conditions explored, vertical graphene nanowalls are bilayer, which is foreseen to directly affect the magnitude of the VGNW specific surface.
