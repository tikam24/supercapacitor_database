In this study, in-situ decoration of a binder-free pseudocapacitive NiCo2S4 and NiCo2S4/MWCNTs hybrid electrode has been synthesized via a wet chemical synthesis route on Ni foam. The hybrid electrodes of bimetallic metal sulfides were investigated using the X-ray diffraction technique and scanning electron microscopy. The electrochemical technique was used to investigate the electrochemical properties of the synthesized bimetallic metal sulfide materials. The good galvanostatic discharge time of 1077 s, the areal capacitance of 5.38 F/cm2, and specific capacitance of 2210 F/g were observed for NiCo2S4/MWCNTs hybrid electrode materials, respectively at 3 mA/cm2. The results show that the addition of highly conductive, MWCNTs, and the synergic effects of bimetallic sulfides (Ni, Co) greatly contribute to the excellent electrochemical properties, making the NiCo2S4/MWCNTs hybrid electrode as a potential material for supercapacitor applications.
