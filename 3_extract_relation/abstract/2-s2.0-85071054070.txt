The microporous carbons samples were obtained on the base of plant feedstock using different modes of carbonization and chemical activation. The effect of N-doped microporous carbon synthesis condition on its morphological properties was investigated by low temperature nitrogen adsorption/desorption and scanning electron microscopy. The impedance spectroscopy measurements performed in 6 M KOH solution allow calculating the carrier concentration and flat band potential of the obtained carbons. Comparative characterization of synthesized carbon materials properties reveals that the sample obtained at weight ratio between activation agent (NaOH) and carbon equals to 0.75 under the condition of double activation procedure has the best preconditions (high value of carrier concentration and flat band potential) for good electrochemical performance.
