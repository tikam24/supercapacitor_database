Nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NPC) for high-performance supercapacitors has been synthesized from oily sludge waste by using KOH activation combined with in situ nitrogen doping method. The NPC possesses a hierarchical porous structure with high surface area of 2514.7m2g-1, large pore volume of 2.383cm3 g-1 and nitrogen content of 4.32%. The NPC-based electrode can deliver an outstanding capacitance of 414.2Fg-1 at 0.5Ag-1 and a good capacitance rate performance of 307.5Fg-1 (74.2% retention) at 50Ag-1. Moreover, the NPC exhibits an excellent cycling stability with little loss of capacitance after 5000 cycles at 5Ag-1.
