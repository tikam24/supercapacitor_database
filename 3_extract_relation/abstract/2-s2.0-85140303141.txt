Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the traditional material for polyester food packaging, is difficult to degrade. Taking PET-like plastics as carbon source, this study fabricates cobalt oxide (Co3O4)/carbon composites with flake structure through carbonization and solvothermal synthesis, which can serve as a useful supercapacitor electrode. Then, the electrochemical properties of samples were investigated under different heating time of solvothermal synthesis. Experiments show that the heating time of solvothermal synthesis had a certain impact on the electrical capacity and charging/discharging performance of the composites. Among the samples, SL-8 stands out with an electrical capacity of 110.8 F gâˆ’1, the retention reached 88.82% after 2000 cycles. This composite offers a promising electrode material for supercapacitors, and sheds new lights on solving white pollution.
