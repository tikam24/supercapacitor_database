In this paper, a simple yet effective chemical activation/carbonization strategy is presented to prepare a hierarchically porous activated carbon with multi-heteroatom (O, N, and P) self-doping using waste soybean pods as carbon source. It is found that the resulting carbon activated by KOH possesses richer textural properties than the one activated by ZnCl2. With abundant micro-, mesopores and interconnected macropores, the KOH-activating carbon possesses a specific surface area up to 2245 m2 g−1 and a large pore volume of 1.35 cm3 g−1. In a three-electrode system, the KOH-activating carbon can deliver a high specific capacitance of 321.1 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. It still can maintain 215.7 F g−1 at a current density of 10 A g−1 with a good rate capacity (67.2% retention). When used as symmetric electrode in 1 M Na2SO4 neutral aqueous solution, the SPAC−K//SPAC−K supercapacitor can provide a high energy density up to 22.28 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 450 W kg−1 in a wide voltage window of 0–2.0 V, surpassing most of the previously reported waste biomass-based carbon materials. The impressive electrochemical performances as well as the low-cost scalable production manifest that the SPAC−K derived from waste soybean pods can be a promising electrode candidate for supercapacitor application.
