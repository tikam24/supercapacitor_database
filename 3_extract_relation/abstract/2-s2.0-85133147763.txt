Three-dimensional (3D) graphene foams (GF) with high electrical conductivity, large surface area, and excellent mechanical flexibility have attracted a tremendous amount of research interest especially in the energy-related areas. In this chapter, the main fabrication methods and properties of GF are presented. The emerging applications of GF in energy storage devices like secondary batteries (metal-ion, metal-sulfur, metal-air batteries) and supercapacitors are summarized. Finally, the perspective for the challenges and opportunities of 3D GF in energy devices will be discussed.
