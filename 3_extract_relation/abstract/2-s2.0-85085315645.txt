A magnetic visible light active CoFe2O4 nano photocatalyst was prepared by co-precipitation technique and its catalytic performance was evaluated by discoloration of methyl violet (MV) dye. The optical, magnetic, and morphological properties of the annealed CoFe2O4 photocatalyst were characterized by UV–Vis, VSM, FE-SEM, EDX, TEM, and FT-IR spectroscopic techniques. Further, the calcined CoFe2O4 nanoparticles were used as heterogeneous catalyst in H2O2 assisted discoloration of MV dye under visible light irradiation, in which 71% color removal was achieved within 120 min. The photodiscoloration of aqueous solution of MV dye was found to follow pseudo-first order kinetics. The supercapacitor measurements were also accomplished in 1 M aqueous KOH electrolyte for the sample CoFe2O4 NP’s calcined at 350 °C. The as-prepared CoFe2O4 electrode displayed significantly improved specific capacity value (1233 F/g at the scan rate of 5 mVs−1). In addition, capacity retention of CoFe2O4was found to be with 90% upto 5000 GCD cycles. Thus, the magnetic CoFe2O4 NP’s were demonstrated as an efficient photocatalyst as well as suitable electrode material for energy storage application.
