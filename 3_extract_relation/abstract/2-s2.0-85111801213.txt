Composites of metal oxide with carbonaceous materials have attracted researchers due to their high energy density and high power density. A series of tin (Sn) incorporated nickel oxide/carbon nanotube (NiO/CNT) composites are prepared by simple microwave irradiation. The chemical composition of prepared composites is analysed using various analytical techniques such as powder x-ray diffraction, micro-Raman spectroscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Surface morphological studies of the composites revealed that the prepared composite has a uniform mixture of NiO nanoflakes with carbon nanotubes. Electrochemical studies of the composite electrodes in a three-electrode system demonstrate that 3% Sn-doped NiO/CNT composite has a higher specific capacitance of 238.2 F/g @ 5 mV/s scan rate than the specific capacitance of 231.8, 214.4 and 160.2 F/g @ 5 mV/s attained for 5%, 1% Sn-doped NiO/CNT and pristine NiO/CNT, respectively, in 2M potassium hydroxide (KOH) electrolyte. A high specific capacitance of 239.0 F/g @ 1 A/g current density is achieved for 3% Sn-doped NiO/CNT in galvanic discharge studies indicates that the prepared Sn-doped NiO/CNT is a suitable candidate for electrochemical supercapacitors.
