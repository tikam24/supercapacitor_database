Graphene nanosheets fabricated with copper doped manganese ferrite nanoparticles and the resultant Mn1-xCuxFe2O4/rGO nanocomposite was investigated as electrode material for supercapacitors. Copper doped manganese ferrite nanoparticles chemically anchored on graphene nanosheets exhibited the enhanced capacitive performance as compared to individual components due to the synergistic effect of faradic behavior and electric double layer capacitance. It is observed that the electrical conductivity of manganese ferrites was enhanced by the doping of conducting metal copper ions. Two-probe (I-V) measurements, assured the increased conductivities of copper doped manganese ferrites and Mn1-xCuxFe2O4/rGO nanocomposite. Cyclic voltammetry experiments and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy confirmed the superior electrochemical activity of Mn1-xCuxFe2O4/rGO nanocomposite. The fascinating electrochemical activity of nanocomposite makes it a potential candidate for supercapacitor applications.
