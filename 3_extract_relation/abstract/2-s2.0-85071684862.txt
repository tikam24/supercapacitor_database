In this study, the characteristics of 3 prepared with acidic solution were analyzed. The acidic solution was prepared by using hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid as the solutions to be added during the hydrothermal synthesis process. SEM, XRD and electrochemical characteristics tests were performed based on the prepared samples. Samples prepared in hydrochloric acid (W1) solution can identify platelet crystals and nanospheres, and samples made from sulfuric acid (W2) solutions can identify nanospheres and nanocubes. From the XRD data, it was confirmed that all of the diffraction peaks had a hexagonal phase. Electrochemical properties showed good rate capability of W1 samples but low capacitance and W2 samples showed relatively high capacitances.
