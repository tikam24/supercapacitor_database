The objective of this paper is to design an equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) for a fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle powered by fuel cell, battery and supercapacitor. Fuel cell efficiency penalty coefficient, battery SOC coefficient and supercapacitor SOC coefficient are designed for ECMS to operate the fuel cell system at its best efficiency zone, the battery as a long term energy buffer and supercapacitor supplying peak power. This paper also takes fuel cell degradation into consideration and sets adaptive fuel cell current change rate to ensure the proper work of the fuel cell during all its lifetime and normal operation of vehicle under fuel cell degradation state.
