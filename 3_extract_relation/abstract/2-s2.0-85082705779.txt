The growth of mesoporous graphene fibers (MGFs) is achieved by the fluidized-bed chemical vapor deposition methodology using MgCO3·3H2O fibers as templates. The regeneration of templates is realized via adding carbonate ions into the pickling filtrate. Besides, regenerated template and graphene possess similar morphologies and comparable qualities with those of initial template and graphene. MGFs present three-dimensional fiber-like microarchitecture coupled with mesoporous structure, strong structural stability and high electrical conductivity (800 S m−1). The symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) constructed by MGFs in aqueous electrolyte system exhibits enhanced capacitive behaviors with respect to the capacitance and rate capability as compared to those of lamellar-like mesoporous graphene and commercial activated carbon. Only 9.2% attenuation ratio of gravimetric capacitance is observed for MGFs-based SSC even when the areal mass loading increases from 2 to 10 mg cm−2. The electrochemical energy-storage behavior of MGFs in the organic electrolyte (LiPF6 system) is also investigated. This work provides an effective strategy to produce the exceptional graphene-based electrode material in a large scale.
