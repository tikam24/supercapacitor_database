We have synthesized a ternary composite electrode comprising graphene oxide (GO), cellulose hydrogel, and polyaniline (PANi). The composite deposited on a platinum electrode was electrochemically characterized. It was investigated using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The ternary composite electrode showed significantly enhanced cycling stability and improved a real capacitance of 980 F gâˆ’1 at 10 mV indicating a synergistic effect of cellulose hydrogel on PANi-GO. We believe the results of this study provide a strong experimental basis for the functioning of supercapacitors. Highlights: A cellulose hydrogel/GO/PANi composite was synthesized using the polymerization method. Cellulose hydrogel is crucial for the functioning of the composite. Cellulose hydrogel composite exhibits superior performances.
