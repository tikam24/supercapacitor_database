The design and development of the supercapacitors containing metal oxides and carbon materials is very important for energy-storage devices in laboratory and industry. In this study, we report a helical carbon tube material derived from epitaxial Cu-MOF coating on textile by calcination treatment. The electrochemical performance obtained from the cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) and cyclic stability measurements indicates that such a hybrid carbon material with a unique structure has a very high areal capacitance of 1812 mF cm-2 at a current density of 1 mA cm-2, and the material also has a good recyclability of 90% after 2000 cycles. This study combines the advantages of MOF- and cotton textile-derived carbon materials, and this study can serve as a guidance to improve the capacitance performance of supercapacitors.
