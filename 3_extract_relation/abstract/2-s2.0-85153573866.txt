This research work proposes a hybrid ultra-capacitor-battery energy storage technology for electric cars.The Quasi Z-source inverters (qZSIs) buck/boost feature allows the Hybrid ESS(HESS) to be integrated into the traction-inverter-system (TIS). The switch can be activated for a quasi-Z-source network with Zero Current Switching (ZCS) process. To automatically turn off all free-wheeling diodes, the inductor currents in the quasi-Z-source network run in Boundary-Conduction-Mode (BCM) or Discontinuous-Conduction-Mode (DCM). It is possible to eliminate the battery converter and lower the rated potential for the battery part and Ultra-capacitors. In different operation modes, the stable power distribution theory is explained. On a short time, scale, a frequency diving frequency diving coordinated control technique is intended to maximize the parameters like battery current stress and dynamic- power regulation.
