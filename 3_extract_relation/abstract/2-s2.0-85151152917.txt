The aim of this study was to investigate the performance measurement of supercapacitors using the electrochemical properties of cyclic voltammetry (CV). The use of CV is crucial in evaluating the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors and determining the surface area of the catalyst with regard to the fractal properties of the electrode. The study specifically focused on the CV behavior of a supercapacitor formed by a cobalt-doped ceria/reduced graphene oxide (Co-CeO2/rGO) fractal nanocomposite, and its assessment was conducted using a machine learning (ML) model with the enhanced XGBoost. The model was trained using an experimental open-source dataset. The results showed that the proposed XGBoost model had a superior ability to predict the CV behavior of the supercapacitor, with nearly perfect results for the MAE, RMSE, and R-squared metrics, which are effective at evaluating the performance of regression models. With the successful design of the proposed intelligent prediction model, the study is expected to provide valuable insights into forming novel nanocomposite forms with high accuracy and minimal need for experiments.
