This paper presents the frequency control strategy of standalone wind turbine with a doubly fed induction generator supported by a supercapacitor as an energy storage. The electrical power frequency will be oscillation when the amount of active power produced by wind turbine is not equal to the amount of active power required by consumer. The wind power generation is varying because wind existence is not constant. The supercapacitor will support system to maintain frequency stability. Â© 2011 IEEE.
