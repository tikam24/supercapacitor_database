Recently, the naturally available biomass wastes are received considerable attention as an appropriate carbon precursor to making low-price, sustainable, and environmental friendly porous carbon for supercapacitors. In this study, we have derived a tubular-like porous carbon (TPC) from natural waste American poplar fruit as a carbon precursor via simple carbonization and KOH activation processes. The derived TPC exhibits an impressive tubular-like framework with extremely arranged porous structures and an enhanced surface area of 942 m2 g−1. Besides, the TPC exhibits superior specific capacitance (SC) (423 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and rate ability (remained 217 F g−1 of SC still at 200 A g−1). It also has very-extensive cyclic life with only loss 3% of SC after 200,000 cycles still at 200 A g−1. The as-fabricated symmetrical cell under 6 M KOH offered a noteworthy SC of 58.71 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, superb specific energy of 7.99 Wh kg−1 at 372 W kg−1 as well as outstanding cyclic durability with preserved 80.2% of SC after 10,000 cycles at 10 A g−1. Meanwhile, the symmetrical cell under 1 M Et4NBF4/AN electrolyte expressed an increased SC of 31.68 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, high specific energy 13.75 Wh kg−1 at 624 W kg−1 as well as excellent cyclic durability with preserved 60.5% of SC after 10,000 cycles at 10 A g−1. Thus, the present work recommends that waste American poplar fruit is a sustainable carbon source for production of hierarchical porous carbon for energy storage device applications.
