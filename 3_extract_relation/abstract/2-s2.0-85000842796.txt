Graphene-wrapped Ni(OH)2 hollow spheres were prepared via electrostatic interaction between poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) modified Ni(OH)2 and graphene oxide (GO) in an aqueous dispersion, followed by the reduction of GO. Morphological and structural analysis by field-emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis confirmed the successful coating of graphene on Ni(OH)2 hollow spheres with a content of 3.8 wt%. And then its application as electrode material for supercapacitor has been investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests. Results show that the sample displays a high capacitance of 1368 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1, much better than that of pure Ni(OH)2, illustrating that such composite is a promising candidate as electrode material for supercapacitors.
