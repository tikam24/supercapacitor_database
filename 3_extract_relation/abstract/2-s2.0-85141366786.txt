Semiconducting cobalt tungstate flanked by carbon (CoWO4@C) polyhedral microstructures with smooth facets and zinc ferrite (ZnFe2O4) polydisperse interconnected nanoparticles via intrinsic mechanisms of hole polaron transfer from Co3+to Co2+sites and electron hopping between Fe2+and Fe3+states, respectively, were endowed with high room-temperature electrical conductivities (>0.9 mS cm-1), thus enabling the fabrication of a high-performance asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) possessing an outstanding rate capability as well as a good trade-off between power (P) and energy (E) densities. Furthermore, electrochemical response comparison of CoWO4@C//ZnFe2O4ASCs encompassing three different electrolytes (aqueous KOH, KOH-PEO gel, and KOH-PVA gel) revealed that the KOH-PEO gel cell outperformed the other two ASCs, with a specific capacity (SC) of 339 F g-1(at 1 A g-1) and Emaxand Pmaxof 105 Wh kg-1and 3.2 kW kg-1achieved over an operational voltage window of 1.5 V while retaining 97% of the original SC after 10,000 cycles. With KOH and KOH-PVA gel, while the Pmaxremained the same, SCs of 300 and 322 F g-1and Emax's of 93 and 100 Wh kg-1were obtained. The high ionic conductivity (81.6 mS cm-1) of the KOH-PEO gel is attributed to the hydrogen bonded networked structure of the gel with free spaces that allows ions to move freely within the polymer matrix. Further, the oxygens along the polymer chains ensure a high dissociation of KOH. The gel also serves as an ion-reservoir and these factors cumulatively resulted in the enhanced performance of the ASC. This study showcases that scalable, low-cost, leak-proof supercapacitors can be fabricated using environmentally friendly electroactive materials that can be synthesized easily using simple wet chemistry techniques.
