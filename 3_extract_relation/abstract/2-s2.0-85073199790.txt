In this study, CuMoO4, MoS2-nanospheres and CuMoO4/MoS2-nanoparticle forest-like structures have been prepared using a controllable simple one step hydrothermal method. The specific capacitance was studied by using different electrochemical methods including cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic studies in 3 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. The results show that this unique nanoparticle forest-like structure merits superiorities such as large surface area, more accessible active sites, better infiltration/diffusion, high conductivity and high electrochemical/mechanical stability. The CuMoO4/MoS2-nanoparticle forest-like structures can achieve a relatively high specific capacitance of 1115.5 F g-1 at a current density of 2 A g-1 with a stable operational voltage of 0-0.5 V and a good capacitance retention of 90.42% at a current density of 4 A g-1 after 3000 cycles. The electrochemical properties are attributed to the good electrical conductivity, redox properties and synergistic effect of the two (CuMoO4 and MoS2) materials. This work demonstrates that the CuMoO4/MoS2 composite is a promising electrode material for next-generation high-performance supercapacitor applications.
