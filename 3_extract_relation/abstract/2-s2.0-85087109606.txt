We proposed a new approach to construct zeolitic imidazolate frameworks-67 (ZIF-67) powders directly on carbon cloth without any conductive agent and adhesion agent and the ZIF-67 nanoparticles on carbon cloth were successfully converted into hollow Co3O4 nanostructure via a facile calcination process. Compared with original ZIF-67 powders, the Co3O4@CC electrode materials had admirable specific capacitance of 1 164.8 F·g−1 at an area current density of 2.5 mA·cm−2. Furthermore, the rate performance remained 42.4% of initial value when the current density was increased to 30 mA·cm−2 and the specific capacitance maintained 93.4% of initial capacity after 5 000 cycles at an area current density of 10 mA·cm−2. This strategy may have potential prospect for the application of MOFs in the energy storage and conversion field.
