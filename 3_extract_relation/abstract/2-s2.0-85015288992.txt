Confronted with severe environment issues, large scale utilization and development of wind energy and solar energy that are regenerative, non-pollution, green and clean, the best way for power generation and grid synchronization of distributed energy is to develop intelligence micro-grid. Amongst micro-grid, batteries will be connected with super capacitors to form hybrid energy storage system. Batteries will stabilize the voltage of DC busbar to as to retain balance between demand and supply over busbar. Super capacitors will quickly provide high frequency power component needed for load variation so as to restrict the impact of abrupt load variation on DC busbar. Parameters should be designed based on DC system at substation. Simulation software will be used to simulate emergency load and abrupt load reduction under different capacitance levels so as to demonstrate The feasibility of Hybrid Energy Storage Systems.
