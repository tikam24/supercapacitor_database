The composites of Ni–Al layeredIP:double127.0.0.1hydroxideOn: Sun,(Ni–Al30 AugLDH)/graphene2020 02:34:29(GR) had been synthesized through the hydrothermal route in this work.Copyright:structureDeliveredThe mechanismAmericanof Scientificthe compositesPublishersdepended on XRD. Meanwhile, SEM was used to record the morphological of the composites.by IngentaThe electrochemical properties were analyzed through the charge-discharge of constant current, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The composites of Ni–Al LDH/GR possessed a layered structure and the structure was uniformly dispersed on the graphene. The given discharge capacity of the composites of Ni–Al LDH/GR was higher than the value of bare Ni–Al LDH, which was approximately 400 F · g−1 in the speed of 1 A g−1; Mean-while, the capacitance retention was still more than 1 time higher compared with the value of Ni–Al LDH for 500 cycles at 1 A g−1 .
