Porous dual-layered molybdenum oxide (MoOx) nanotube arrays (NTAs) with highly conductive titanium nitride (TiN) cores (MoOx/TiN/MoOx NTAs) are fabricated by depositing MoOx on porous TiN NTAs produced by nitriding as-anodized TiO2 NTAs on Ti foils. The highly conductive TiN facilitates electron transfer and the porous MoOx wall allows the electrolyte to permeate the nanotubes readily, maximizing the active sites of the MoOx electroactive material to improve the specific capacitance and rate capability. The coaxial MoOx/TiN/MoOx NTA electrode shows a high specific capacitance of 97mFcm-2 (323Fg-1) at a current density of 1mAcm-2, and 60% capacitance is retained when the current density is increased 20 times. A symmetrical device based on the MoOx/TiN/MoOx NTA electrode exhibits a capacitance as high as 24Fcm-3 (based on the volume of MoOx/TiN/MoOx NTAs) and no significant decay is observed after charging/discharging for 10000 cycles.
