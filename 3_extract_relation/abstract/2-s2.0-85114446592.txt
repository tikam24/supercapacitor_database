The advanced structural design of supercapacitor (SC) electrodes is an effective approach to enhance their performance towards energy conversion and storage. Herein, ultrathin NiCo2S4 nanosheets on Ni foam (NF) with uniform Ni3S2 nanocrystals were synthesised via a simple microwave-assisted sulfidation process. The cooperation of massive ultrathin Ni3S2 nanocrystals and cross-linking NiCo2S4 nanosheets endowed the Ni3S2/NiCo2S4/NF electrodes with a high specific capacitance of 3299 F/g at 13.3 A/g (11.5 F/cm2 at 5 mA/cm2), a remarkable rate capacity of 77% retention at 20 A/g, and cycling performance of 61% retention after 8000 cycles at 50 mA/cm2. This work illustrates that the Ni3S2/NiCo2S4/NF electrodes synthesised via a simple microwave-assisted method are promising anode materials in asymmetric SCs.
