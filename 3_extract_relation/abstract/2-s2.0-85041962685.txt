CoFe2O4 nanospheres ornamented CdS nanorods were successfully assembled over the reduced graphene oxide nanosheets. Such hierarchical morphology established by field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy studies, with high surface area offered a high specific capacitance of 1487 F g-1 at a current density of 5 A g-1 owing to fast diffusion of ions, facile transportation of electrons, and great synergism between the components, which led to reversible redox reactions. Furthermore, the electrode material has specific capacitance retention of 78% up to 5000 cycles, thus demonstrating its good reversibility and cyclic stability. The resulting CdS-CoFe2O4@reduced graphene oxide nanohybrid can deliver excellent electrochemical performance and can be a potential candidate for supercapacitor application.
