This paper presents a wireless power charging system for storage energy in a supercapacitor as a power source for biomedical implants. The system uses a class E amplifier to give voltage to an inductive link and storage energy in a supercapacitor. Supercapacitor has high energy density in a very small package (almost 7mm diameter). The system was tested using a laboratory prototype, measuring the time of charge and discharge. Different times of charging were used to evaluate the instantaneous and long term charge. The stored energy can feed an implanted nerve stimulator more than 33 hours after 120s of charge time.
