The development of a new generation of supercapacitors with high electric and energy characteristics based on new active ingredients is an important and useful task. One of the most promising materials for the realization of these objectives is granular nanocomposites made from pyrocarbon (PC) matrix and nanosized globular carbon. The paper presents the results of the study properties of pyrocarbon matrix and defines the conditions which have a significant influence on the formation of its properties.
