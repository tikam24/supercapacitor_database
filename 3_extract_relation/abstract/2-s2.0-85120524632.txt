Using cheap coal pitch as raw material and adding pore-forming agent, the carbon material with three-dimensional skeleton structure was obtained by mixing process, air oxidation stabilization process and carbonization process successively, and then the porous carbon material with high specific surface area was obtained by water vapor activation. Thermogravimetric and elemental analysis were used to study the thermal reaction characteristics and structural changes of the samples after oxidation stabilization and carbonization. The surface morphology, pore structure and electrochemical properties of the activated samples were characterized by scanning electron microscope, BET method and electrochemical workstation. After water vapor activation, BET of porous carbon can reach 1638 m2/g. The water-based double layer capacitors prepared with this porous carbon as the electrode material of supercapacitors have good cyclic performance, and the specific capacitance can reach 252 F/g at 1 A/g current density. After 10000 cycles, the specific capacity can still maintain 97.3%. Therefore, the porous carbon materials prepared by this method have low cost and good chemical stability, and can be used as an ideal electrode material for supercapacitors.
