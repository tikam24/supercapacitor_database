The novel Ce doped MnO2/rGO composite was fabricated by a simple two-step hydrothermal method reacted for different times. As results, the composite reacted for 1h exhibits better electrochemical performance and rate capacity, the capacitive retention is 85% from 130.44 F g–1 for first cycle decrease to 111.11 F g–1 after 1000 cycles at the current density of 1 A g–1, and 14.7 W h kg–1 of energy density. Moreover, the BET surface area is 243 m2 g–1, and the average pore size is 7.9 nm, which will be convenient for the quick transport and migration of electrolyte ions during the charge–discharge process, and further confirm good rate capability.
