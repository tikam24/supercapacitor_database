This paper presents an original model-based control for dc microgrid supplied by a battery bank (main source) and supercapacitor (secondary source) for electric vehicle (e-Vehicle) applications. A nonlinear control approach based on the differential flatness theory is proposed. Utilizing the differential flatness characteristics, we advance simple solutions to hybrid convergence problems and energy management. To corroborate the proposed method, a hardware system is realized with fully digital estimation accomplished with a dSPACE MicroLabBox controller. Experimental results with small-scale devices (a battery bank of 120 V, 40 Ah and a supercapacitor bank of 160 V, 6 F) in a laboratory substantiate the good control scheme during a load-drive cycles.
