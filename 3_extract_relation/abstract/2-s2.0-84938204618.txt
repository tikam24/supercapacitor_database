3D frameworks are important because of their potential to combine the advantageous properties of porous materials with those associated with polymers. A series of novel 3D aromatic frameworks are presented that incorporate the heterocycles thiophene, selenophene, and tellurophene. The specific surface area and pore width of frameworks depends on the element that is used to build the framework. Optoelectronic properties are element-dependent, with heavy atoms red-shifting the optical properties and decreasing the energy gap of the solid. The metalloid nature of tellurophene allows the properties of this material to be tuned based on its oxidation state, even as an insoluble solid. The incorporation of the optoelectronic active thiophene, selenophene, and tellurophene units and the effect that they have on properties was studied. A supercapcitor device was fabricated using these frameworks, showing that these 3D frameworks are promising for optoelectronic uses. Elements control properties: 3D frameworks consisting of adamantane vertices and diphenylheterocycle (S, Se, and Te) linkers have been synthesized and characterized. The specific surface area and pore width of frameworks depends on the element incorporated in the heterocycle. Optoelectronic properties are also element dependent. A supercapacitor was constructed to demonstrate electronic activity.
