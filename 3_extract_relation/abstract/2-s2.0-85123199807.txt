Porous reduced graphene oxide (prGO) with NiCo2S4 composite prepared hydrothermally, tested as electrode materials for supercapacitor (EC) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This work provides insight into different combinations of EC. Among which symmetric supercapacitors proving more efficient with fifty folds higher specific capacitance (SC). The composite also accounted for good HER activity with a Tafel slope value as low as −57 mV dec−1.
