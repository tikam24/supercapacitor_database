Supercapacitor (SC) has the characteristics of high power density, long cycle life, and fast charge and discharge rates, which possess great potential in providing energy storage performance for smart electronic products. The preparation and assembly of electrodes play an important role in improving the performance of SC. Traditional manufacturing techniques have limitations in controlling the geometry and structure of the electrodes. The advent of three-dimensional (3D) printing technology offers great opportunities for accurately control SC device geometry and structure, as well as enhanced energy and power density. This article reviews recent advances in common 3D printing techniques, carbon-based materials used to manufacture electrodes, and structures of different SC devices, with emphasis on the fabrication and application of carbon-based SC. Finally, the research conclusions and prospects are given, and the future design and development direction of 3D printing in carbon-based SC are pointed out. Graphic abstract: 3D printing offers a great opportunity to precisely control the structure of supercapacitor devices and to improve their energy and power density. This article focuses on the different 3D printing technologies, preparation and application of supercapacitor device structures with carbon based electrode.[Figure not available: see fulltext.].
