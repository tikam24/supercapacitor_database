CoFe2O4/reduced graphene oxide (CoFe2O4/rGO) hydrogel was synthesized in situ via a facile one-pot solvothermal approach. The three-dimensional (3D) network structure consists of well-dispersed CoFe2O4 nanoparticles on the surfaces of graphene sheets. As a binder-free electrode material for supercapacitors, the electrochemical properties of the CoFe2O4/rGO hybrid hydrogel can be easily adjusted by changing the concentration of the graphene oxide (GO) precursor solution. The results indicate that the hybrid material made using 3.5 mg mL-1 GO solution exhibits an outstanding specific capacitance of 356 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1, 68% higher than the pure CoFe2O4 counterpart (111 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1), owing to the large specific surface area and good electric conductivity. Additionally, an electrochemical energy storage device based on CoFe2O4/rGO and rGO was assembled, which exhibits a high energy density of 17.84 W h kg-1 at a power density of 650 W kg-1 and an excellent cycling stability with 87% capacitance retention at 5 A g-1 after 4000 cycles. This work takes one step further towards the development of 3D hybrid hydrogel supercapacitors and highlights their potential application in energy storage devices.
