The development of on-chip and in-plane energy storage devices have drawn prospective research interest because of possible wide range of practical applications in forthcoming future. Primarily, the in-plane electrochemical capacitors (ECs) such as micro-supercapacitors, lithium ion micro-capacitors, sodium ion micro-capacitors, zinc ion micro-capacitors, etc are the competitive future on-chip and planar energy storage devices due to their desirable energy storage performances. This article mainly focuses on the roadmap of current development of these devices and their potential electrode materials. Brief overviews of working mechanisms associated with these devices are covered. Moreover, this article includes the recent progresses of advanced on-chip and in-planar portable conjugated ECs and sensors systems. Finally, the research perspectives and possible research direction of these devices are covered for upcoming high-performance on-chip and in-planar energy storage devices.
