The novel Ni-doped Co3O4 nanowire array was synthesized successfully by electrochemical deposition with the aid of anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) template, followed by oxidation at high temperature. The phase composition and morphology were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope and high resolution transmission electron microscope. The results show that as-prepared Ni-doped Co3O4 nanowire array perpendicular to the substrate displays highly uniform shape and size, with an average diameter of 80 nm and length of 1.4 Î¼m. The nanowire with coarse surface is composed of small crystalline nanoparticles. Average atom ratio of Co to Ni in the nanowire is 20 : 1. Electrochemical characterization was performed using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge in a 2 mol/L KOH aqueous solution electrolyte. The test results indicate that the Ni-doped Co3O4 nanowire array exhibits a specific capacitance of 173 mF/cm2 at current density of 10 mA/cm2, and a good cycling stability with 98% capacity retention over 1000 cycles. Excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to the large specific surface area and the enhanced conductivity achieved by incorporating of Ni.
