The authors successfully demonstrated flexible hybrid supercapacitors on polyimide sheets by integrating femtosecond laser direct writing, Au coating, and MnO2 electrodeposition. Scanning electron microscope images display that focused pulsed laser irradiation rapidly converts the polyimide surface into an electrically conductive porous carbon structure. After Au coating and thermal sintering of Au nanoparticles, these flexible supercapacitors achieved an enhanced rate capability. Compared to the in-plane supercapacitors, the specific capacitance of hybrid supercapacitors with MnO2 electrodeposition increase from 20 to 300 mF/cm2 at 0.5 mA/cm2 charge/discharge current. These high performance supercapacitors can be potentially integrated with applications for portable and wearable electronic devices, solar cells, chemical and biomedical sensors, display devices, and other on-chip level devices.
