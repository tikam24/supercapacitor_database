As a significant macrostructure of 2D MXene nanosheets, MXene (Ti3C2Tx) films made by vacuum-assisted filtration have considerable application prospects in the field of energy storage and infrared stealth. However, using vacuum-assisted filtration to assemble 2D MXene nanosheets into films is energy-intensive, inefficient, and thereby detrimental to the further development of MXene films. This work involves the first investigation into the electrochemical capacitive and infrared stealth behavior of MXene films prepared by the blade coating method. Blade-coated MXene films have a more regular and dense structure than traditional films prepared vacuum-assisted filtration. Thus, the electrical conductivity can reach as high as 8000 S cm−1 and the film exhibits good mechanical properties. When the blade-coated MXene film is used for supercapacitors, it has a specific capacitance of 347 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1, which is similar to that of the filtered MXene film. Additionally, the blade-coated MXene film demonstrates excellent infrared stealth performance, benefitting from its low mid-infrared emissivity. As a result, this form of MXene film assembly has broad application prospects in the field of military infrared camouflage. This work lays an important foundation for the further application of MXene films in practice.
