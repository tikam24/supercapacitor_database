We report the synthesized mixture of MXene and Ni–Co LDH on nickel foam by an electrodeposition technique. The specific capacitance of the mixture attained 983.6 F g−1 at a discharge current of 2 A g−1, which is greater than that of pure MXene. Compared to Ni–Co LDH, the sample created through electrodeposition provided a better rate capability of 983.6 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 and 536.6 F g−1 at 50 A g−1 and cycling stability with 76% retention after 5000 cycles at 30 A g−1. Moreover, a solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor with MXene-LDH as the positive electrode and multi-walled carbon nanotube coated on the nickel foam as the negative electrode delivers high energy density (36.70 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 1.44 kW kg−1), which outperforms the other devices reported previously.
