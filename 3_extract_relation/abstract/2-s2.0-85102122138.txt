In this work, MoO2@NPGA nanocomposites were successfully prepared via a simple hydrothermal and calcinations route. The as-prepared MoO2@NPGA composites exhibit a synergistic effect between MoO2 and N,P-codoped graphene aerogels, which can significantly improve the electrochemical performance of the MoO2@NPGA electrodes. Moreover, the results also proved that the mass loading of MoO2 has a huge effect on the electrochemical properties of MoO2@NPGA composites. With an appropriate amount of MoO2, the MoO2@NPGA composite shows a high specific capacitance 335 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and excellent cycle stability capacitance remains at 88% after 6000 cycles. Furthermore, the assembled symmetric supercapacitor displays a high energy density of 23.75 W h kg-1 at a power density of 300 W kg-1 and can maintain an energy density of 17.1 W h kg-1 when the power density reaches up to 6005 W kg-1.
