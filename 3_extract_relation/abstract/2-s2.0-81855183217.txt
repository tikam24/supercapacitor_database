We report the synthesis of a series of praseodymium oxide/polypyrrole (Pr6O11/PPy) nanocomposites, and their application in the electrochemical energy storage. The Pr6O11/PPy nanocomposites were synthesized by the in situ surface-initiated polymerization technique based on the amine-functionalized Pr6O11 nanoparticles. The nanocomposites exhibit the well-defined core/shell structure observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Thermogravimetric analysis reveals a significantly enhanced thermal stability with the addition of the amine-functionalized Pr 6O11 nanoparticles. Furthermore, they possess weak temperature dependence of the conductivity and the highest specific capacitance of 400 F g-1 at the charge-discharge current density of 10 mA cm -2 in 1.0 M NaNO3 electrolyte solution when being used as the electrode material for supercapacitor.
