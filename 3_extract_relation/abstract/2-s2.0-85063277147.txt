The flexible and light weight supercapacitors as a power source for flexible electronics have attracted extensive attention recently. Herein, we present the fabrication of a flexible aerogel composed of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and delaminated titanium carbide (Ti 3 C 2 ) sheets as a high performance, binder free, flexible and self-standing electrode for supercapacitor application. Micron sized two dimensional (2D) delaminated Ti 3 C 2 sheets were synthesized from Ti 3 AlC 2 and were successfully accommodated inside a three-dimensional (3D) microporous network of rGO, prepared via room temperature interfacial gelation route and successive reduction of GO at Zn surface. The vacuum dried composite aerogel with a quasi-parallel arrangement of the 2D sheets showed high areal capacitance of 171.4 mF cm −2 at 1 mA/cm 2 current density, which was ~4.7 times higher than that of the only rGO aerogel electrode. The high areal capacitance was accompanied by excellent cycle stability of only 4.3 ∗ 10 −3 % capacitance loss per cycle over 1500 cycles at 3 mA/cm 2 current density. The impressive electrochemical performance of the rGO/Ti 3 C 2 composite aerogel was also realized in a solid state symmetric supercapacitor using PVA/H 3 PO 4 gel polymer electrolyte with high areal energy density of 2.1 μWh/cm 2 accompanied by excellent cycle stability.
