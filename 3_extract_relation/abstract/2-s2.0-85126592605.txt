The intensive growth of smart portable devices has triggered a boom in the research of all-solid-state flexible supercapacitors. However, the unsatisfactory mechanical flexibility and limited energy density still hinder their practical application. Herein, a combination hydrothermal-Assisted assemble strategy is proposed to design reduced graphene oxide fiber/MoS2nanosheet-Assembled composite fabrics (rGOFF-MoS2), where the MoS2nanosheets vertically grow on the surface of rGO fibers through C-O-Mo covalent bonds. The synthesized rGOFF-MoS2fabrics present an inter-linkage isotropy skeleton, a robust fusing node, an in situ vertical covalent bridge, an adequate pseudocapacitive reactivity, and a large electrochemical active surface (80.1 m2/g), resulting in fast interlaminar conductivity, great ionic migration and adsorption, and outstanding mechanical stability. The as-prepared flexible electrode displays a large capacitance of 330 F/g at 0.1 A/g (1330 mF/cm2at 1 mA/cm2) and a high stability (95% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles) in the H2SO4electrolyte. Additionally, the assembled solid-state flexible supercapacitor presents an energy density of 69.44 Î¼W h/cm2(0.5 mW/cm2) and an excellent mechanical flexibility, making the rGOFF-MoS2fabric a highly competitive candidate for practical applications in next-generation wearable/smart electronics.
