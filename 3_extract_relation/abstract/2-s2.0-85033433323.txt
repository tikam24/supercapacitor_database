3D reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-wrapped Ni3S2 nanoparticles on Ni foam with porous structure is successfully synthesized via a facile one-step solvothermal method. This unique structure and the positive synergistic effect between Ni3S2 nanoparticles and graphene can greatly improve the electrochemical performance of the NF@rGO/Ni3S2 composite. Detailed electrochemical measurements show that the NF@rGO/Ni3S2 composite exhibits excellent supercapacitor performance with a high specific capacitance of 4048 mF cm−2 (816.8 F g−1) at a current density of 5 mA cm−2 (0.98 A g−1), as well as long cycling ability (93.8% capacitance retention after 6000 cycles at a current density of 25 mA cm−2). A novel aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor is designed using the NF@rGO/Ni3S2 composite as positive electrode and nitrogen-doped graphene as negative electrode. The assembled device displays an energy density of 32.6 W h kg−1 at a power density of 399.8 W kg−1, and maintains 16.7 W h kg−1 at 8000.2 W kg−1. This outstanding performance promotes the as-prepared NF@rGO/Ni3S2 composite to be ideal electrode materials for supercapacitors.
