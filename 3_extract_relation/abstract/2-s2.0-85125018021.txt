In this study, MoO/MWCNT thin-film supercapacitors were produced at different temperatures (20 °C, 40 °C, 60 °C and 80 °C) on Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) substrates via Chemical Bath Deposition (CBD). The surface morphologies of the produced MoO/MWCNT/PMMA thin film supercapacitors were analysed by FESEM, and their chemical compositions were determined by EDX analysis. MoO/MWCNT thin films were analysed by XRD, and vibration band stretch was examined using FTIR analysis. Electrochemical properties were determined from time-dependent current-voltage (I–V) measurements in the range of −0.2 V – 0.3 V, at 5 mV/s, 10 mV/s and 20 mV/s scanning rates using Keithley 2400 sourcemeter. Accordingly, the maximum specific capacitance was calculated as 522 F/g for MoO/MWCNT/PMMA, at 60 °C, and 5 mV/s scanning rate. The superior performances can be attributed to excellent electrical conductivity and fast ion transport. This work introduces a simple production method for low-cost, scalable, and high-performance CNT-based supercapacitors.
