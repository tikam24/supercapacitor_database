Graphite and multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) served as dual dopants to prepare the composite with poly (aniline-co-o-methoxyaniline) copolymer electrochemically. The aniline to o-methoxyaniline monomer feed ratio was screened, with 4 to 1 monomer ratio being optimal. The supercapacitive properties of the prepared dual dopant-doped composite as electrode materials have been investigated and yielded a large specific capacitance of 535.0 F/g under 1.0 A/g current density and showed excellent rate performance, even with large current densities applied (up to 50.0 A/g). The composite remained to give a relatively stable specific capacitance of more than 200.0 F/g after 500 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles, which afforded better and/or comparable performance compared with other polyaniline-based composite. The composite's morphological features were characterized with scanning electron microscopy. The results from this study will be significant for the development of conducting polymer-based energy storage materials.
