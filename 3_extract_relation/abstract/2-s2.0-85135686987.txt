Nickel cobalt oxide (NiCo2O4) thin films were grown by using chemical spray pyrolysis on conducting substrate (FTO) for energy storage application. The physical and electrochemical properties of prepared NiCo2O4 thin films were reported via various analytical techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electrochemical measurements. The higher specific capacitance of the NiCo2O4 thin films demonstrated their suitability as outstanding candidates in electrochemical applications. The maximum evaluated specific capacitance of 777 F/g obtained at scan rate 5 mV/s.
