We have prepared borocarbonitrides of various compositions with extended sheet morphology, by the reaction of few-layer graphene with boric acid and urea at 900 Â°C and characterized them in detail. Supercapacitor performance of the borocarbonitrides has been studied in detail, the composition containing more pyridinc nitrogen exhibiting a specific capacitance of 306 F/g at 0.2 A/g. This composition also shows good oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity with an electron transfer number close to 4. The extended sheet structures of the BxCyNz samples has enabled us to fabricate field-effect transistors. These materials also show reasonable UV photoresponse.
