The output power of photovoltaic (PV) is often volatile and intermittent, its large-scale grid connection will cause a huge burden on the stable operation of the power system. In recent years, there are more and more examples of energy storage systems used to smooth power fluctuations caused by PV. This study developments a hybrid energy storage system (HESS), which composed of battery, supercapacitor and flywheel energy storage. In this study, a two-stage low-pass filtering strategy is proposed to divide the unbalanced power that needs to be smoothed into high, medium, and low-frequency signals. Furthermore, Proposing a coordinated control strategy based on the state of charge (SOC) of battery and supercapacitor, and the angular velocity of the flywheel. Finally, the simulation results of typical solar-storage combined power generation system under various operating conditions are compared and analyzed to verify the effectiveness and rationality of those proposed strategy.
