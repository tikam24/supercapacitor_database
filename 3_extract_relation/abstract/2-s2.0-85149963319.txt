Electrochemical super-capacitors (SCS) show high energy density and very long cyclability due to high power density. However, the key challenge for further enhanced capacitance of SCS lies in fabricating stable structure which can provide large chemically active surface area of materials for SCS. Two-dimensional (2D) layers in such hybrid structure may come into contact unavoidably, which may lead to ‘aggregation’. We are developing processes for fabrication of hybrid architecture with 2D materials (such as graphene)-based nanocomposite structures for application of novel SCS. Graphene–carbon nanotubes (CNT) nanocomposite hybrid structures are novel materials for SCS which possess: (1) large chemically active surface area for large capacitance; (2) high electrical conductivity in all directions; (3) enabling novel thermal management; and (4) realizing enhanced mechanical and chemical stability of devices. As preliminary results, the average measure capacitance of the hybrid graphene–CNT composite structure was 725 µF/cm2 at 10 mV/s with a standard rectangular voltammetry curve.
