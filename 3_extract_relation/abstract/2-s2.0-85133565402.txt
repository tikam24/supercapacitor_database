This work demonstrates ionic liquid electrolyte-inscribed sweat-based dual electrolyte functioning supercapacitors capable of self-charging through sweat electrolyte function under a non-enzymatic route. The supercapacitor electrodes are fabricated from TREN (tris(2-aminoethyl)amine), poly-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene, and a graphene oxide mixture with copper-mediated chelate, and this polymer-GO-metal chelate film can produce excellent energy harvest/storage performance from a sweat and ionic liquid integrated electrolyte system. The fabricated device is specifically designed to reduce deterioration using a typical planar structure. In the presence of sweat with ionic liquid, the dual electrolyte mode supercapacitor exhibits a maximum areal capacitance of 3600 mF cm−2, and the energy density is 450 mWhcm−2, which is more than 100 times greater than that from previously reported supercapacitors. The supercapacitors were fabricated/attached directly to textile fabrics as well as ITO-PET (Indium tin oxide (ITO)-polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film to study their performance on the human body during exercise. The self-charging performance with respect to sweat wetting time for the sweat@ionic liquid dual electrolyte showed that the supercapacitor performed well on both fabric and film. These devices exhibited good response for pH effect and biocompatibility, and as such present a promising multi-functional energy system as a stable power source for next-generation wearable smart electronics.
