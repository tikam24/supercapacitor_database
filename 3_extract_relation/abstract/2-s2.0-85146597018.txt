This work describes the development of a woven carbon fiber and thermoset polyester resin based structural supercapacitor via three-dimensional (3D) printing. The specific surface area and capacitance of the electrodes were increased by hydrothermally synthesized N-doped Zn-Co selenide nanowires on the surface. The supercapacitor with N@ZnCoSe2-MXene exhibited an energy of 2.69 Wh kg-1, a power density of 43.20 W kg-1, and a Coulombic efficiency of 88.8% at 1000 mA g-1 of current density. The cyclic stability and multifunctionality of the device were satisfactory, and the capacitance retention was 83.7% at the same current density after 6000 consecutive charge-discharge cycles. The device’s high tensile strength (637.679 MPa) and modulus (36.92 GPa), with an impact energy absorption capacity of 2.22 J g-1, indicated its mechanical robustness. The device exhibits a comparable performance under various weather conditions. It retains 39.11 F g-1 of specific capacitance, 4.62 Wh kg-1 of energy, and 67.29 W kg-1 of power density at 70 °C, while it retains 7.87 F g-1 of specific capacitance, 1.78 Wh kg-1 of energy, and 20.98 W kg-1 of power density at −5 °C.
