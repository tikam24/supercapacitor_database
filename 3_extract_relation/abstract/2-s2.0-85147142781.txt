Vanadium pentoxide nanowires were prepared using a solution of ammonium metavanadate in deionized water by simple hydrothermal synthesis based on a reaction time of 20 to 36 h. The prepared samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and galvanostatic charge/discharge. According to the results of the study of the obtained materials' surface morphology, it was found that the allowable temperature for the hydrothermal synthesis of vanadium pentoxide nanowires is 220-240Â°C. The temporal parameters do not make a characteristic contribution to the development of the morphology of vanadium pentoxide nanowires. At the same time, the study by galvanostatic charge/discharge test shows a significant increase in the specific capacity of vanadium pentoxide with an increase in the reaction time in the studied interval. The dependence of the specific capacity on the reaction time is described by a power (exponential) function.
