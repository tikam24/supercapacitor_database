Novel carbon-based microporous nanoplates containing numerous heteroatoms (H-CMNs) are fabricated from regenerated silk fibroin by the carbonization and activation of KOH. The H-CMNs exhibit superior electrochemical performance, displaying a specific capacitance of 264 F/g in aqueous electrolytes, a specific energy of 133 Wh/kg, a specific power of 217 kW/kg, and a stable cycle life over 10000 cycles.
