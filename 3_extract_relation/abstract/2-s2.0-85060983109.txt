Polyaniline (PANI)/lignin (LG) composites with interpenetrating fibrous networks are prepared by in-situ oxidation polymerization of aniline using reticulated LG as the framework. The optimal PANI/LG composite gives a conductivity of 3.22 S cm âˆ’1 , and that of PANI is 1.43 S cm -1 . As an electrode for supercapacitor, above composite shows better electrochemical capacitance performances than PANI, especially in rate capability and cycling stability. PANI/LG has a specific capacitance of 284.4 F g -1 at a current density of 30 A g -1 , and possesses the capacitance retention as high as 58.6% with the growth of a current density from 0.5 to 30 A g -1 , and those of PANI are 123.1 F g -1 and 29.2%. Meanwhile, the capacity retention of PANI/LG symmetrical capacitor is 67.4% after 5000 cycles at a current density of 1.0 A g -1 , which far exceeds PANI (17.8%).
