In order to achieve resource recycling and environmental protection, the waste plastic foam-based porous carbon material PMC-T is prepared by a high-temperature pyrolysis activation method. Plastic foam-based porous carbon PMC-T is an amorphous carbon with a honeycomb-like structure, a specific surface area of up to 2281 m2 g-1, and a reasonable pore size distribution. Cyclic voltammetry tests and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests show that the plastic foam-based porous carbon material PMC-700 exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. Specifically, in a 6 M KOH electrolyte at a 1 A g-1 current density, the specific capacitance reached 296 F g-1. Additionally, PMC-T demonstrates good cycle stability, and after 5000 charging and discharging cycles, its capacitance retention rate is as high as 87.1%. The plastic foam-based porous carbon exhibits excellent electrochemical properties.
