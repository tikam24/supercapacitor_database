A porous organic framework as electrode material for supercapacitor was prepared successfully. It exhibited the remarkable specific capacitance of 170.66F路g-1 at current density of 1.0A路g-1, and 100% of capacitance retention after successive charge-discharge 10,000 cycles in an alkaline aqueous electrolyte solution. At the same time, we explored the electrochemical performance of porous N-doped carbon derived from the template of porous organic framework as supercapacitor electrode material. Impressively, it possessed the higher specific capacitance and better cycling stability, which showed specific capacitance of 180.88F路g-1 at the current density of 0.4A路g-1 and retained 100% of initial capacitance after 30,000 cycles.
