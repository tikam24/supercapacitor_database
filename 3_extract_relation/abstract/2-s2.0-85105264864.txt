NiCo layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have attracted extensive attention in supercapacitors nowadays due to their ion insertable layer structure, however, improvement of their electrochemical energy storage performance is still a great challenge work. Herein, three-dimensional NiCo(NA)-LDH nanosheet networks with high mass-loading on an activated carbon cloth are prepared by electrodeposition using a mixed Ni/Co nitrate and acetate as reactants, which is denoted as NiCo(NA)-LDH. When the mass-loading is 16 mg cm−2 and the current density is 10 mA cm−2, the areal capacitance of NiCo(NA)-LDH@ACC electrode reaches 27.3 F cm−2 and the specific capacitance is 1709 F g−1 at 0.62 A g−1, and the mass-loading is positively correlated with the capacitance performance. An asymmetric supercapacitor assembled by NiCo(NA)-LDH@ACC as the positive electrode and acid-etched carbon cloth as the negative electrode achieves a working potential window of 1.7 V and energy density of 2.24 mW h cm−2 at a power density of 3.71 mW cm−2, which are much higher than the previous reports of NiCo-LDH based supercapacitors. In addition, the prepared device shows an excellent cycle stability with 104% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles at 250 mA cm−2.
