With multiple properties, green carbon nanomaterials with high specific surface area have become extensively attractive as energy storage devices with environmental-friendly features. The primary synthesis attempts were based on alkalis activation, which, however, faced the dilemma of low utilization rate of carbon sources. Herein, the green carbon with ultrahigh surface area (up to 3560 m2/g) was prepared by the KOH-assisted biomass carbonization. Moreover, the redundant K2O steam and CxHy flow were further utilized; as a result, the carbon materials with a wide range of morphological diversity were collected on the Cu foam. Accordingly, we carried out density functional theory simulations to reveal the mechanism of O-adatom-promoted CH4 dissociation over the Cu surface for carbon formation. The electrodes of electrochemical capacitor fabricated by carbon synthesis possess a 170% higher specific capacitance compared with commercial carbon electrodes. As such, this strategy might be promising in developing hierarchical carbons along with sufficient carbon sources for broadening their potential applications.
