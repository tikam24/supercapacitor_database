Increasing implementation of renewable energy sources within power systems means that the use of energy storage technologies will be ever more important for system stability and power quality purposes. A range of energy storage technologies currently exist, ranging from low-power, short term technologies such as capacitors to long-term high power systems such as Pumped Hydro. Future developments such as the use of Carbon Nanotube technology within super-capacitors look set to bring improvements in power density, efficiency and lifetime.
