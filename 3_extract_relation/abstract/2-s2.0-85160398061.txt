MXenes have been received considerable attention because of their particular physical and chemical properties in recent. In this work, a novel poly(ionic liquid)/MXene gel polymer electrolyte (PIL/MXene GPE) based on 1-vinyl-3-ethylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ionic liquid, Ti3C2Tx MXene, and ethylene glycol diacrylate was prepared by a one–step radiation method. The PIL/MXene GPE exhibited good ionic conductivity, thermal stability, and excellent mechanical strength. The maximum compression resistance could reach 59.97 MPa. In addition, the supercapacitor based on the PIL/MXene GPE showed good electrochemical performances and high stability. The specific capacitance retention could reach about 93.02% even over 300 charge–discharge cycles. Based on the above research, the designed PIL/MXene GPE will open a new window and provide an important enlightenment for synthesis and application of the gel polymer electrolytes in future.
