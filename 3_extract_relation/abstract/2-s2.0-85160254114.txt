The global demand for energy is constantly rising, and thus far, remarkable efforts have been put into developing high-performance energy storage devices using nanoscale designs and hybrid approaches. Hybrid nanostructured materials composed of transition metal oxides/hydroxides, metal chalcogenides, metal carbides, metal–organic frameworks, carbonaceous compounds and polymer-based porous materials have been used as electrodes for designing energy storage systems such as batteries, supercapacitors (SCs), and so on. Different kinds of hybrid materials have been shown to be ideal electrode materials for the development of efficient energy storage devices, due to their porous structures, high surface area, high electrical conductivity, charge accommodation capacity, and tunable electronic structures. These hybrid materials can be synthesized following various synthetic strategies, including intercalative hybridization, core–shell architecture, surface anchoring, and defect control, among others. In this study, we discuss applications of the various advanced hybrid nanostructured materials to design efficient batteries and SC-based energy storage systems. Moreover, we focus on their features, limitations, and real-time resolutions.
