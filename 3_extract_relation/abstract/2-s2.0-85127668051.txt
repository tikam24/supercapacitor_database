Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are found interesting for various applications owing to their specific characteristics that could be enhanced/fine-tuned for the potential applications by an external magnetic field. Moreover, the surface modification of MNPs is advantageous to utilize both the magnetic and surface modifier characteristics. Because of the high-electronic conductivity and high-surface area, carbon-based materials are in high demand as a surface modifier to achieve hybrid MNPs. The carbon-modified MNPs are widely used for electrochemical applications, including supercapacitor, hydrogen evolution reaction, water splitting, and batteries. The presence of an external magnetic field during the preparation of nanomaterials and the electrochemical reactions has a significant influence on the magnetic and electrochemical characteristics and performance. Here the ferrites or ferrite-based oxides are MNPs that could modify their properties in the presence of carbon. The magnetic fieldâ€™s effect adopted during the synthesis of nanostructures permits the understanding of electrochemical behavior. Furthermore, it is necessary a discussion on the magnetic field assistance during the electrochemical development. Therefore, this chapter is devoted to elaborating on the effect of carbon modification on the magnetic properties and the electrochemical characteristics of the carbon-modified MNPs.
