Herein, we outline the fabrication of highly porous three-dimensional carbon-fiber network anchored with uniform metallic cobalt (Co) via electrospinning and subsequent post-modification approaches. First, cobalt acetate solution saturated electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibrous mat was subjected to sodium borohydride (NaBH4) solution which results in the fabrication of three dimensional (3D) hierarchical multilayer network. Restructuring of the 2D mat into multilayered sponges with metal particles entrapment is attributed to the in-situ generated hydrogen gas into the interconnected pores of the fibrous network simultaneous with reduction of cobalt salt into metallic cobalt by NaBH4. The resulting mesh was stabilized and carbonization at inert atmosphere to obtain metallic cobalt (Co) embedded 3D carbon nanofibrous networks (Co@3D-CNFs). Physicochemical characterization and electrochemical analysis were performed. Results show carbon network was found to be expanded with bubbling like structures often embedded metallic Co nanoparticles. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern confirms the existence of the metallic cobalt particles on the carbon fiber networks. Furthermore, we establish a resulting composite (Co@3D-CNFs) identify the enhanced electrochemical performance having specific capacitance 762 F g−1 compared to 173 and 180 F g−1 for corresponding @3D-CNFs and 2D carbon nanofiber network with cobalt doped (Co@2D-CNFs) counterparts, respectively. The assembled Co2@3D-CNFs//NGH ASC device exhibits a high energy density 24.6 W h Kg−1 at 797 W kg−1 power density with an operating voltage of 1.6 V (vs Ag/AgCl). The device further shows good capacitance retention (90.1%) after 5000 cycles. This research shows the simple and cost-effective strategy to make metallic particles embedded 3D porous carbonaceous electrode materials which can have great potential for energy storage application.
