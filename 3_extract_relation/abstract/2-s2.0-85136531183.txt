Prussian blue analogues are considered as promising supercapacitor electrode materials due to their high theoretical capacitance and low cost. Yet, they suffer from poor electronic conductivity and cycling life. Here, a redox dye polymer, poly(azure C) (PAC), is in-situ grown uniformly on CoFe Prussian blue analogue (CoFePBA). As a polymer mediator, the PAC coating on each PBA not only enhances the electronic conductivity and surface area, but also improves the structural stability and specific capacitance of PBA. As a result, the optimized CoFePBA@PAC possesses ultrahigh specific capacitance (968.67 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), superior rate performance (665.78 F g−1 at 10 A g−1), and excellent long-cycling stability (92.45% capacity retention after 2000 cycles). As an application, a fabricated CoFePBA@PAC//AC asymmetric supercapacitor (AC = activated carbon) maintains 84.7% capacitance retention in 2000 cycles at 1 A g−1 and displays a superior specific energy of 29.16 W h kg−1 at the power density of 799.78 W kg−1. These results demonstrate that redox dye polymer-coated PBAs with outstanding performance have a promising prospect in the field of energy storage.
