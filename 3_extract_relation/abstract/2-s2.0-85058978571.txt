MoS2/reduce graphene oxide composites were synthesized using hydrothermal method by varying three different surfactants like Cetyltrimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB), Sodium Dodecyl Sulfonate (SDS) and TritonX-100 (TX-100). SEM images of the composites show different morphologies. The specific surface area and electrochemical performance are largely dependent on the morphologies of the composites. The MSG/CTAB composites exhibit the largest surface area (133 m2·g−1) and the highest specific capacitance of 1022 F·g−1 at a current density of 0.3 A·g−1 among the studied composites. This composite is very promising for application in energy storage and other electrochemical devices.
