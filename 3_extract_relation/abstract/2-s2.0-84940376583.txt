Nano-polyaniline (nano-PANI) was deposited on hollow carbon spheres (HCS) to prepare nano-PANI/HCS composites via in-situ chemical polymerization. The composites combined the high pseudocapacitance of nano-PANI and the excellent porous structure of HCS which were prepared by the carbonization of a cross-linked co-polymer, poly(styrene-co-divinylbenzene-co-methylacrylic acid). The structure and properties of the resulting composites were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and nitrogen (N<inf>2</inf>) adsorption measurements, and the electrochemical behaviors were examined in 1 M H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> aqueous solution. Morphology was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transition electron microscopy (TEM). SEM and FTIR characterizations reveal that nano-PANI was successfully deposited on the surface of HCS; and electrochemical tests indicated that the nano-PANI/HCS composites exhibited a high specific capacitance of 435.0 F g<sup>-1</sup>, along with good long-term cyclic stability (â‰¤60% retention after 2000 cycles).
