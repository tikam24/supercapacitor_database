Hierarchical hollow nanostructured MnO2 has been fabricated using polyaniline spheres as reactive templates. The reaction between KMnO4 and polyaniline leads to the reduction of KMnO4 into Mn2+ ions that are further oxidized by excessive KMnO4 into MnO2 layers. Meanwhile, the polyaniline cores are over-oxidized and diffuse into the solution to form the cavity. The ratio of the KMnO4 and polyaniline plays an important role in achieving the hollow structure via establishing a reasonable diffusion/reaction rate equilibrium. Owing to the unique nanostructure, the MnO2 electrode exhibits a specific capacitance of 308 F g-1 at a current density of 0.2 A g-1 and maintains 91% capacitance value after 3000 cycles at a current density of 2 A g-1. An asymmetric supercapacitor assembled by the hollow MnO2 and activated carbon presents energy densities of 20.93∼7.23 W h kg-1 under the power densities of 180∼9000 W kg-1 and 24% capacitance fading is detected after 2000 cycles at a current density of 4 A g-1.
