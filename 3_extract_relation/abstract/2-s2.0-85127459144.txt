In this study, we report on the synthesis of bare and cobalt (Co)-doped nickel oxide nanoparticles (NPs) using a chemical precipitation method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirms that the crystallite size decreases after doping cobalt using the Scherrer formula. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer depicts the metal–oxygen bond (M–O) in the compounds. Scanning electron microscopy and Transmission electron microscopy revealed a mesoporous spherical-like morphology. XPS spectrum identifies the oxidation states of the constituent ions existing in the sample. The supercapacitor application of nanoparticles was examined via cyclic voltammetry (CV). The electrochemical performance verified the pseudocapacitive nature of the materials and the highest specific capacitance (717.11 F/g) for BNC3 was recorded, which is higher than values previously reported NiO materials. The weak crystalline nickel–cobalt is easy to form porous structure, which can significantly increase capacitance, also maintaining good rate performance. Cobalt-doped sample shows promising supercapacitor electrode material and ensures that NiO:Co could act as an enhanced working electrode for the upcoming generation of a supercapacitor.
