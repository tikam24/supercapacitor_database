Nanostructured CuO has been synthesized by surfactant-assisted chemical bath deposition method. The copper foam has been used as a conductive substrate for CuO deposition, which can be used as a binder-free electrode for supercapacitor. Due to the addition of surfactant Triton X-100, there is a tremendous change in structure, morphology, surface area and electrochemical property of copper oxide. The SEM images revealed the formation of cabbage rose-like structure by addition of Triton X-100. The binder free electrode developed using this cabbage rose- like CuO exhibits a high specific capacitance of 550 Fg −1 at scan rate 30 Ag −1 , and excellent rate capability.
