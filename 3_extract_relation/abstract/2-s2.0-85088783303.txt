In order to find a more optimized electrode material for supercapacitors, hydrothermally manufactured CoO nanoparticles doped with Ni were prepared in this research, and capacitor electrochemical performances were compared with those of non-doped CoO nanoparticles. The promoting electrochemical performances of doped CoO nanoparticles were demonstrated by specific capacitance rising significantly from 151.9 F/g of non-doped one to 279.5 F/g in current density of 1 A/g by galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements and from 151.9 F/g to 270.6 F/g in cyclic voltammetry experiments with a scan rate of 2 mV/s. Performance of doped CoO particles is proved to be better because of the increased specific surface area, decreasing pore radius distribution, most probable aperture reducing, as well as the more suitable hole longitudinal section features. Moreover, the upgraded electrode material exhibits significant beneficial synergistic effects (both capacitance expansion and Faradaic output steadiness), as well as high capacity retention (106 % after 500 cycling tests). Our findings pave a new way to obtain supercapacitor electrode materials with better electrochemical performance.
