The activated carbon particles made of charcoal by using an alkaline activation method were applied to the EDLC electrodes. The EDLC cells were assembled with 34% KOH water electrolyte. The density of energy was approximately 2.7Wh/L in the EDLC cells. The EDLC units (12V-EDLC) were composed of the 12 pieces of charcoal EDLC cell in a series connection. An electric power storage (1kWh class EDLC) was composed from the 30 pieces of 12 V-EDLC unit in a parallel connection. The electric power storage quantity of the 1kWh class EDLC was approximately the summation of the composed 12V-EDLCs of power storage on design. The internal resistance of the composed 1 kWh class EDLC was only 13mÎ©. From the obtained results, there is a possibility of the over 1 kWh class EDLC with low internal resistance is also composed of charcoal EDLCs.
