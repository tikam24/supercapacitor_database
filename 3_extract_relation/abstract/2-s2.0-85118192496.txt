To solve the problem of severe DC bus voltage fluctuations caused by frequent changes in the distributed electric propulsion aircraft load, and to further optimize the size and life of the hybrid energy storage system (HESS), this paper proposes a method based on three-step power distribution (TSPD). This strategy realizes the reasonable distribution of battery and supercapacitor power by using a low pass filter. Through the introduction of a supercapacitor state-of-charge (SOC) automatic recovery control and maximum power value dynamic limit strategy, the size of the HESS is optimized, and the service life of the energy storage device is extended. Finally, simulation and experiment platform are built to prove the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.
