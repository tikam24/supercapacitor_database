Lithium ion capacitor is a new electric storage device which combines high power density of a EDLC and high energy density of a battery. It has four time higher energy density than conventional supercapacitor and four time higher power density than a lithium battery. The characteristics of an electric storage device are usually determined by testing only one cell or the whole pack (without looking at the individual cells), with a low, constant current and by considering only one internal resistor[1]. This is the easy way and gives good performance results, but this is not the reality where the batteries or capacitors are submitted to. In this research individual cell parameters (two internal resistors and two internal capacitors) of Li capacitor are determined at cell level and at module level with FreedomCAR model and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy method. An extreme current profile is loaded to represent the reality. The model matches the measurements with an accuracy of 99%(+/-0.9%). The evolution of the parameters and the imbalance between the cells are studied as a function of SOC, frequency, current.
