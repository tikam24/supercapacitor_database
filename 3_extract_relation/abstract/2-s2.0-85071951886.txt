This paper presents a new class of supercapacitor with high mass-loading and high mechanical strength using reduced graphene oxide/carbon fiber (RGO/CF) composite electrodes for practical applications such as wearable and flexible energy storage systems. Key innovative claims include: 1) interconnected CF structures as the framework for enhanced mechanical strength, (2) high surface area RGO nanosheets for increased energy storage capability; 3) a complex 3D hierarchical structure to maintain highly efficient ion transports for high mass-loading independent of the thickness of the electrode up to 4 mg cm-2. As such, these high mass-loading electrodes could potentially find real-world applications such as wearable devices.
