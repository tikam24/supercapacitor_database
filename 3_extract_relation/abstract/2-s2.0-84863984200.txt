A method of in situ integrating carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into activated carbon (AC) matrix was developed to improve the performance of AC as a supercapacitor electrode. Glucose solution containing pre-dispersed CNTs was hydrothermally carbonized to be a char-like intermediate product, and finally converted into a "tube-in-AC" structure by the chemical activation using KOH. The "tube-in-AC" composite had oxygen content of 12.98 wt%, specific surface area of 1626 m2/g and 90% of 1-2 nm micropores. It exhibited capacitance of 378 F/g in the aqueous KOH electrolyte and excellent cyclibility under high current, that is, the capacitance only decreased 4.6% after 2000 cycles at scanning rate of 100 mV/s. These performances of "tube-in-AC" electrode are better than those of commercial AC electrodes, post-mixed with CNTs or carbon black. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
