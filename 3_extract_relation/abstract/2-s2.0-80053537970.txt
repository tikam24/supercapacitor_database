In this paper, a testing methodology for ageing quantification of supercapacitors (SC) for Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV) applications is investigated. The performances regeneration of supercapacitors after power cycling tests is studied. Parameters of double layer capacitor (EDCL) may be recovered after it is has faded. This phenomenon is characterized by an increase of the capacitance, a decrease of the series resistance and can be explained by the charges redistribution inside the porous carbon electrodes when the power cycling is stopped. So, capacitance recovery may be increasing the energy storage and the useful life of supercapacitors. Many factors have an influence in these phenomena like the age of ultracapacitors, also the stop duration and may be the voltage and temperature during stop.
