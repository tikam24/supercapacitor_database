The primary goal of this study is to construct and design the renewable resources such as solar and wind with the Power Management System (PMS). The Power Distribution control is used to regulate the energy flow from the solar to grid through bidirectional converter. Smart Grids that use renewable energy and provide a set of technological options for data sharing between customers and distributed energy. Verifying the battery's state of charge (SOC) reveals the average current is distributed between electric grid and battery. It is an efficient and cost-effective energy management scheme is proposed. Using a super capacitor also reduces current stress on the system's battery during sudden changes in producing power and load demand. Simulation analysis the both performance and efficiency of a energy management approach in a proposed system.
