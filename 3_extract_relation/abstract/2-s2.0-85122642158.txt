Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors combine the advantages of high energy density of batteries, high power density, and excellent cycling stability of supercapacitors. In this report, plasma treated carbon microspheres with N, P, O co-doping are prepared and used as cathode material for Zn ion hybrid supercapacitors. The combination of plasma treating and heteroatom doping plays a critical role in tailoring the electrochemical performance of the prepared carbon microspheres in Zn ion hybrid supercapacitors. A capacitance of 215.2 F g−1 is achieved for the as-prepared carbon microspheres at 0.1 A g−1, and the supercapacitor fabricated using the carbon microsphere display a high energy density of 54.4 Wh kg−1 with a power density 4000 W kg−1 and an excellent retention rate of ~ 100% after 10,000 cycles at 5 A g−1. This work is inspiring for the manufacturing and developing new high-performance carbon materials for Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitor
