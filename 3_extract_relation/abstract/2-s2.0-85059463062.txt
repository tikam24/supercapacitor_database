Graphene-based fibers synthesized under ambient temperature have not achieved excellent mechanical properties of high toughness or tensile strength compared with those synthesized by hydrothermal strategy or graphitization and annealing treatment. Inspired by the relationship between organic/inorganic hierarchical structure, interfacial interactions, and moderate growth temperature of natural nacre, we fabricate an ultratough graphene fiber via sequential toughening of hydrogen and ionic bonding through a wet-spinning method under ambient temperature. A slight amount of chitosan is introduced to form hydrogen bonding with graphene oxide nanosheets, and the ionic bonding is formed between graphene oxide nanosheets and divalent calcium ions. The optimized sequential toughening of hydrogen and ionic bonding results in an ultratough graphene fiber with toughness of 26.3 MJ/m 3 and ultimate tensile strength of 743.6 MPa. Meanwhile, the electrical conductivity of the resultant graphene fiber is as high as 179.0 S/cm. This kind of multifunctional graphene fiber shows promising applications in photovoltaic wires, flexible supercapacitor electrodes, wearable electronic textiles, fiber motors, etc. Furthermore, the strategy of sequential toughening of hydrogen and ionic bonding interactions also offers an avenue for constructing high-performance graphene-based fibers in the near future.
