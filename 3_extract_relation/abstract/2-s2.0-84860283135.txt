Dispersed carbon hollow-spheres with micropore shells and meso/macropore cores are prepared through a simple and efficient hydrothermal treatment directly using colloidal silica as template. The as-prepared hollow spheres are used as supercapacitor electrode material and exhibit high specific capacitance (about 270 F g -1 at 0.5 A g -1 in KOH aqueous electrolyte), long cyclic life and excellent rate capability, which is applicable for high performance electrical double-layer capacitors.
