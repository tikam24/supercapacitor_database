With the increasing energy consumption, it is urgent to find low cost, environmental protection and long-life energy storage equipment. With ultracapacitors, graphene material was attracted wide attention for their advantages about high specific capacitance, excellent rate performance and good electrical conductivity. The preparation methods, electrochemical properties and related mechanisms of graphene materials were summarized, with the purpose of studying the effects of different structures of graphene materials on the performance of supercapacitors, and to find graphene-based materials with excellent performance. Finally, the problems existing in graphene-complex electrode were analysed, and the future research focus was prospected.
