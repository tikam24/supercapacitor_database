A modular based research platform that is suitable for combined operation of distributed generation sources is presented. The modular concept is adopted with a view to allow for easy integration of various renewable sources such as PV cells, bio-gas etc. A hybrid supercapacitor-battery storage and a converter, which facilitates bi-directional energy flow, are used to improve the versatility of the system. The proposed concept is demonstrated with peak power point tracking of a novel Smart-Blade wind turbine system. A prototype system is implemented with Simulink and dSPACE, and results are presented in relation to a peak power point tracking algorithm. A user interface, which is implemented in Controldesk and allows for real time metering and performance analysis, is also presented. Â© 2008 IEEE.
