Functional transition metal oxides (TMOs) have gained significant attention for use as electrode materials in electrochemical energy storage devices because to the fascinating surface activities they provide. One dimensional (1D) VO2 is one of several TMOs whose behavior has not been thoroughly studied due to a lack of effective synthesis methods. Here, a novel chemical route is optimized to obtain fine 1D VO2 after a two-step hydrothermal process. The monoclinic structure of 1D VO2 with fine morphologies with diameters mostly in the range of 10â€“100 nm is confirmed by XRD, XPS, EDS, SEM, and HRTEM investigations. As a consequence, the best-in-class binder free electrode material for supercapacitance was achieved. A promising capacity of 615.8F/g at 2 A/g is achieved in 3 electrode system with 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Energy storage device characteristics were tested by fabricating a 2-electrode symmetric supercapacitor to account a high energy density of 122.3 Wh/kg at 2160 W/kg close to sodium/potassium ion batteries.
