In this paper, agricultural waste rice husk as carbon source, sodium hydroxide as activator, dry two-step activation was used to prepare activated carbon. The results of X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed that this activation method could effectively remove ash from rice husk and improve the porosity of activated carbon. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the activated carbon has a developed pore structure. And then the electrode of supercapacitor was prepared with activated carbon and assembled into a button capacitor. The electrochemical performance of supercapacitor was measured by constant current charging-discharging, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and alternating current (AC) impedance. In addition, the effect of pre-activation time on structure and electrochemical properties of activated carbon was investigated. The results showed that the activated carbon with the pre-activation time of 120 min possessed the largest specific capacitance of 219 F/g at 0.25 A/g for current density. And the capacitance retention rate was as high as 85.4% after 1000 cycles, indicating that the activated carbon electrode had ideal capacitance characteristics and stable cycling performance.
