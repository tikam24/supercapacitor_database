In this paper, we present a flexible supercapacitor on paper substrate consisting of gel-based electrolyte sandwiched between two nanoparticle modified nickel-based electrodes. The inherent porosity of the paper provides a porous template for electrodeposition of nickel micro- and nano-particles through them, increasing the overall surface area of the electrodes. This results in high-density supercapacitor with exceptional energy density. Since the fabrication process can be conducted in ambient environment without a need for cleanroom using low cost materials such as paper, it is highly suitable for low-cost sensors and medical diagnostics. We characterize the supercapacitor using pulsed transient measurements. Results indicate that for a 17cm 2 surface area, we achieve a capacitance of 10 Farads with just 6m series resistance.
