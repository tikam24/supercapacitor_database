Nickel-doped manganese dioxide (Ni-MnO2) for supercapacitors as electrode materials was successfully prepared by one-step chemical liquid phase coprecipitation with the different nickel doped proportions. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) were used for analysis of microstructure, micromorphology and chemical composition. As well the electrochemical properties were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectrometry (EIS). The results revealed that MnO2 synthesized in this work turned out to be Î´-MnO2 of homogeneous dispersion and excellent electrochemical properties. The specific capacitance of the 2% Ni-doped MnO2 was achieved to 300.85 F/g at 2mV/s through cyclic voltammetry and after 5000 circles the persistence rate of which still remained to 75%, exhibiting a preeminent advantage of stability and reversibility to naked MnO2.
