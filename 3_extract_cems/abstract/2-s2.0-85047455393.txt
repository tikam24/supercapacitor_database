SbPO4 hierarchical microspindles are successfully prepared through a facile solvothermal route. The X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electronic microscopy and nitrogen adsorption-desorption techniques are utilized to characterize the obtained SbPO4 materials. It is found out that the as-prepared SbPO4 microspindles are composed of nanoplates with mesoporous features. A self-assembly process is proposed for the formation of the SbPO4 microspindles. Besides, the SbPO4 microspindles is also tested as an electrode for supercapacitor, which demonstrates an enhanced electrochemical property due to their novel nanostructures.
