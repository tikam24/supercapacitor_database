Conformal hydrolysis of MOF precursors is a promising strategy to prepare hierarchical metal hydroxide electrode materials on a large scale with low cost and high efficiency. However, a complete transformation is challenging due to the normal "outside-in" conversion process. After studying the hydrolysis of Ni-MOF-74, which has regular 1D channels, we suggest that the transformation to Ni(OH)2 can occur simultaneously outside and within the precursor depending on the treatment temperature. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that a higher temperature weakens the steric effects of OH- ions and facilitates the diffusion in the regular channels, and therefore, a complete transformation from Ni-MOF-74 to Ni(OH)2 is achieved. It is for the first time demonstrated that the 1D channels of MOFs are utilized for the complete conformal hydrolysis of Ni-MOF-74 to Ni(OH)2 electrode materials. Meanwhile, we also perform pioneering work illustrating that the complete conformal hydrolysis is the key to the improved supercapacitor performances of the MOF-derived Ni(OH)2 electrodes. The prepared Ni(OH)2 electrode under the optimized conditions has a specific capacity of 713.2 C g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1, which is at least 28% larger than those of the Ni(OH)2 prepared at other temperatures. The detailed analyses based on CV and EIS of the obtained Ni(OH)2 electrodes indicate that the residual MOFs within electrodes due to incomplete hydrolysis significantly influence the diffusion length and diffusion efficiency of OH-, drastically lowering the supercapacitor performances.
