Potassium-ion capacitors (KICs) have received a surge of interest because of their higher reserves and lower costs of potassium than lithium. However, the cycle performance and capacity of potassium devices have been reported to be unsatisfactory. Herein, a unique crystalline MnCo2O4.5 and amorphous MnCo2S4 core/shell nanoscale flower structure grown on graphene (MCO@MCS@rGO) was synthesized by a two-step hydrothermal process and demonstrated in KICs. The MCO@MCS@rGO exhibits improved electrical conductivity and excellent structural integrity during the charging and discharging process. The reasons could be attributed to the cavity structure of MCO, the mechanical buffer and high electrolyte diffusion rate of MCS, and the auxiliary effect of graphene. The electrical conductivity of MCO@MCS shows a specific capacity of 272.3 mA h g-1 after 400 cycles at 1 A g-1 and a capacity of 125.6 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1. Besides, the MCO@MCS@rGO and high-surface-area activated carbon in KICs exhibit a relative energy density of 85.3 W h kg-1 and a power density of 9000 W kg-1 and outstanding cycling stability with a capacity retention of 76.6% after 5000 cycles. Moreover, the reaction mechanism of MCO@MCS@rGO in the K-ion cell was investigated systematically using X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy, providing guidance on the further development of pseudocapacitive materials.
