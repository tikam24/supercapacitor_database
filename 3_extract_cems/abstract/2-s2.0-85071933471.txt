Polyaniline has been widely developed for many applications, e.g. sensor, supercapacitor components, electrochromic devices, and anticorrosion pigments. Although the addition of polyaniline pigment in organic coatings has been an alternative for corrosion protection in industrial applications, the protection mechanism is still not fully understood. Herein in this study, as a part of the development of polyaniline/silicon dioxide coating for geothermal application, polyaniline has been deposited electrochemically on carbon steel surface in oxalic acid medium and tested in geothermal solution to understand the contribution of polyaniline to the corrosion protection of a polyaniline-based composite in the geothermal system. To observe the surface/interface reaction between the electrolyte and electrode surface during the electrochemical polymerization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was applied after each cycle. For corrosion study in the geothermal application, an artificial geothermal solution was used with the composition of 1,500 mg/l Cl-, 20 mg/l SO42-, 15 mg/l HCO3-, 200 mg/l Ca2+, 250 mg/l K+, and 600 mg/l Na+, and pH 4 to simulate a geothermal brine found in Sibayak, Indonesia. An electrochemical measurement was performed by monitoring the open circuit potential over seven days, with the interruption by EIS every 22 hours. The experiments were performed at room temperature and 150 °C (1 MPa) in an oxygen-free environment. Impedance spectra showed a reduction of the total impedance value of approximately 10 times for specimens measured at 150 °C compared to the specimens measured at room temperature, suggesting a less stable layer at high temperature.
