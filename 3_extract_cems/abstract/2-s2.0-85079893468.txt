Herein, a MoO3 film is directly synthesized on carbon cloth through a simple electrodeposition procedure with an annealing treatment. The clingy MoO3 film on carbon cloth fibers can speedily transfer electrons by virtue of the superior electrical conductivity of carbon cloth, while the outspread MoO3 film in the gap between the adjacent carbon cloth fibers can provide abundant channels for the diffusion of Li+. The electrochemical properties of the as-fabricated MoO3 electrode working as the cathode and anode materials are systematically studied, respectively. The specific capacitances of the MoO3 electrode within the potential ranges of 0–1.0 V and of −1.0 to 0 V are 603 and 835 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, respectively. The CV kinetic analysis reveals the surface capacitance-dominated charge storage mechanism for the MoO3 electrode under different potential windows. Moreover, the energy density of the as-assembled 2.0 V MoO3//MoO3 aqueous symmetric supercapacitor device can reach up to 78 Wh kg−1 at 1 kW kg−1. Notably, this device exhibits a brilliant lifespan with 98% storage retention after 8000 CV scans at 150 mV s−1. The ease of preparation and outstanding energy storage capability make this newly-assembled aqueous symmetric supercapacitor a highly potential candidate for practical applications.
