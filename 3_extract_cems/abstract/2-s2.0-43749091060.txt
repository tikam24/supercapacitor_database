Arrays of multi-segmented hybrid nanostructures of carbon nanotube and gold nanowires have been synthesized using a combination of chemical vapour deposition and electrodeposition methods and we further demonstrate that ultra-high power electrochemical double layer capacitors can be engineered using these hybrid nanowires, resulting in very high power densities.
