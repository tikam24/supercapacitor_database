In the article was assessed the dynamic stability of Electrical Submersible Pumps (ESP) in case of decrease and interruptions of voltage in the supply network. The permissible values and durations of decrease of voltage, at which the stable operation of the ESP is maintained, were revealed. The structure of the guaranteed power supply source was proposed. Dependences of the capacitance of the supercapacitor on the load power were revealed.
