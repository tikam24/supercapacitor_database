Freestanding and flexible graphene/polyaniline composite paper was prepared by an in situ anodic electropolymerization of polyaniline film on graphene paper. This graphene-based composite paper electrode, consisting of graphene/polyaniline composite sheets as building blocks, shows a favorable tensile strength of 12.6 MPa and a stable large electrochemical capacitance (233 F g-1 and 135 F cm-3 for gravimetric and volumetric capacitances), which outperforms many other currently available carbon-based flexible electrodes and is henceparticularly promising for flexible supercapacitors.
