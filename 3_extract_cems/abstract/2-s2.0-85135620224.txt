Flexible electronics have achieved development with the rising consumption of wearable devices. In this work, a novel polyacrylamide-graphene oxide-polyaniline composite hydrogel (PGPH) based flexible electrode with good mechanical and electrochemical properties is prepared. The polyacrylamide interpenetrating network can provide a porous substrate. The strong π–π interaction between graphene oxide and polyaniline can stabilize polyaniline. The area-specific capacitance of PGPH is 100.57 mF cm–2 at a current density of 5 mA cm–2, and the capacity remains at 75.54% after 1000 cycles. One layer of sodium alginate is spin-coated on top of the electrode to solve the problem of desorption of conductive materials and improve the cycle stability of the materials. The PGPH exhibits a conductivity of 5.11 S m–1 and elongation at break of 352%, which is significantly higher than that of common polyacrylamide-polyaniline hydrogel. Based on the good mechanical and electrochemical properties of PGPH, it has broad application prospects in flexible energy storage devices and flexible sensors.
