Radio frequency energy harvesting (RFEH) systems have emerged as a critical component for powering devices and replacing traditional batteries, with paper being one of the most promising substrates for use in flexible RFEH systems. However, previous paper-based electronics with optimized porosity, surface roughness, and hygroscopicity still face limitations in terms of the development of integrated foldable RFEH systems within a single sheet of paper. In the present study, a novel wax-printing control and water-based solution process are used to realize an integrated foldable RFEH system within a single sheet of paper. The proposed paper-based device includes vertically layered foldable metal electrodes, a via-hole, and stable conductive patterns with a sheet resistance of less than 1 Ω sq−1. The proposed RFEH system exhibits an RF/DC conversion efficiency of 60% and an operating voltage of 2.1 V in 100 s at a distance of 50 mm and a transmitted power of 50 mW. The integrated RFEH system also demonstrates stable foldability, with RFEH performance maintained up to a folding angle of 150°. The single-sheet paper-based RFEH system thus has the potential for use in practical applications associated with the remote powering of wearable and Internet-of-Things devices and in paper electronics.
