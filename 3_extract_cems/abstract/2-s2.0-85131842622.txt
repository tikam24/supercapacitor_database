Research on applications of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) as semiconductors has increased exponentially in last few years. MoS2 a prominent member of TMD group has attained adequate attention due to its outstanding features like change of bandgap from indirect to direct with change in size, high on/off ratio etc. The tunability of electronic and dielectric properties of MoS2 by altering the layer thickness, mechanical strain etc. has led to its prominence in multifaceted domains like optoelectronics, flexible electronics. The three phases of MoS2 has varied properties and applications in various domains. This chapter provides comprehensive information on the novel materials and synthesis methods, which tailor the properties as per requirement. Additionally, we also discuss prominent properties of MoS2 under the physical, electronic, and optical sections. It elucidates the semiconductor applications in areas like electronics/optoelectronics, batteries, supercapacitors, solar cells, photocatalysis, and sensing platforms along with present development status. Finally, we discuss the constraints and promising development features of the MoS2 on the basis of current developments. Â© 2022 Copyright
