Graphene is a monolayer of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms packed in a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice. In the form of polymer nanocomposite, it has shown multifunctional properties and performance due to the synergistic effect of both the components (i.e., graphene and polymer). However, its exceptional behavior strictly relies on a range of significant parameters such as graphene structure, functionalization, content, choice of polymer, overall structural design, and interfacial organization. Moreover, thermal, mechanical, electrical, barrier, and optical performances of polymer/graphene nanocomposite have been controlled by interfacial interactions as well as processing technique used. Solution mixing, melt processing, in situ method, and other techniques have enabled the graphene components to be dispersed and aligned in the polymer matrix. However, fine dispersion of graphene remains a major problem for the effective nanofiller reinforcement in polymer/graphene nanocomposite. A range of technological fields have been benefited using polymer/graphene nanocomposites including aerospace, organic solar cell, sensor, supercapacitor, etc. This chapter actually outlines the momentous progression from graphene-to polymer/graphene nanocomposite-to advance application in this field. It basically reports a comprehensive outlook on technological developments of polymer and graphene-based hybrid materials. Finally, future opportunities and challenges in the emerging technological field of polymer/graphene hybrids have been discussed.
