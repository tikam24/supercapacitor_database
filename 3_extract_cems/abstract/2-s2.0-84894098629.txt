Both NiMoO4 nanowires (NWs) and NiMoO4 ultrathin mesoporous nanosheets (NSs) are successfully synthesized on Ni foam via simple hydrothermal methods. Benefiting from the ultrathin and mesoporous features, the NiMoO4 NSs with high electrical conductivity exhibit an enhanced electrochemical performance compared with the NiMoO4 NWs. The NiMoO4 NS electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance (2840 F g-1 at 10 mA cm-2), good rate capability, electrochemical reversibility (the Coulombic efficiency is nearly 100%) and cycling stability (86.7% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles at a high current density of 15 mA cm-2). Impressively, the energy density can reach ∼12.5 × 10-5 Wh cm-2 at 5 mA cm-2. These excellent electrochemical performances indicate such NiMoO4 NSs-Ni foam electrodes could provide great potential for supercapacitor applications. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
