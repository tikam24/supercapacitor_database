Tencel fibers with different degree of original fibrosis were obtained through short-cut Tencel fibers via grinding，and used to prepare fibrillated tencel separator by wet-forming process. The effect of fiber geometry size and morphology on the pore structure of separators was further investigated. Eventually，the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors prepared from separators with different pore structure was studied. The results showed that the fiber size and the pore structure of the separator changed significantly after the tencel fibers were treated with different grinding revolutions. With the increase of the grinding revolutions（20000~250000 r），the proportion of coarse fibers decreased obviously and the average fiber length decreased from 2.29 mm to 0.76 mm. Consequently，the porosity of the separator decreased from 81.2% to 66.3%，the average pore size of the separator reduced from 1.20 μm to 0.27 μm，and the thickness of separator decreased from 47.7 μm to 26.0 μm. Whereas the change of the impedance，specific capacity，energy and power density of supercapacitors prepared from different fibrillated tencel separator was not significant.
