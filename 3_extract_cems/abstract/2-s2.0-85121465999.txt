CuCo2S4 is a well-studied promising electrode material for energy storage devices. In this work we describe a method to further increase its electrochemical performance by forming hollow core–shell structures of CuCo2S4 and polyaniline. CuCo2S4 nanoparticles are synthesized in micro-sized hollow sphere assemblies through facile solvothermal method. They exhibit high capacitive behavior with specific capacitance of about 839F g−1 at current density of 1 A g−1 in three-electrode configuration. Oxidative polymerization of aniline on surface of these micro-sized hollow spheres leads to form an electrochemically improved nanocomposite and the specific capacitance is increased to about 1120F g−1 at current density of 1 A g−1. This superior capacitive performance can be attributed to the hollow core–shell structure of the obtained nanocomposite. The assembled symmetric supercapacitor device based on as-prepared CuCo2S4/PAni nanocomposite exhibits a wide working potential of 2 V in 1 M Na2SO4 which can reach a high energy density and power density of 44.16 Wh kg−1 and 1 kW kg−1, respectively.
