The hierarchical porous carbons were prepared from rice husk bio-oil as carbon precursor by using magnesium chloride (MgCl2) as a template agent and potassium oxalate (K2C2O4) as activator. The effect of process parameters on the physicochemical properties and electrochemical properties of porous carbon was investigated. It was shown that K2C2O4 as an activator could etch the carbon skeleton and greatly increase the pore structure of carbon. MgCl2 template could improve the activation effect and increase the mesopore ratio. The BOC-3 prepared under the optimal activation conditions had a three-dimensional foam structure, high specific surface area (1961.1m2/g), high mesoporosity (47.25%) and high oxygen content (15.0%). Benefiting from the multiple synergistic effects of these properties, BOC-3 has a mass specific capacitance of 280F/g, and a specific capacitance retention rate of 94.8% after 5000 cycles of charging and discharging. BOC-3 had excellent rate performance and cycle stability. This study revealed that the combination of K2C2O4 activator and MgCl2 template could be used as an efficient route to fabricate hierarchical porous carbons for high-performance supercapacitors from bio-oil, which was conducive to the high value utilization of bio oil.
