Nanomaterials have various preferable properties for supercapacitor applications because of their nanosize, which is different from other sizes such as micron sizes and bulky behavior. Nanowires are one-dimensional (1D) materials, in which atoms grew in 1D only. 1D inherent morphologies of nanowires give a quick path for effective ion movement. Their high length/diameter ratio, large surface area, ease of electrode-electrolyte interaction, and easy adsorption of ions pay much attention to supercapacitor materials. In this chapter, we discuss the various synthesis approaches with current prospects of research in the field of nanowire-based supercapacitor electrode materials. It includes electric double layer capacitance (EDLC), pseudocapacitance, and hybrid-type nanowire materials in the supercapacitor field. And we also discuss symmetric and asymmetric nanowire systems. Furthermore, the advantages and disadvantages of nanowire-based materials in supercapacitors are also addressed. Finally, we examine the prime areas in research and development for commercializing nanowire-based supercapacitors.
