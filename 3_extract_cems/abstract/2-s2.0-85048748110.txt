Two kinds of electrode materials Ni(OH)2 and Ni(OH)2@Zn(OH)2 composite are fabricated on nickel foam. Electrochemical experiments indicate Ni(OH)2@Zn(OH)2 composite deserves further study due to high specific capacitance and good cycle stability, so that it can achieve energy storage and conversion as much as possible. When the hydrothermal time is different, the electrochemical performance of the sample is also different. Accurately, samples can obtain better electrochemical performance at 15 h, and the maximum specific capacitance of Ni(OH)2@Zn(OH)2 is 7.87 F cm−2 compared to Ni(OH)2 (0.61 F cm−2) at 5 mA cm−2. Even at 50 mA cm−2, specific capacitance is 5.24 F cm−2 and rate capability is 66.6%. Furthermore, Ni(OH)2@Zn(OH)2-15 h loses 19.8% after 1000 cycles, revealing the composite has an outstanding stable cycle. These properties also indicate Ni(OH)2@Zn(OH)2-15 h is a promising electrode material.
