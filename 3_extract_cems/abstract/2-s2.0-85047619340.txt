A one-step and energy-saving method was proposed to synthesize hierarchical and hollow Co(VO3)2-Co(OH)2 composite leaf arrays on carbon cloth, which expressed high capacitance (522 mF cm-2 or 803 F g-1 at the current density of 0.5 mA cm-2), good rate capability (79.5% capacitance retention after a 30-fold increase of the current density) and excellent cycling stability (90% capacitance retention after 15 000 charge-discharge cycles) when tested as a supercapacitor electrode.
