The development of energy management tools for next-generation PhotoVoltaic (PV) installations, including storage units, provides flexibility to distribution system operators. In this paper, the aggregation and implementation of these determinist energy management methods for business customers in a microgrid power system are presented. This paper proposes a determinist energy management system for a microgrid, including advanced PV generators with embedded storage units and a gas microturbine. The system is organized according to different functions and is implemented in two parts: a central energy management of the microgrid and a local power management at the customer side. The power planning is designed according to the prediction for PV power production and the load forecasting. The central and local management systems exchange data and order through a communication network. According to received grid power references, additional functions are also designed to manage locally the power flows between the various sources. Application to the case of a hybrid supercapacitor battery-based PV active generator is presented. Â© 2011 IEEE.
