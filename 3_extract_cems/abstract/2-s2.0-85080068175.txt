The study divulges the innovative route to the synthesis of strontium oxide (SrO) nanorods integrated with polyaniline (SrO-PANI) by using physical blending method and utilized for high performance asymmetric supercapacitor. The synthesized nanocomposites (NCs) are initially characterized by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The electrochemical performance of the NCs is evaluated for energy storage applications. The results demonstrated that the SrO-PANI NCs yield a maximum specific capacity (Qs) of 258 C g−1 at current density of 0.8 A g−1 in three electrode assembly and exhibit better electrochemical stability as compared to PANI and SrO nanorods. Supercapattery device is fabricated by using SrO-PANI NCs. Results reveal that supercapattery device gives an improved energy density of 24 Wh kg−1 and the maximum power density is 2240 W kg−1. Furthermore, the fabricated supercapattery device demonstrated an excellent cyclic stability withholding the capacity of 114% after continues 3000 GCD cycles. The capacitive and diffusive contribution in total capacity of the device is further investigated by using Dunn's model. The advancement of these cost effective NCs are fairly suitable for proficient energy storage devices.
