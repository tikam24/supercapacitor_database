Framework materials, including metal-organic framework materials (MOFs), Prussian blue/Prussian blue analogs (PB/PBAs), and covalent framework materials (COFs), are promising candidates for fabricating electrodes for use in electrochemical devices, especially supercapacitors. Supercapacitors have been widely investigated over the past decade. Active materials as electrode materials are vital to the development of the next generation of supercapacitors. Therefore, designing and fabricating novel electrode materials endowed with superior specific capacitance, perfect cycling stabilities, and distinguished power/energy density are crucial. In this review, we focus on framework materials - MOFs, PB/PBAs, and COFs - and report electrode materials based on their pristine forms, derivatives, and composites for supercapacitors. Recent advances and potential applications of framework materials in supercapacitors are also discussed. Furthermore, we discuss the opportunities and challenges for the future direction of supercapacitors based on framework materials.
