Corn cob-like Fe3O4@Ni3S2 nanocomposites was synthesized through a facile two-step hydrothermal process. The precursor was obtained by a facile calcination of a Fe-MOF template, then, nickel sulfide coated on iron oxide composites were synthesized using a hydrothermal method. In addition, the fabricated Fe3O4@Ni3S2 electrode revealed a great electrical performances with a maximum specific capacitance of 1200Fg-1 at 1Ag-1, a capacitance retention of 83% could be observed after 1000 cycles at a great charge-discharge current density of 5Ag-1. We believed that the excellent performance might be ascribed to the synergistic effect between the Fe3O4and Ni3S2. Thus, the results demonstrate the corn cob-like Fe3O4@Ni3S2 composite is prominent candidate in the field of supercapacitor applications.
