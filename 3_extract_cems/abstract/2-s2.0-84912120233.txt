This paper presents the simulation performance of various duty cycle ratios for bidirectional DC-DC converter for solar power application. The dual active bridge (DAB) converter topology has been chosen because of more accuracy at high power transfer applications with bidirectional power flow capability. For performance evaluation, input side of the converter is connected to the high voltage (HV) DC bus and output side of the converter is connected to the low voltage (LV) ultra capacitor. In this paper a 2 kW DAB converter is designed using PSCAD software. The average and peak values of parameters are studied during charging and discharging mode of operation of the converter. The performance of the DAB DC-DC converter is verified through the simulation studies.
