The aim of the study is to predict the use of supercapacitors. This paper focuses on the future growth curves of supercapacitors which is modeled using the Gompertz method. In the analysis, export data covering the years 2002-2020 from the world trade center and the growth rates in the same period from the World Bank were used, and reference scenarios that were accepted as possible maximum and minimum growing or average were created. It has been seen in the scenarios created that even if the S curves have different growth figures in the supercapacitor predictions, it has been determined that will reach saturation approximately between 2035 and 2040. In conclusion, the purpose of this study is not to predict the future, however, to guide possible studies by showing the possible effects and potential outputs of technology with scenarios. It is thought that supercapacitors will be mentioned frequently as an alternative energy storage system in the future.
