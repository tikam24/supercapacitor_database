Tremendous development in the field of portable electronics and hybrid electric vehicles has led to urgent and increasing demand in the field of high-energy storage devices. In recent years, many research efforts have been made for the development of more efficient energy-storage devices such as supercapacitors, batteries, and fuel cells. In particular, supercapacitors have great potential to meet the demands of both high energy density and power density in many advanced technologies. For the last half decade, graphene has attracted intense research interest for electrical double-layer capacitor (EDLC) applications. The unique electronic, thermal, mechanical, and chemical characteristics of graphene, along with the intrinsic benefits of a carbon material, make it a promising candidate for supercapacitor applications. This Review focuses on recent research developments in graphene-based supercapacitors, including doped graphene, activated graphene, graphene/metal oxide composites, graphene/polymer composites, and graphene-based asymmetric supercapacitors. The challenges and prospects of graphene-based supercapacitors are also discussed.
