The performances of the new generation energy storage devices are strongly dependent on the physical and chemical properties of the electrode materials; therefore, the development of high-activity electrode materials is of great importance. For this purpose, Graphene oxide: Antimony sulfide (on Si substrate) thin films were produced at different deposition temperatures via chemical bath deposition (CBD) and their supercapacitor performances were investigated. Specific capacitance values were calculated through time-dependent current-voltage (I-V) measurements in the range of -0.2 V - 0.8 V, at 5 mV/s, 10 mV/s and 20 mV/s scanning rates. The maximum specific capacitance for each deposition temperature at scanning rate of 5 mV/s was found to be 562 F/g, 549 F/g, 401 F/g and 254 F/g, respectively.
