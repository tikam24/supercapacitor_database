In highly porous carbon electrodes, a large fraction of pores can be inaccessible to the electrolyte, which translates into lower specific capacitances. This is accentuated at high current densities. To circumvent this, channels can be opened to enhance ionic diffusion. In this work, ionic channels were created using a pulsed laser. Nine sets of laser-scribing parameters (pulse fluence and spot spacing) were applied on two sets of carbon-based supercapacitor electrodes: K-bar hand-coated electrodes (“K”) and screen-printed electrodes (“SP”). Profilometry and scanning electron microscopy revealed that, before laser-scribing, the latter already had several holes and trenches, whilst the former were compact films. Electrochemical measurements in Na2SO4 indicate improvements in the rate capability of the laser-scribed SP electrodes, namely an up to 50% reduction of the rate at which energy density decreases as power densities increase. For laser-scribed K electrodes, the slope of the Ragone plot only decreased by ca. 20% in the best set of conditions. However, for both sets of electrodes, a negative trade-off is observed: laser processed electrodes seem to have a lower specific capacitance. This might be caused by the entrapment of debris in the laser-drilled holes, which could lead to the overestimation of the active mass. Moreover, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy analysis suggests that this may also be explained by the decrease in the oxygen functionalities and by its impact on the electrodes’ wettability. On the other hand, for electrodes tested in an organic electrolyte (tetrabutylammonium perchlorate in acetonitrile), the specific capacitance at 2 A/g was up to 66% higher for laser-scribed electrodes and an energy density of 13 Wh/kg was achieved even at 2.8 kW/kg.
