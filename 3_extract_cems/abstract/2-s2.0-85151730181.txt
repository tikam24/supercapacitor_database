Covalently functionalized 1T-MoS2 (Fc-1T-MoS2) nanosheets are synthesized by the chemical reaction between electrochemically exfoliated 1T-MoS2 nanosheets and iodobenzene. The NH2Ph ring functionality and 1T-MoS2 phase improves the electrochemical performance for supercapacitors by enhancing the charge density and electronic properties, which leads to fast charge transport and high charge storage capacity. The Fc-1T-MoS2 has a high specific capacitance of 501 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 with capacitance retention of 76.32% after 2000 cycles, which is 2.6 times of magnitude higher than that of bare 1T-MoS2 nanosheets. This study exposes the effect of functionalization of MoS2 nanosheets for supercapacitor applications.
