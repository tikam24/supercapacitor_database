The pristine ZnWO4 and ZnWO4/SnO2 composite was synthesized by solvothermal method. The crystal structure of the ZnWO4 and ZnWO4/SnO2 composite is determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern. The morphology of the samples investigated using SEM and found to be agglomerated structure. The samples are tested as an electrode material for supercapacitor using electrochemical techniques like cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Galvanostatic Charge-Discharge (GCD) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). The ZnWO4/SnO2 composite reveals 56.7 F/g specific capacitance at 1 mV/s scan rate which is higher than that of pristine material and also ZnWO4/SnO2 composite exhibits good cyclic stability than pure ZnWO4.
