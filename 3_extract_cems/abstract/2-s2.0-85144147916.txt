Smart devices that are portable and wearable have advanced significantly over the years. Further research on compatible storage devices with tiny, light and flexible properties is required to make wearable electronic devices more versatile, lightweight, smart, and commercially viable. Because of their advantages of having a high-power density, long cycle longevity, superior mechanical strength, good safety, and ease of assembly, supercapacitors have sparked a great deal of interest. Nevertheless, if the conventional supercapacitor is distorted by an external force, the power storage qualities would be significantly diminished or perhaps even eliminated. The primary component of capacitors is the electrode material, hence it is essential to produce extremely flexible electrode materials with superior energy-storage capabilities. This study introduces the supercapacitor energy storage theory and the current state of graphene applications in flexible supercapacitors. Additionally, a succinct summary of the research on pseudo, double-layer, and asymmetric capacitors is provided. Future progress and the difficulties that flexible supercapacitor electrode materials still confront are explored.
