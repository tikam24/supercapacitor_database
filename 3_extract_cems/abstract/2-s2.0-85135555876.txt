The development of bifunctional electrodes with good capacitive performance and efficient hydrogen evolution reaction activity is one of the potential solutions to combat energy depletion. In this study, flexible polyacrylonitrile-based carbon fiber mat with nitrogen doping and oxygen-containing functional group carbon structure was selected as the flexible substrate, and binder-free flexible Sb2Se3/polyacrylonitrile-based carbon fiber mat composite electrode was successfully prepared within 120 s using microwave synthesis. The electrode not only has a capacitance of 478.0C g−1 and retains 97.4% of the initial capacitance after 50,000 charge–discharge tests but also exhibits good HER activity of low overpotential (152 mV) and Tafel slope (78.4 mV/dec) in alkaline electrolyte. The performance of the assembled flexible asymmetric supercapacitor is almost unaffected by bending up to 180°. The device has an energy density of 21.3 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 800.0 W kg−1, indicating that the electrode has good prospects for portable energy storage applications.
