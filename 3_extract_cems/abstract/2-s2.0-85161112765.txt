Supercapacitors with high energy and power densities have become highly desirable in practical applications. Ionic liquids (ILs) are considered as promising electrolytes of supercapacitors owing to their excellent electrochemical stability window (approx. 4-6 V) and good thermal stability. However, the high viscosity (up to 102 mPa s) and low electric conductivity (<10 mS cm−1) at room-temperature extremely reduce the ion diffusion dynamics in the energy storage process, resulting in the unsatisfactory power density and rate performance of supercapacitors. Herein we propose a novel binary ionic liquids (BILs) hybrid electrolyte composed of two kinds of ILs in an organic solvent. Along with the organic solvent with high dielectric constant and low viscosity, the addition of binary cations effectively improves the electric conductivity and reduces the viscosity of IL electrolytes. By mixing trimethyl propylammonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([TMPA][TFSI]) and N-butyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([Pyr14][TFSI]) with an equal mole ratio in acetonitrile (1 M), the as-prepared BILs electrolyte shows superior electric conductivity (44.3 mS cm−1), low viscosity (0.692 mPa s), and a wide electrochemical stability window (4.82 V). The supercapacitors assembled with activated carbon electrodes (commercial mass loading) and this BILs electrolyte achieve a high working voltage of 3.1 V, leading to a maximum energy density of 28.3 W h kg−1 at 803.35 W kg−1 and a maximum power density of 32.16 kW kg−1 at 21.17 W h kg−1, which are obviously superior to those of commercial supercapacitors based on organic electrolytes (2.7 V).
