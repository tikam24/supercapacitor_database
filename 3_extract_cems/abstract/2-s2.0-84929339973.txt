Monodispersed hollow spindle-like nanosphere (HS-NS) and tetrapod nanorod (TP-NR) MnS nanocrystals are obtained via a facile template-free hydrothermal process. The MnS nanocrystals are used as supercapacitor materials and they exhibit high performances. The TP-NR nanocrystals show a higher specific capacitance of 704.5 F g-1 compared to the HS-NS nanocrystals, and both show higher values compared to manganese oxide. This journal is
