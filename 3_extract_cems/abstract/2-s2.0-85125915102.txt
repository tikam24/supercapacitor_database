Parameters of an EH system with a supercapacitor and piezo harvester located on a single arm of the UAV copter have been assessed in this manuscript. In order to check the efficiency of this system, firstly the electromechanical model of a piezo-harvester with homogenized material has been considered as well as mechanical parameters of the macro-fiber composite in the form of mode shapes and bending strains for different duty cycles of the PWM signal applied to a brushless DC motor have been determined. The obtained simulations results allow to determine a proper location of the piezo harvester on the considered structure and assess its electrical parameters. In order to do it, the electro-elastic fractional order model of the piezo composite in modal coordinates has been analyzed. The obtained experimental results of the EH system connected with the SSHI circuit allow to verify numerical results and indicated that the proposed approach can be used to power small devices located on the UAV platform with low power demand under certain conditions.
