This paper presents a design of capacity of supercapacitor and current control for a real-scale battery hybrid electric vehicle using an acceleration and deceleration scheme. In the MATLAB/SIMULINK model, the supercapacitor current control strategy is explained and implemented. The proposed strategies' performances are evaluated by running simulations with the Extra Urban Driving Cycle and the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule driving cycles to examine speed tracking performance, supercapacitor current control performance, battery voltage variation, power, and energy consumption. When compared to a full-scale battery electric vehicle, the advantages are highlighted. The viability and feasibility of the proposed control strategies are then validated using a small-scale simulation and experiment. The results show that the vehicle's applicability under deceleration-based design contributes the lowest battery energy- and power consumption and voltage variation of the battery against the other schemes.
