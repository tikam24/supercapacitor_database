Active carbon/rGO based on natural materials as coconut shell has been assembled with a coin cell in shape of prototype supercapacitor. The physical feature of active carbon/rGO electrode were characterized by FTIR, and FESEM. The Electrochemical performance of supercapacitor in 1 M LiPF6 electrolyte solution with density current of 12 mA/g until 163 mA/g were analyzed by galvanostatic charge-discharge test. The result showed that active carbon/rGO had absorption peaks at wave numbers 1592.27 cm-1 and 1288.45 cm-1 which were functional groups as C = C and C-O. The morphology of activated carbon has been covered by the presence of rGO that determines the agglomeration of rGO around the pore of activated carbon so that it affects the performance of supercapacitors. Supercapacitor has a specific capacitance charging of 20.5 F/g, and discharging of 19 F/g in density current 12 mA/g.
