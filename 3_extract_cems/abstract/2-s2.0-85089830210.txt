Four graphene materials and four activated carbons from various producers as well as carbon black from Cabot company and compositions of all these materials are tested as electrodes of electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLC). As revealed, the specific capacitance of graphene-based electrodes and capacitance retention with an increase in current are inferior to the values, which can be achieved with the best activated carbons specially developed for the EDLC application. Fairly good correlation between the surface area and the electrostatic capacitance of electrode materials is revealed resulting in the capacitance of electric double layer of graphene, graphenecontaining and activated carbon materials tested in this work to be close to 0.052 F/m2.
