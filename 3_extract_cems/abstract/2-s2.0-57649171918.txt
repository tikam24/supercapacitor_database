Pristine and high-energy milled activated carbon was chemically modified by vapor phase iodine reaction. Besides significant modification of the physical properties, moderate degrees of iodation results in about 200-500% increase in the volumetric capacity of activated carbons by an increase in the non-Faradaic performance and the development of a Faradaic reaction around 3.1 V. Examining variety of physical and electrochemical properties of iodated carbons, halide modification is proposed as a novel way to produce carbon electrodes for symmetric and asymmetric supercapacitors.
