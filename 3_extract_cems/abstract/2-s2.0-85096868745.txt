A hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) is a supercapacitor (SC) based on two different electrode materials. One electrode is based on battery type faradic reactions (also known as extrinsic pseudocapacitor), and the other is based on the electric double-layer capacitor (non-faradic, known as intrinsic pseudocapacitor). In HSC, generally negative electrode material includes carbon-based materials (such as activated carbon, carbon nanotubes (CNT's) and graphene), metal oxides (such as V2O5and MoO3), and their composites, while positive electrode materials are Ni, Co-based, mixed metal oxide, binary metal-based, layered double hydroxide (LDH) based materials etc. The synergy between high conductivity, specific surface area of negative electrode and architectures, heterostructures of positive electrodes is used to improve the overall electrochemical performances of the HSC's device. In this review, the basic charge storing mechanisms, a method for determination of capacitive and diffusion-controlled contribution, are explained. This review highlights the importance of hybrid solid-state supercapacitors (HSSC's) as energy storage devices. Finally, recent advancement in the HSSC fields is discussed and will guide future work in the HSSC field.
