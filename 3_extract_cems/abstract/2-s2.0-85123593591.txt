In this study, obtaining the PI control coefficients of a power converter using the heuristic optimization method was investigated. A new converter has been designed to increase the lifetime of the energy storage unit of a satellite power subsystem. It is also possible to increase the active duty life of the satellite by using the aforementioned converter according to the increased battery life.
