This paper focuses on the need of Primary and Secondary Frequency control of a low inertia power system. The Sri Lankan Power System is taken as a case study. Due to the high penetration of wind and solar injection to the Sri Lankan power system, the inertia of the system is reduced drastically. The dynamic stability of the system due to high solar power penetration, is first discussed. The problems of the current system and the repercussions of such problems to the power system are then discussed related to the stability of the system where there is severe machine tripping. The paper also points out the remedial action needed to be taken in order to increase the power quality of the power system. The main remedial actions addressed in this paper are Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) and supercapacitors. In the third section of the paper a discussion is done on the BESS systems that are already installed in the world and how they are incorporated to achieve dynamic stability.
