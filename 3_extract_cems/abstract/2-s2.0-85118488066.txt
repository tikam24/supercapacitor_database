Lithiated SnS2 (LiSnS2) is a highly promising supercapacitor electrode owing to the wide interlayer spaces in its crystal structure and the large effective surface area, afforded by its nanostructure. Here, LiSnS2 micro-flowers with a nominal conductivity of ∼0.4 μS cm−1 are directly prepared for the first time, by solid-sate diffusion, with a 2D layered rhombohedral pre-lithiated structure, affording facile intercalation of electrolyte cations in an asymmetric supercapacitor, with Bakelite sourced porous carbon (BSPC) as the anode. Significant enhancement in the storage performance by mixing LiSnS2 with BSPC in 3:1 (High) and 1.66:1 (Low) weight ratios, with the High LiSnS2 cell encompassing an aqueous electrolyte delivering a specific capacitance (SC) of 249 F g−1 at current density of 1 A g−1, Emax and Pmax of 34 Wh kg−1 and 3.5 kW kg−1, and enduring 10,000 cycles, with 88% SC retention, over a potential window of 1.4 V. Both diffusive and capacitive contributions account for this performance with the ability of short diffusion path lengths of the sulfide, and the large electrical conductivity of BSPC imparting a fast kinetic response to the cell. A non-aqueous High LiSnS2 supercapacitor, could be charged to a high voltage of 2.7 V, with a SC of 32 F g−1, thus ratifying the suitability of this cell for practical applications. This work opens up the possibility of developing a variety of previously difficult to synthesize pre-lithiated metal chalcogenides or oxides, for such materials are more conducive for undergoing reversible ion-intercalation/de-intercalation contrasting with their non-lithiated analogues and have the potential to give a tremendous boost to their energy storage performances.
