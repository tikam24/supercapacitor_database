Electrodes based on Zn2+-doped polyaniline/graphene oxide (Zn2+/PANI/GO) were synthesized on stainless steel mesh substrates in H2SO4 solution via electrochemical codeposition. Different concentrations of graphene oxide (GO) were incorporated into the films to improve the electrochemical performance of the electrodes. Electrochemical properties of the films were tested by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge tests, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, in a three-electrode system. The maximum specific capacitance of the Zn2+/PANI/GO film with a GO concentration of 15 mg L−1 was found to be 1266 F g−1 at a scan rate of 3 mV s−1. This value was higher than that of a Zn2+ doped polyaniline (Zn2+/PANI) film (814 F g−1). The Zn2+/PANI/GO film also showed good cycling stability, retaining over 86% of its initial capacitance after 1000 cycles. These results indicate that the Zn2+/PANI/GO composites can be applied as high performance supercapacitor electrodes.
