Batteries are energy storage devices consisting of electrochemical cells that convert chemical energy into electrical energy. Today we have a wide range of batteries available in the market. This paper deals with Lead-acid batteries as stationary storage. Basic steps related to designing a standalone DC microgrid are discussed, which helps design an efficient system with a proper battery selection according to the needs. The paper proposes a case study to identify how to increase the efficiency of the system and battery. The paper identifies the major problem faced by Lead-acid batteries in microgrid storage and proposes the solution of the following using a supercapacitor. An isolated microgrid with lead-acid as the storage unit, MATLAB model is used to study battery power, current, and voltage according to which the problem due to which Lead-acid efficiency is analyzed. The results of the case study solution the identified problem.
