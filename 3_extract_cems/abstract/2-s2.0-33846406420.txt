Polypyrrole (PPy) nanowires were prepared in high yield by using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as "soft template" in 0.2 M HCl aqueous solution. From the observation of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), PPy nanowires with a diameter in the range of 30-50 nm was obtained. The electrochemical capacitance of PPy nanowires was characterized by cyclic voltammetry, charge/discharge test and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Compared with conventional PPy, PPy nanowires had the higher specific capacitance and energy density. The capacitor also exhibited the good cycling performance with 1000 cycles. Â© 2006 Elsevier B.V.
