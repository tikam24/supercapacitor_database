Ternary layered double hydroxide (LDH) materials have shown promising application in hybrid supercapacitors. However, the low electrical conductivity of LDHs is still a restriction to their performance. Herein, carbon nanotubes/cobalt–nickel–iron LDH (CNTs/CoNiFe-LDH) hybrid material was prepared by a one-step hydrothermal approach for the first time. The presence of CNTs improved the conductivity and surface area of the electrode, leading to an enhanced electrochemical performance. The CNTs/CoNiFe-LDH hybrid electrode exhibited high specific capacity 170.6 mAh g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, with a capacity retention of 75% at 10 A g−1 . CNTs/CoNiFe-LDH//AC asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was also assembled, which had high specific capacitance (96.1 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1 ), good cycling stability (85.0% after 3000 cycles at 15 A g−1 ) and high energy density (29.9 W h kg−1 at the power density of 750.5 W kg−1 ). Therefore, the CNTs/CoNiFe-LDH material could be used for hybrid supercapacitor electrodes.
