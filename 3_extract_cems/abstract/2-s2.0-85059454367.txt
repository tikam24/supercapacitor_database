Self-stabilized and well-defined chlorine-doped carbonated cobalt hydroxide nanowires have been obtained as a binder-free electrode via a facile method. The Co material has a unique well-defined needle-like structure, composed of highly aligned monomer with the diameter of about 3â€“10 nm and numerous surface pores, which makes it have potential for high-performance electrochemical capacitors. The test results show the directly acquired Co-ClNWs(NiE) electrode in three-electrode system can reach the specific capacity of more than 2150 F/g under the current density of 1 A/g, accompanied by a good cycling stability of 94.3% capacitance retention after 500 cycles, and exhibits a high energy density of 41.8 W h/kg at the power density of 1280.7 W/kg when using it as the positive electrode of an asymmetric supercapacitor. After making a comparison of the current material with the conventional electrodes, we can find that a better electrochemical performance can be achieved with a more convenient one-step method. Therefore, we, in this work, may provide a new type of manufacturing concept for future electrode treatment.
