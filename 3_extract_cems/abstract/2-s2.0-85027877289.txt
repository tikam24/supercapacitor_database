This paper presents a study by simulation of the performance of two of the current topologies for the interconnection of batteries and supercapacitors in a Hybrid Energy Storage System with potential application in electric microgrids. Converters selection is made taking into account the most used topologies documented in the literature for the integration of storage technologies. Control strategies are implemented pursuing the goal of prolonging the lifetime of batteries, using the supercapacitor for reducing the dynamic component of the current from a pulsed current load to the batteries.
