A novel route is developed to synthesize highly uniform N-doped porous carbon spheres (NCS) with a tailorable size ranging from 86 to 205 nm depending on their precursors of phenolic-resin-based analogues. Solid-state NMR and FTIR spectra confirm that the as-synthesized polymer spheres are composed of typical phenolic resin. After activation treatment with KOH, the NCS with a diameter of 86 nm possesses a high surface area of 1462 m 2 g -1 coupled with hierarchical (micro and meso) pore structures. Upon these advantages, the prepared carbon sample endows the supercapacitor with high specific capacitance up to 247 F g -1 at 1 A g -1 with excellent rate performance and high cycling stability. Also, the specific energy density is 6.74 Wh kg -1 at a current density of 0.1 A g -1 . Therefore, the as-prepared uniform N-doped porous carbon spheres represent a promising candidate for an efficient electrode material.
