In this study, a three-dimensional hybrid was synthesized via depositing of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and ferroferric oxide (Fe3O4) particles on the abandoned disposable sheet mask fabric, followed by the polymerization of polypyrrole (PPY). The as-prepared nanocomposite shows superior electrochemical performances when it was used for the material for the flexible supercapacitor electrode. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of CNTs, Fe3O4 and PPY in such a porous structure, cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements indicated that the as-prepared hybrid possessed a good reversibility and high specific capacity at various scanning rates. It turned out that the as-prepared electrode demonstrated a high specific capacitance of 221.7F/g at the scanning rate of 50mV/s and long-life cycling stability of 88.2% after 10000 cycles. Besides, the electrode composite had good flexibility after repeated bending times of 3000. With the exception of improved electrochemical properties, this hybrid electrode material also showed many advantages, including facile preparation, flexibility and cost savings. These results will provide new ideas and solutions to design and fabricate the flexible supercapacitors, which has great prospect in the development of energy storage devices.
