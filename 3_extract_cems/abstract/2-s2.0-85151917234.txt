Cost effective and safe zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZIHSCs), coupling the virtues of aqueous rechargeable supercapacitors and batteries, hold great potential in the energy storage field. However, ZIHSCs development is encumbered by the fatal obstacles of carbon cathodes, including inferior capacity and low energy and power densities. Herein, inspired by the intrinsic feature of well-developed metabolic channels, three-dimensional channels-enriched biomass is effectively converted into a novel N/O co-doped 2D arcuate carbon nanosheets cathode with robust 2D arcuate architecture, an optimized hierarchical porosity plus an ultrahigh surface area and high N/O co-doping contents for high energy-power ZIHSCs to conquer these barriers. The comprehensive integration of these properties affords extensive interfacial active sites for high energy density and fast kinetics for a high power output, thereby endowing remarkable Zn2+ storage capability, including specific capacity of 198.4 mAh/g at 0.2 A/g, capacity retention of 57.2% at a 100-fold enlarged current, and energy and power densities of 155.6 Wh/kg and 18.9 kW/kg, together with no loss in the capacity reservation of 10,000 cycles. Most excitingly, the resultant carbon-based quasi-solid ZIHSC device gave expressive specific capacity of 166.6 mAh/g, outstanding energy density of 123.4 Wh/kg, and excellent mechanical flexibility.
