Pristine polypyrrole (PPy) suffers from poor structural stability and comparatively less electrochemical durability. Ruthenium oxide has been known to provide the good structural, electrochemical stability and durable performance. Present work concentrates on the impact of addition of ruthenium trichloride (RuCl3) during the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) synthesis on the specific capacitance (SC), cycling stability and the structural stability of the ruthenium oxide (RuO2) incorporated PPy hybrid flexible electrodes (HFEs). The synthesis has been carried out by using the simple SILAR technique using stainless steel strips as flexible substrates, 0.1M pyrrole as monomer blended with different percentages of RuCl3 and 30 wt% of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as oxidizer and oxidative polymerizing agent. The prepared HFEs were electrochemically analyzed by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The electrodes exhibit slight variation in surface morphology as the interconnected granules become small and get closely attached and then the surface is occupied with the interconnected spheres coated with PPy matrix. The observed maximum SC was found to be 1321.67 Fg-1 at 5 mVs-1 in 0.2M sodium sulphate (Na2SO4). The HFE prepared with optimum concentration of ruthenium chloride (RuCl3) exhibit 86% retention of SC even after 5000 cycles. A symmetric device has been fabricated using the optimized electrodes which has SC of 71.5 Fg-1 at 18.18 Ag-1. The device also retains 86.05% of the SC even after 5000 cycles. The measured specific energy and power were 286.18 Whg-1+ and 36.36 Wg-1, respectively.
