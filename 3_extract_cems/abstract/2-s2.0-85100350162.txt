The development of wearable electronic devices and energy storage devices that are thin, lightweight, and flexible has led to the fabrication of flexible all-solid-state supercapacitors with skyscraping mechanical endurance and foldability. Herein, for the first time, we have delineated the assembly of a high-performance mechanically flexible all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor device from the nanocomposite comprising (Ag0.50Ni0.50)90-rGO10 and pure rGO as the cathode and anode electrode, respectively. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) gel containing 3 M KOH is used as the electrolyte and separator. This device delivers a high power density of 1700 W kg-1 without compromising with an energy density value of 49 W h kg-1 which is much higher in comparison to many of the existing supercapacitors in the market and substantive findings in the literature. Also, when the fabricated device is subjected to 5000 galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) cycles, a retention of âˆ¼97% of the initial specific capacitance value is observed, displaying its high cycling stability. The omnidirectional mechanical robustness of this supercapacitor makes it flexible to that extent that it tends to exhibit high electrochemical performance even under extreme conditions and the specific capacitance value is pragmatically left unmodified when the device was subjected to different bending conditions. This device showcased its practical application by illuminating seven light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and appeared as an attractive energy storage unit for handy devices.
