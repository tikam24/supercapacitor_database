Supercapacitors are playing great roles in research-and-development field of power engineering as a new energy store device. The porous carbon material developed in our laboratory exhibits perfect physical structure and properties. Its good electrochemical performances were confirmed by the experiment of CV and alternating current impedance analysis etc. The specific capacitance of active carbon was 172 F · g-1 at the 20 mA · cm-2 current density discharge. The RuO2/active carbon composite electrode was prepared and the specific capacitance amounts to 359 F · g-1, electrochemical performance of supercapacitor composed of RuO2/active carbon composite electrode and the "pseudo-capacitance" characteristic of ruthenium oxide was discussed in detail in this paper.
