Unstable nanoparticles/carbonaceous nanomaterial synthesis results in inhomogeneous mass and charge transfer across the electrode/electrolyte interface. And high-entropy alloy nanoparticles (HEA-NPs) are rarely reported in supercapacitors. Herein, this study reports an uniform carbothermal shock (CTS) of quinary HEA-NPs on super aligned electrospun carbon nanofibers (ACNFs). The key to this approach is coupling a self-designed collector for aligned CNFs and a suitable CTS current direction. For the electrochemical performance, the FeNiCoMnMg HEA-NPs/ACNFs electrodes with 5 mM precursor concentration show a high capacitance of 203 F/g and a specific energy density of 21.7 Wh/kg. These findings give hints for the HEA-NPs/carbonaceous nanomaterials as promising candidates for energy storage applications.
