Graphene oxide nanoplate-MnO 2 composites have been synthesized by oxidizing part of the carbon atoms in the framework of graphene oxide nanoplates at ambient temperature. The composites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). Their microstructures and morphologies have affected their electrochemical properties. Compared with MnO 2 nanoparticles, the nanocomposite prepared reveals better electrochemical properties as a supercapacitor electrode material. Â© (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
