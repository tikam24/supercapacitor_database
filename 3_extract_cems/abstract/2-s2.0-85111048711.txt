We have made a first attempt to build a novel Tin doped indium oxide@Manganese oxide (ITO@Mn3O4) nanocomposite electrode to overcome the detriments of Mn3O4 such as low conductivity and small potential window. Herein, we have synthesized the ITO@Mn3O4 nanocomposite by growing Mn3O4 nanoplates over ITO nanofibers synthesized by electrospinning technique. Benefitted from, the high conductivity and negative operating potential window of ITO exceptionally increased in the electrochemical performance of ITO@Mn3O4 was observed. The specific capacitance of optimized ITO@Mn3O4 nanocomposite reached up to 823 F/g at 1 mA/cm2 in a wide potential window of 2 V using Na2SO4 electrolyte. To determine the practical feasibility an ITO@Mn3O4//ITO@Mn3O4 all-solid-state symmetric device was developed, which operated very well in a 2.2 V voltage window. It was found to deliver a maximum energy density of 88 Wh/kg and a power density of 550 W/kg. This novel composite inferred the significance of using simple design to build a high-performance device.
