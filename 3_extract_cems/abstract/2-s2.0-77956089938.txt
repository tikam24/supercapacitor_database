Hybrid power sources with energetic buffer technology are based on supercapacitors with bi-directional dc-dc converters. This paper describes the application of bi-directional converters with Supercapacitors for remote area power hybrid sources using photovoltaic sources, Diesel Generator Sets and battery storage. One of the future trends in that area of power sources supercapacitors are introduced. The system of power electronic converter consists of ac-dc rectifier, dc-dc, dc-ac inverter, bi-directional converter and supercapacitor was set up and verified. This concept of power electronics is beneficial, compared with the un-centralized system without battery buffer, since higher dynamic behaviours can be achieved. Power management of hybrid power sources is also presented.
