The vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) has been attached to functionalized multiwall carbon nanotube (f-MWCNT) networks by simplified solution based approach. The product V2O5/f-MWCNT hybrid nanocomposite has been exploited for supercapacitor electrode application. The addition of f-MWCNT with V2O5 significantly improves the surface area and conductivity, which leads the high energy and power densities. This nanocomposite shows highest specific capacitance up to 410 F g-1 and 280 F g-1 at current densities of 0.5 and 10 A g-1 respectively. Moreover, this nanocomposite provides excellent energy density (∼57 W h kg-1), better rate capacity, and a good retention of capacity (∼86%) up to 600 cycles of charge-discharge. Further a symmetric supercapacitor was fabricated using V2O5/f-MWCNT nanocomposite as electrodes. It shows a specific capacitance of 64 F g -1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1. © the Partner Organisations 2014.
