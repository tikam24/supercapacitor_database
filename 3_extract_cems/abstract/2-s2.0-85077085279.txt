Controllably adjusting the porosity and the heteroatom content has become extremely attractive for increasing the energy storage capacity of carbon materials. In this work, petal-shaped N-doping carbon materials with super-high specific surface area (2752 m2 g−1) and enriched micropores (90.1 %) have been synthesized by using renewable spikes of terminalia catappa as raw materials via a facile and feasible method. The results confirmed that the prepared N-doping carbon material exhibits outstanding electrochemical performances. The specific capacitance reaches up to 503 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and 306 F g−1 at 50 A g−1; cycling stability maintains 100.2 % after 10000 cycles. The fabricated symmetric supercapacitor shows an attractive energy density of 30.5 W h Kg−1 at a power density of 492.4 W Kg−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Moreover, this study opens up a new way to enhance the micropore proportion and N content of carbon materials and displays the unique petal-shaped nano-flakes morphology that can maximally expose the surface of carbon materials.
