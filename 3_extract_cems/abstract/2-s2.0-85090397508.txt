Recent research interest has been shifted toward energy storage devices, especially supercapacitors, which provide high specific power and long cycle life. In this context, two-dimensional organic polymers are a class of versatile materials found to be useful in energy storage applications. However, the performance is not promising due to the low capacitance, energy density, and cyclic stability. Here, we report a two-dimensional polymer derived from hexaaminobenzene and pyromellitic dianhydride and its excellent supercapacitor performance. The specific capacitance of the two-dimensional polymer is found to be 805 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 current density in galvanostatic charge-discharge, which is the highest among the organic two-dimensional polymer and most of the carbon-based materials. The superior performance of the 2D-polymer compared to a model derivative (350 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 current density) points to the critical role of a 2D-platform to excel. The high energy density, excellent cyclic stability, and low self-discharge rate support the 2D-polymer supercapacitor as a promising candidate for futuristic applications.
