A facile approach of introducing ultrasound for the large-scale rapid synthesis of core-shell C@MnO2 nano particles was suggested for practical application in supercapacitors. Results showed that the mesoporous C@MnO2 particles possess a high specific surface area of 62.8 m2 g−1. With the use of stable gel electrolyte, the C@MnO2 electrode delivers a specific capacitance of 177 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 under a high mass loading of 6 mg cm−2. When the current density increases to 10 A g−1, the specific capacitance reaches up to 128 F g−1. Long-term test confirms only 8.3% decline in initial capacitance after 5000 cycles, thus implying the practical application of MnO2 for energy storage devices.
