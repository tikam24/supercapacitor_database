Nanocomposites of Au-Mn3O4 flowers decorated on graphene oxide have been developed through a hydrothermal technique to improve the efficiency and electrochemical behavior of transition metal oxide (TMO)-based energy materials. The mechanism for the formation of the flower morphology of the nanocomposites has been proposed with the help of time-dependent electron microscopy imaging. The surface properties and chemical composition of the nanocomposites were thoroughly investigated. The optimized nanocomposite has shown a high specific capacitance (475 F g−1) and excellent energy density (55.8 W h kg−1). The charge storage mechanism of the materials was also examined to provide an in-depth understanding of the superior electrochemical performance of the nanocomposites. In addition, the presence of graphitic carbon in the nanocomposites has resulted in better cycle stability of Au-Mn3O4//GO in an acidic electrolyte.
