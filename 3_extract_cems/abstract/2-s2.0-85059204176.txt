Transition metal sulfides with designed nanostructure have attracted significant research interest as electrode materials for supercapacitors. In this work, core-shell structured Co9S8@N-C@MoS2 nanocubes have been successfully fabricated through a sulfuration process based on ZIF-67 precursor. Due to improved electrical conductivity and large surface area, Co9S8@N-C@MoS2 nanocubes with core-shell heterostructure exhibit better electrochemical performance in supercapacitors compared with Co9S8. Moreover, the morphology of core-shell structured Co9S8@N-C@MoS2 nanocubes can be well-adjusted by tuning the ratio between Co9S8 and MoS2. The homogeneous core-shell structured Co9S8@N-C@MoS2 nanocubes (S-3) can be obtained with the mass ratio of Na2MoO4Â·2H2O and CH4N2S at 1:2. And the obtained core-shell structured S-3 delivers a high specific capacitance of 410.0 F g-1 at the current density of 10.0 A g-1 after 20000 cycles with excellent cycling stability (101.7% of the initial value). The excellent electrochemical property is mainly due to the unique structure which induces synergistic effects between Co9S8 and MoS2.
