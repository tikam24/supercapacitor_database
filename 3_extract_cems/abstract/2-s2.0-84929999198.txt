A novel approach for the recovery of Ni, P and S was proposed through forming graphene oxide/NiAl layered double-hydroxide composite (GO/NiAl-LDHs) from the spent electroless nickel (EN) plating baths with an aid of ultrasonic wave. The recovery efficiency of Ni, P and S could reach to 97.2%, 90.7% and 91.9% under the optimum conditions (pH 5.5, Ni<sup>2+</sup>:Al<sup>3+</sup> 2:1 (molar), ultrasonic intensity 7.7 W/cm with 60 min). The recovered material was full characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscope, field emission scanning electron microscope techniques, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Icp-Oes inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry and electrochemistry techniques. The produced GO/NiAl-LDHs shows promising applications as catalyst for methanol oxidation and electrode material for supercapacitor with a maximum specific capacitance of 911 F/g at current density of 1.0 A/g.
