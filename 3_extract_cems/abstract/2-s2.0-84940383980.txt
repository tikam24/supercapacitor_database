We present a comprehensive study on the influence of the synthesis atmosphere on the structure and properties of nanodiamond-derived carbon onions. Carbon onions were synthesized at 1300 and 1700 °C in high vacuum or argon flow, using rapid dynamic heating and cooling. High vacuum annealing yielded carbon onions with nearly perfect spherical shape. An increase in surface area was caused by a decrease in particle density when transitioning from sp<sup>3</sup> to sp<sup>2</sup> hybridization and negligible amounts of disordered carbon were produced. In contrast, carbon onions from annealing nanodiamonds in flowing argon are highly interconnected by few-layer graphene nanoribbons. The presence of the latter improves the electrical conductivity, which is reflected by an enhanced power handling ability of supercapacitor electrodes operated in an organic electrolyte (1 M tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate in acetonitrile). Carbon onions synthesized in argon flow at 1700 °C show a specific capacitance of 20 F/g at 20 A/g current density and 2.7 V cell voltage which is an improvement of more than 40% compared to vacuum annealing. The same effect was measured for a synthesis temperature of 1300 °C, with a 140% higher capacitance at 20 A/g for argon flow compared to vacuum annealing.
