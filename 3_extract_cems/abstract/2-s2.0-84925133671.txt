Three-dimensional graphitic carbon nitride functionalized graphene composites (g-C3N4@G) were grown using a simple one-step hydrothermal reduction. The super-capacitive properties of the as-formed 3D g-C3N4@G were evaluated in a symmetrical supercapacitor. It is found that the 3D g-C3N4@G exhibit a high specific capacitance of 264 F g-1 and good cycling stability.
