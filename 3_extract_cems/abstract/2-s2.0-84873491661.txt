The paper shows a 25kW series resonant converter. It is part of the power train of an electric vehicle. It transfers energy from a supercapacitor stack to a power electric motor. The paper explains the design of this kind of converters and shows the measurements at different power levels. This converter provides galvanic isolation between the supercapacitors and the voltage bus. The efficiency of the converter is higher than 92%. Â© 2012 IEEE.
