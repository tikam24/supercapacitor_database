Bi 2 S 3 nano rods-graphene (BG) composite material was synthesized by a simple one step precipitation method. The crystallanity, structural and morphological properties were studied by the X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy techniques. The photocatalytic activity of BG was evaluated by the photocatalytic degradation of malachite green dye (MG) aqueous solution under the visible light irradiation. The effect of graphene content on the photoelectrochemical property of Bi 2 S 3 nano rods was also studied. The enhancement of photocurrent and photocatalytic properties of BG composite attributed to the synergistic effect between the Bi 2 S 3 nano rods and graphene sheets which improves the charge separation efficiency in Bi 2 S 3 nano rods. The supercapacitor behavior was studied using cyclic voltametry and galvanostatic charge discharge studies. The BG composite exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 290 F g -1 at a current density of 1 A g -1 . The present study may provide as a new approach in improving the performance of BG composite in supercapacitor, solar cells and photocatalytic applications.
