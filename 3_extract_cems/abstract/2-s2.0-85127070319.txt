Wireless power transfer (WPT) has gotten a lot of attention in the present times and is going to become our potential future. From small power application scenarios such as charging a mobile phone to high power scenarios like charging an electric vehicle (EV), WPT is investigated as an option. The growing market share of electric vehicles raises questions whether it is possible to integrate wireless charging technology developed for low power applications into this high-power application. Furthermore, it should be investigated if the integration of regenerative braking into the overall system is possible. Several converters have been proposed to enable regenerative braking (RB). However, there is a lack of studies examining the interaction of both technologies on the system level. This paper proposes the integration of an inductive wireless power transfer (IWPT) system and a regenerative braking system into an EV. The merits of the proposed system are represented in scenarios where a considerable amount of power is lost due to frequent acceleration and deceleration. This paper describes the study of the system level integration of a regenerative braking system and a WPT system into an EV. It presents the design, development, and simulation of the complete system along with the brushless direct current (BLDC) traction motor. It shows the simulation model of the Inductive wireless power transfer system (two stage) to EV and acceleration/deceleration phenomenon of BLDC motor. The speed and torque parameters of BLDC motor are the externally controlling variables of EV, having battery-supercapacitor (battery-SC) as storage devices during this transition period. Regenerative braking in BLDC motor can be observed when EV is under sudden deceleration motions consuming/producing excessive current where SC picks up the transients in place of the battery.
