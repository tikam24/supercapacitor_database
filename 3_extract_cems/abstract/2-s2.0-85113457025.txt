The rapid development of wearable electronics has accelerated the development of wearable energy storage devices. Wearable supercapacitors have aroused widely interest due to their large power density. However, there are still many challenges in the practical application of wearable supercapacitors. This paper summarizes the structure, working mechanism, materials and key parameters of wearable supercapacitors. And we reviewed the challenges of wearable supercapacitors in practical applications, namely safety, mechanical adaptability, self-charging capability, environmental tolerance, and multifunction. Finally, these challenges are summarized and prospected. We hope to inspire some work to solve the practical application challenges of wearable supercapacitors.
