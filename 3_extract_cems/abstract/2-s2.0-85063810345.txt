Nitrogen-doped plasma treated graphite is synthesized by using ammonium hydroxide and ambient plasma for supercapacitor applications. Nitrogen is doped 9 wt%, and electrochemical active surface area is increased five times, compared to the precursor graphite. Electrochemical impedance is also dramatically reduced from 296 to 34 Ω at 100 Hz. The specific capacitance is finally improved from 27 Fg−1 to 399 Fg−1 at 50 mVs−1, demonstrating high energy density of 40.4 Whkg−1 when its power density reaches to 617 Wkg−1. The capacitance retention was 91% after 1000 cycles, revealing high cyclic stability and reliable performance for the supercapacitor applications.
