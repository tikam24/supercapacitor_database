Large scale energy storage system with low cost, high power, and long cycle life is crucial for addressing the energy crisis, especially when integrated with renewable energy resources. To realize grid-scale applications of the energy storage devices, there remain several key issues including the development of low-cost, high-performance materials that are environmentally friendly. This study explores the synergic contribution of the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) on metal organic framework (MOF) as positive electrode for asymmetric supercabattery. The structural elucidation of the synthesised hybrid material and its precursors were characterised using XRD, FTIR, TGA, SEM and TEM. The electrochemical analysis of the synthesised hybrid material and its precursors was achieved using CV, GCD and EIS. The electrochemical behaviour of NF-rGO/MOF hybrid obtained from the three-electrode system exhibited a battery-type behaviour and accomplished an improved specific capacity of 459.0 Cg−1 at the current density of 1.5 A g−1. Furthermore, the two-electrode system fabricated in an asymmetric configuration made of NF-rGO/MOF hybrid as the positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as the negative electrode studied in 3.0 M KOH electrolyte, exhibited specific capacity of about 48.81 Cg−1 at the current density of 0.4 A g−1, the corresponding maximum energy density of 11.0 Wh kg−1 and the maximum power density of 640.45 W kg−1. The cycling stability of the rGO/MOF hybrid asymmetric device displayed 70 % capacity retention after 2000 cycles.
