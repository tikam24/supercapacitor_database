MXene, a 2D transition metal carbides/nitrides, have attracted heated attention in various fields, such as supercapacitors, batteries, catalysis, solar cell, and senor, because of their outstanding properties. The coexistence of metallic and covalent bonds contributes to the intrinsic properties of MXenes, such as unique structural, surface-chemical, thermo-physical, and optoelectronic properties. These new physics and chemistry properties of MXene will open up new possibilities for applications.
