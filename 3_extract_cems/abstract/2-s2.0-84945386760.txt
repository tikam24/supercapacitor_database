To guarantee stability of microgrid system, power balance between power generation units, and quality of output power, energy storage part of microgrid system with photovoltaic power generation is usually hybrid energy storage devices. For this reason, control strategy of various energy storage units and DC bus voltage for microgrid operating in grid-connected model is proposed. When energy management system of grid-connected PV systememployspower allocation type control strategy, amplitude stability of DC bus voltage is controlled by power generation unit side. Stability of DC bus voltage amplitude is controlled by energy balance between micro generators and three-phase inverter connected to grid. When micro generator or local load mutates, because of better complementary characteristics of battery and super capacitors, impact caused by load mutation on DC bus is restrained by control strategy of battery absorbing/releasing low-frequency power and super capacity absorbing/releasing high-frequency power. Results of simulation and experiments show that control strategies can regulate system output active/reactive power effectively and rapidly, damppower fluctuation caused by load mutation of microgrid, and improve quality of output power, reliability and stability of power system.
