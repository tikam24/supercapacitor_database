Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD's) have recently attracted much interest as energy storage materials due to having a two-dimensional structure. Indeed, the trigonal phase has shown more beneficial characteristics owing to higher electrical conductivity. In this research, in a facile one-pot solvothermal method, tungsten disulfide (WS2) was synthesized on the activated carbon cloth (ACC) as an electrode for wearable supercapacitors. The active material was composited with graphene to increase the capacitive properties of this electrode. The formation of the trigonal phase (1T) was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Raman Spectroscopy. First principle calculations were employed to study the interface of composite and surface energy of related planes. The synthesized nano-flower powder showed a substantial surface area of 761 m2/g. Electrochemical studies revealed that graphene has a beneficial impact on the electrode's charge storage and rate capabilities. Furthermore, remarkable areal capacitance of 2964 mF/cm2 in Na2SO4 electrolyte and 86% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles were achieved.
