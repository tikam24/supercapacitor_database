The aim of this study was to prepare MnO2 from a MnCl2 solution by electrode polarisation at a constant potential. MnO2 was deposited at platinum and platinum modified by carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with a varying degree of oxidation. The mass of the electrodeposited MnO2 was calculated from the current transient. An electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) enabled the determination of the correction factor which considers the presence of the equivalent amount of water within the MnO2 layer. The obtained electrodes (MnO2, MnO2/CNT, MnO2/CNT-EO1 and MnO2/CNT-EO2) were tested in NaCl, LiCl and MnCl2 electrolytes by cyclic voltammetry, demonstrating the best pseudocapacitive properties in the MnCl2 solution. It was proven that the electrolyte cation size, its valence and the hydration shell significantly influence the MnO2 pseudocapacitive redox reaction. The pseudocapacitive properties of MnO2 were improved by MnO2 deposition onto CNTs and oxidised CNT electrodes. The oxidation of CNTs was accomplished by a simple electrochemical procedure in a Na2SO4 solution (CNT-EO1 and CNT-EO2 electrodes). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy has shown that charge transfer resistance has increased by oxidation process. However, it did not influence the overall pseudocapacitive properties significantly.
