The paper presents the results of research on new electroconductive polymer materials, based on polypyrrole, for the different supercapacitor constructions, i.e., the symmetric and asymmetric constructions. All the supercapacitors considered contain ITO collectors. Measurements of the complex impedance frequency characteristics were performed for these elements using the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) method. Selected fractional-order models, known from the literature, have been used to model the impedance of these elements. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm was used to estimate the model parameters. Selected estimation results, their comparison, and conclusions are also presented in the paper. The type of active electrolyte component has the greatest impact on the shape of the impedance frequency characteristics. In most cases, the highest capacitance values and the smallest resistance values were obtained for asymmetric supercapacitors.
