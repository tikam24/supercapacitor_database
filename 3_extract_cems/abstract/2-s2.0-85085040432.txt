Over the past decade, electrochemical devices have significantly improved due to advanced fabrication and synthesis of nano-electrode materials. However, the cost-effective and -efficient fabrication of nanomaterials is still challengeable. In this regard, we have used bio-organic compounds of E. cognata as fuel to synthesize and functionalize the Co3O4 nanoparticles and then incorporated NiO–PdO–Pd following the hydrothermal route. X-ray diffraction revealed Co3O4:NiO–PdO–Pd phases with crystallite size of 21 nm while spherical-shaped nanoparticles are observed by scanning electron microscope. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed the presences of organic-functional groups of E. cognata on the surface of synthesized nanomaterial. The as-synthesized Co3O4:NiO–PdO–Pd nanomaterial is investigated as supercapacitor electrode material. In 3 M KOH the Co3O4:NiO–PdO–Pd nanomaterial exhibits a specific capacitance of 217.4 F/g. The Co3O4:NiO–PdO–Pd was reach up to 142.91 F/g at 10 mV/s while 115.15 F/g of capacitance is achieved by GCD data. Moreover, excellent conductivity is revealed by lower internal Ohmic resistance of 0.71 Ω which corresponds to the efficient transport of charges, and promotes the electrolyte diffusion. These results indicate that Co3O4:NiO–PdO–Pd nanomaterial can be a potential electrode for supercapacitor application.
