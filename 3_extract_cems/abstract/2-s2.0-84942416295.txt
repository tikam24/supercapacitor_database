Highly nanoporous carbon materials have been produced by a synchronous carbonization/graphitization process, using magnesium citrate serves as the carbon source and nickel nitrate as graphitization catalyst. The carbonization temperature plays a crucial role in determining the porosity and graphitization. The lower temperature favors for the formation of larger porosity, whilst higher temperature for better crystallinity. Resultantly, a high BET surface area of 2587.13 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> and large total pore volume of 4.64 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> appear, the case of C-800 sample, thereby resulting in a large specific capacitance of 305.3 F g<sup>-1</sup> at 1 A g<sup>-1</sup> from the contribution of electric double layer capacitances. More importantly, we demonstrate a novel redox active additive of p-nitroaniline (PNA) into the 6 mol L<sup>-1</sup> KOH electrolyte to largely improve the capacitance by the quick self-discharge redox reaction of H<sup>+</sup>/e<sup>-</sup>. The C-800-2 sample with the PNA concentration of 2 mmol delivers largely improved capacitance of 502.1 F g<sup>-1</sup> at 1 A g<sup>-1</sup>, which is almost 1.65 fold increase. Apparently, the present PNA is commercially available, and highly effective for elevating the specific capacitance and might be implemented for the wide supercapacitor application.
