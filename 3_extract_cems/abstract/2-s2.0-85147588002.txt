Fiber supercapacitors are promising power supplies suitable for wearable electronics, but the internally insufficient cross-linking and random structure of fiber electrodes restrict their performance. This study describes how interfacial cross-linking and oriented structure can fabricate an MXene fiber with high flexibility and electrochemical performance. The continuous and highly oriented macroscopic fibers were constructed by 2D MXene sheets via a liquid-crystalline wet-spinning assembly. The oxyanion-enriched terminations of surface-modified MXene in situ could reinforce the interfacial cross-linking by electrostatic interactions while mediating the sheet-to-sheet lamellar structure within the fiber. The resultant MXene fiber exhibits high electrical conductivity (3545 S cm-1) and mechanical strength (205.5 MPa) and high pseudocapacitance charge storage capability up to 1570.5 F cm-3. Notably, the assembled fiber supercapacitor delivers an energy density of 77.6 mWh cm-3 at 401.9 mW cm-3, exceptional flexibility and stability exhibiting âˆ¼99.5% capacitance retention under mechanical deformation, and can be integrated into commercial textiles to power microelectronic devices. This work provides insight into the fabrication of an advanced MXene fiber and the development of high-performance flexible fiber supercapacitors.
