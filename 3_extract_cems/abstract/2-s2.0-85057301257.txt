This paper proposed a strategy to improve efficiency for a permanent magnet motor drive system with fuel cells connected in series with electric double-layer capacitors. The configuration of the proposed system and its operation are explained and equations for losses of the overall system are derived. Moreover, a control method to reduce the losses of overall system is investigated. Finally, experiments of the proposed control are performed and the results demonstrate that the proposed control can improve the efficiency of the overall system.
