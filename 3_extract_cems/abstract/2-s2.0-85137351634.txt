Porous micro/nano structured materials have gained much interest since they have many excellent properties wisely as large surface area and confined pore structure for various applications in electrochemistry such as, catalysis, sensing and energy storage devices. Among various characteristics, structure of porous metal oxides plays vital role in determining electrochemical performance. Fortunately, nano-structuration and porosity conjunction for transition metal oxides ascertains a role in enhancing electrochemical storage of electrodes for charge storage devices mainly due to: (i) large surface area for charge storage; (ii) easy access over active material for electrolyte ions and (iii) fast electrolytic ion transportation through porous channels. This chapter reviews the current development of nanoporous transition metal oxide-based materials, with specific focus on advanced electrochemical supercapacitor applicatin.
