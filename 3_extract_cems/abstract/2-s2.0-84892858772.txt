A kind of new hierarchical ZnOAuMnO2 core-shell nanowire structure has been designed and constructed for supercapacitor electrode materials. The nanostructure is produced by forming ultrathin self-standing MnO2 nanosheets on Au-coated ZnO nanowires grown radically on carbon fiber paper. A specific capacitance of 654F/g at a scan rate of 2mV/s by cyclic voltammetry and 478F/g at a current density of 2.6A/g are achieved for the ZnOAuMnO2 nanostructure electrode in 1.0M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. In addition, the hybrid nanostructure shows an excellent long-term cycling stability. 80% of its initial capacitance remained after 2500 cycles at a large scan rate of 50mV/s. The improved electrochemical performance of the new ZnOAuMnO2 core-shell nanostructure endows it a potential value as electrode materials for next generation supercapacitors. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.
