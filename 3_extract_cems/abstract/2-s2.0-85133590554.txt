In order to apply polypyrrole conductive materials in the textiles field and prepare textilebased supercapacitors, polypyrrole/wool composite conductive fabric was prepared by in-situ polymerization using wool felt as substrate and ferric chloride as oxidant. The fabrication condition of polypyrrole/wool composite conductive fabric was investigated by Box-Benhnken center composite design and response surface method. The influences of parameters such as polymerization temperature, concentration of pyrrole monomer, the molar ratio of pyrrole monomer to oxidant and their interaction on the electrical conductivity and capacity of fabrics were discussed. The quadratic polynomial regression equation was also obtained. The results show that the optimum conditions of polypyrrole/wool composite conductive fabric are as follows: polymerization temperature of 10 Â°C, the concentration of pyrrole of 0.40 mol/L, n(pyrrole): n (FeCl3) = 1: 1. In this process, the capacitance of polypyrrole/wool composite conductive fabric is 5.658 F/cm2
