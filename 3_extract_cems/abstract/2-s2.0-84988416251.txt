Highly active electrode materials with designed nanostructure play an important role for the application as high-performance electrochemical energy storage devices. Herein we report a facile synthesis of titanium nitride nanowire array (TiN NWA)@NiCo2O4coaxial composite for the first time. The TiN NWA was synthetized through hydrothermal method combined with reduction and nitridation treatment. The diameter of the array is about 200 nm and the length is up to 10 μm. To improve the electrochemical properties related to energy storage, NiCo2O4nanowires with about 20 nm in diameter and length of about 2 μm are further coated on the TiN NWA by hydrothermal method. The TiN NWA@NiCo2O4coaxial composite displays a high specific capacitance (1200 F g−1at current density of 2.0 A g−1), good rate capability (63.6% capacitance retention from 2 A g−1to 100 A g−1) and excellent cycle stability (7.8% capacitance loss after 5000 cycles) in a 2 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. Moreover, the TiN NWA@NiCo2O4composite is able to maintain stable electrochemical performance at wide temperature range of 25–65 °C.
