Herein, we present the synthesis of PPy@MoO3 nanocomposites through a novel situ polymerisation growth. The introduction of polypyrrole (PPy) not only greatly improved the electrical conductivity of the material but also significantly improved the electrochemical activity, thus promoting the storage of energy reaction. The results exhibit that the electrode material has a very high specific capacitance (453.75 F/g at 1 A/g) and an excellent cycle life (84.3% of the initial specific capacitance after 5000 cycles). Notably, based on the rise of high-safety all-solid supercapacitors, it has great potential in the portable/wearable field. The PPy@MoO3//AC all-solid supercapacitors have the power density of 400 W/kg at an energy density of 20.3 Wh/kg. The distinguished performances stem from the synergetic merits of the morphology, structure, and mechanism of PPy@MoO3. PPy@MoO3 is expected to be a promising anode material and provide a theoretical basis for the scalable research and applications of MoO3-based anode materials for all-solid supercapacitors.
