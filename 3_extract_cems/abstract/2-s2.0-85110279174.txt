Fe3O4 nanocrystals ornamented CdO nanorods were successfully grown over the apple waste-based carbonaceous activated aerogel through hydrothermal and calcination techniques. The high surface area, crystalline nature, strong magnetization, and numerous functional groups make it a potential candidate for energy storage devices owing to fast ions diffusion, facile electron transportation, and outstanding synergism between metals. The resulted supercapacitor achieved a maximum 40 W h/kg energy density at 1000 power density W/kg and excellent cycling stability of 93.68% capacitance retention after 1100 charge/discharge cycles. These discoveries have opened the use of cost-effective biomass-based composite materials and provide possibilities for their application in the field of sustainable energy storage.
