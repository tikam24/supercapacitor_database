In this work, we report the design and fabrication of hierarchical NiCo2S4@polypyrrole (PPy) core-shell hybrid nanosheet arrays on Ni foam as a novel battery-type electrode using a facile hydrothermal and electrodeposition strategy. The conductive and electroactive PPy layers are deliberately coated on the backbones of interconnected NiCo2S4 nanosheets to significantly boost the energy storage capacity. The resulting NiCo2S4@PPy hybrid electrode exhibits an enhanced areal capacity (800 μA h cm−2 at 5 mA cm−2) and good rate capability. An aqueous hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) device is assembled by employing NiCo2S4@PPy and activated carbon as the positive and negative electrodes, achieving high energy density (60.8 W h kg−1 at 200 W kg−1) and high power density (4362 W kg−1 at 31 W h kg−1), as well as excellent cycling stability (98.3% retention over 3000 cycles at 20 mA cm−2). Moreover, two HSC devices can easily light 38 LEDs efficiently, demonstrating the great potential of this core-shell hybrid nanostructure toward practical applications in energy storage devices.
