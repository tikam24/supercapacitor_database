To optimize the dynamic output power quality of the diesel generator (DG), the storage energy-power compensation system (SE-PCS) containing super capacitor (SC) is connected with DG in parallel to supply power to load. A generation scheme of dynamic referential active power for SE-PCS, which is based on the exponential function with e as the base, is proposed. When sudden change of load occurs, SE-PCS outputs active power transitorily according to e-based exponential function to enhance the dynamic output performance of DG. The initial value and the time constant of e-based exponential function as well as the design principle of capacitor quantity of SC are given. Further, the impact of the inner resistance of SC on the output voltage range of SC is analyzed, and then a new design principle for the capacitor capacity of SC to keep the output voltage range of SC constant is put forward to maintain secure and reliable operation of SE-PCS. The correctness and effectiveness of the proposed scheme, control strategy and design principle of parameters are validated by corresponding simulation results.
