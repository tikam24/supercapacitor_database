In this study, we reported the preparation of a conducting polymeric/inorganic nanohybrid consisting of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), N-doped graphene (NGr), and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), and its electrochemical application in intelligent sensors and supercapacitors. The multilayer thin film of the PEDOT:PSS-supported MWCNT-NGr nanohybrid was prepared by a facile layer-by-layer assembly strategy. The obtained conducting polymeric/inorganic nanohybrid modified electrode displayed superior electron transfer ability and a high specific surface area, which was used for electrochemical applications in intelligent sensors and supercapacitors. Remarkably, the fabricated amaranth sensor exhibited a broad linear range of 0.05-10 μM with a limit of detection of 0.015 μM under the optimal conditions. With the help of the response surface methodology, multivariate optimization was used as a substitute for the traditional single variable optimization to reflect the complete real effects of multivariate optimization in a sensing platform. Machine learning implemented by hybrid genetic algorithm-artificial neural network was used as an intelligent analysis model to replace the traditional regression analysis model for realizing intelligent analysis and output of sensing system. The MWCNT-NGr/PEDOT:PSS modified electrode exhibited a considerable specific capacitance of 6.5 mF cm-2 at a current density of 2.0 mA cm-2. The proposed results provided a new thought for a nanosensing platform equipped with a supercapacitor as a self-powered electrochemical energy storage system and machine learning as an intelligent analysis and output system in the near future.
