3D Ni(OH) 2 /tungsten disulfide (WS 2 ) nanofibers composed of ultrathin nanoflakes are synthesized by electrospinning followed by a hydrothermal process, which have a large specific surface of 64.56 m 2 g −1 . When tested in a three-electrode configuration, the WS 2 /Ni(OH) 2 nanofiber-based electrode exhibits a high specific capacity of 354 C g −1 at a current density of 1 A g −1 . The hybrid storage device, in which WS 2 /Ni(OH) 2 nanofibers and graphene are used as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively, exhibits a high energy density of 34 Wh kg −1 at a power density of 940 W kg −1 and a high capacity retention of 83% after 4000 cycles at 4 A g −1 . The as-synthesized 3D Ni(OH) 2 /WS 2 nanofibers provide a way for the WS 2 nanostructure to optimize its viability and potential in constructing a high-performance energy storage device.
