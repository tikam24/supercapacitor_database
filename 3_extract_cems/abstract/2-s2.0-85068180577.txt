Porous carbon nanomeshes with large specific surface area and pore volume are successfully synthesized through a one-step carbonization process. Notably, these porous carbon nanomeshes are highly doped with N in the carbon lattice and S at the edge of carbon lattice. The binary doped porous carbon nanomeshes synthesized at the optimized condition show high specific capacitance (delivers a specific capacitance of 340 F g−1 at discharge rate of 0.5A g−1), excellent rate performances (retains the capacitance of 260 F g−1 at discharge rate of 10 A g−1) and long cycle stability (92% of its initial capacitance after 10000 cycles). The synergetic effect of heteroatom doping and pore structure on the supercapacitor performance is investigated. Abundant nitrogen and sulfur dopants provide pseudocapacitance via rapid Faradaic reactions, while the in-plane pores offer additional ion channels to accelerate the diffusion rate across the thin sheets and afford abundant edge atoms to further increase the pseudocapacitance.
