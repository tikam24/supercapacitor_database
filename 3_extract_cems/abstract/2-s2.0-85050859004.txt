We present a supercapacitor with polypyrrole-dodecylbenzenesulfonate (PPy(DBS))-vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) hybrid partially embedded into PDMS. The facile technique enables the partial-embedding of vertically aligned carbon nanotubes in PDMS, which facilitates a stable charge/discharge under varied strains. The measured capacitance was 2 mF/cm2 at a scan rate of 1000 mV/s with a gel electrolyte. The structure was seamlessly stretched up to 160% with a capacitance attenuation by 30% at 160% stretching. The measured capacitance valuse were very well maintained under bending with its angles varying from 0 to 180 degrees.
