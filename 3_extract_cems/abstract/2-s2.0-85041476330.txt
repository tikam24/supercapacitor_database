We report a novel hybrid Sn-doped Co3O4 nanowires synthesized by a facile, one-step hydrothermal growth method on conductive substrates (Ni foam) followed by a post-annealing procedure. The Sn-doped Co3O4 nanowires are used as the electrode materials for supercapacitors. The electrochemical results show 0.4-Sn-doped Co3O4 (the initial adding molar ratio of Sn and Co = 0.4) has higher specific capacitance of 151.8 F/g at 5 mV/s. The nanocomposites presented in this work could be considered as potential electrode materials for next generation supercapacitors in high energy density storage systems.
