This study aims to quantify the synergistic effect of Ni2+ and Mn2+ ions on the capacitive performance of oxide, hydroxide and phosphate electrodes in alkaline electrolytes. Three types of phases containing both nickel and manganese in a ratio of one‐to‐one were selected due to their stability in alkaline media: oxides with ilmenite and spinel structures (NiMnO3 and Ni1.5Mn1.5O4); hydroxides with layered structures (β‐Ni1/2Mn1/2(OH)2); and phosphates with olivine and maricite structures (LiNi1/2Mn1/2PO4 and NaNi1/2Mn1/2PO4). In the mixed hydroxides and phosphates, Ni2+ and Mn2+ ions randomly occupied one crystallographic site, whereas in the ilmenite oxide, a com-mon face was shared by the Ni2+ and Mn4+ ions. The electrochemical parameters of the Ni–Mn com-positions were evaluated in asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor cells working with alkaline electrolytes and activated carbon as a negative electrode. A comparative analysis of oxides, hydroxides and phosphates enabled us to differentiate the effects of nickel and manganese ions, structures and morphologies on their capacitive performance. Thus, the best performed electrode was predicted. The electrode composition should simultaneously contain Ni and Mn ions, and their morphologies should comprise spherical aggregates. This was an ilmenite NiMnO3, which delivers high energy and power density (i.e., 65 W h kg−1 at 3200 W kg−1 ) and exhibits a good cycling stability (i.e., around 96% after 5000 cycles at a current load of 240 mA g−1 ).
