The proceedings contain 76 papers. The topics discussed include: structural and phase transition changes of sodium dodecyl sulfate micellar solution in alcohols probed by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS); development of CSAMT impedance modeling and its estimation; electronic structure and optical properties of Sr 2 SnO 4 studied with FP-LAPW method in density functional theory; controlling vortices motion using holes and boundary introduction; the quantum hall effect helicity; impedance spectroscopic analysis of composite electrode from activated carbon/conductive materials/ruthenium oxide for supercapacitor applications; effect of carbonization temperature on the physical and electrochemical properties of supercapacitor electrode from fibers of oil palm empty fruit bunches; and effect of electrolyte concentration on performance of supercapacitor carbon electrode from fibers of oil palm empty fruit bunches.
