Rare earth metal (La) doped aurivillius structured bismuth molybdate (Bi2MoO6: La) has been prepared by a single pot microwave-assisted combustion method. The characteristics of the bare Bi2MoO6 and Bi2MoO6: La catalysts have been analyzed systematically using different characterization techniques. The crystalline phase purity of the nanostructures has been analyzed by PXRD and Rietveld refinement technique with an average crystallite size approximately 28 nm (Bi2MoO6) and 25 nm (Bi2MoO6: La). The surface morphologies have been nanoplatelets for both samples. The Bi2MoO6: La structure ensures maximum capacitance of 662.8 F g−1 at 5 mVs−1. Also, they performed good cyclic stability of 87.4% over 2000 cycles with a current density of 5 mA cm−2. The prepared active material serves as a novel negative electrode material for supercapacitors.
