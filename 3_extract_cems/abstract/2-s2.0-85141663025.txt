The binary metal oxide ZnCo2O4 is considered as a potential electrode candidate for asymmetric supercapacitors due to its unique composition and battery-type features. However, its low electrical conductivity and insufficient material utilization efficiency hinder its major practical application. In this work, hierarchical polyaniline-coated ZnCo2O4 nanobelts have been synthesized using an economical two-step strategy (including a hydrothermal method and an in situ polymerization route) and are investigated as a supercapacitor material. Impressively, the resulting ZnCo2O4@PANI nanobelt electrode exhibits a remarkable specific capacitance of 1938.2 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and superior cycling performance (the capacitance retains 92.4% after cycling for 10 000 cycles at 6 A g−1). Furthermore, an ASC was prepared using the obtained ZnCo2O4@PANI electrode as a cathode and using active carbon (AC) as an anode. The constructed ASC delivers a high specific energy of 66.6 W h kg−1 at a specific power of 800.1 W kg−1, and attains 92.5% capacitance retention over 10 000 cycles at 8 A g−1, indicating its high potential for applications in the field of high-capacitance supercapacitors. These results demonstrate the great potential of ZnCo2O4@PANI nanobelts as a promising cathode material for supercapacitors.
