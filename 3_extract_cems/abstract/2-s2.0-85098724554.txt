Carbon nanocages with a hierarchical structure have attracted increasing attention in recent years due to the high rate capability of supercapacitors based on such materials. In this study, cubic carbon nanocages (CNCs) with a hierarchical porous structure were prepared by using cubic magnesium oxide as a template and sucrose as the carbon source. The carbon nanocages interconnect to form 3D nanoparticles, when used as the electrode material for supercapacitors, exhibit a high specific capacitance and excellent rate capability. The specific capacitance at a current density of 50 A g-1 can reach 135 F g-1. The excellent capacitive performance of carbon nanocages is attributed to the macropores formed by the cavity inside the cages and interparticle voids, which provide a fast pathway for ion transportation by shortening the diffusion pathway for electrolyte ions. Moreover, CNCs possess good cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 96.2% after 10000 cycles.
