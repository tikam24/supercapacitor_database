Highly crystalline manganese-oxide nanostructures are fabricated by acidic reduction of KMnO4 solution followed by air-annealing. During annealing, the nanostructures are converted from nanoparticles (diameters ∼ 100 nm) to nanorods (width ∼ 20 nm), which depends on the K+ ion content within the samples. K+ ions are considered to act as a 'growth-director' for the nanoparticle-to-nanorod conversion process. By controlling the K+ content through a simple rinsing step, the nanostructures are effectively controlled to be either only nanorod structures, or of pure nanoparticle structure or a mixture of both. Electrochemical characterization of these three types of nanostructures revealed that nanorod-nanoparticle mixture samples have superior electrochemical performance compared to others, which is attributed to their unique morphology, with a combination of highly crystalline 1D-nanorods and the porous structure of 3D-nanoparticles. This provides a high active surface area in the pores of nanoparticles and high surface-to-volume ratio in the nanorods for considerably higher utilization of the active materials during electrochemical performance.
