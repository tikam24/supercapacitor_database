The rational design of the heteroatom-doped ZIF-67 provides a good opportunity to optimize the performance of the MOF-based supercapacitor. In this work, a simple method was proposed to fabricate a well-formed Co/Mn-ZIF cube by a one-step coprecipitation method. The surface area and conductivity of the as-prepared sample were greatly improved beneficial from the presence of manganese ions. When used in supercapacitor testing, Co/Mn-ZIF-based positive electrode exhibited an ultra-high specific capacitance of 926.25 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and good cycling stability with 64.1% of initial capacitance remained after 1500 charge-discharge cyclic testing. Attractive specific energy of 52.95 Wh kg−1 at 1080 W kg−1 was achieved and 26.4 Wh kg−1 at remarkable 43.2 kW kg−1 was accomplished from the asymmetric supercapacitor in terms of Co/Mn-ZIF and activated carbon.
