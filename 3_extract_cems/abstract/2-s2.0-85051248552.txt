Mesoporous vanadium phosphate (VOPO4) nanosheets have been successfully synthesized through an easy and reproducible lyotropic liquid crystals (LLC) templating approach for the first time. Using the triblock copolymer (P123) as a surfactant, VOPO4 precursor with a well-developed 2D hexagonal mesostructure can be obtained. Following complete removal of the template by calcination, crystallized VOPO4 frameworks with less-ordered mesostructure are achieved. The as-prepared mesoporous VOPO4 nanosheets exhibit superior pseudocapacitive performance (767 F g‒1 at 0.5A g‒1) by virtue of the favorable mesostructure that gives rise to abundant easily accessible redox active sites as well as reinforced charge transfer and ion diffusion properties. The charge storage mechanism of the mesoporous VOPO4 nanosheets has been experimentally demonstrated to be based on the reversible two-step redox reactions between V(V) and V(III) in acidic medium. This advantageous LLC templating strategy is expected to open up a new route for designing various mesoporous metal phosphates with superior electrochemical performance for utilization in energy storage devices.
