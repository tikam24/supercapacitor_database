Fluctuation of wind turbine output power is one the most important drawbacks of these kinds of resources. This oscillation caused by wind speed variation is undesirable for the microgrid to which the wind turbine is connected. Therefore, reduction of output power oscillation of wind turbines is one of the most important issues related to this resource. In this paper, a new method based on Continuous Wind Speed Forecasting (CWSF) is proposed to reduce fluctuation. Output power fluctuation reduction is considered as momentary in transient power oscillations and performed using short term wind speed forecasting. The goal of this paper is to decrease the output power fluctuation of a set of wind turbines and their energy storage system by CWSF and Online Supervisory Control. The oscillation reduction is performed in both the charging and discharging modes of the ultra-capacitor. The studied wind turbine is a 50 kW wind turbine and all simulations are implemented in MATLAB SIMULINK.
