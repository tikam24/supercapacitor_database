To improve the lithium storage properties of anode in lithium ion capacitors (LICs), reduced graphene oxide (rGO) decorated with crystallized cobalt borate nanoparticles (Co-B/rGO) was prepared by an in-situ growth method. Microstructural characterizations demonstrate that crystallized Co-B nanoparticles not only act as an effective electron transfer bridge between rGO nanosheets but also provide more active sites for lithium storage. As a result, LIC based on Co-B/rGO anode exhibited stable cycling performance with a capacitance retention of 75% after 2000 cycles at 2000 mA gâˆ’1, and high energy and power density. Thus, Co-B/rGO can be a promising anode material for LICs.
