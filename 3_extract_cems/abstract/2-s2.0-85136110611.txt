A facile and environmentally friendly one-step electrodeposition method is developed to prepare Ni(OH)2/PANI/rGO (NPG) composites. The structure and morphology characterization of NPG composites reveal that Ni(OH)2 and PANI grow uniformly on the rGO layers surface, which makes the composites have large specific surface area (118.3 m2 g−1) and better electrochemical properties. The specific capacitance value of NPG composites reaches to 2320 F g−1 and 1746 F g−1 at a current density of 5 A g−1 and 20 A g−1, respectively, indicating that NPG ternary composites has excellent rate performance. Moreover, cycle stability, another very important performance indicator of supercapacitors, is also further investigated. When the NPG composites is charged and discharged after 2000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g−1, the capacitance retention remains 84.39 %. Furthermore, the NPG||activated carbon asymmetric supercapacitor shows a high energy density of 96.5 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 465.6 W kg−1. All the electrochemical properties demonstrate that NPG composites have great potential applications in electrode materials of supercapacitors.
