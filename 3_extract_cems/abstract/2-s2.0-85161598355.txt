Copper oxide−zeolite (CuO−ZT) reinforced polyaniline (PANI) matrices were prepared by in situ oxidative polymerization and the samples were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, XRD, TGA, UV–visible spectrophotometry, SEM and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller theory; the optical bandgap was also evaluated. Moreover, the synthesis and exploration of electrodes are increasingly being considered for the development of conducting-polymer-based supercapacitors, which has attracted significant interest in energy conversion and storage technology. Here, hybrid materials used in the preparation of the electrode materials on the capacitive properties were investigated. It is found that the PANI@CuO exhibits a high specific capacitance of 311.5 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 current density between 0.0 and 1.0 V compared to PANI@CuO−ZT (222.7 F g−1). Further, the PANI@CuO presented an excellent cycling stability at 1.0 A g−1 (1500 cycles; 81.9%) in a two-electrode system. Accordingly, producing a PANI matrix on CuO presented a simple and viable way to ameliorate the capacitive performance of the supercapacitor. Conversely, the adsorptive removal of malachite green and methyl violet dyes by PANI@CuO−ZT adsorbent could be described by the pseudo-first-order and Temkin models. The maximum adsorptive capacity of malachite green and methyl violet dyes was 249.7 and 198.2 mg g−1, respectively. © 2023 Society of Industrial Chemistry.
