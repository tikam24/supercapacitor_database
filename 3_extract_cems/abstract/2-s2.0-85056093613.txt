Two-dimensional conducting polymers nanosheet prepared by the soft-template-assisted technique in aqueous system still has rarely been reported, especially the formation of nanosheets structure by protonic acid assisted controlling the stability of the micelles method. Herein, a facile, one-step, bottom-up approach is developed to synthesize novel and uniform conductive poly(4-aminodiphenylamine) (P(4-ADPA)) nanosheets with controlled morphology via regulating the proton acid concentration during the self-assembly of surfactant lamellar micelles. The as-produced conducting P(4-ADPA) demonstrates a integral nanoframework structure with uniform and intertwined nanosheets, resulting in a satisfactory specific capacitance of 395 F g-1 at the current density of 0.5 A g-1. Furthermore, another pseudocapacitor electrode material, urchin-like W18O49, is selected as a negative electrode material to fabricate a novel P(4-ADPA)//W18O49 asymmetric supercapacitor, which extends the operating voltage window up to 1.5 V, provides an energy density of 24.4 W h kg-1 at a high power density of 1491 W kg-1, and possesses superlong-life of 92% capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles. Therefore, the present work will propose an affordable strategy to design novel conducting polymer nanosheets and open up the possibility of cheap conductive polymers to meet the demands of energy storage.
