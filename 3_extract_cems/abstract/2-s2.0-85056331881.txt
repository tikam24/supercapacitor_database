Co3O4/CoF2·4H2O/graphene composites and Co3O4/graphene composites are synthesized by a facile microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis, followed by calcining at 350 °. The synthesized composites are characterized by X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. Electrochemical property of the prepared composites is measured by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge. Results show that Co3O4/CoF2·4H2O/graphene composites exhibit better specific capacitance and retention ratio of initial specific capacitance when compared with Co3O4/graphene composites. Particularly, Co3O4/CoF2·4H2O/graphene composites prepared using CoSO4·7H2O as material exhibit the highest specific capacitance at various current densities, retention ratio of the specific capacitance at the current density ranging from 1 to 4 A g-1 and retention ratio of initial specific capacitance after 1000 cycles, indicating excellent rate capability and cycling stability. These characteristics demonstrate that Co3O4/CoF2·4H2O/graphene composites prepared using CoSO4·7H2O as material possess a great potential application in supercapacitors.
