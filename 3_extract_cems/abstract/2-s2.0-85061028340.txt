Metal sulfides are of great interest for future electrode materials in supercapacitor and solar cell applications owing to their superior electrochemical activity and excellent electrical conductivity. With this scope, a binary transition metal sulfide (CoS) is prepared via one-step hydrothermal synthesis. Hexagonal phase of CoS with space group of P63/mmc(194) is confirmed by XRD analysis. Additional cubic Co3S4 phase in the prepared sample originates the mixed valence state of Co (Co2+ and Co3+) is affirmed from XPS analysis. Morphological features are visualized using HRSEM images that shows nanoflower shaped star-anise structure. Employing the prepared CoS as active electrode material, interfacial charge transport kinetics is examined by EIS-Nyquist plot. The supercapacitive performances are tested in two and three-electrode system which exhibited respective specific capacitances of 57 F/g and 348 F/g for 1 A/g. Further, the fabricated asymmetric CoS//AC supercapacitor device delivers an appreciable energy density of 15.58 Wh/kg and power density of 700.12 W/kg with excellent cyclic stability of 97.9% and Coulombic efficiency of 95% over 2000 charge-discharge cycles. In addition, dye-sensitized solar cells are fabricated with CoS counter electrode and the obtained power conversion efficiency of 5.7% is comparable with standard platinum based counter electrode (6.45%). Curie-Weiss plot confirms the transition of paramagnetic nature into ferrimagnetic behavior at 85 K and Pauli-paramagnetic nature at 20 K respectively. Temperature dependent resistivity plot affirms the metallic nature of CoS sample till 20 K and transition to semiconducting nature occurs at <20 K owing to Peierlâ€™s transition effect.
