The present investigation describes the synthesis of uniform sponge-like Ni(OH) 2 nanoparticles on stainless steel substrates by a two-step successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method; the study also explores electrochemical properties. The formation of the β-phase Ni(OH) 2 and it's nanocrystallinity are confirmed by X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the formation and random distributions of porous and sponge-like nanoparticles with high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of 56.4 m 2 g -1. The maximum specific capacitance of 428 F g -1 was obtained at 5 mV s -1 in a 2 M KOH electrolyte, indicating promising supercapacitor applications with remarkable rate capability. These results suggest the importance of rational design and synthesis of thin nanomaterials for high-performance energy applications. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.
