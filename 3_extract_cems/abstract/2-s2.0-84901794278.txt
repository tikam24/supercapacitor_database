A flexible all-in-one single fiber supercapacitor has been fabricated through region-specific reduction of graphene oxide (GO) fiber by laser irradiation, and thus reduced GO layers as electrodes and GO as the separator are integrated into one single fiber. This in-fiber supercapacitor with high mechanical flexibility and high performance could be woven into the textile for wearable electronics and beyond. Â© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014.
