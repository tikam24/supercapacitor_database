The two essential steps of the new approach are: 1. A simple procedure for obtaining, in a 'visual way', novel active RC sub-circuits which simulate grounded and floating inductors and grounded and floating frequency-dependent negative resistors (fdnr's) of the supercapacitor type (i. e. with impedance proportional to s** minus **2, where s is the complex frequency variable. 2. These novel sub-circuits can be interpreted as consisting of grounded and floating positive and negative resistors and capacitors (** plus or minus R, ** plus or minus C). The second step consists of realizing these ** plus or minus R, ** plus or minus C sub-circuits by means of plus R, plus C circuits and current inverting negative impedance converters.
