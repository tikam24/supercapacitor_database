Polyaniline functionalized titanium carbide (PANI/F-TiC) nanocomposite is synthesized by chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline and F-TiC. In this have work we observed that PANI/F-TiC nanocomposite has high specific capacitance of 3379 F/g at 5 mv/s scan rates. The specific capacitance of the capacitor increases when functionalized TiC is added having the high value of dielectric constant and high surface area. The super capacitor electrode material has exhibited ultra high power density of 4451.22 W/kg and ultra high energy density of 295.66 Wh/kg. Nanocomposites are examined by X- ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier- Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Thermogravimetry (TGA) and Dielectric study. The electrochemical performances of these samples are measured in aqueous H2SO4 electrolyte. PANI/F-TiC shows high charge transfer rate as compared to the pure PANI.
