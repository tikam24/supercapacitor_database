Flexible and high energy density supercapacitors have been received extensive attention due to their suitability as the power supply for wearable and portable electrical devices. However, it is still a great challenge to fabricate devices with simultaneously flexibility, high energy density and voltage window in a neutral electrolyte. Herein, we demonstrated a high-efficiency supercapacitor with dense NiCo2O4 nanosheets in Na2SO4 neutral electrolyte, achieving 1.2 V voltage window based on a single electrode, and 2.4 V for an assembled asymmetric system. The device shows an impressive capacitance of 120 F g‐1 at current density of 1 A g‐1, as well as an excellent cycling performance of 79.4% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles. Meanwhile, the flexible ASC shows highly mechanical flexibility and impressive energy density, suggesting the great potential of the applications in flexible energy storage devices.
