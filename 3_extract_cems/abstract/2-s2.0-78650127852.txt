Additional converters that are used to interface energy storage devices incur power losses as well as increased system cost and complexity. The need for additional converters can be eliminated if the grid side inverter can itself be effectively used as the interface for energy storage. This paper therefore proposes a technique whereby the grid side inverter can also be used as an interface to connect a supercapacitor energy storage for wind energy conversion systems. The proposed grid side inverter is formed by cascading a 3-level inverter and a 2-level inverter through a coupling transformer. The three-level inverter is the main inverter and it is powered by the rectified output of the wind turbine coupled AC generator while the 2- level auxiliary inverter is connected to the super capacitor bank that is used to compensate short term power fluctuations. Novel modulation and control techniques are proposed to address the problems associated with non-integer and dynamically-changing dc-link voltage ratio, which is caused by the random nature of wind. Simulation results are presented to verify the efficacy of the proposed system in suppressing short term wind power fluctuations. Â© 2010 IEEE.
