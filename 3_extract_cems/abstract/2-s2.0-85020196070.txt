Carbon–carbon nanocomposite (CCNC) was synthesized by introducing a dispersion of reduced graphite oxide (RGO) into the reaction medium upon the synthesis of polymer with a conjugated bond system (polyvinylene), which is a product of alkaline dehydrochlorination of polyvinylchloride, followed by carbonization of the resulting adduct–RGO-polyvinylene. After activation of CCNC in the CO2 environment (900°С) a high-porosity material (the specific BET surface is more than 1700 m2/g) with a developed volume of micro- and mesopores was obtained. According to electrochemical investigations, this material possesses a large capacity (100–200 F/g) and high performance, and, therefore, it can be applied in supercapacitor traction systems and for load leveling in electric power lines.
