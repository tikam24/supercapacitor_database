The most dependent storage technologies are secondary batteries and supercapacitors. Supercapacitors are more competent regarding faster energy supply, sustainability, and high-capacity retaining. However, in supercapacitors, most research comprises the least abundant materials that raise the cost and toxicity, which are unfavorable to the environment. Therefore, we have prepared activated carbon-based earth-abundant iron oxyhydroxide material via a low-temperature hydrothermal technique. The key finding of this research is sustainable materials, with co-related studies of TEM and GCD cyclic stability (pre and post-cycling characterizations up to 10k). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis reveals the elemental composition of the optimized sample. The electrochemical performance has been tested via galvanostatic charge-discharge analysis, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. The cyclic stability evaluation is done to see the lasting usability of the device for the 10,000th number of charging-discharging cycles, which is supported by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results in form of a Nyquist plot. The galvanostatic charge-discharge analysis revealed the specific capacitance of 372 F g−1 at 2 mA. The specific energy and power density were obtained as 40 Wh kg−1 and 4200 W kg−1, respectively. The ACF1 shows Coulombic efficiency and capacity retention as 96 % and 80 %, respectively, up to 10k cycles. We have proposed a charge storage mechanism for the fabricated electrode. A supercapacitor has been made-up and tested for the glow of LED, and the device can glow LED for 20 min. The device was repeated after two months and reproduced the LED glow for the same duration.
