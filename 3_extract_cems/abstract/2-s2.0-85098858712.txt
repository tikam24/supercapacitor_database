A PPY/TiO2/PPY jacket nanotube array was fabricated by coating PPY layer on the external and internal surface of a tube wall-separated TiO2 nanotube array. It shows coaxial triple-walled nanotube structure with two PPY nanotube layers sandwiching one TiO2 nanotube layer. PPY/TiO2/PPY reveals much higher current response than TiO2. The theoretical calculation indicates PPY/TiO2/PPY reveals higher density of states and lower band gap, accordingly presenting higher conductivity and electroactivity, which is consistent with the experimental result of a higher current response. The electroactivity is highly enhanced in H2SO4 rather than Na2SO4 electrolyte due to feasible pronation process of PPY in an acidic solution. PPY/TiO2/PPY could conduct the redox reaction in H2SO4 electrolyte which involves the reversible protonation/deprotonation and HSO4- doping/dedoping process and accordingly contributes to Faradaic pseudocapacitance. The specific capacitance is highly enhanced from 1.7 mF cm-2 of TiO2 to 123.4 mF cm-2 of PPY/TiO2/PPY at 0.1 mA cm-2 in H2SO4 electrolyte. The capacitance also declines from 123.4 to 31.7 mF cm-2 when the current density increases from 0.1 to 1 mA cm-2, presenting the rate capacitance retention of 26.7% due to the semiconductivity of TiO2. A PPY/TiO2/PPY jacket nanotube with high charge storage capacitance is regarded as a promising supercapacitor electrode material.
