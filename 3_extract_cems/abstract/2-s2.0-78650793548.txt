Activated carbon (AC) electrodes to electrosorption NaCl from aqueous solution were modified. The electrodes were characterized using scanning electron micrograph (SEM), nitrogen adsorption and cyclic voltammetry. The electrosorption removal efficiency is improved by 3 M HNO3 modification due to increased hydrophilic groups enhance adsorption of inorganic ion. The electrosorption removal efficiency is decreased by 15 M HNO 3 modification due to the combined effects of increased hydrophilic groups and decreased average pore size. The improvement of electrosorption performance by TiO2 nanoparticles modification due to TiO2 nanoparticles boned with the polar groups works as electrosorption sites with enhanced adsorption strength. The reversal operation mode is better than non-reversal operation mode for electrosorption application. Â© (2010) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
