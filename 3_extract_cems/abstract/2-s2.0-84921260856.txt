In this study, we prepared supercapacitor separators on cellulous films and papers using an inkjet printing technology. Several different ink materials, in this case carbon nanotubes and metal oxides were introduced. The influence of the base materials usedas a separator was also investigated. The interface topologies and electric properties of the thus-formed supercapacitors were investigated by a scanning electron microscope and by measuring the charge-discharge cycles, respectively.
