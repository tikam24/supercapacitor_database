In recent years, due to the superiority of clean and renewable energy and the need for suitable storage systems for this energy, supercapacitors have been studied and investigated as a suitable storage device. For the design and manufacture of supercapacitors, the structure of the used electrode and the configuration of the device are among the most effective parameters. Therefore, in this study, the aim is to design and investigate a suitable and cost-effective nanomaterial for use in supercapacitors. For this purpose, CoMnFeO4 magnetic nanoparticles and rGO/CoMnFeO4 magnetic nanocomposite were synthesized. Then, they were investigated and identified using FT-IR, XRD, VSM, SEM, Mapping and EDX analyses. In order to investigate the supercapacitance property of these materials, various electrochemical analyses such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used. The specific capacity, the energy density, and the power density were calculated at different conditions. The specific capacity and the energy density of rGO/CoMnFeO4 at a current density of 1 A.g−1 are 380 F.g−1 and 58.18 Wh.kg−1, respectively. The results of this study generally show that CoMnFeO4 nanoparticles have the appropriate behavior as active materials for supercapacitors, and their modification with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) improved their electrochemical behavior.
