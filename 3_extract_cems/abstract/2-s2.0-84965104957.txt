FC is a clean energy source alternative for electric vehicle and certain microgrid operations. However to compensate its slow dynamics and inability for tracking fast load transients it needs some auxiliary storage system like battery, supercapacitor (SC) or ultracapacitor (UC). This paper considers hybrid combination of FC-UC, as it has added advantages over other storage systems like instantaneous charging and discharging with increased lifetime of fuel cell. Furthermore, the paper proposes the dynamic model prediction based control strategy to achieve optimum current management. To optimize control efforts and computation complexity of optimization problem, the control strategy is used in two levels. The model predictive control (MPC) is used as outer control loop which provides optimal current references to the inner control loop which is designed using PI controller. The proposed control strategy is simulated and validated using MATLAB/SIMULINK.
