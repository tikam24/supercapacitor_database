In-Wheel Motor (IWM) which is a driving system of Electric Vehicles (EVs) is effective for improving driving stability of vehicle and reducing vehicle weight. However, IWM has not been put in practical use because of a possibility of power lines disconnection. Therefore, we have proposed Wireless In-Wheel Motor (W-IWM) in which Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) is used to remove these lines and to enhance practicability of IWM. Moreover, we have proposed the advanced system of W-IWM which has Lithium-ion Capacitor (LiC) and circuit for Dynamic-Wireless Power Transfer (D-WPT) on its wheel-side. In this paper, power management method of this system is proposed. By applying this control method, efficiency of regenerative breaking can be improved. Moreover, dynamic-wireless power transfer from a road-side infrastructure can be achieved on the wheel-side. The proposed method is verified by simulations and experiments including actual vehicle driving test.
