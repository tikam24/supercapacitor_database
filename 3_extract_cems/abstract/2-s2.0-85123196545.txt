Flexible carbon nanofibers (CNFs) were prepared by electrospinning of polyacrylonitrile, followed by peroxidation and carbonization treatments. Then, conductive Ni2P nanosheet arrays were vertically grown on the CNFs by phosphorizating of Ni-precursor on its surface. The obtained CNFs loaded by conductive Ni2P nanosheet arrays (Ni2P-CNFs) were directly used as flexible pseudocapacitive electrode materials. Results showed that the Ni2P-CNFs electrode displayed remarkable specific capacitance of 1057.5 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, good rate capability of 387.5 F g−1 at 50 A g−1 and prominent capacitance retention of 89.7% after 3000 cycles at 5 A g−1. Asymmetric supercapacitor based on Ni2P-CNFs and CNFs were fabricated, which showed energy density of 8.5 Wh kg−1 at power density of 353.3 W kg−1 and the capacitance was kept at 92.5% after 3000 cycles at 2 A g−1. Therefore, the conductive Ni2P-CNFs would be a promising pseudocapacitive electrode materials for asymmetric supercapacitor.
