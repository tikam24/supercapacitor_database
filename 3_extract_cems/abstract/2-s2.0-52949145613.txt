One of the important aim related to the transportation research activities is the development of a clean and efficient transport. Among the solutions, the hybrid electric vehicles are proposed to replace the conventional vehicles, due to their advantages of zero pollutant emissions, high efficiency and multi energy sources. In this paper a modular configuration representing a hybrid electric vehicle of 75 CP at 1/10 scale is described. The test bench is realized in the GESC Laboratory of UTBM Belfort and is containing many sources of energy: fuel tank, batteries, supercapacitors and fuel cells. The scheme and the structure of the modular test bench including the existing and the future functions are presented. The tests carried out and the results obtained through the measured data processing are described. The energetic model of the traction motor is developed and the modelling and simulations of the hybrid delivery/storage energy system consisting on batteries and supercapacitors are done.
