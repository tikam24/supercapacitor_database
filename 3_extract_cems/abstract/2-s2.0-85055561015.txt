NiCo2O4 (NCO) nanosheet decorated MnCo2O4 (MCO) nanoflakes are successfully prepared on a nickel foam surface using a one-step chemical bath deposition route for supercapacitor applications. The unique nanoflakes with nanosheet structures provide efficient pathways for rapid electron and ion transportation. As a result, the MCO-NCO composite electrode exhibits a higher specific capacitance of 1152 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, excellent rate capability and superior cycling stability (95.38% retention after 3000 cycles) compared to individual MCO nanoflakes and NCO nanosheets. These results show that the as-fabricated MCO-NCO composites are promising candidates for electrochemical supercapacitors.
