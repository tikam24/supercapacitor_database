Developing a generalized route to effectively fabricate periodic mechanically flexible graphene aerogels across several size orders and whole structural integrity on a large scale for flexible electronics is still a challenge. Herein, inspired by bamboo's natural hierarchical structure, a general method is developed to effectively fabricate biomimetic cellular graphene fibers using hydrogen bubbles and ice simultaneously as templates, whose whole size ranges from micro to several centimeters. Owing to its superior mechanical flexibility demonstrated by the in situ scanning electron microscope test and intrinsically good electrical conductivity, its potential in flexible electronics such as sensors, supercapacitors, and Niâ€“Zn batteries is carefully investigated. It not only shows superior sensitivity in the monitoring of the pulse pressure in sensor devices but also directly serves as a promising binder, flexible scaffold, and conductive additive, as well as extra active material in the energy storage device without any extra additives. This strategy can also be extended to fabricate other configurations of graphene aerogels such as spring-like type and bulk film, able to serve as the next generation of intelligent infrastructure for achieving multifunctional structural and functional tasks.
