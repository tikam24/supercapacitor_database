This paper focuses on the production of magnetic biochar through a novel vacuum condition in an electrical muffle furnace by employing durian rind as the raw material in the presence of three different metallic salts. A high BET surface area value of 835 m2 g−1was attained at the pyrolysis temperature and time of 800 °C and 25 min. This magnetic biochar was embedded with polypyrrole (PPY) through an in-situ polymerization process which improved specific capacitance of the polymer composite compared to the pure PPY and magnetic biochar. The MBCP composite exhibited the highest specific capacitance of 572 F g−1and energy density of 71.50 Wh kg−1compared to other existing PPY coated carbon composite. This MBCP composite exhibits a good potential for future low-cost supercapacitor applications with an impressive specific capacitance and energy density value.
