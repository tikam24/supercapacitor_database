The mesoporous carbon materials with different specific surface areas were prepared by using SBA-15 as template and sucrose as carbon source under different carbonization temperatures. By means of infrared spectrometer(IR), low-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm, the effects of carbonization temperature on morphology, specific surface area, pore volume and specific capacitance of the mesoporous carbon materials were investigated. It was found that the optimal carbonization temperature was 700°C. TEM results showed that the sample possessed two-dimensional (2-D) hexagonally ordered mesoporous structure. N2 adsorption-desorption showed that the pore volume of the sample was 1.88 cm3·g-1, the specific surface area was 1394 m2·g-1. It possessed mesoporous structure and narrow pore size distribution, and the average pore size was 3.4 nm. The electrochemical behavior of the sample used as electrode material and supercapacitor was investigated by cyclic voltammetry(CV) test. The mesoporous carbon material was found to be a promising electrode material for the application of supercapacitor. The specific capacitance of the electrode was as high as 212 F·g-1 in 6 mol·L-1 KOH solution at a scanning rate of 1 mV·s-1.
