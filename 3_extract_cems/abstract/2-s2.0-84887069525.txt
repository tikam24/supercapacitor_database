Urchin-like Ni(OH)2-Co(OH)2 hollow microspheres were successfully synthesized by a microwave-incorporated hydrothermal method. The Ni(OH)2-Co(OH)2 hollow microspheres achieved a high specific capacitance of 2164 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and long-term cycle life. Electrochemical data reveal that the Ni(OH) 2-Co(OH)2 hollow microspheres exhibits much better electrochemical reversibility and specific capacitance retention than that of the single Ni(OH)2 or Co(OH)2 based on peak potential difference, symmetry of charge-discharge curves, and specific capacitances at high charge-discharge rates. Furthermore, the designed Ni(OH) 2-Co(OH)2/graphene asymmetric supercapacitor displays good reversibility and a high specific capacitance of 169 F g-1 at 1 A g-1, 145 F g-1 at 3 A g-1, and 116 F g -1 at 5 A g-1, indicating a good ability to deliver a high energy density at a high power density. These results proved that the Ni(OH)2-Co(OH)2 hollow microspheres can be promising electroactive materials for supercapacitor and the microwave-incorporated hydrothermal method provided a one-step, template-free, and cost-effective route for fabricating pseudocapacitive materials in 3-D form.
