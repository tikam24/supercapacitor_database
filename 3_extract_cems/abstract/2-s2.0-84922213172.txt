Methyl 4-((9H-(carbazole-9-carbanothioylthio) benzoate (MCzCTB) was chemically synthesized and characterized by FTIR, 1HNMR, and 13CNMR. A novel synthesized monomer was electropolymerized on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) in various initial molar concentrations of [MCzCTB]0 = 1, 3, 5, and 10 mM in 0.1 M NaClO4/CH3 CN and 1 M H2 SO4. P(MCzCTB)/GCE was characterized by cyclic voltammetry, Fourier transform infrared-attenuated transmittance reflectance, scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The capacitive behavior of the modified electrode was obtained by Nyquist, Bode-magnitude, and Bode-phase plots. The highest capacitance at low frequency was obtained as âˆ¼53.1 mF cm-2 from Nyquist plot and 19.454 Fg-1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s-1 for [MCzCTB]0 = 1.0 mM. CS2 and OCH3 groups are electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups in the monomer structure. These groups affect the polymerization and capacitive behavior of the polymer. The polymer may be used for supercapacitor and biosensor applications in the future.
