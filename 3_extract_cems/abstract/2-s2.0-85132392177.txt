In this work, the study of the electrodeposition of polyaniline (PANI) on Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) substrate by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry from an acidic medium (0.5 M H2SO4 + 0.01 M Aniline + 0.1 M Na2SO4) revealed that the PANI electropolymerization is a quasi-reversible reaction controlled by the diffusion process. The electrochemical performances investigation using cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic charge-discharge methods demonstrated that the PANI electrodeposited film is a pseudocapacitive material. The higher specific capacitance is about 21.76 mF cm−2 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1, this value decreases increasing the scan rate. Similarly, the charge-discharge curves showed a specific capacitance of 9 mF cm−2 at 0.1 A cm−2.
