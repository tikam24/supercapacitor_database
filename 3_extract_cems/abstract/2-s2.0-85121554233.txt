Due to the rapid increase of environmental pollution caused by automobiles. To decrease pollution and to save our resources, there is an alternator to use an electric vehicle instead of a gasoline engine. The main drawback of a gasoline engine of compared to the electric vehicle can polluter noise efficiency durability. When it comes to durability, efficiency, and acceleration capabilities of electric vehicles, they are more impressive. The electric vehicles involve HEVs and BEVs. Generally, ultra-capacitor, solar Photovoltaic (PV) system, batters, regenerative braking systems and flywheel are utilized in HEVs as energy storage devices. All energy storage devices are linked to this distinct dc-dc converter scheme for raising input sourcesâ€™ voltage. In past few decades, most HEVs have incorporated multi-input converters in order to enhance their reliability and efficiency. There are several distinct multi-input dc-dc converter schemas utilized in HEVs. This research discusses their current and future trends as well as energy storage devices.
