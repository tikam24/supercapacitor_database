Nitrogen-doped hollow carbon microspheres (NHCMs) are fabricated rapidly in 15 min through tri-constitute assembly of melamine, formaldehyde and silica spheres. The use of silica nanospheres affords the formation of spherical carbon architectures covered in macropores. The obtained NHCMs possess large hollow cores and hierarchical porous shell with interconnected macropores of 250 nm and a broad micro/meso pore size of 1.5–10 nm. The NHCMs carbonized at different temperatures exhibit high nitrogen content (2.35–17.53%) and high surface area (216–659 m2 g−1), which manifesting a good capacitance of 106 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, as well as high cycling stability with 5% degradation over 1000 cycles.
