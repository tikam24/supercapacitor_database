Functional porous carbon materials have attracted significant attentions due to their unique characteristics. Herein, the synthesis of N-doped hierarchically porous carbon (N-HPC) with ordered mesopores from liquefied wood is reported through a soft-templating and chemical blowing method with the assistance of NH4Cl to regulate their pore architectures. The NH4Cl strengthens the interactions between the carbon sources and soft templates in the hydrothermal process to produce carbon materials with highly ordered mesostructure after carbonization. Then, the obtained carbon is ground with NH4Cl, where NH4Cl releases NH3 and HCl upon heating to introduce N atoms and micropores into the carbon structures. Highly ordered p6mm mesostructure, high specific surface area (1160 m2 g−1) and nitrogen content of 3.75 wt% are obtained with the assistance of NH4Cl, which together affords them enhanced electrochemical performance for supercapacitors. The obtained N-HPC electrode displays a specific capacitance of 282 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and good rate capability.
