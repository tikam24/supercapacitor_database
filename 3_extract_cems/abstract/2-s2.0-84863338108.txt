A novel method is described for fabricating an all-solid-state flexible micro-supercapacitor. The microelectrodes of the supercapacitor are prepared by in situ electrodeposition of polyaniline (PANI) nanorods on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) patterns that are fabricated by micromolding in capillaries. The morphologies of PANI nanorods could be controlled by the concentration of aniline and the growth time in the electrodeposition process. The micro-supercapacitor possesses electrochemical capacitance as high as 970 F g -1 at a discharge current density of 2.5 A g -1, as well as good stability, retaining 90% of its initial capacitance after 1700 consecutive cycles for the synergistic effect of these new rGO/PANI nanostructures. The results show that the method could represent a route for translating the interesting fundamental properties of rGO and conducting polymers into technologically viable energy devices. Furthermore, this study might further guide the preparation of functional graphene-based materials. Copyright Â© 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
