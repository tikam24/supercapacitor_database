Supercapacitor: A π conjugated microporous polymer with an aza-fused framework is reported. The porous framework is conductive and allows electrolyte ions to move into the pores because of structural features (see picture). The material becomes highly co-operative in the formation of electrostatic charge-separation layers, shows exceptional capacitance in supercapacitive energy storage, provides high energy densities, and offers an excellent cycle life.
