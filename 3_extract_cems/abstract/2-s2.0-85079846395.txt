Advances in microelectronic system technology have necessitated the development and miniaturization of energy storage devices. Supercapacitors are an important complement to batteries in microelectronic systems; and further reduction of the size of micro-supercapacitors is challenging. Here, a novel strategy is demonstrated to break through the resolution limit of micro-supercapacitors by preparing nano-supercapacitors (NSCs) with interdigital nanosized electrodes using focused ion beam technology. The minimization of the size of the NSCs leads to a large increase in capacitance, with a high areal capacitance of 9.52 mF cm−2 and a volumetric capacitance of 18 700 F cm−3, far superior to those of other reported works. Size reduction and the narrowing of the physical separation between nanoelectrodes are proved to be the most crucial factors in the enhancement of capacitive performances. New charge-storage mechanisms are discovered with a remarkable nonfaradaic double-layer capacitance that exists due to the considerable inner electric field force at the nanoscale. The developed strategy and the first set of data provided here shed light on the design and fabrication of flexible interdigitated NSCs that rival state-of-the-art supercapacitors in performance.
