A novel hybrid composed of carbonization lignin-free wood as an effective scaffold for loading CoS, NiS nanofibers with Co, Ni flower-like structure attached Co, Ni nanoparticles is fabricated as electrode material for high-performance supercapacitor. For the resultant, the natural porous pipe structure of wood provides a large number of electrolyte ions channels for the hybrid. The flower-like NiS, CoS distributed along the carbonized wood pipe gather together to form NiS nanofibers. These NiS and CoS nanofibers interweave with each other to form some new pores, which is helpful for the transport of electrolyte ions. As a result, the synergistic effect of these components endows the wood-based hybrid with good supercapacitive performance: high gravity (volumetric) energy densities of 46 Wh kg−1 (66 Wh L-1) are obtained, meanwhile sustaining high gravity (volumetric) power densities of 68 kW kg−1 (50 kW L-1).
