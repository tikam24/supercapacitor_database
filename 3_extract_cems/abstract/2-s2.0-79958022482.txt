2-Aminoanthraquinone (AAQ) molecules were covalently grafted onto chemically modified graphene (CMG), and the AAQ functionalized CMG sheets were self-assembled into macroporous hydrogels for supercapacitor electrodes. The electrode based on the AAQ modified self-assembled graphene hydrogel (AQSGH) showed a high specific capacitance of 258 F g-1 at a discharge current density of 0.3 A g-1, which is much larger than that of a pure graphene hydrogel (193 F g-1). Furthermore, the AQSGH electrode exhibited excellent rate capability and a long cycle life. This is mainly due to the covalently bonded AAQ moieties contributing additional redox capacitance. Furthermore, the highly conductive graphene hydrogel scaffold provided a large specific surface area for forming electric double layers and convenient routes for charge transfer and electrolyte diffusion.
