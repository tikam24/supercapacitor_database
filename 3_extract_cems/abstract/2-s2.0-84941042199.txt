Hybridizing nanocarbons, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) or graphene (G), with inorganic and organic compounds is a powerful strategy to designing next-generation functional materials for environmental and sustainable energy applications. While research on nanocomposites, created by dispersing the nancarbon into polymer and ceramic matrices, was started almost immediately after the popularization of CNTs and graphene in 1991 and 2004, respectively, nanocarbon hybrids are a relatively recent addition to the family of composite materials. In contrast to nanocomposites, which typically combine the intrinsic properties of both compounds, nanocarbon hybrids additionally provide access to both a large surface area required for gas-liquid-solid interactions and an extended interface, through which charge and energy transfer processes create synergistic effects that result in unique properties and superior performance. This chapter summarizes the current progress of nanocarbon hybrid materials and reviews the most intriguing results on their performance in heterogenous catalysis, electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, batteries, supercapacitors, photovoltaics and sensors.
