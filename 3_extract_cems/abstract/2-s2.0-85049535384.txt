This investigation focuses on the in situ preparation of cobalt oxide through a less explored potentiodynamic approach under ambient conditions. A spinel structured feather like p-type cobalt oxide is obtained having dual bandgaps. Gracing Incidence x-ray Diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, UV-Visble spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscope and Hall measurement are used to study the structural, optical, morphological and electrical characteristics of the film. The prepared film showed an excellent cyclic stability upto 1600 number of cycles and good charge retention as obtained from cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements. A high specific capacitance of 396.67 F g-1, specific energy 71.40 Wh kg-1 and specific power 10.02 kW kg-1 is obtained, implying supercapacitive nature of the material. Overall a sustainable energy storage material, prepared by template free potentiodynamic method for new generation devices has been explored in this work.
