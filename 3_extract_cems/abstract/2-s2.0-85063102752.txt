The sol-gel polycondensation method was used to prepare a resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) hydrogels. The RF gels and RF gels with the addition of graphite intercalation compound (GIC) were carbonised at 1000 Â°C in N 2 atmosphere to obtain carbon xerogels (CX) and CX-GIC composites, respectively. The purpose of this paper was to describe the impact of admixture of GIC on the electrochemical performance of CX-GIC composites. Studies of morphological, crystalline and porous properties of obtained xerogels showed that the addition of GIC resulted in changes of the carbon matrix. It has been proved that xerogel CX and composites CX-GIC are electrochemically active in aqueous alkaline solution. The addition of GIC caused an enhanced of electrochemical activity. The specific capacitances for CX-GIC electrodes were also higher, from 21 to 65%, than for the carbon xerogel electrode. The increase of capacitance depended on the amount of GIC added.
