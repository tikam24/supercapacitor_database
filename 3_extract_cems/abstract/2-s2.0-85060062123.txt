A new class electroactive material with favorable architectures allowing high surface area, large conductivity and good mechanical stability is strongly needed to further improve the energy density, recharging ability and sustained cycle life of wearable supercapacitors. Herein, this study reports the rational and multicomponent design of hierarchical CoFe 2 Se 4 (CFS) nanorods adhered to CoNiSe 2 (CNS) microspheres via facile and eco-friendly synthesis methods. The as-prepared hierarchical CFS-CNS robust architectures enhance the specific surface area, porosity and also increase the availability of electrochemical active sites, which provides ideal pathways for electrolyte diffusion and facilitates electron transportation. Moreover, the assembled fabric-based CFS-CNS//CFS-CNS symmetric SC achieves high energy density of 80.2 W h kg -1 at 1000 W kg -1 and delivers exceptional cycling stability of 97.02% retention over 3000 cycles as well as exhibits excellent flexibility to sustain various deformations including bending and twisting. Utilizing the outstanding energy storage performance, the symmetric SC can light up light-emitting diode for real-time applications.
