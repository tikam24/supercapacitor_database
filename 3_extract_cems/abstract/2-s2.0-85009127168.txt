Three-dimensional (3D)/carbon nanotube composite materials were fabricated by chemical vapor deposition method using diatomite as templates. The morphology, surface area and pore size distribution of the 3D graphene/carbon nanotube composite materials were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and brunauer-emmett-teller measurement (BET), respectively. The electrochemical properties of the supercapacitor in H2SO4 electrolyte were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) techniques. It was found that the supercapacitor exhibited an outstanding specific capacitance value of 110 F/g in 1 mol/L H2SO4 electrolyte at a scan rate of 2 mV/s, and the capacitors stay stable with 10 000 cycles at 50 mV/s.
