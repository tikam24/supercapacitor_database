Supercapacitors become promising devices to apply in some field like wearable device because the impressive electrochemical performance and excellent safety performance. Liquid electrolytes bring some problems such as leakage and vapor tension. Meanwhile, temperature-tolerance is an important topic in supercapacitor. Solid polymer electrolytes, a separator for active electrodes, possess many advantages over liquid electrolytes like devoid of leakage, chemical and mechanical stabilities over a wide temperature rand and non-volatility. In this paper, a double network solid state electrolyte was developed. A densely crosslinked polyvinyl alcohol (C-PVA) will become the first network and the coarsely crosslinked poly (2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (C-pHEMA) as the second network. The 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoro-methylsulfonyl) imide (EMImTFSI) as ionic liquid. Mean-while, PBI solid-state el-ectrolyte is another thing we want to synthesis. Porous H3PO4-doped PBI will supply outstanding mechanical property and wide temperature range. Through water vapor, we can get porous gel. The poly (vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) was modified with MMT and ILs to increase the ionic conductivity and wide window of electrochemical stability.
