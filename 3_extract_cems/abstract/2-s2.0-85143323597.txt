The supercapacitor is an intriguing future energy storage device. 2D nanomaterials such as Graphene oxide (GO) and MoS2 are well-known electrostatic double layer capacitance (EDLC) based electrode materials. In the present work, the effect of compositing CeO2 with GO and MoS2 on their electrochemical performance has been investigated. The crystal structure of the pure CeO2 and composites were confirmed by XRD analysis. Raman spectroscopic analysis revealed the F2g vibration mode of CeO2, D and G bands of GO nanosheets. SEM analysis confirmed the spherical morphology of CeO2 nanoparticle and sheets like morphology of rGO and MoS2. The SEM images of composites show the presence of spherical particles and nanosheets, which confirm the formation of CeO2/rGO and CeO2/MoS2 nanocomposites. The electrochemical characteristics of CeO2/rGO and CeO2/MoS2 nanocomposites-based electrode materials were evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronopotentiometry (CP), and EIS analyses. The CeO2, CeO2/MoS2, and CeO2/rGO electrodes exhibited the specific capacitance of 660, 866, and 959 Fg-1, respectively at 5mVs-1. Due to the synergistic effect of CeO2 with rGOand MoS2, the CeO2/rGO and CeO2/MoS2 nanocomposite electrode materials have shown improved energy storage performance compared to pure CeO2.
