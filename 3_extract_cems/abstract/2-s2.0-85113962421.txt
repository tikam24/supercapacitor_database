Fabrication of high-performance supercapacitors with exceptional mechanical flexibility and durability for wearable electronics still remains an elusive challenge. In this paper, oriented polyaniline (PANI) nanowires were in-situ polymerized on a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)/polypropylene (PP) fabric to produce highly robust flexible electrodes for high-performance supercapacitor. The obtained binder-free PANI/rGO/PEDOT/PP electrode fulfills an outstanding electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance (Cs) of 572.7 mF/cm2 and excellent retention of 97.4% over 5000 cycles. More significantly, the corresponding symmetrical supercapacitors could achieve a high Cs of 432.1 mF/cm2 and a satisfactory energy density of 49.6 Î¼Wh/cm2. In addition, this device exhibits very stable capacitance properties with the Cs retention of 95.3% and 92.9% under mechanical bending and folding over 1000 times, respectively. All these results indicate a remarkably enhanced electrochemical performance, which provided a valuable reference for the development of flexible supercapacitor electrodes.
