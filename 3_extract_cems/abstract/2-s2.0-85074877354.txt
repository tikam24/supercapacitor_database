This paper proposed a braking energy recovery method for novel power supply model tram supplied power by fuel cell (FC) and super capacitor (SC). In the method, an optimized vehicle braking speed curve can be got according to motor vehicle braking characteristic curve, maximum deceleration, braking distance, SC absorption capacity and comfort in the vehicle brake stage. When the tramway runs according to the optimized vehicle braking speed curve, the FC consumption energy will decrease by 7.45%, the breaking resistors consumption energy will decrease by 7.93%, and the SC recover braking energy will increase by 7.83%. The method changed the braking power by changing braking speed, and decreased the braking resistors consumption energy and improved the SC recovery energy. And that the method was based on pontryagin's minimum principle (PMP) energy management method to make the system transient hydrogen consumption minimum in the vehicle traction stage; The PMP energy management method also ensures the state of charge (SoC) of SC from start to terminal time accordant in order that controlling the SC SoC in the tram running process.
