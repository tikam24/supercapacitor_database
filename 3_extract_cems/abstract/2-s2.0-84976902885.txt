In this work the production and investigation of nano-porous carbon material from organic raw materials of plant origin with different promoters - KOH and ZnCl2. The basic energy capacitive characteristics of materials, the specific capacity of the materials obtained with KOH and ZnCl2 activation is 205 F/g and 138 F/g, respectively.
