We use Fe as dopant in the metal–organic framework (MOF) of [(CH3)2NH2]Mn(HCOO)3, and four crystals were obtained with hydrothermal method according to the doping ratio: [(CH3)2NH2]Mn(HCOO)3, [(CH3)2NH2]Fe0.1Mn0.9(HCOO)3, [(CH3)2NH2]Fe0.2Mn0.8(HCOO)3 and [(CH3)2NH2]Fe0.3Mn0.7(HCOO)3. And their electrochemical properties were studied by measuring cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge and electrochemical impendence spectrum. The results showed that the sample of [(CH3)2NH2]Fe0.1Mn0.9(HCOO)3 performed the highest specific electrical capacity of 167.95 F g−1 at a current density of 0.01 A g−1. This work suggests that a small amount of Fe doping can improve the electrochemical performance of MOFs-based supercapacitors.
