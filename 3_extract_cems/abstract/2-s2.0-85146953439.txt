Multifunctional copper oxide (CONP = 80% CuO and 20% Cu2O) nanoparticles (~ 13 nm) have been successfully synthesized using M. oleifera leaf extract for photothermal and hybrid supercapacitor applications. A very small amount (~ 0.03 mg/mL) of these synthesized CONP could convert 22.6% of near-infrared photons (~ 975 nm) to thermal energy and has the capability of destroying ~ 50% of B16F10 melanoma cells by the photothermal effect. The same CONP also displayed excellent energy (> 20 Wh/kg) and power (> 10,000 W/kg) density outputs, when employed as electrode material in an electrochemical workstation. Further, the developed CONP exhibits hybrid supercapacitor material properties, which can be repeatedly utilized as an electrode material over 8000 cycles of operations with merely a 10 % loss in specific capacitance value. Hence, the developed copper oxide nanoparticle has the ability to demonstrate multifunctionality in both the biological and electrochemical energy storage sector.
