Well-aligned hierarchical NiMoO4 nanorods are successfully grown on nickel foam by a facile hydrothermal method, which can be directly used as integrated electrodes for supercapacitors without the addition of other ancillary materials such as binders or additives to enhance electrode cycling stability or conductivity. The samples are characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. The achieved NiMoO4 nanorods are uniformly grown on nickel foam with the average diameter of 100 nm and length of 3 Î¼m. The results indicate that the NiMoO4 nanorod samples deliver high specific capacitances of 3412, 2490, 1740, and 1496 F/g at 1, 4, 7, and 10 A/g, respectively. Furthermore, the excellent rate capability of the NiMoO4 nanorod based supercapacitors has been obtained in the KOH electrolyte, demonstrating that the as-prepared products can be promising electrode materials for supercapacitors.
