Environmental and energy issues have always been a hot topic of global research. Oil leakage has caused great damage to the environment, affecting a wide area and it is difficult to clean up. In most cases, carbon-based adsorbents are typically utilized to remove oil spills because of their economic benefits and high adsorbent efficiency. At the same time, its excellent material properties can also be used for the preparation of supercapacitors. In this paper, the carbon aerogels were prepared by the one-step method. The prepared materials endowed a 3D network structure with a huge number of micropores and mesoporous, and the material is light-weight, stable, hydrophobic and has affinity for oil (17.02g/g) to the KGM carbon aerogel. Through the physic-chemical characterization, the KGM carbon aerogel shows specific surface area is 689m2/g, high water contact angle (136.64) and excellent reusability (more than 15 cycle times). In addition, we also discussed the electrochemical properties of the material and obtained the specific electrical capacity of 139F/g under the condition of 1A/g.
