The supercapacitor is one of key energy storage elements in wind power flow optimization and control system, while highly efficient and reliable voltage equalizing strategy is a precondition that the supercapacitor is used in middle and high-power applications. A model for supercapacitor voltage equalizing strategy is introduced in the paper, accordingly, a novel supercapacitor voltage equalizing method having fast equalizing speed and high equalizing precision, namely adjoining inductor voltage equalizing method is proposed. The method detects the voltage of each supercapacitor in real time, uses the inductor as energy transfer medium and uses the semiconductor switching device as control switch, which can transfer the energy in the capacitor with the higher voltage into that with the lower voltage. The working principle and the working process of the proposed method are analyzed in detail, then the rule to adjust duty ratio of control switch and the principle to choose parameter of inductor are presented. Finally, simulation analysis and experiment of the two modules composed of 12 supercapacitors are performed. Simulation and experiment results show that the adjoining inductor voltage equalizing method reduces the voltage discrepancy between the supercapacitor modules, increases the average voltage of serial modules, and markedly improves the consistency of the module voltage. So the proposed voltage equalizing strategy has comparatively high practicable value in wind power flow optimization and control system.
