In this paper, a multi-input interleaved DC-DC converter with reduced current ripple is designed. The interleaving structure present in the front end side of the converter reduces the current ripple. Switched capacitors are present at output side which provides wide input voltage gain. Multi-input makes the converter to gather input from multiple sources like solar array, battery, super-capacitors etc. Here two converters with different sources are paralleled so that if one of the sources is absent, the output remains the same. Duty cycle adjustment based closed loop control is adopted here. The output of the converter is given to a three phase inverter to control the BLDC motor that can be used for electric vehicle application.
