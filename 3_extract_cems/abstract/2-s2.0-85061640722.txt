Novel nanostructured Fe 2 O 3 with a network of 3D mesoporous nanosheets was synthesized by depositing on carbon fabric (Fe 2 O 3 @CF) for use as an anode using a potentially low-cost electrodeposition technique. The electrode with freestanding binder-free Fe 2 O 3 @CF of high surface area displayed an exceptional specific capacitance of 394.2 F g −1 . Moreover, a flexible solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was fabricated with a negative electrode based on Fe 2 O 3 @CF and a positive electrode based on MnO 2 @CF in the presence of PVA-LiCl as gel electrolyte. The above ASC exhibited a high operating potential up to 1.8 V, a favorable specific capacitance of 93.5 F g −1 (2.92 F cm −3 ), long-term stability (91.3% retention of initial value over 5000 cycles), and remarkable mechanical stability and flexibility, suggesting its potential application for wearable electronics.
