A novel electrode material based on P-doped dandelion-like MnCo2S4 spheres was fabricated and examined for application in electrochemical supercapacitors. The unique structure made up of nanoneedles endows high electrical conductivity and large accessible ion-diffusion surface area. When used as the electrode, the P-doped MnCo2S4 nanostructures give an improved specific capacity of 543.3F g−1. A supercapacitor employing the P-MnCo2S4 and active carbon as the electrodes shows a high energy density of 20.8 W h k g−1 at a power density of 400 W kg−1, and an excellent cycling stability of 91.1% retention after 5000 cycles. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we show that the as-made supercapacitor is able to drive three LEDs.
