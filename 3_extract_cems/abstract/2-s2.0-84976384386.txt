Sandwich-type ordered mesoporous carbon/graphene nanocomposites were successfully synthesized using 2D ordered mesoporous silica/graphene nanocomposites as the hard template and an ionic liquid as a N-rich carbon source. We used an ionic liquid of 1-(3-cyanopropyl)-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide containing nitrile groups (–CN) in the cation and anion as a carbon precursor for the preparation of the nanocomposites. Nitriles do not decompose under thermal treatment in an inert gas atmosphere, but leave significant amounts of N-rich carbon materials. The nanocomposites had a large surface area (1,316 m2·g–1), an average pore diameter of 5.9 nm, and high electrical conductivity. The nanocomposite electrode showed a high specific capacitance of 190 F·g–1 at 0.5 A·g–1 in 1 M TEABF4/AN electrolyte and a good rate capability between 0 and 2.7 V for supercapacitor (or ultracapacitor) applications.
