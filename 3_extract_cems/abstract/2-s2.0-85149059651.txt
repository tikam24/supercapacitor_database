We investigated the microstructure and electrochemical properties of a series of hollow carbon nanofibers (HCNFs) fabricated via coaxial electrospinning of poly(amic acid) (PAA, shell part) as a precursor of polyimide (PI) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA, core part) solutions, followed by heat treatment for imidization at 300 °C and carbonization at 1000 °C. The core–shell structure of PI/PMMA-derived HCNFs could be controlled by the flow rate (0.0–0.8 mL/h) of the core solution during the coaxial electrospinning. HCNF-28 and HCNF-38, which were manufactured at the core flow rates of 0.2 and 0.3 mL/h, respectively, exhibited a stable hollow morphological feature, unlike other HCNFs. It was also revealed that an ordered graphitic structure with fewer defects was developed for HCNF-28 and HCNF-38. Consistently, the electrical conductivity was relatively high, with a value of 1.17 S/cm for HCNF-28 and 1.35 S/cm for HCNF-38. The overall performance of a symmetric supercapacitor system, made up of two free-standing HCNF-28 electrodes, was found to be high in aspects of specific capacitance (ranging from 220.6 to 108.6F/g), power density (from 250 to 5,000 W/kg), and energy density (from 18.0 to 7.0 Wh/kg) when evaluated at current densities from 1 to 10 A/g.
