This work presents the synthesis of ternary composites at laboratory and bench scale. A possible industrial scale-up was also evaluated. The synthesis of polyaniline on nickel oxide–carbon black (NiO-CB) was carried out by chemical polymerization. Several modifications were formulated to carry out the bench scale production. Based on the experimental results obtained at laboratory scale, the synthesis, washing and drying processes were redesigned for the bench scale test. The material obtained at bench scale was characterized by physicochemical (SEM, EDS, FTIR, DRX, BET) and electrochemical techniques (galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy). The products obtained at both scales presented similar physicochemical properties and a very good electrochemical performance.
