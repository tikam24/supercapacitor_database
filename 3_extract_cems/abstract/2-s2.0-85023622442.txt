A nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) method has been presented as the energy management strategy of a battery-supercapacitor (SC) hybrid energy storage system (H-ESS) in a Toyota Rav4EV. For the first time, the NMPC has been shown to be real-time implementable for these fast systems. The performance of the proposed controller has been demonstrated against a linear model predictive control (LMPC) and a rule-based control (RBC) strategy. The NMPC shows to outperform the RBC even with no prior knowledge of the future trip available. The NMPC also shows performance improvement over the LMPC by compensating for the error accompanied by linearization in LMPCs. Hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) testing has been performed to demonstrate the NMPC capability for real-time implementation in a battery-SC H-ESS. Upon carefully choosing the prediction horizon and control horizon size, as well as the maximum number of iterations, the turn-around time for the control update is shown to fall far below the necessary sampling time of 10 ms in vehicle control.
