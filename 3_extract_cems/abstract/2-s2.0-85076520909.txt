Niobium-based oxides including niobium oxide (Nb2O5) and their analogues with quasi-2D network of open and stable Wadsley-Roth shear crystal structure, have gained great interest for advanced hybrid supercapacitors due to their outstanding rate capability derived from the intercalation pseudocapacitive kinetics. To realize their full potential as battery-type anode electrodes for supercapacitor, various strategies have been effectively implemented to overcome the drawbacks especially the poor intrinsic electrical conductivity, including structure design, surface modification, conductivity enhancement, and electrode engineering. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the latest progress of Nb-based oxides for high-rate hybrid supercapacitors in the aspects of structure-performance relationship, performance-optimizing strategies, and energy storage mechanisms. We will also present our insights into the challenges and perspectives for future development and industrial applications.
