It's significant to find an atom-economic way to prepare graphene-manganese oxide nanocomposites for supercapacitors. Herein, a highly atom-efficient strategy is reported to synthesize reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-Mn3O4nanoparticles composite for supercapacitors. First, rGO/MnSO4suspension is obtained by hydrothermal reduction of graphene oxide (GO)/MnSO4suspension, which is directly produced via Hummers method, and then rGO-Mn3O4nanoparticles composites are prepared by precipitation of Mn3O4nanoparticles anchored in-situ on rGO sheets. The as-prepared rGO-Mn3O4nanocomposites with 86.96% Mn3O4exhibit high specific capacitance of 258.6 F g−1and 186.2 F g−1at 0.25 A g−1, when using 2 M KOH and 1 M Na2SO4solution as electrolyte, respectively. More importantly, with the wastewater recovered in the preparation process as electrolyte, the rGO-Mn3O4composites can deliver a high specific capacitance of 221.6 F g−1at 50 mA g−1and 97.1% of the initial capacitance is retained after 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1. In addition, the rGO-MnO2nanosheets composites can also be obtained via a similar strategy. Obviously, this work provides an atom-efficient way for preparation of rGO-manganese oxide nanocomposites for supercapacitors by fully utilizing effective components of the reaction system, including the wastewater.
