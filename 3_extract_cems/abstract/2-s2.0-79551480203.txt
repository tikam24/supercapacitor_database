The nickel-zinc ferrite (Ni0.8Zn0.2Fe 2O4) thin films have been successfully deposited on stainless steel substrates using a chemical bath deposition method from alkaline bath. The films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), static water contact angle and cyclic voltammetry measurements. The X-ray diffraction pattern shows that deposited Ni0.8Zn0.2Fe 2O4 thin films were oriented along (3 1 1) plane. The FTIR spectra showed strong absorption peaks around 600 cm-1 which are typical for cubic spinel crystal structure. SEM study revealed compact flakes like morphology having thickness ∼1.8 μm after air annealing. The annealed films were super hydrophilic in nature having a static water contact angle (θ) of 5°.The electrochemical supercapacitor study of Ni 0.8Zn0.2Fe2O4 thin films has been carried out in 6 M KOH electrolyte. The values of interfacial and specific capacitances obtained were 0.0285 F cm-2 and 19 F g-1, respectively. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
