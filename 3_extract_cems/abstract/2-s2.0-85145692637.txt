We report the synthesis of ternary CoS/MXene/PANI and CoS/MXene/ PEDOT composites using supercritical fluid (SCF) method for the first time. These fabricated materials along with CoS/MXene was gone through electrochemical investigations using three electrode system. Enhancement in specific capacitance was observed with inclusion of PANI (407 F/g) and further enhanced with PEDOT (630 F/g) at 2 A/g. Therefore, symmetric device using coin cell technique was fabricated by taking CoS/MXene/PEDOT and CoS/MXene/PANI as electrode material. These coin cells were further be examined on the basis of CV, GCD and EIS and it was observed that the specific capacitance was enhance in CoS/MXene/PEDOT (331.1 F/g) over CoS/MXene/PANI (246 F/g) at 2 A/g. For the material, the capacitance retention was calculated to evaluate the charge storage stability and it was observed that the CoS/MXene/PEDOT (97%) is slightly higher stable than CoS/MXene/PANI (96%). Overall electrochemical performance was observed to be enhanced by inclusion of PANI and PEDOT because it has lower resistance and higher specific capacitance along with these polymers, MXene nanosheets also play a vital role in enhancing the specific capacitance of the heterostrucutre by providing the larger surface area.
