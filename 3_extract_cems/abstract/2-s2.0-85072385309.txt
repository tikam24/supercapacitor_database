In recent years, the invention of electric vehicles solved problems like lacking of resources, but at the same time, other problems raised, including aging of electric vehicles and low energy efficiency. With the background of global development of electric vehicles, we launched a wireless electric vehicle system, using wireless energy, supercapacitor energy storage and re-release to charge electric vehicles better. Wireless electric transmission refers to wireless electric transmission between power supply and electric vehicles. In addition, the supercapacitor is at the core of the energy storage system, and the self-starting circuit is used to supply energy without complicated power supply circuit. Compared with lithium batteries, supercapacitors have significantly improved the performance of overcharging, overdischarging, stability and safety.
