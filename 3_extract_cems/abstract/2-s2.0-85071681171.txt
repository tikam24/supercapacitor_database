The layered Co3O4 nanosheets with porous nature on Ti mesh were adopted to optimize the transfer resistance by a facile hydrothermal method. The synthesized materials were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electrochemical techniques. The results showed that the materials consisted of well-arranged micrometer length rectangular 2D flakes with uniform pore distribution. This unique microstructure obtained the electrode lower transfer resistance, higher structure stability, and better electrochemical performance for supercapacitor. The 2D porous layered Co3O4 nanosheet could achieve a relatively good capacitance retention of 91.8% at a current density of 100 mA·g-1 after 1 000 cycles and a low transfer resistance (Rct) of 0.29 Ω. These remarkable supercapacitive performances are attributed to the rationally 2D layered structure on flexible Ti mesh substrate, high utilization ratio of active materials of the flexible Co3O4/Ti electrode.
