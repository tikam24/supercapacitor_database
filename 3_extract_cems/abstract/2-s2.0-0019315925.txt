A new configuration containing only two operational amplifiers and a single resistor has been shown to simulate a grounded supercapacitor (D) frequency-dependent negative resistance element based on the usual one-pole rolloff characteristics of the active o.a. device. Appropriate insertion of only one additional RC section yields a novel network with multi-filter function capabilities having independent Q and ω0adjustments at very low active and passive sensitivities. With suitable design, a minimal circuit realisation of a variable frequency active R oscillator can be derived from the proposed configuration. © 1980, The Institution of Electrical Engineers.
