The nickel manganese sulfide (Ni-Mn-S) anchored on graphitic carbon nitride/graphene (g-C3N4-G) composite (Ni-Mn-S/g-C3N4-G) was prepared via a one-pot solvothermal method for supercapacitor application. FE-SEM and TEM analyses confirmed that the Ni-Mn-S nanoparticles were attached with the graphitic carbon nitride/graphene nanosheets (g-C3N4-G). The g-C3N4-G sheets deliver a large surface area to reduce self-aggregation and confine the morphology of the Ni-Mn-S particles, resulting highly conductive network of Ni-Mn-S/g-C3N4-G. Ni-Mn-S/g-C3N4-G based electrode exhibited high specific capacitance of 1697 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 and excellent rate capability (91% capacity retention after 2,000 cycles at 10 A g-1) due to the abundant porous nanostructure, relatively high specific surface area, well-defined spherical morphology, and the synergetic effect of Ni-Mn-S and g-C3N4-G.
