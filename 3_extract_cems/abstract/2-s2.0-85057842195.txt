Co2(OH)3Cl was synthesized by a facile solvothermal method with different solvent ratios of water/glycol (Vwater:Vglycol). The Co2(OH)3Cl prepared at the ratio of 1:2 showed uniform cubic nanostructure and provided the highest specific capacitance of 321.79 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. The capacitance retention and the Coulombic efficiency were both kept at 100% without obvious decay after continuous 10,000 charge-discharge cycles, demonstrating the durability and eximious stability of the Co2(OH)3Cl when utilized as the supercapacitor electrode material.
