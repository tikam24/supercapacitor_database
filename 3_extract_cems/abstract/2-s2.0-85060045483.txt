In this work, a novel Cu-MOF of translational 2D (4,4) layers has been designed and afforded as hierarchically stacking lamellae with interspace. Cu-MOF is initially employed as precursors to prepare the Cu@C composite through calcination-thermolysis procedure. Then Cu@C is etched with HCl, and subsequently activated by KOH to obtain APC with nanosheet morphology, which shows ultrahigh BET specific surface area (2491 m 2 g −1 ) and pore volume of 1.50 cm 3 g −1 (V mirco = 0.12 cm 3 g −1 , V meso+macro = 1.38 cm 3 g −1 ). Significantly, the APC nanosheet owns outstanding specific capacitance of 260.5 F g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 under a load of 8 mg/cm 2 . SSC based on APC achieves excellent specific energy density of 18.38 W h Kg −1 at specific power density of 350 W kg −1 . Our SSC still retains 91.1% of original capacitance after 5000 cycles, exhibiting remarkable long-term cycle and reversibility. Amazingly, a red LED can be lighted up by three SSCs over 12 min. Therefore, the APC nanosheet is a competitive and promising candidate for preparing supercapacitor cells.
