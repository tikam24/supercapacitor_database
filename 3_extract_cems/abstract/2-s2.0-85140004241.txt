Biomass-based activated carbon has great potential in the use of its versatile 3D porous structures as an excellent electrode material in presenting high conductivity, large porosity, and outstanding stability for electrochemical energy storage devices. In this study, the electrode material develops through a novel consolidated carbon disc binder-free design, which was derived from Moringa oleifera leaves (MOLs) for electrochemical double-layer capacitor applications. The carbon discs are prepared in a series of treatments of precarbonized, chemical impregnation of zinc chloride, integrated pyrolysis of N2 carbonization, and CO2 physical activation. The physical activation temperatures applied at 650, 750, and 850 °C optimize the precursor potential. By optimizing the 3D hierarchical pore properties of the MOL750, the carbon disc binder-free design demonstrates optimal symmetric supercapacitor performance with a high specific capacitance of 307 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 in an aqueous electrolyte solution of 1 M H2SO4. Furthermore, the extremely low internal resistance (0.006ω) of the carbon disc initiated excellent electrical conductivity. The supercapacitors also maintain their high capacitive properties in aqueous electrolyte solutions of 6 M KOH and 1 M Na2SO4, respectively. The results show that a novel consolidated carbon disc binder-free design can be obtained from biomass MOLs through a reasonable approach to develop superior electrode materials to enhance high-performance electrochemical energy storage devices.
