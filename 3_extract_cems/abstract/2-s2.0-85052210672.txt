In this paper, fabrication of vague manganese oxide and MnO2/Carbon Vulcan nanocomposite by utilizing chemical co-precipitation technique is been reported. The electrical and electrochemical characteristics of these nanomaterials are investigated following distinct pathways involving Cyclic Voltammetry, EIS, GCD and I-V tests. This investigation is preceded by evaluation of certain parameters such as specific capacitance, energy density and power density. Depending upon this evaluation, a comparative study between both the nanomaterials is been explored to designate the supreme auspicious material favorable for energy conservation application in supercapacitors.
