Supercapacitors play an important role in a future clean-energy landscape to meet the challenges of existing energy-storage/delivery systems. They suffer from low energy density and are mainly used for the storage/delivery of electrical energy in high power demands. However, improvement of their energy density is vital to develop energy storage systems that can respond to the energy demands of emerging technologies requiring a wider energy/power spectrum. In this article, a symmetrical capacitor is developed from a composite consisting of synthesized activated carbon and cobalt oxide to improve the energy storage performance of the supercapacitor. Uniform distribution and immobilization of cobalt nanoparticles within the composite is achieved by embedding cobalt acetate into the initial resorcinol formaldehyde polymeric aerogels, followed by the pyrolysis of the gel in Ar atmosphere and activation of the carbon in CO2 atmosphere at 800 °C. The activated carbon/cobalt composite is used as the electroactive material in electrode formulation. The electrochemical characteristics of the synthesized electrode materials demonstrates an optimized specific capacitance of 235 F g−1 at a sweep rate of 10 mV s−1 in a three-electrode system. The symmetrical capacitor has a capacitance of 66 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, a very high rate of performance in 10,000 cycle tests, and a rate capability of 24% at 30 A g−1. The capacitor shows a power density of up to 15 Wh k g−1. The presence of cobalt spices makes it possible to optimize the capacitance of a symmetrical capacitor, while the capacitance of a symmetrical activated carbon capacitor cannot be optimized.
