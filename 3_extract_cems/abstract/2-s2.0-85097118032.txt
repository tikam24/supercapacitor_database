Lithium ion hybrid capacitors are electrochemical energy storage devices combining the advantages of both Li-ion battery and electrochemical capacitor. They can be extensively used in many fields. However, the commercialization of lithium ion hybrid capacitor has been encountered several problems, e.g., the device structure design, the screening of materials, the pre-lithia-tion process, and the interface between electrolyte and electrode, etc. This review summarizes the recent research advances in lithium ion hybrid capacitor with high energy density, including the selection of the active materials in cathode/anode and the separator, the pre-lithiation method using the three-electrode structure, the high- and low-temperature performances, the capacity fading be haviors, the charge storage mechanisms and the device fabrication of lithium ion hybrid capacitor (including lithium ion capacitor and lithium battery-type supercapacitor). Finally, the perspectives and future developments of lithium ion hybrid capacitor are highlighted.
