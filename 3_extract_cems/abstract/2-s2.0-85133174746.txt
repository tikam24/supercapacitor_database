This manuscript describes the CdxCo1−xFe2O4 nanoparticles that have synthesized using a chemical co-precipitation technique. The preparation of as-synthesized products was annealed at 600, 700, and 800 °C for 3 h. The structural, electrical, and electrochemical properties of the CdxCo1−xFe2O4 nanoparticles were also discussed. The TG–DTA analysis of the as-prepared Cd0.3Co0.7Fe2O4 NPs sample is examined. XRD studies reveal the cubical spinel shape of the CdxCo1−xFe2O4 nanoparticles. The functional group assignment of FTIR results shows the two absorption bands observed at 585 and 434 cm−1, which are connected with the vibration of stretching mode in the tetrahedral and octahedral sites. The surface morphology of NPs Cd0.3Co0.7Fe2O4 has been studied by FESEM and HRTEM, which specify that the nanoparticles were found in a crystalline and spherical structure. The EDAX analysis confirms the elementary composition, namely the presence of Cd, Co, Fe, and O. The electrical measurements were confirmed by dielectric constant (ε′), dielectric loss (tan δ), and AC conductivity with frequency in the range 50 Hz to 5 MHz and revealed that the dielectric constant and dielectric loss decrease with the increase of frequency, representing a decrease in polarization. The higher Ac conductivity value of 5.5 × 10–4 Sm−1 was observed for Cd0.3Co0.7Fe2O4 nanoparticles indicating the semi-conductive nature of the prepared samples. The CV analysis for the sample Cd0.3Co0.7Fe2O4 (x = 0.3) annealed at 600 °C reveals the highest Cs value of 395 Fg−1 was observed in the scan rate of 2 mVs−1 and concluded that it was suitable for supercapacitor application.
