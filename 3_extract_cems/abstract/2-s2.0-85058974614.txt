This study proposes a facile solvothermal synthesis of nickel tungstate (NiWO 4 ) nanowires for application as a novel cathode material for supercapacitors. The structure, morphology, surface area and pore distribution were characterized and their capacitive performances were investigated. The results showed that the NiWO 4 nanowires synthesized in ethylene glycol solvent could offer a high specific capacitance of 1190 F g -1 at a current density of 0.5 A g -1 and a capacitance retaining ratio of 61.5% within 0.5-10 A g -1 . When used as a cathodic electrode of an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC), the NiWO 4 nanowire based device can be cycled reversibly in a high-voltage region of 0-1.7 V with a high specific capacitance of 160 F g -1 at 0.5 A g -1 , which therefore contributed to an energy density of 64.2 W h kg -1 at a power density of 425 W kg -1 . Moreover, 92.8% of its initial specific capacitance can be maintained after 5000 consecutive cycles (5 A g -1 ). These excellent capacitive properties make NiWO 4 a credible electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.
