The diversity of nanostructures obtained from organic polymerization is limited when compared to the huge amount of documented inorganic nanostructures. In this paper, we elucidate a synergistic mechanism between in situ inorganic salt hydrolysis and vapor-phase polymerization for the metal oxide-poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) hybrid nanostructure growth. The steady state polymer growth and kinetically controlled hydrolysis enables homogeneous deposition of high-aspect-ratio crystal phases such as Î²-FeOOH, TeO2, and SnO2 coated by a conducting polymer. By controlling the hydrolysis kinetics, the hybrid material is synthesized in one step with morphologies controlled from 1D nanofibers to 2D nanoflowers and nanostructures from monolithic to core-shell. This fundamental understanding of the connection between hydrolysis and polymerization allows the future development of nanostructured inorganic, polymeric, and inorganic-organic hybrid materials. Enabled by this study, electrodes for energy storage are fabricated with different PEDOT morphologies, and their structure-property relationships are discussed. The 1D fibrillar structure shows a higher capacitance of 185 F/g at 25 mV/s compared to 2D nanoflowers because this morphology enhances electrolyte diffusion kinetics that facilitate PEDOT doping and dedoping, leading to a lower internal resistance.
