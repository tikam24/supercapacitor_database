2D conductive metal–organic frameworks (2D c-MOFs) naturally possess high active sites, large specific surface areas, and fast ion transport for energy-storage devices. However, the intelligent exploration of 2D c-MOFs for the emerging flexible transparent supercapacitors (FTSCs) with excellent photoelectric property and electrochemical activity is rarely implemented. Herein, 2D conductive ultrathin Cu3(HHTP)2 (HHTP = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene) film is synthesized on the indium tin oxide/polyethylene terephthalate (ITO/PET) substrate for flexible transparent conductive electrodes (FTCEs) through the layer-by-layer assembly method. The interconnected conductive frameworks possess the cooperative superiority of low internal resistance, fast electrolyte ion diffusion, and quick electron transfer. Cu3(HHTP)2-15/ITO/PET FTCEs show high photoelectric property of T550 nm = 82.2% and Rs = 49.1 Ω sq−1, and high areal capacitance (CA) of 1700 µF cm−2. The corresponding symmetrical FTSCs (T550 nm = 62.1%) exhibit excellent CA of 939.2 µF cm−2 at the current density of 7 µA cm−2, superior rate capability (63.9% at 150 µA cm−2), long-term cycling stability (85% after 3000 cycles), and mechanical flexibility under different bending angles. This work provides key insights into the design and synthesis of 2D c-MOF films for flexible transparent energy-storage devices.
