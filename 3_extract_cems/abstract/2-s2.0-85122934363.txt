Graphene oxide was universally acknowledged to be a very important precursor to prepare graphene or the relative derivatives, but it was criticized sharply due to its quite inferior electrical properties and many structural defects arising out of strong oxidation process. Non-oxidation synthetic strategy of graphene oxide was expected a good solution to mitigate the disadvantages. Inspired by this concept, we attained a totally new, well-defined graphene oxide, that is, G(C4)–OH, in which hydroxyl was the unique oxygen-containing group and the hexagonal honeycomb carbon lattice was less-defective, by successfully challenging the hydrolysis of ultra-inert, commercially-available graphite fluoride feedstock. An advantaged structure made G(C4)–OH greatly outperforming traditional graphene oxide both in fundamental electrical properties, such as conductivity, carrier mobility, and in electrochemical performances when applied in supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries. As convenient as traditional graphene oxide, G(C4)–OH was pretty reactive to versatile electrophiles and allowed tremendous post-functionalization opportunities to customize graphene functions and orientate its applications.
