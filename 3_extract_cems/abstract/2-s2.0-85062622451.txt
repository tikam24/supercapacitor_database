Herein, we report the rational design and fabrication of multicomponent, hierarchical CuCo2O4 nanowire arrays wrapped with metal oxides (NiO, Co3O4 and MnO2) nanosheets for use in high-performance supercapacitors. Among all the composite electrodes prepared, the CuCo2O4@NiO electrode exhibits the best electrochemical behavior with a high areal capacitance of 2.3 F/cm2 at 2 mA/cm2 and excellent cycling stability. The asymmetric supercapacitor with CuCo2O4@NiO as the positive electrode shows a superior specific capacitance of 124.6 F/g at 1 A/g, exceptional energy density of 38.9 Wh/kg at 750 W/kg, and long cycle life with âˆ¼81.3% capacitance retention after 6000 cycles. The results indicate that the CuCo2O4@NiO electrode shows great potential for high-performance electrochemical energy storage.
