Due to its notable mechanical and electrical properties, graphene has high-value-added applications in future flexible electronics. The preparation of ultrathin uniform graphene oxide (GO) multilayer film through simple and cost-effective technique still is concern. Herein, we have demonstrated the electrospray deposition (ESD) method to prepare the uniform alternative GO multilayer film with controlled thickness by alternatively depositing the different surface charge. It is a solution-processed technique that can be applied in a variety of practical applications due to low-cost and high-speed processing time. Colloidal nanoparticles, which is deposited through ESD technique, have different physical and optical properties based on surface charge. Owing to the electrostatic repulsion between the functional groups, GO can be well soluble, homogeneous and stable dispersion. The prepared alternated rGO films enhanced the sheet resistance because of improving electrical conductivity. Furthermore, alternated rGO film is utilized in the symmetric supercapacitor and the device exhibit a larger capacitance of 103.5 F/g at 0.5 A/g and good cycling stability (94%) on the account of high conductivity than that of other prepared rGO based films. These attributes of ultra-thin rGO film underscore the potential of the current method towards the understanding of film-based supercapacitors in a numerous energy storage applications.
