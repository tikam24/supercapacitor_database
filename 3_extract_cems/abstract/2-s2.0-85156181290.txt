The global impact of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) is exponentially rising as it is an emission-free and reliable alternative to fossil fuel-based vehicles that cause enormous negative impacts on the socioeconomic and environmental sectors. Fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles (FCHEV) have been widely considered in the latest research as an energy-efficient, environmentally friendly, and longer-range green transportation alternative. The performance of these FCHEVs, however, is primarily dependent upon the optimal selection of Energy Management Strategies (EMSs) adopted for optimum power split and energy resource management. This research reviews the latest EMS techniques presented in the literature and highlights their working principle, operation, and impact on the FCHEV performance and reliability. This research also highlights the challenges associated with the globalization of FCHEVs and recommends future work and research directions essential for optimal FCHEV performance and commercialization.
