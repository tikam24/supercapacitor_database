SnO2/C microspheres were prepared by a facile hydrothermal method with SnCl4·5H2O and soluble starch as the precursors of SnO2 and carbon material. Porous SnO2/C microspheres were then obtained by subsequent ZnCl2 activation. Both SnO2/C microspheres and porous SnO2/C microspheres were mainly in spherical shape with particle size of 1-5 μm and SnO2 nanoparticles were homogeneously distributed in carbon microspheres. The electrode based on porous SnO2/C microspheres showed higher specific capacitance, lower equivalent series resistance and better rate capability than the electrode based on porous carbon microspheres prepared via the same method, indicating a promising application prospect of porous SnO2/C microspheres in supercapacitors in the future.
