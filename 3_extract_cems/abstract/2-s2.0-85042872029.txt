This work aims to solve the difficulty of V2O5 nanomaterials to exhibit both high specific capacitance and long cycling life as supercapacitor electrodes. Novel 3D V2O5 nanocorals with continuous size-gradient mesopore channels have been constructed by clustering and focusing of V2O5 nanobelt bundles. The 3D V2O5 nanocorals exhibit a specific capacitance as high as 414 F/g at 0.3 A/g. Even after 3000 cycles, the 3D V2O5 nanocorals maintain 70% of initial specific capacitance, which surpasses the cycling lifes of common V2O5 materials. Construction of continuous size-gradient mesopore channels is proven to be effective strategy to simultaneously enhance the specific capacitance and cycling life of V2O5 materials. This work has provided new insights into the design and preparation of soluble transition-metal based nanomaterials for high performance supercapacitors.
