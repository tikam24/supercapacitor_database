Energy storage plays crucial role to complete global and economical requirements of human beings. Supercapacitor act as promising candidate for energy storage applications due to its astonishing properties like - high power density, remarkable crystallinity, large porosity, elongated life-cycle, exceptional chemical & thermal stability, framework diversity and high specific surface area. The current review article embraces the history along with the difference of supercapacitors with fuel cells, capacitors, and batteries and detailed explanation of fabrication of supercapacitors i.e. proper selection of electrode and electrolyte material, separator and current collector. As a supercapacitor electrode material, several carbon-based materials, metal-oxides, and metalâ€“organic frameworks have been briefly mentioned here. The current review article also discusses the supercapacitor components and various types of electrolytes. Electrochemical characterization techniques such as Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Galvanostatic Charge Discharge (GCD) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) are also briefly discussed here. Furthermore, this article outlines the current issues as well as potential solutions for upcoming time period.
