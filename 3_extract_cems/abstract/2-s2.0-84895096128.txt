The proceedings contain 11 papers. The topics discussed include: different techniques for characterizing single-walled carbon nanotube purity; carbon nanotube synthesis with different support materials and catalysts; hydrogen and carbon nanotube production via catalytic decomposition of methane; the effect of fluid mechanics on graphene growths by chemical vapor deposition; supercapacitor electrode based on mixtures of graphene/graphite and carbon nanotubes fabricated using a new dynamic air-brush deposition technique; covalently functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes and graphene composite electrodes for pseudocapacitor application; current transport model of graphene nanoribbon tunnel transistor in variable and constant field; single molecule sensing with carbon nanotube devices; coherent control of photocurrent in molecular nanojunctions with graphene contacts; and simulation of au particle interaction on graphene sheets.
