Electrical field can tailor the lattice structure and morphology of manganese oxides during their synthesis and improve their supercapacities. Manganese oxides as Hausmannite Mn3O4 nanoparticles and/or Bernessite δ-MnO2 nanolayers, were synthesized under electric field by titration of MnSO4·H2O and H2O2 solution into dilute NaOH solution at 90 °C. The sample without electric field has the main phase as Mn3O4 and some of δ-MnO2. When a high electric field is applied, the percentage of δ-MnO2 in the samples increases with the electric field rapidly. A pure δ-MnO2 sample is obtained when an applied electric field above 0.6 kV·cm−1. The supercapacity is improved in the samples synthesized with high electric field, in which the main phase is the δ-MnO2. However, the deterioration of the properties is observed in the pure δ-MnO2 sample. Therefore, synthesis under the electric field can tailor the crystalline structure of manganese oxides to improve the supercapacity respectively.
