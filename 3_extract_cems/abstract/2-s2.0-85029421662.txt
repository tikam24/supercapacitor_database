We report a printable and high performance energy storage device comprising MnO2-based electrodes and ionogel electrolyte. The MnO2 based electrodes could be prepared on various substrates by inkjet printing process without any binder. As a result, continuous and semi-transparent MnO2 thin films were obtained on the commercially available fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass and served as the electrode for symmetric supercapacitor. The as-prepared device exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 86 F•g-1 at 0.1 F•g-1, leading to a superior energy density of 38.75 Wh•kg-1. All the merits make the MnO2based energy storage devices a promising candidate for large-scale production of printable and high performance electronics in the near future.
