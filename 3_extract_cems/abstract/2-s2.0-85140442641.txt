Electrode materials determine the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors and are strongly affected by their morphologies. In this paper, NiCo2Se4 with three different morphologies, such as solid nanoneedle array, hollow nanoneedle array, and nanotube array structure have been in situ grown on carbon cloth by a facile two-step hydrothermal method. The microstructures and electrochemical performance of synthesized integrated electrode material (CC@NiCo2Se4) with different morphologies were studied. It was revealed that the volume of solvent during the selenization process had a significant effect on the morphologies and loading capacity of NiCo2Se4, and the hollow nanoneedle array structure electrode (CC@hn-NiCo2Se4) exhibited the highest specific capacitance of 1687.08 F·g−1 at 2 A·g−1, and 70.64% retention even though the current density was increased to 20 A·g−1. Furthermore, the CC@hn-NiCo2Se4//CC@AC asymmetric supercapacitor exhibited an energy density of 30.71 Wh·kg−1 at 800 W·kg−1. All results highlight that NiCo2Se4 with a hollow nanoneedle array structure will be a promising electrode material for practical supercapacitor applications.
