In the present study, super-capacitive behavior of spinel Zn-Co oxides (with different Zn +2 /Co +2 mol ratio) has been thoroughly investigated. The spinel of transition metal oxides with different morphologies has been synthesized with hydrothermal method on Ni foam as substrate layer. The specific capacitance of the Zn-Co oxide electrode prepared at 180 °C for 5 h with different Zn +2 /Co +2 mol ratios of 1:0, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 0:1 were investigated and measured 405, 842, 726, 1237, 705 F g −1 , respectively at 50 mV s −1 scan rate. Zn-Co oxide with Zn +2 /Co +2 mol ratio of 1:2 was also synthesized at two different temperatures of 120 and 150 °C for 5 h with the specific capacitance of 1147, 917 F g −1 at 50 mV s −1 scan rate, respectively. Among the obtained data, the sample with Zn +2 /Co +2 mol ratio of 1:2 prepared at 180 °C for 5 h possessed highest specific capacitance. The cyclic life of this electrode showed 92% capacitance retention after 1000 cycle of charge-discharge. All results revealed that Zn-Co oxides had excellent supercapacitive properties due to multiple oxidation states and fast ion/electron transfer at the surface of electrode which could be offered as suitable devices for energy storage applications.
