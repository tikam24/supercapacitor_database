Energy storage is a persistent problem in general and electrical energy storage in particular. Supercapacitor is emerging technology in the field of electrical energy storage and its use along with battery or fuel cell is viewed as a solution in many portable systems. Supercapacitor is a new pulse power source and it shave off the pulse power demand. The energy density, power density of supercapacitor is determined by may parameters of electrode and electrolyte. For most applications, it is important to reduce weight and cost of supercapacitors. In this paper, we have developed low cost aqueous metal oxide based supercapacitor through material characterization. Modeling approach is used to characterize the material and complete supercapacitor as a device. Statistical modeling is used to find most significant parameters of this device. Life cycle and temperature tests were performed to study the possibility of developing battery-supercapacitor hybrid power source. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
