Current collectors play a very crucial role in the performance of an energy storage device. Regarding supercapacitors, material design, processing, and current collectors' surface properties can result in substantial variation in energy density, power output, cyclic chargeâ€“discharge behavior, and other key performance parameters. Most of the reviews in supercapacitor materials and devices focus on the synthesis, characterization, and electrochemical properties of electrode materials. In the present report, the recent advances in supercapacitor electrodes in conjunction with current collector materials and design are summarized in light of various supercapacitor devices categorized concerning their applications and working mechanisms. It includes the literature documented on multifarious supercapacitors, that is, flow supercapacitors, alternating current line filtering supercapacitors, redox electrolyte-enhanced supercapacitor, metal ion hybrid supercapacitors, microsupercapacitors, electrochromic supercapacitors, and self-healing supercapacitors. To the best of authors' knowledge, this is a new and recent summarized report on the development of current collector materials based on intended applications and the working principles of supercapacitors.
