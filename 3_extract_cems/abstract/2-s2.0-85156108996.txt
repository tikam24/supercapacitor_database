β-Ni(OH)2 and β-Ni(OH)2/graphene oxide (GO) were prepared on an Ni foil electrode using the electrochemical cyclic voltammetry formed in 0.5 M KOH solution. Several surface analyses such as XPS, XRD, and Raman spectroscopies were used to confirm the chemical structure of the prepared materials. The morphologies were determined using SEM and AFM. The addition of the graphene oxide layer showed a remarkable increase in the specific capacitance of the hybrid. Through the measurements, the specific capacitance values were 280 F g−1 and 110 F g−1 after and before adding 4 layers of GO, respectively. The supercapacitor displays high stability until 500 cycles are charged and discharged almost without a loss in its capacitance values.
