In this article we concentrate on the integration of genetically tuned Supercapacitor Energy Storage System (SCESS) with a two area power system. The role of governor dead band as well as generation rate constraint in case of a practical power system is considered. Each area of power system is interconnected to the SCESS Unit. A control model of SCESS is also connected to it and its voltage loop is used as a feedback to the power system via the SCESS. Simulation studies carried out in MATLAB SIMULINK environment reflect significant improvement in frequency response and tie-power deviation of the system. The SCESS voltage and power response is also depicted.
