Lithium-ion supercapacitors (LISCs) have attracted increasing attention for its competitive energy and power capabilities compared with electric double layer capacitors and lithium-ion batteries. The working voltage of LISCs is the potential difference between the cathode and the anode and is oftentimes determined by the lower potential limit of the anode. Up to date, only carbon and MXene anodes can allow charge/discharge at low potentials. Here, we report electrochemically tuned layered polyaniline with solidified SEI nanochannels that promises as new type low potential anode for high voltage pseudocapacitive intercalation LISCs (PI-LISCs). We found that the tuned layered polyaniline attained high volumetric capacity of 196 mAh cm−3 at 25 mA g−1 at potentials as low as 0.01 V vs. Li/Li+, while allows the fabrication of a high voltage PI-LISC at 4.5 V with a high energy density of 100.5 Wh L−1 at 219.8 W L−1 and a high power density of 13.7 kW L−1 at 27.9 Wh L−1, as well as excellent capacity retention at 90.1 % after 10,000 cycles. Our findings present a significant step forward to open up new opportunities of high energy and high power PI-LISCs.
