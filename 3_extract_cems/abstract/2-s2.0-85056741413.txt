This paper deals with the problem of controlling a hybrid energy storage system consisted of a Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) as the main power source and Supercapacitors (SCs) as the auxiliary power source for electrical applications. The energy control strategy aims at reasonably distributing the load power demand into the two different sources and making sure that each source can be optimally used. The energy controller is devised based on the Passivity-Based Control (PBC) method with the Interconnection and Damping Assignment (IDA) technique. Moreover, a complementary PI controller is designed to enhance the robustness of the closed-loop system under system model uncertainties. Simulation results show that the proposed control strategy could help the hybrid system fast response to electrical load demand with strong robustness.
