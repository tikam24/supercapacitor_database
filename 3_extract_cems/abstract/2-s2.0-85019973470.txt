We have synthesized a ternary rGO/Fe3O4/PANI (rGFP) composite for binder-free, semiflexible, thin, all-solid-state supercapacitor device fabrication. A scalable soft-template technique has been adopted for the preparation of three-dimensional Fe3O4-decorated reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-doped polyaniline (PANI) nanorods that are unambiguously investigated under electron microscopes (FESEM and HRTEM). The presence of PANI in the nanocomposite is overwhelmingly supported by the absorption and vibration studies. Raman spectra convincingly show the presence of rGO in the nanocomposites, and the formation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles is confirmed by XRD and XPS results. The specific capacitance value that has been achieved for synthesized ternary rGFP nanocomposite is âˆ¼283.4 F/g at 1.0 A/g current density and exhibited a maximum energy density of 47.7 W h/kg at a power density of 550 W/kg. Interestingly, after 5000 cycles the composite shows excellent life stability that is a 78% retention of the electrochemical property. To demonstrate the portable energy storage applicability, a binder-free rGFP-based supercapacitor device was fabricated, which illustrated the operation of an LED bulb for 30 min when fully charged. These results indicate that synthesized ternary nanocomposites are worth their potential as an electrode material and would be used in next-generation high-rate energy storage systems.
