The mesoporous TiN powder was prepared by non-hydrolyzed sol-gel method combined with ammonia gas reduction nitrification method using ethanol as oxygen donor, titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) as titanium source and P123 as pore-forming agent, and then was used an electrode material to prepare button capacitor. The effects of reduction nitride temperature on the phase, pore structure and electrochemical performance of mesoporous TiN powder were test by XRD, SEM, BET, XPS, CV, GDC and EIS. The results show that as the reduction nitrification temperature increases, TiO2 in the powder is reduced to TiO and then turns into TiN, and Ti-O bond is gradually replaced by Ti-N bond. In addition, the phase purity and particle size increase, and the pore diameter of the mesoporous first increases and then decreases. When the reduction nitrification temperature is 800℃, the specific surface area of the powder is 41 m2/g, the pore structure is developed, and the average pore diameter is 24 nm, which is conducive to ion transfer and electrochemical performance improvement. At this point, the internal impedance is 0.9 Ω. As the current density is 20 mA/g, the specific capacitance is 130 F/g. It is worth mentioning that it also can keep nearly 90% of the initial specific capacitance after 1000 cycles under the current density of 50 mA/g.
