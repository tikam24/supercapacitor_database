One of the most promising topics in the study of advanced energy applications is the creation of extraordinarily effective electrodes substances for higher-power devices. Scientific community has recently become interested in MXene because of its exceptional electrochemical characteristics, especially in comparison with two-dimensional (layered materials) like graphene/MY (M = Metal and Y[dbnd]S, O, Se, N, P etc). Layer restacking of MXene, however, reduces its supercapacitive performance as an electrode material because of functional group interactions. This work examines MXene and its composites with manganese ferrite MnFe2O4 nanostructure (MnF) for use as a battery-like hybrid supercapacitor in an effort to resolve this problem. In this work, MnF were used as interlayer spacers between layers of MXene nanosheet. When compared to either MnF or MXene alone, the electrochemical investigations demonstrate that the composite (MnF/MXene) has improved electrochemical characteristics. For MnF, MXene, and MnF/MXene composites, maximum (specific capacitance, Cs) around 1A g−1 was calculated to be around of 594, 1046.25, and 1268.75 F g−1, respectively. The MnF/MXene composites exhibited the high surface area of 975.3 cm2 resultant decreased the lesser charge transfer resistance (Rct) around 0.25 Ω, and shows a stable behavior for 50 h over 5000 cycles. In this study, 2D MXene was found to be the most effective capacitive electrode, outperforming carbon-based electrodes in an asymmetric assembly. As a result, the hierarchical MnF structure produced on different substrates in conjunction with MXene is a promising material for storage of energy.
