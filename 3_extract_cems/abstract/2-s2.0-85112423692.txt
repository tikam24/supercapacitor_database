This main objective of this project is to control the hybrid energy storage system in order to increase the lifetime and performance of an electric vehicle battery source. This can be achieved by utilizing the powerful super capacitors in order to satisfy the peak power demand in an electric vehicle. When there is sudden raise in acceleration the peak power demand raises and hence the battery life gets reduced when there is sudden peak in discharge. In order to overcome this drawback, the super capacitor based auxiliary energy storage system comes into the role. We have used ARDUINO as a brain of this operation and it smartly identifies the excess power demand, cruise and normal mode of acceleration and rapidly switches between the battery storage and super capacitor storage accordingly in order to increase battery life time.
