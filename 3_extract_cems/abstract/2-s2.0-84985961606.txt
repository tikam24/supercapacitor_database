The following paperwork presents results from examination of a resonant converter with voltage limitation over the commutating capacitor. The converter is used for charging of energy storage elements - supercapacitors or batteries. Computer simulations are carried out by the means of LTspice. The results from the computer simulations are verified with experimental studies. The experimental studies are carried out on an experimental stand. Main advantage of the proposed circuit is the limitation of the charging current in operation modes close to short circuit. This is achieved according to the circuit features.
