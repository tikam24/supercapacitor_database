A highly efficient 1-D flexible supercapacitor with a stainless steel mesh (SSM) substrate is demonstrated. Indium tin oxide (ITO) nanowires are prepared on the surface of the stainless steel fiber (SSF), and MnO2 shell layers are coated onto the ITO/SSM electrode by means of electrodeposition. The ITO NWs, which grow radially on the SSF, are single-crystalline and conductive enough for use as a current collector for MnO2-based supercapacitors. A flake-shaped, nanoporous, and uniform MnO2 shell layer with a thickness of ∼130 nm and an average crystallite size of ∼2 nm is obtained by electrodeposition at a constant voltage. The effect of the electrode geometry on the supercapacitor properties was investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and a galvanostatic charge/discharge study. The electrodes with ITO NWs exhibit higher specific capacitance levels and good rate capability owing to the superior electronic/ionic transport capabilities resulting from the open pore structure. Moreover, the use of a porous mesh substrate (SSM) increases the specific capacitance to 667 F g-1 at 5 mV s-1. In addition, the electrode with ITO NWs and the SSM shows very stable cycle performance (no decrease in the specific capacitance after 5000 cycles). © 2013 American Chemical Society.
