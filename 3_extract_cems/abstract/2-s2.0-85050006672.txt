This work provides a micro-grid, which consists of Photovoltaic (PV) array, a micro-turbine (MT) set and a supercapacitor (SC) module to support the grid and/or grid integrated domestic load. Each subsystem (e.g., PV, MT, and SC) is controlled through non-isolated conventional controllers whereas the overall system operation and power flow priorities are performed via power control and management system. According to proposed system operation, PV has the priority to meet the demand. MT is synchronized as a secondary system to support continuous power flow for 24 hours. The SC module is utilized as an energy storage device during excess power and/or backup during demand. A complete Simulink test-bed is designed and checked under real load and weather conditions for at Islamabad, Pakistan. MATLAB Simulations conclude the effectiveness of the proposed system in terms of feasibility, load tracking and continuity.
