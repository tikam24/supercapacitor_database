Polyaniline doped with hydrochloric acid was synthesized by chemical polymerization, then de-doped and immersed in acetone solutions containing ZnCl2 and FeCl3, respectively. Polyaniline doped with ZnCl2 (PZn) and polyaniline doped with FeCl3 (PFe) were prepared. The physic-chemical properties of polyaniline were characterized by DC conductivity measurement, SEM and FT-IR. Using 1mol/L H2SO4 as electrolyte, the two-electrode supercapacitors were assembled. Compared with PFe, PZn has higher d. c. conductivity of 1.16Ã—10-2 S/cm. PZn supercapacitors show a larger capacitance than PFe supercapacitors, a specific capacitance of 340F/g obtained. PZn supercapacitors exhibit lower inter resistance and longer cyclic life. All results suggest that PZn is a prospect material for supercapacitor.
