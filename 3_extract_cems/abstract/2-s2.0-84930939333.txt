Functionalized TiO2 nanotube arrays with decoration of MnO2 nanoparticles (denoted as H–TiO2/C/MnO2) have been synthesized in the application of electrochemical capacitors. To improve both areal and gravimetric capacitance, hydrogen treatment and carbon coating process were conducted on TiO2 nanotube arrays. By scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, it is confirmed that the nanostructure is formed by the uniform incorporation of MnO2 nanoparticles growing round the surface of the TiO2 nanotube arrays. Impedance analysis proves that the enhanced capacitive is due to the decrease of charge transfer resistance and diffusion resistance. Electrochemical measurements performed on this H–TiO2/C/MnO2 nanocomposite when used as an electrode material for an electrochemical pseudocapacitor presents quasi-rectangular shaped cyclic voltammetry curves up to 100 mV/s, with a large specific capacitance (SC) of 299.8 F g−1 at the current density of 0.5 A g−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. More importantly, the electrode also exhibits long-term cycling stability, only ~13 % of SC loss after 2000 continuous charge–discharge cycles. Based on the concept of integrating active materials on highly ordered nanostructure framework, this method can be widely applied to the synthesis of high-performance electrode materials for energy storage.
