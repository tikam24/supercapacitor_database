This work briefly introduces some of the available forms of energy storage, which are classified into mechanical, electro-chemical, electrical and thermal. This aids to inform the rationale to pair complementary energy forms for creation of hybridized energy storage systems for generating power sources. This research aims therefore to mitigate the variability of renewable energy (RE) by supplementing it with hybrid energy storages of lead acid batteries (PbA) and Supercapacitors (SC) banks integrated in a solar PV grid. The various topologies suited for connecting network bus are presented in this work. The benefits network bus are presented in this work. The benefits also given by way of comparative analysis of the combined PbA and SC over the single PbA or SC only.
