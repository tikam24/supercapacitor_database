Nanostructured α-MnO 2 thin films with different morphologies are grown on the platinum substrates by a facile solution method without any assistance of template or surfactant. Microstructural characterization reveals that morphology evolution from dandelion-like spheres to nanoflakes of the as-grown MnO 2 is controlled by synthesis temperature. The capacitive behavior of the MnO 2 thin films with different morphologies are studied by cyclic voltammetry. The α-MnO 2 thin films composed of dandelion-like spheres exhibit high specific capacitance, good rate capability, and excellent long-term cycling stability. © to the authors 2009.
