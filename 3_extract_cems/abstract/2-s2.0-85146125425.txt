Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely adopted in various fields (catalysis, sensor, energy storage, etc.) during the last decade owing to the trait of abundant surface chemistry, porous structure, easy-to-adjust pore size and diverse functional groups. However, the limited active sites and the poor conductivity hinder the relative practical application. Two-dimensional (2D) MOFs can shorten the ion transport path with the merit of layered structure. The large surface area can increase the number of active sites as well as effectively utilize the sufficient active sites, exhibiting enormous potential in the field of energy storage systems (EESs). In this review, the characteristics of the 2D MOFs have been introduced, and the systematic synthesis methods (top-down and bottom-up) of 2D MOFs are presented, providing fundamental understanding for the construction of 2D MOFs. Moreover, the applications of 2D MOFs in energy storage fields such as supercapacitors and batteries are demonstrated in detail. Finally, the future development prospects have been proposed, offering guidelines for the rational utilization of 2D MOFs and promoting the understanding of 2D MOFs in EESs.
