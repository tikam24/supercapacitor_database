Solid-state supercapacitors based on galvanostatic pulse polymerized Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) electrodes and ionic liquid gel polymer electrolyte were fabricated and characterized. For comparative studies, PEDOT electrodes were also deposited by potentiostatic method. The SEM study shows that the pulse polymerized films are highly porous whereas potentiostatic polymerized PEDOT film shows compact globular clusters like morphology. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies confirm that in the pulse polymerized PEDOT films polymer chains are fully conjugated with the dopant ClO4- ions. The performance characteristics of solid state supercapacitor cells based on impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and galvanostatic chargedischarge technique are presented. The optimum capacitance value of 85 F g-1 of PEDOT, which correspond to the specific energy of ~4.25 Wh kg-1 and specific power of ~5.0 kW kg-1 have been achieved. The solid state supercapacitor shows almost stable cyclic performance, after initial fading in capacitance, for 10000 charge-discharge cycles. Â© 2012 The Electrochemical Society.
