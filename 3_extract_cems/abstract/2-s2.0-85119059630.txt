Polyaniline, as a kind of conductive polymer with commercial application prospects, is still under researches in its synthesis and applications. In this work, polyaniline was fabricated on flexible substrates including carbon cloths and polyethylene naphthalate by in situ electropolymerization method. The synthesized flexible electrodes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, High resolution transmission electron microscope, atomic force microscope, Fourier transform infrared, x-ray diffraction, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Owing to the conductivity and the reversible redox property, the polyaniline/carbon cloth electrodes show excellent properties such as decent supercapacitor performance and good detection capability toward ascorbic acid. As supercapacitors, the electrodes exhibit a specific capacitance as high as 776 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 and a long cycle life of 20 000 times in the three-electrode system. As ascorbic acid sensors, the flexible electrodes demonstrate stable response to ascorbic acid in the range of 1-3000 µM with an outstanding sensitivity (4228 µA mM-1 cm-2), low detection limit (1 µM), and a fast response time. This work holds promise for high-performance and low-cost flexible electrodes for both supercapacitors and non-enzymatic ascorbic acid sensors, and may inspire inventions of self-powered electrochemical sensor.
