Supercapacitors constitute an important class of energy storage devices. They generally employ activated carbons as electrode materials. It has been found that carbon nanotubes and graphene, and related materials are good materials for use in supercapacitors. In this chapter, we discuss the results obtained with supercapacitors employing graphene, nitrogen- and boron-doped graphenes, and graphene polymer composites.
