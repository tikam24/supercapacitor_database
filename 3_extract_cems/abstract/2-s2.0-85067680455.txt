In recent years energy storage devices are the prominent candidates for the upcoming generation of electrochemical applications. ZnCo2O4 nanoparticles have been successfully synthesized by hydrothermal method in the presence of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as a reducing agent. The formation of small cubic structure and well-defined crystalline nanoparticles in the size of 27 nm evaluated by Debye Scherrer method, has been determined from XRD analysis. The cubic structure of the nanoparticles was analyzed through the FE-SEM. The particle size distribution and potential stability of ZnCo2O4 nanoparticles were measured using DLS from zeta potential analysis. The functional group of ZnCo2O4 nanoparticles were confirmed by the Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR). The specific capacitance 434 F g-1 at the scan rate 5 mV s-1 of ZnCo2O4 nanoparticles was measured by cyclic voltammetry measurement. Furthermore, the high specific capacitance of ZnCo2O4 nanoparticles show desirable stability suitable for supercapacitor applications.
