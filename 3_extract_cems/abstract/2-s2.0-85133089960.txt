Due to the increasing demand for energy globally and the reduction of the traditional energy sources, the development of an efficient and sustainable energy source has grabbed the attention of researchers. So, supercapacitor (SC) is a crucial energy storage device that has gained attention in the energy sector. One important part of any SC cell is the electrolyte. The electrolyte plays an important role in the ion migration in the device between electrodes. Hence, polymer electrolytes are fascinating candidates and fulfil the need due to better mechanical properties and ion dynamics. Consequently, the present chapter will start with a brief introduction to supercapacitors, followed by characteristics of electrolyte, types and modification strategies for the electrolyte. Further, the important preparation techniques and advanced characterization techniques are briefed. Finally, some important developments made using the polymer electrolytes for SC cell are presented (publications and patents).
