Exploring newly regulative strategies to design highly efficient electrode materials is of great importance for supercapacitors. Herein, we highlight an interfacial engineering strategy for fabricating NiMn-LDH/V2CTx/NF hybrids with heterogeneous structure via a simple hydrothermal reaction. Detailed analysis confirms that the interfacial effect between NiMn-LDH and V2CTx enables electron transfer from NiMn-LDH to V2CTx in the hybrid material, resulting in improved electrochemical reactivity. As expected, the optimal NiMn-LDH/V2CTx/NF-2 demonstrates much better specific capacity than that of its counterparts. Moreover, this strategy can be extended to NiFe-LDH/V2CTx/NF hybrids, further proving the coupling effect between MXene and LDH is beneficial for the electrochemical performance. This work presents a new pathway to design advanced materials for supercapacitors.
