Positive Poles: A new type of electrochemical capacitor with two different aqueous solutions, separated by a Nafion membrane (see image) is described. High capacitance values as well as excellent energy/power characteristics are reported and discussed. The neutral character of the applied electrolytes makes this capacitor an environmentally friendly, easy to assemble, and cost-effective device for energy storage.
