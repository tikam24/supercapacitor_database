The SnO2â€“RuO2 mixed films are prepared by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. The SnO2 films combined with RuO2 are prepared by varying the deposition cycles of SILAR. The effect of combining SnO2 with RuO2 on structural, morphological and electrochemical properties is studied. It is observed that the crystalline nature of SnO2 changed to amorphous with increase in RuO2 deposition cycles. The morphology is also changed from fibrous-porous to compact after increasing RuO2 deposition cycles. The specific capacitance of SnO2 is increased from 4 to 185 F/g after combined with RuO2. The maximum utilization of RuO2 is observed with specific capacitance of 1010 F/g.
