Herein, pyridine functionalized naphthalenediimide (NDI-Py) and perylenediimide (PDI-Py) derivatives are synthesized and characterized using modern techniques. NDI-Py and PDI-Py in combination with graphite foil (GF) are employed as electrode materials for supercapacitor (SC) applications. Under the three-electrode system, the electrode materials based on NDI-Py/GF and PDI-Py/GF composite electrode exhibit specific capacitance (C sp) of about 118 and 179 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 from cyclic voltammetry (CV) and 132 and 197 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 from galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) curves. The electrochemical performance behaviors of these electrodes are mainly contributed by surface reactions along with the Faradaic redox reactions such as pseudocapacitance. The corresponding two-electrode symmetric SC device based on PDI-Py/GF//PDI-Py/GF exhibits a high energy density of 46 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 3060 W kg−1 at 1 A g−1 current density, which is further retained at 13 Wh kg−1 and 15 300 W kg−1 energy and power density, respectively, at 5 A g−1 current density. Moreover, the symmetrical SC device based on PDI-Py/GF//PDI-Py/GF shows outstanding cyclic stability for 10 000 charge–discharge cycles while maintaining 95% of the original capacitance.
