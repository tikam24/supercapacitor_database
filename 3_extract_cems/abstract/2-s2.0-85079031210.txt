With the advent of enhanced power converter based generation technology in the power utility industry, there is an increasing need for dynamically controllable real and reactive power to maintain stability of electric power systems. Static Synchronous Compensators (STATCOMs) improve the stability of electric power systems by controlling reactive power supply to the system. However, they cannot provide dynamic real power control. In this paper, we discuss a device capable of both dynamic real power control and reactive power control. The device consists of a modular multilevel converter (MMC) based STATCOM combined with a hybrid energy storage system that combines battery energy storage with a supercapacitor energy storage system. Matlab/Simulink is utilized to simulate the stability of the response of an electric transmission system under three-phase fault conditions without compensation, with a STATCOM alone and with the enhanced energy storage. Simulation plots show that the system stability improved significantly when the hybrid energy storage system was combined with the STATCOM for power compensation.
