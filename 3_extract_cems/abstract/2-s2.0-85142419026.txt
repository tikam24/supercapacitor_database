High-entropy alloys (HEAs), comprising five or more metallic elements, are currently attracting in catalysis and energy storage fields owing to their wide range of composition modulation, complex structured surface and excellent electrochemical properties. In addition, continuous breakthroughs in nanotechnology stimulates the development of high-entropy alloy nanoparticles (HEA-NPs) with specific function. So far, HEAs has achieved outstanding results in the field of catalysis and has also gained wider attention in energy storage applications, so a complete review article is needed to capture the research progress in this burgeoning field. This paper reviews the research progress of HEAs in synthesis, mechanical properties, corrosion resistance and high temperature oxidation properties. In addition, the research progress of HEAs in hydrogen energy application, oxygen energy catalysis, carbon conversion and supercapacitors are introduced in detail. Finally, the development prospects and challenges of HEAs in the fields of catalysis and energy storage are prospected.
