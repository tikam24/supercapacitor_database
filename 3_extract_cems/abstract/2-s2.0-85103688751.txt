The Ni(OH)2/three-dimensional reduced graphene oxide (3D-rGO) composites are prepared by adsorbing of Ni(OH)2 on 3D-rGO, which makes full use of the high specific capacitance of Ni(OH)2 material and high specific surface area and excellent conductivity of 3D-rGO. The Ni(OH)2/3D-rGO composites with an adsorption time of 16 h exhibits the highest specific capacitance, reaching 1053.2 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1; after 500 galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) cycles, the capacitance retention rate reaches 92 %, and the coulombic efficiency is up to 96.7 %, indicating that the composite has excellent cyclic stability and reversibility. In the sample with the adsorption time of 16 h, the Ni element is evenly distributed in 3D-rGO materials and its atomic percentage is up to 20.2 %.
