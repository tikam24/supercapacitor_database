We report the effect of ionic liquids on chemically synthesized hierarchical-like copper oxide (CuO) thin films for supercapacitor applications. Concisely, the CuO thin films were deposited via chemical bath deposition (CBD) using 2-dimethylimidazolium chloride [HPDMIM(C1)], 1-(2′,3′-dihydroxypropyl)-3-methylimidazolium chloride [DHPMIM(C1)], and N-(3-methyl-2-oxopropyl)pyridine chloride [MOCPP(C1)] ionic liquid solvents. The effects of the ionic liquid solvents on the morphological evolution of the as-prepared films were analyzed, and electrochemical properties were investigated. The highest specific capacitance was achieved for the electrode with a nanosheet-like structure produced by functionalization with the HPDMIM(C1) ionic liquid. The maximum specific capacitance achieved for the HPDMIM(C1):CuO hybrid electrode was 464 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 in a 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Thus, our findings, in addition to the stability of the HPDMIM(C1):CuO, indicate that it is a candidate for energy-storage applications.
