Sizing optimization and power smoothing methodology in highly fluctuating grid-connected renewable systems represent important challenges nowadays, the total cost and energy quality depend on the effective balance between source and load with certain restrictions to increase reliability and enhance the use of renewable sources at all scales. This article presents a novel power smoothing effect and sizing optimization methodology for a grid-connected photovoltaic-hydrokinetic system by pattern search method comparatively with three optimization algorithms encompassing a multi-objective optimization. In this context, the method considers the reduction of power fluctuations using supercapacitors, where the objective function considers technical and economic indexes. The main contribution of the research is that the objective function decreases the fluctuation suppression ratio to sizing optimization of renewable system through three pattern search size optimization algorithms. Experiments have shown that pattern search method can find the global optimum by reducing the computational effort; the Latin hypercube algorithm reduces the photovoltaic capacity by approximately 5 % and 2.3 % with respect to the Nelder Mead and genetic algorithm respectively. The influence of the supercapacitor successfully reduces power fluctuations and causes an increase in self-consumption of 32.32 %, this result represents an annual cost savings of 42 % on energy purchased from the grid. Furthermore, this paper goes further by calculating the optimal location of a hydrokinetic turbine in a river using the HEC-RAS software to determine with high precision the HKT power fluctuations as input signal to novel proposed method.
