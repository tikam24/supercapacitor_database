Electrode material of TiO2 nanofiber was fabricated by electrospinning technique and a post treatment by KOH. Compared with the pristine TiO2, KOH treated fibers become much more conductive and thus are suitable for supercapacitor. The specific capacitance of treated TiO2 is dramatically enhanced from 0.04 F g-1 to 65.84 F g-1 at 1 mV s-1 and is about 1500 times higher than that of the pristine. This value is also about several times higher than those of conductive TiO2 obtained by anodic oxidation or hydrogen annealing. Besides, the treated TiO2 nanofibers exhibit a good rate characteristics and cycling stability by remaining 78% of the capacitance with increasing the scan rate from 1 mV s-1 to 1 V s-1 and 90% after 10,000 cycles, respectively.
