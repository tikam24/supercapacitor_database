Supercapacitor energy storage devices are well suited to meet the rigorous demands of future portable consumer electronics (PCEs) due to their high energy and power densities (i.e., longer battery-life and rapid charging, respectively) and superior operational lifetimes (10 times greater than lithium-ion batteries). To date, research efforts have been narrowly focused on improving the specific capacitance of these materials; however, emerging technologies are increasingly demanding competitive performance with regards to other criteria, including scalability of fabrication and electrochemical stability. In this regard, we developed a polyaniline (PANI) derivative that contains a carbazole unit copolymerized with 2,5-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine (Cbz-PANI-1) and determined its optoelectronic properties, electrical conductivity, processability, and electrochemical stability. Importantly, the polymer exhibits good solubility in various solvents, which enables the use of scalable spray-coating and drop-casting methods to fabricate electrodes. Cbz-PANI-1 was used to fabricate electrodes for supercapacitor devices that exhibits a maximum areal capacitance of 64.8 mF cm-2 and specific capacitance of 319 F g-1 at a current density of 0.2 mA cm-2. Moreover, the electrode demonstrates excellent cyclic stability (≈ 83% of capacitance retention) over 1000 CV cycles. Additionally, we demonstrate the charge storage performance of Cbz-PANI-1 in a symmetrical supercapacitor device, which also exhibits excellent cyclic stability (≈ 91% of capacitance retention) over 1000 charge-discharge cycles.
