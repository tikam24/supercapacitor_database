The energy storage system is a key aspect for the development of clean cars. Many types of batteries used in automotive vehicles application. Li-ion batteries are mainly in hybrid and electric vehicles. These technologies have a high energy density and a long lifetime. However, the use of this last one with high stresses influence directly the lifetime of components. For that, in our study, the li-ion battery is associated with supercapacitor to improve the characteristics of the power supply. This paper deal with the development of a thermo-electrical and aging model of Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) taking into account the electrical and thermal behaviors. In this context, an electric-thermal model is associated to the aging model for both battery and supercapacitor to test the operation mode of whole system. This model allows to test and validate the developed management strategies. The obtained results show the well performance of the model and confirm the interest of our system.
