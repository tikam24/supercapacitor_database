Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are considered as promising candidates for supercapacitors because of high specific area and potential redox sites. However, their shuffled orientations and low conductivity nature lead to severely-degraded performance. Designing an accessibly-manipulated and efficient method to address those issues is of outmost significance for MOF application in supercapacitors. It is the common way that MOFs scarify themselves as templates or precursors to prepare target products. But to reversely think it, using target products to prepare MOF could be the way to unlock the bottleneck of MOFs' performance in supercapacitors. Herein, a novel strategy using Co(OH)2 as both the template and precursor to fabricate vertically-oriented MOF electrode is proposed. The electrode shows a double high specific capacitance of 1044 Fg−1 and excellent rate capability compared to MOF in powder form. An asymmetric supercapacitor was also fabricated, which delivers a maximum energy density of 28.5 W h kg−1 at a power density of 1500 W kg−1, and the maximum of 24000 W kg−1 can be obtained with a remaining energy density of 13.3 W h kg−1. Therefore, the proposed strategy paves the way to unlock the inherent advantages of MOFs and also inspires for advanced MOF synthesis with optimum performance.
