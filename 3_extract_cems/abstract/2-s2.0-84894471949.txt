A stretchable carbon nanotube (CNT) fiber based wire-shaped supercapacitor is fabricated using a prestraining-then-buckling approach. At tensile strains from 0% to 100% or after 20 mechanical stretching-releasing cycles with maximum strain of 100%, the electrochemical properties are not reduced but rather somewhat improved. This may have implications for the integration of wire-shaped supercapacitors with wearable, miniaturized, and portable electronic devices. Â© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
