The combination of the molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and graphite can result in very promising hybrid electrode material for use in energy storage devices owing to the interesting properties of the combined material, such as an extremely high surface area, and prominent electrical conductivity. In this study, MoS2 powder and graphite powder are mixed with different compositions via the ball milling. A nanoparticle deposition system is used to deposit MoS2–graphite composites on stainless-steel. The morphology and structure of the thin films are evaluated by field-emission scanning electron microscope, x-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy. The electrochemical performances of supercapacitors fabricated from MoS2–graphite thin films as an electrode material using a two-electrode cell were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The supercapacitor shows better performance at 15% of the MoS2–graphite composition ratio. Moreover, the cyclic stability of the supercapacitor is measured by repeating charging–discharging for 10,000 cycles.
