Electrochemical supercapacitors are energy storage systems that exhibit high-power density, high cycle stability, and fast charge–discharge capacity. Carbon-based electrodes have been extensively used for supercapacitors due to their excellent porosity, mechanical properties, and large surface areas. However, these carbons are produced from fossil-based and unsustainable resources, mainly polyacrylonitrile. In recent years, lignin has appeared as a potential alternative precursor for producing sustainable carbon materials. Specifically, lignin’s renewable nature and large content of aromatic rings with reactive functional groups make it a highly viable candidate for electrochemical supercapacitor materials. This chapter deals with the current development of carbonaceous electrodes from sustainable lignin precursors. An extensive investigation of the utilization of lignin biopolymers toward developing high-performance electrodes for supercapacitors is described. The computational modeling techniques for designing supercapacitors and investigating their properties are illustrated. In conclusion, the challenges and improvements with lignin for supercapacitors are highlighted.
