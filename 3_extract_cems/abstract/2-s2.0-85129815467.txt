Electrode materials are the key to the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors. This study reports the electrochemical properties of V2O5 supercapacitors. V2O5 nanosheets with different morphologies were prepared by controlling the solvent under a facile hydrothermal method. The phase and the morphology of the samples were characterized by x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The electrochemical properties of V2O5 nanosheets with different morphologies were studied by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The charge transfers resistance decreases from 3.2 ω of V2O5 particles to 2.0 ω of V2O5 nanosheets. V2O5 nanosheets exhibit higher specific capacity (375 F g-1) than V2O5 particles (318 F g-1) in K2SO4 solution. The cycling capacity retention keeps 96.8% for 1000 cycles at 0.5 A g-1 in K2SO4 solution, indicating better cycling stability.
