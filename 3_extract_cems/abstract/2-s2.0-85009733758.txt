The development of advanced composite materials based on polyoxometalates (POMs) and nanostructured carbons has attracted significant attention as they combine the unique chemical reactivity of POMs and the unparalleled electronic properties of nanocarbons. The exceptional properties of the resultant composites have been widely employed in catalysis, energy conversion and storage, molecular sensors and electronics. In this chapter, we report the latest progress on POM/CNT (CNT = carbon nanotubes) and POM/graphene nanocomposites with a focus on energy materials for water splitting and fuel cells, electrode materials for batteries and supercapacitors, as well as functional materials for environmental pollutant sensing. Current applications are critically assessed and promising future target systems are discussed.
