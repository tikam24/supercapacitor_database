The invention of cost-effective, clean, and eco-friendly energy storage technology has been capturing a lot of worldwide interest. Herein, biogenically synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) were ultrasonically coupled with biomass-derived activated carbon (BAC) to obtain composite (denoted as TiO2@BAC). With the inspiration of nature, Mentha Aquatica leaves extract was employed for biogenic preparation of TiO2 NPs, and residual solid waste (SW) after extract was subsequently utilized for BAC. It is noteworthy that, this unique intensive method does not require any harmful or toxic chemicals and solvents, and no secondary waste is generated. TEM analysis of TiO2@BAC revealed spherical morphology of TiO2 NPs (average size ∼ 18 nm) that were accumulated on nanosheets. Raman, XRD, and XPS manifested the successful construction of TiO2@BAC. The electrochemical performance of the as-synthesized BAC, TiO2 NPs, and TiO2@BAC electrodes was tested towards supercapacitor applications. Notably, the TiO2@BAC electrode exhibited capacitance of 149 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g, which is approximately twice than that of the bare TiO2 electrode (76 F/g) along with excellent capacitance restoration of ∼99%. The TiO2@BAC electrode further revealed outstanding cyclic stability, exhibiting capacitance retention of ∼90% (at 5 A/g) after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles. Furthermore, the TiO2@BAC electrode delivered optimal specific energy density (6.96 Wh/kg) and large power density (2.07 kW/kg at 10 A/g). Moreover, the TiO2@BAC delivers an excellent restoration and retention performances of ∼100 and ∼95% (after 10,000 cycles) at 1 A/g with ∼98% coulombic efficiency in symmetric configuration (maximum cell voltage of 1.2 V).
