Fiber-supercapacitors (FSCs) hold great promise in smart wearable energy textiles due to the advantages of security, excellent deformability and unique integration structure. However, the integration of electroactive materials into economically viable textile fibers to produce FSCs with high energy density and mechanical flexibility remains a huge challenge. Herein, we fabricated NiCo2S4/PANI/CNTs hierarchical nanostructures on graphene polyamide blend fiber (GPAF) as effective cathodes for FSCs. The prepared composite fiber electrode exhibited a specific capacity of 1290 mF cm-2 when the current density was 2 mA cm-2, which was benefitted from the delocalized conjugated system of PANI nanolayer and the unique nanostructure of NiCo2S4/PANI. Subsequently, the constructed asymmetrical fiber-supercapacitor (AFSC) delivered energy density up to 83.3 μWh cm-2 when the power density was 420 μW cm-2. In addition, the AFSC also exhibited satisfactory cycling stability, maintaining 80.13% of the initial capacity after 5000 cycles. This work provides new ideas to promote the further development and practical applications of flexible fiber-supercapacitors and accelerate the development process of wearable energy textiles.
