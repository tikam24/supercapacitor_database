Integration of polyaniline (PANI) with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) resulting in PANI/rGO seems to be an effective way to eliminate the concern of cyclic stability attributed to the fragile back bone of polyaniline (PANI). Also, presence of aniline fibrils in the intervening layers of reduced graphene oxide enhances the conduction of the electrolytic ions in the resulting composite. The as-synthesized PANI/rGO composite shows an enhanced specific capacitance of 268 F g-1. All these results project PANI/rGO as an attractive electrode material for supercapacitor application.
