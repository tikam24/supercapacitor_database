This paper deals with super capacitors aging analysis performed on a large experimental database set issued from original and unique home-made storage component tester. We present the choice of dedicated cycles used for an automotive application recorded during a period of five years and from different manufacturers' technologies. The work merges applied and theoretical approaches of multi-research teams from different scientific communities. Based on a previous aging modeling work, this work confronts this model with estimation issued from experimental dataset. We propose a theoretical model refinement and some explanations of the evolution of internal capacity and serial resistance parameters based on physical phenomena. We then discuss the impact of the different applied cycles for managing the storage energy in vehicles or wave-energy applications.
