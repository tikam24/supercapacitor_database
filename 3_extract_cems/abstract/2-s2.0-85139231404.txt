The energy management strategy (EMS) can efficiently split the power among different sources for a fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV). This paper puts forward how to cooperate with a proton exchange membrane fuel cell as the primary energy source, and a ultracapacitor as the auxiliary energy storage. Firstly, the test bench of fuel cell is built and the characteristic of fuel cell is tested. A model of vehicle is built in AMESim software based on the real parameters of vehicle especially the characteristic of fuel cell. Secondly, the traditional power following strategy is introduced and an optimal energy management strategy is proposed. The demand power is decomposed by quadratic utility function (QUF) and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition. In order to balance the vehicle economy and durability of fuel cell, the multi-objective artificial bee colony algorithm (MOABC) and pareto solution set are used to solve the optimal balance coefficient in the algorithm. The simulation results show that compared with the traditional strategy under one WLTP driving cycle, the novel strategy can reduce the fuel cell degradation by 25.08 %, and the equivalent hydrogen consumption can be also reduced.
