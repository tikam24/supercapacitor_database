In this article, we are reporting the synthesis of graphene nanosheets from plasma assisted reduction of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets using a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma reactor and their supercapacitive behavior. The X-ray photoelectron analysis revealed the reduction of oxygenated functional groups in GO after the plasma assisted reduction reaction. The Raman spectra revealed that the regraphitization process was occurred in the GO nanosheets after the plasma reaction. The electrochemical studies such as cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge discharge analysis revealed the better supercapacitive performances of the as-synthesized graphene nanosheets. The specific capacitance of the graphene nanosheets calculated from the charge discharge cycle is about 141 F/g at a constant current density of about 0.5 mA cm-2.
