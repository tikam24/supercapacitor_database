Recently, there has been a great deal of interest in the possibility to exploit quantum-mechanical effects to increase the performance of energy storage systems. Here, we introduce and solve a model of a quantum supercapacitor. This consists of two chains, one containing electrons and the other one holes, hosted by arrays of double quantum dots, the latter being a building block of experimental architectures for realizing charge and spin qubits. The two chains are in close proximity and embedded in the same photonic cavity, which is responsible for long-range coupling between all the qubits, in the spirit of the Dicke model. By employing a variational approach, we find the phase diagram of the model, which displays ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases for suitable pseudospin degrees of freedom, together with phases characterized by collective superradiant behavior. Importantly, we show that when transitioning from the ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic to the superradiant phase, the quantum capacitance of the model is enhanced. Our work offers opportunities for the experimental realization of a novel class of quantum supercapacitors with an enhanced capacitance stemming from quantum-mechanical effects.
