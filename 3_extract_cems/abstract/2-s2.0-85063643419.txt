A novel 2D/3D NiS/Ni 3 S 4 composite was fabricated by a one-pot hydrothermal process, in which 3D hierarchical microspheres were anchored in or covered by the interconnected 2D nanosheets. The composites exhibited a high specific capacitance of 1796 F g −1 and good capacitance retention of 80.5% at a current density of 1 A g −1 after 1000 charge-discharge cycles. Our results indicate that the interconnected 2D/3D NiS/Ni 3 S 4 composites can be a promising electrode material for supercapacitor.
