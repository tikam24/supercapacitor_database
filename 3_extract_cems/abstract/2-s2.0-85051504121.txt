Herein, the honeycomb-like Mn-doping Ni(OH)2/Ni3S2 nanohybrid is synthesized, via a one-pot hydrothermal reaction with multi-temperature adjustment. This distinct multi-temperature control achieves fast nanostructure transformation from thicker nanosheets to thinner nanosheets. The cross-linked honeycomb-like structure consists of abundant open space and internal ultrathin nanosheets. Meanwhile, the introduction of Ni3S2 and Mn-doping into Ni(OH)2 will generate synergistic effects in our nanohybrid. As expected, the nanohybrid electrode displays ultrahigh areal capacitance of 2518.8 mC cm−2 at a high current density of 1.2 mA cm−2, and still possesses a high value of 1027.7 mC cm−2 even at 120 mA cm−2. A hybrid supercapacitor was developed, which shows high energy density of 51.0 Wh kg−1 (at 425 W kg−1) and suitable cycling reversibility of 78.6% (after 5000 cycles). These results suggest this electrode material could serve as a promising candidate for energy-storage devices.
