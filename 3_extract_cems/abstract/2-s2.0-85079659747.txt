An efficient strategy of surface engineering is developed to extraordinarily boost the energy density of multiscale porous carbon cloth for aqueous symmetric supercapacitors by optimizing the oxygen-containing functional groups. The operating voltage with neutral electrolyte is remarkably broadened from 1.3 to 1.8 V for electrochemical oxidized active carbon cloth (EOACC), enabling its ultrahigh areal capacitance (1548 mF cm−2) and extraordinary energy density (239.25 μWh cm−2). More importantly, engineering such a functionalized electrode with improved operating potential window is critically hinged on the fundamental understanding of the underlying electrochemical mechanism. The outstanding performance can be attributed to the enlarged ions-accessible specific surface area and created electrochemical active C[dbnd]O quinone-type groups, contributing to the combination of electrical double-layer capacitance and pseudo-capacitance, respectively. More significantly, the broadened potential window is originated from the increase of the onset overpotential for oxygen evolution reaction, induced by the physical barrier of adsorbed Na+ and the kinetic limitations of fast faradic redox reactions. This strategy sheds a light on the understanding of the electrochemical mechanism for broadened potential range, which provides a promising way for designing and engineering carbon-based aqueous supercapacitors with boosted energy density.
