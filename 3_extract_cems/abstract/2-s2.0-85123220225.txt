Lithium-ion capacitor has structure of consistingof the battery-type anode and capacitor-type cathode, thus having a enabling high energy density and a high power density. This capacitor expected to become the next generation of new energy storage devices.The kinetic mismatch between the Faradaic battery-type anode and capacitive cathode is a great challenge for lithium-ion capacitors. Therefore, researchers have developed a variety of high-rate lithium-ion battery materials.Among these materials, vanadium-based materials are considered as ideal anode materials for lithium-ion capacitor due to their low cost, large specific capacity, and superior rate performance.This review summarized recent work on the optimization strategies ofseveral vanadium-based anode materials, i.e. Li3VO4, VN and Li3V2O5.In addition, the future directions in the application of vanadium-based anode materials for lithium-ion capacitor were also proposed.
