Nitrogen-doped graphene aerogel (NG ae ) with a three-dimensional (3D) interconnected structure with ca. 3.5 at% of nitrogen content was synthesized by a hydrothermal reduction of graphene oxide with hydrazine and a following freezing-dry method. The 3D morphology of conductive NG ae provides fast ion diffusion leading to nearly steady specific capacitances (ca. 450 F g −1 ) when increasing scan rates (10–100 mV− 1 ) or applied currents (0.5–2.5 A g −1 ). Not only can the nitrogen-containing groups improve the electrical conductivity of NG ae but also they can store charges via their reversible surface redox reactions. The as-fabricated symmetric supercapacitor of NG ae in 1 M H 2 SO 4 electrolyte provides a maximum specific energy and power of 42 Wh kg − 1 and 2077 W kg −1 , respectively. In addition, incorporating pseudocapacitor materials i.e., MnO 2 and polyaniline to NG ae structure can also provide higher specific energy owing to surface redox reactions. The as-fabricated supercapacitors in this work may be practically used in high energy and power applications.
