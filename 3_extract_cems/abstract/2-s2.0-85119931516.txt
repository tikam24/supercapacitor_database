A new 3-D Co-MOF with the molecular formula of C10H8Co3N4O12 was prepared by hydrothermal method. As the anode for lithium ion battery, the electrode modified with 20% copper powder (Co-MOF-20) shows the specific capacity of 1138.5 mAh g−1 at 100 ​mA ​g−1. Even under the high current test of 500 ​mA ​g−1, Co-MOF-20 also shown excellent performance (349.6 mAh g−1) after 300 cycles. The advantages of Co-MOF-20 electrode are not only due to the introduction of copper powder conductive agent, but also the existence of three-dimensional structure which can provide ion transport channels.
