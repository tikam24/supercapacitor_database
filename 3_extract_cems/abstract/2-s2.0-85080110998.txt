The present paper continues our investigations in the field of Supercapacitors or Electrochemical Double Layer Capacitors, briefly named EDLCs [1]. During charging process EDLCs modules experience uneven state of charge (SOC) caused by manufacturing dispersions. Hence, the need for supplemental circuits to monitor and balance the charging process. The complex circuit for charging, monitoring and balancing presented in [1] has proven its effectiveness, but was limited to maximum charge/discharge currents of 500mA and a total capacitance of 4.4 F. We propose in the paper a modification of the power components in the circuit to permit a charge/discharge with 2A maximum current, that will permit us to handle a total capacitance of 40F, that corresponds to an individual capacitance of 200F. We will present the complete circuit, electrical simulation for major sub-circuits involved in charging/discharging and measurement of charge/discharge cycles.
