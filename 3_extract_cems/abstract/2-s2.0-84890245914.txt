In this paper, a gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) polyvinyl alcohol-sulphuric acid-2-mercaptopyridine (PVA-H2SO4-PySH) was prepared by solution mixing method using PySH as a redox mediator and PVA as a polymer host. The effect of the added amount of PySH on the ionic conductivity of GPE was investigated. The electrochemical properties of the supercapacitor with the prepared gel polymer electrolyte and activated carbon electrodes were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and self-discharge measurements. The results indicate that the ionic conductivity of GPE and the electrochemical properties of the supercapacitor were improved by introducing PySH. At the same current density, the electrode specific capacitance and energy density of the supercapacitor increase from 137 to 394F/g and 3.6 to 12.4 Wh/kg, respectively. In addition, the capacitive retention ratio of the supercapacitor still retains 89% over 3000 charge-discharge cycles.
