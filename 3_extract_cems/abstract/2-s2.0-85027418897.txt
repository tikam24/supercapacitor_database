City of Gdynia (Poland) exploits one of the most modern trolleybus network in Europe, which has been involved in many projects related to the reduction of energy consumption [1]. Some of them are connected with the improving of energy breaking recovery usage. An experimental stationary storage system at Północna substation, which was tested in 2012-2014, is a bright example of a system which is connected with the improving of the energy breaking recovery. In 2014 the storage energy system in Wielkopolska substation was installed. It the first stationary supercapacitor storage system of such a huge implemented in traction supply system in the central - eastern part of Europe. Moreover, in 2016 PKT started to apply Smart Grid technologies in supply network: the bilateral supply system. The paper presents results of these two novel investments.
