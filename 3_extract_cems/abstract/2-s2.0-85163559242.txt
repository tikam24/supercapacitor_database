The roles of oxygen vacancies to enhance the electrochemical performance were not clearly explained in comprehensive research. Herein, the vertically oriented NiCo2S4/MnO2 core–shell nanocomposites are in situ grown on the nickel foam (NF) surface and activated by oxygen vacancy engineering via a chemical reduction method. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) results show the shell-MnO2 is well coated on the core-NiCo2S4. The hierarchical core–shell nanostructures synergistically increase conductivity and provide rich faradaic redox chemical reactions. Moreover, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations further indicate that the electronic properties and structure properties in NiCo2S4/MnO2 electrode of reduction for 60 min (NiCo2S4/MnO2-60) are effectively adjusted by introducing oxygen vacancies. Impressively, the NiCo2S4/MnO2-60 electrode delivers substantially appreciable areal capacity of 2.13 mAh·cm−2 couple with superior rate capability. The as-prepared high-performance electrode material can assemble into solid-state hybrid supercapacitor. The fabricated NiCo2S4/MnO2-60//AC device exhibits an exceptional energy density of 43.16 Wh·kg−1 at a power density of 384.21 W·kg−1 and satisfactory cyclic stability of 92.1 % at current density of 10 mA·cm−2 after 10,000 cycles. In general, the work demonstrates the significance of NiCo2S4/MnO2-60 as a highly redox active electrode material for future practical application in supercapacitors.
