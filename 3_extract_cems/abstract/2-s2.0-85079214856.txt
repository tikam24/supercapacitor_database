How to achieve a balance between excellent pseudocapacitive performance and simplicity of the synthetic pathway of Co3O4 is still a challenge. Herein, hollow Co3O4 microspheres were synthesized through a facile template-free solvothermal approach with a following calcination treatment. The synthetic Co3O4 exhibited remarkable electrochemical properties in terms of high specific capacity 922.7 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, superior rate capability with 67.7 % capacitance retention (1–20 A g−1), as well as excellent cycling stability (105.6 % retention after 10000 cycles). A hybrid supercapacitor device is also successfully assembled consisting of a Co3O4 cathode and a reduced graphene oxide anode with a wide potential window of 0–1.65 V, which delivers a high energy density and an outstanding cycle lifetime. These superior electrochemical properties will render the hollow Co3O4 microsphere material as an attractive material for promising application in high-performance electrochemical energy storage systems.
