The balance performance of super-capacitor is very important when super-capacitor is used in module. In order to study the influence of different balance circuits on module charging performance, A MATLAB simulation of two different charge balancing circuits was carried out on the super-capacitor module, with the Monte Carlo method simulating dispersion of parameters. The results show that in the same parameter conditions, the dynamic voltage balancing circuit has higher energy utilization efficiency, the switch resistance balancing circuit is easier to control the charge process, but its voltage balancing effect is not as good as effect of dynamic balancing circuit. With the resistance balancing method, if switch is active in advance, the variance of modular single voltage and number of over-voltage reduce significantly. With the dynamic voltage balancing method, the discharge current increases, the voltage of individual super-capacitor becomes more quickly balanced and concentrated. Consequently, with the resistance balancing method, making the switch active in advance can significantly improve the balancing effect; with dynamic voltage balancing method, designing an appropriate equilibrium coefficient which coordinates with the value of the super-capacitor can reach a better state of balance effect.
