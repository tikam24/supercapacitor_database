The synthesis of nanocrystalline vanadium nitride (VN) supercapacitors through a low-temperature route base on a two-step ammonolysis reaction of VCl4 in anhydrous chloroform, is discussed. X ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) are used to characterize the as-prepared and heat-treated NV nanocrystals. Cyclic voltammetry is conducted at 600Â°C to obtain accurate redox potentials that correspond to the pseudocapacitance behavior, and to confirm the reversibility among the different vanadium oxide phases. The results demonstrated the possibility of using transition metal nitrides as a new class of supercapacitor material through modification of their surface chemistry.
