An efficient method for growing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on the surface of continuously moving carbon fibres has been developed by a unique open-ended chemical vapor deposition (CVD) furnace. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is used to observe the morphological characteristics of CNTs grown on carbon fibre surfaces, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) is used to study the microstructure of CNTs. The results show that the CNTs achieve uniform and orderly growth. In the process of CNTs growth, the cross-linking of adjacent graphite crystallites is formed and the damage of the catalyst nanoparticles to the fibres is repaired, so the tensile strength is increased compared to the carbon fibres undergoing reduction. CNTs-grown carbon fibres can be used to fabricate the flexible supercapacitor electrodes to improve electrochemical capacitance and promote electrochemical stability.
