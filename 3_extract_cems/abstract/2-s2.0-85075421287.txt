In this work, a new fabric electrode for supercapacitors was prepared by a facile two-step (dyeing and spray-coating) method. Organic dyes (C. I. Disperse Blue 79 (DB 79) and C. I. Disperse Red 60 (DR 60)) were adsorbed by PET fabric during the traditional dyeing process to improve the capacitance performance of the fabric, while poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) solution was coated onto the fabric by spray-coating procedure to boost the conductivity of the fabric. The results indicated that the introduction of dyes can enhance the surface conductivity and the area specific capacitance of the PEDOT:PSS-coated PET fabric. Notably, DB 79 increased the fabric capacitance from 50.92 m F/cm2 to 74.99 m F/cm2 at the current density of 0.5 mA/cm2. The fabric electrode exhibited excellent reversibility and rate capability although the internal ohmic resistance of electrode was reduced compared with the electrode without dyes. Meanwhile, the assembled all-organic supercapacitor based on the prepared fabric electrode delivered a high specific capacitance of 46.18 m F/cm2 at 1 mA/cm2 with good cycling stability, and also showed excellent flexibility. This study provided a novel and potential method with good manufacturing scalability to develop high performance flexible supercapacitors.
