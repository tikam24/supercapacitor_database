A facile electrochemical codeposition method was developed to prepare the manganese dioxide/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) composite electrodes for supercapacitor applications. Electrode characterizations include Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, indicating that the MnO2/PEDOT composite is prepared successfully. Electrochemical tests manifest that MnO2/PEDOT composite electrodes have better electrochemical properties than individual MnO2 and PEDOT electrodes. The as-prepared MnO2/PEDOT composite achieves a high areal specific capacitance of 89.7 mF cm−2 at 10 mV s−1, as well as superior rate capability and cycle stability (maintaining 97.1% of initial capacitance for 5000 cycles). The composite we have developed also exhibits superior supercapacitive performances relative to other conducting polymers reported previously, including PEDOT based composite electrodes. These properties of MnO2/PEDOT composite are closely related to the porous microstructures formed and the synergic effect between the two components. The present MnO2/PEDOT based organic–inorganic hybrid materials are very promising for supercapacitor applications.
