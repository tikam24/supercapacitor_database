In this paper, we successfully demonstrated the fabrication of highly ordered and large-scale P3HT:PCBM nanowires via a slow-drying method, which allows for the convenient and cost-effective preparation of well-defined P3HT:PCBM nanostructures with large domains. The formation of the organic nanowires can be explained by the self-organization of polymer chains under favorable thermodynamic conditions in the slow-drying process. Furthermore, the C-V measurements revealed that the P3HT:PCBM nanowires possess high capacitance. This supercapacitive behavior of the nanowires is related to their large surface area and open structure, which can facilitate ion transport and accumulation. Owing to their extremely easy preparation and excellent capacitance performance, the P3HT:PCBM nanowires offer a promising electrode material for supercapacitor devices.
