The search of efficient, robust and fault-tolerant electronic power converters is a challenge for the industry and academia. Nowadays, the integration and exploitation of the renewable energy sources and energy storage systems is required. In these terms, the multilevel power converters and specifically the cascaded H-bridge (CHB) power converter is a very good candidate. However, if a CHB power converter operates under an unbalanced operation a low-frequency high-distortion content appears in the output voltage spectrum. In order to reduce this problem, an extra cell, equipped with a low voltage battery or supercapacitor, is added to the original CHB converter. The idea is to operate the extra cell with the convenient duty cycle value in order to eliminate the low-order harmonic distortion generated by the unbalanced operation. This makes the proposed method very interesting because it leads to a reduction of the grid connection filter.
