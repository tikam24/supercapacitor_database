Transitional metal oxide nanomaterials are considered to be potential electrode materials for supercapacitors. Therefore, in the past few decades, huge efforts have been devoted towards the sustainable synthesis of metal oxide nanomaterials. Herein, we report a synergistic approach to synthesize spherical-shaped CoMoO4 electrode materials using an inorganic-organic template via the hydrothermal route. As per the synthesis strategy, the precursor solution was reacted with the organic compounds of E. cognata to tailor the surface chemistry and morphology of CoMoO4 by organic species. The modified CoMoO4 nanomaterials revealed a particle size of 23 nm by X-ray diffraction. Furthermore, the synthesized material was scrutinized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. The optical band gap energy of 3.6 eV was calculated by a Tauc plot. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry identified cyclobutanol (C4H8O) and octodrine (C8H19N) as the major stabilizing agents of the CoMoO4 nanomaterial. Finally, it was revealed that the bioorganic framework-derived CoMoO4 electrode exhibited a capacitance of 294 F g-1 by cyclic voltammetry with a maximum energy density of 7.3 W h kg-1 and power density of 7227.525 W kg-1. Consequently, the nanofeatures and organic compounds of E. cognata were found to enhance the electrochemical behaviour of the CoMoO4-fabricated electrode towards supercapacitor applications.
