We demonstrate an organic photovoltaic (OPV) device with an electrochemically gated carbon nanotube (CNT) charge collector. Bias voltages applied to the gate electrode reconfigure the common CNT electrode from an anode into a cathode which effectively collects photogenerated electrons, dramatically increasing all solar cell parameters to achieve a power conversion efficiency of ∼3%. This device requires very little current to initially charge and the leakage current is negligible compared to the photocurrent. This device can also be viewed as a hybrid tandem OPV-supercapacitor with a common CNT electrode. Other regimes of operation are briefly discussed. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.
