A power system faces problems such as transient stability of PV nodes, worsening of power quality and capacity coordination when a wind farm is connected to a power system. In view of the circumstances in which a reactive power compensation device is used to inject friendly wind energy into the system, a supercapacitor energy storage high power DVR is proposed to detect the grid dispatching value and wind farm output power, and then the DVR coordinates power control. Compared with the traditional energy storage-type DVR, it significantly reduces the harmonic content of the bus point and the capacity of the energy storage device when the wind farm is put into the network. The simulation model built in Matlab/Simulink and experiment verifies the correctness and effectiveness of the DVR topology and its control strategy with a wind farm.
