The negative electrode materials are crucial to improve electrochemical performance in asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) as well as positive electrode. Herein, the α-MnO2/Ag/RGO hybrid films were prepared by a facile and rapid natural deposition technique and exhibit good electrochemical performance with specific capacitance of 804.6 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. The ASCs were further fabricated using NiCoS2/CNFs and α-MnO2/Ag/RGO film as positive and negative electrodes. The operation potential window of ASCs was 0–1.6 V. The fabricated ASCs exhibited the maximum energy density of 44.2 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 288.2 W kg−1. The as-fabricated ASCs has a great potential for application in portable and wearable energy-storage systems.
