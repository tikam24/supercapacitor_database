Novel nickel oxide@nitrogenous mesoporous carbon (NiOx@NMC) nanocomposite (NC) has been synthesized from the hydrothermal method using costless smoked cigarette filter as a source of nitrogenous carbon. The prepared NiOx@NMC-NC shows high surface area (~1843 m2/g) with excellent mesoporous (~12 nm) nature. The NiOx@NMC-NC exhibits brilliant electrochemical performance in super-capacitors and stability up to 4000 segments. The specific capacitance of NiOx@NMC-NC was found to be ~740 F/g at 1 A/g in 6 M KOH.
