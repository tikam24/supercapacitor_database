Identifying the super capacitor's characteristic parameters correctly is the key research basis for analyzing the super capacitor's electrical performance and estimating its state of health. In order to overcome the impedance spectroscopy method's disadvantages, such as its stimulating signal amplitude is too low to depict the research object's real working condition, and it is hard to realize online parameter identification, the recursive least square method is adopted in the paper. Based on the test results, large differences between the identified parameters' values and its real values can be observed. So the identification structure of the method on the basis of deep analysis of the least square method is imoroved. The experimental and simulation results show that, based on the improved recursive least square method, the characteristic parameter identification values are more correct and credible.
