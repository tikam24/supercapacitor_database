Uses of supercapacitors are increasing in the electronics field due to their properties and sustainability. Controlling this E-Waste generation by supercapacitors should be considered seriously to overcome the upcoming problem of E-waste management. Recycling supercapacitors is cost-effective and beneficial for the environment because it keeps dangerous elements out after the device has completely degraded. Due to its high capacitance and high energy density, ruthenium oxide (RuO2) is a frequently used electrode material in supercapacitor devices and a good choice in this sector. This chapter discusses the recycling of RuO2 electrode material-based supercapacitors. RuO2 was extracted by the chemical extraction method. Sonication, chemical separation, and thermal decomposition methods were used to extract RuO2. Used RuO2 was removed from the device by sonication and then oxidized in RuO4 by oxidizing agent ceric ammonium nitrate. RuO4 is in a gas form and absorbed by paraffin oil and again reduced in RuO2. So crystalline RuO2 was extracted from paraffin oil via filtration. The extraction of crystalline RuO2 is confirmed by XRD, showing clear and sharp peaks. Another electrochemical performance of the supercapacitor based on recycled RuO2 material was investigated.
