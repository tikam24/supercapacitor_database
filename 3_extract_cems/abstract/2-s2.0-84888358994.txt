Freestanding Ni(OH)2 nanoflakes on CNT films (NNCF) electrode with high specific capacitance is effectively fabricated via a facile chemical precipitation method. The CNT films function as conductive networks and the nucleation centers of Ni(OH)2 nanoflakes. The resulted ultrathin a-Ni(OH)2 exhibits a high specific capacitance of 3351 F g -1 at a scan rate of 2 mV s-1 and a good cycling stability with a visibly lowcapacitance loss of 15% at a high scan rate of 70mVs -1, suggesting promising potential for supercapacitor applications.
