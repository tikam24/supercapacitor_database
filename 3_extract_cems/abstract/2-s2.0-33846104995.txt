The solvated ion size of electrolytes increases in the following order; SO42-(H2O)12 (0.53 nm) < (C2H5)4N+·7acetonitrile (Et4N+·7ACN, 1.30 nm) < (C2H5)4N+·4propylene carbonate (Et4N+·4PC, 1.35 nm). The size difference between the nanowindows of single-wall carbon nanohorns and the solvated ions of electrolytes should be an important factor in the accessibility of the ions to the internal spaces through the nanowindow.
