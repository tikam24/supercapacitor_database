The supercapacitor multilayered electrode materials were prepared potentiodynamically based on polyaniline/activated carbon composite materials. The multilayers comprised of various combinations of activated carbon and doped polyaniline layers using three dopants such as sulphuric acid, camphor-10-sulphonic acid and p-toluene sulphonic acid. These composite materials were characterized using SEM, BET Surface area and FTIR. The supercapacitive properties of the fabricated symmetrical supercapacitors were analyzed by cyclic voltammetry, ac impedance and galvanostatic chargeâ€“discharge techniques. Based on the electrochemical results best one was chosen for fabricating the symmetrical supercapacitor and it showed the highest specific capacitance of 549.5 F/g. Further, it was found that these multilayered electrode materials gave higher capacitance than their single layered counter parts.
