Novel MnS @ Mn3O4/C nanoflakes are prepared via two step method using natural polysaccharide. The structural, morphological and electrochemical features of the nanocomposite are investigated by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance analysis. This synergetic core-shell nanostructure exhibits the maximum specific capacity of 567.5 C g−1 at a current density of 1 Ag−1. MnS@ Mn3O4/C//activated carbon asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor is assembled, which reveals the excellent specific capacitance (45.91 Fg−1), cyclic stability (71% even after 1000 cycles) and energy density (12.50 WhKg−1), indicating that the prepared nanocomposite can be useful for the fabrication of high performance supercapacitor devices.
