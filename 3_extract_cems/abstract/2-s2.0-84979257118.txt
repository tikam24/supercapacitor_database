There are many types of high-power batteries used in HEVs, and their durabilities and degradation mechanisms are different. In this paper, four types of commercial high-power batteries, including two types of LTO/NCM lithium-ion battery from two different manufacturers, a C/LMO battery and a supercapacitor (SC), are studied. A durability test with a realistic current profile for an HEV is used so that the durability results more closely reflect real operating conditions than a general cycle life test. Incremental capacity (IC) curves are used to qualitatively analyze the degradation mechanism. To compensate for defects in the IC method, a prognosis model, using a genetic algorithm to reconstruct constant current charge voltage curves, is adopted to quantitatively identify the battery aging mechanism.
