The electrochemical properties of poly sodium 4-styrenesulfonate intercalated thermally reduced graphite oxide (PSS-TRGO) for supercapacitors have been investigated and compared with PSS intercalated graphite oxide (PSS-GO). The specific capacitance improved from 200 F g−1 of PSS-GO to 250 F g−1 for PSS-TRGO, at the scan rate of 50 mVs−1. PSS-TRGO also displayed high energy density of 36 W h kg−1 with power density of 611.3 W kg−1, revealing viability and potential for supercapacitor applications. The capacitance retention of PSS-TRGO was 97% after 1000 cycles, indicating potential high cyclic stability. PSS-TRGO, therefore, could be an excellent carbon based electrode for further energy storage devices.
