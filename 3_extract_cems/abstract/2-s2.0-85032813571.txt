NiSx−n grown on the carbon cloth (NiSx−n//CC) were successfully prepared via a facile one-step hydrothermal technique by controlling initial S2−/Ni2+ molar ratio n. Serving as a supercapacitor electrode, the specific capacitance of Ni3S4//CC (n = 3.0) has been measured to be 1340 F/g at a discharge density of 1 A/g. Also, the Ni3S4//CC displays an excellent long-time cycling stability (94.5%). Furthermore, the flexible all-solid-state supercapacitor device fabricated based on the Ni3S4//CC exhibits good supercapacitive performance with maximum power density of 6750 W/kg and superior cycling stability after 5000 continuous cycles (retention rate of cycling around 84.7%). These results indicate that the Ni3S4//CC is a promising and suitable electrode material for high-performance flexible all-solid-state supercapacitors.
