Lithium manganese oxide intercalation compound (Li0.7MnO2) supported on titanium nitride nanotube array (TiN NTA) was applied as cathode electrode material for lithium-ion supercapacitor application. Li0.7MnO2/TiN NTA was fabricated through electrochemical deposition and simultaneous intercalation process using TiN NTA as a substrate, Mn(CH3COO)2 as manganese source, and Li2SO4 as lithium source. The morphology and microstructure of the Li0.7MnO2/TiN NTA were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis. The electrochemical performance of the Li0.7MnO2/TiN NTA was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements. Li0.7MnO2/TiN NTA exhibited higher capacitive performance in Li2SO4 electrolyte solution rather than that in Na2SO4 electrolyte solution, which was due to the different intercalation effects of lithium-ion and sodium-ion. The specific capacitance was improved from 503.3 F g−1 for MnO2/TiN NTA to 595.0 F g−1 for Li0.7MnO2/TiN NTA at a current density of 2 A g−1 in 1.0 M Li2SO4 electrolyte solution, which was due to the intercalation of lithium-ion for Li0.7MnO2. Li0.7MnO2/TiN NTA also kept 90.4 % capacity retention after 1000 cycles, presenting a good cycling stability. An all-solid-state lithium-ion supercapacitor was fabricated and showed an energy density of 82.5 Wh kg−1 and a power density of 10.0 kW kg−1.
