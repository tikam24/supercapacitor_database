Recent progress in the construction of non-peripheral octamethyl-substituted copper(II) phthalocyanine (N-CuMe 2 Pc) has opened up new strategies for energy storage applications. Since metal phthalocyanines can deliver excellent redox activities, we have prepared composite based on different ratios of N-CuMe 2 Pc and graphene oxide (GO) through a simple ultrasound process and evaluated their electrochemical performance for supercapacitor applications. As-prepared composites exhibit superior electrochemical activities as the results of the synergistic effect. A maximum specific capacitance of 291.6 F g −1 is achieved for the G10P2 electrode (Graphene oxide 10 mg and N-CuMe 2 Pc 2 mg) at 0.5 A g −1 which two times higher than their individual components. Further, the fabricated symmetric device shows that the excellent cyclic stability of about 100.1% over 5000 cycles. The experimental findings ensure the potential application of copper-phthalocyanine/GO composite as an electrode material for the next-generation supercapacitor applications.
