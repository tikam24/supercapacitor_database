In this contribution, we present a novel and rational strategy for preparing hierarchical porous CNTs@NCS@MnO2 core-shell composites via a facile in situ chemical polymerization coating method, followed by a hydrothermal process. An intermediate nitrogen-doped carbon shell (NCS) with mesoporous structure and favorable chemical durability is obtained by utilizing resorcinol-formaldehyde resin as the carbon source and l-cysteine as the nitrogen source. Benefiting from a unique structure and considerable combination, the composites exhibit a highly comprehensive electrochemical performance: high specific capacitance (312.5 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1), good rate capability (76.8% retention with the charge-discharge rate increasing from 1 A g-1 to 10 A g-1), superior reversibility and cycling stability (92.7% capacitance retention after 4000 cycles at 8 A g-1). In order to increase the energy density and voltage window, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was assembled using CNTs@NCS@MnO2 and activated carbon (AC) as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. The as-fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor achieved a high specific capacitance with a stable operating voltage of 1.8 V and a maximum energy density of 27.3 W h kg-1. Such a synthetic route to prepare capacitor materials can thoroughly motivate the synergistic effect between electrical double layer capacitors and pseudocapacitors for obtaining high comprehensive performance electrodes in energy storage fields.
