In the 1990s, polymer-in-salt electrolytes (PISEs) came into the picture with the hope to overcome the problem of slow ion motion and low cation transference number in salt-in-polymer-electrolytes (SIPEs). The present paper reports an electrolyte membrane in the PISE range using renewable polymer (rice starch), synthesized using a simple solution cast technique having high moisture content (~ 12%). The synthesized flexible PISE membrane has high conductivity (~ 10−2 S/cm) and fast ion transport (relaxation time ~ µs). Conductivity is almost independent of relative humidity indicating the water molecules available in the matrix are involved in the lattice formation and the matrix is stable. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and optical photographs have confirmed that the crosslinked starch matrix accepts a large amount of salt, and even at 300 wt% of salt (i.e., at 3:1 salt: starch ratio), morphology remains homogenous, and no signature of salt is present in XRD spectra. The electrochemical stability window (ESW ~ 2.7 V) is also wide enough for energy device fabrication. To check its potential for supercapacitor application, the two most simple electrodes (anodized Al and carbon cloths) were selected. The approximate rectangular shape of cyclic voltammetry (CV) performed at different scan rates from 5 to 500 V/s, indicated the EDLC-type charge storage phenomenon in the studied voltage ranges. For scan rate above 300 V/s, the capacitance value is almost independent of scan rate. All these indicate that crosslinked starch-based PISEs are a successful step towards the target for possibilities of commercial application of polymer-in-salt electrolytes.
