The optimized structure of composited materials decides the electrochemical performances of supercapacitors. Herein, the NiCo 2 O 4 @MnMoO 4 particles with novel and functional structure were synthesized by two-step hydrothermal method process in this work, in which nickel foam (Ni foam) was employed as substrate. In the experiment process, the NiCo 2 O 4 particles were prepared on the Ni foam and then the NiCo 2 O 4 @MnMoO 4 particles were prepared on the NiCo 2 O 4 . According to the electrochemical tests, both the NiCo 2 O 4 and NiCo 2 O 4 @MnMoO 4 micro-particles prepared in this work have superior electrochemical performances including higher specific capacitances than most of the other NiCo 2 O 4 and NiCo 2 O 4 @MnMoO 4 researches. At the scan rate of 5 mA·cm −2 , the area specific capacitance of the NiCo 2 O 4 electrode is 4.73 F cm −2 (equivalent to 1152.4 F·g −1 mass specific capacitance), while that of the NiCo 2 O 4 @MnMoO 4 electrode is 16.40 F cm −2 (equivalent to 2603.9 F·g −1 mass specific capacitance). The cycling performance of the NiCo 2 O 4 and NiCo 2 O 4 @MnMoO 4 at the current density of 5 mA·cm −2 were measured. After 3000 discharge–charge cycles, the specific capacitance of the NiCo 2 O 4 micro-particles remains 112.2% of its initial value, and the NiCo 2 O 4 @MnMoO 4 micro-particles remains 92.1%. The asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled by the NiCo 2 O 4 @MnMoO 4 compounds and activated carbon (AC), which show high energy density of 44.16 Wh/kg at power density of 0.8 kW/kg. The results show that the NiCo 2 O 4 @MnMoO 4 composite is an excellent candidate for electrode materials of energy storage devices.
