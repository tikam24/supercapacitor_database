This paper presents the control of solar photovoltaic (PV)-battery-supercapacitor fed synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) drive for electric vehicles (EVs) applications. The integrated system performance is evaluated by considering European drive cycle (EDC) which justifies closer to practical applications; especially in mountain regions where vehicle speed varies due to slope and in cities heavy traffic situations where vehicles are frequently required to start and stop. This integrated system uses a bidirectional dc-dc converter (BDDC) for regulating the power requirement from the hybrid energy storage system (HESS) which includes the combination of battery and supercapacitor (SC) for different operating conditions as per EDC. To improve the efficiency of HESS a solar PV array is installed on the rooftop of EVs with a boost converter for maximum power point tracking (MPPT). The power developed from solar PV array adds to battery power to fulfil the average power requirement of EVs and SC is used to fulfil the transient power requirement of EVs as a result of which charging/ discharging of battery reduces. This process enhances the life of the battery as well as increases the driving range of EVs. The SynRM drive is operated using 3-Ï• voltage source converter (VSC) with hysteresis current control by tracing the speed and rotor position which makes this system less bulky and cost-effective. The integrated solar PV array-battery-supercapacitor fed SynRM drive is simulated in MATLAB Simulink environment and is studied under steady-state and dynamic conditions as per the European drive cycle.
