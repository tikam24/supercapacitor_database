In this work, N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTS) have been easily unzipped using a chemical oxidation method to obtain porous and multi-defective partially unzipped N-doped carbon nanotubes (PU-NCNTs), which are promising as negative electrode materials for supercapacitors and are also suitable substrate materials for the efficient loading of ultrathin manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanosheets. Herein, the PU-NCNT/MnO2composite was synthesized through a simple microwave irradiation method. Moreover, we have fabricated an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) using PU-NCNT/MnO2composite as cathode, PU-NCNTs as anode and neutral aqueous Na2SO4as electrolyte. Because of the synergistic effects of the PU-NCNTs electrode and the high capacitance as well as good rate performance of PU-NCNT/MnO2composite, the asymmetric cell exhibited good electrochemical performance. The optimized ASC can be worked stably in the voltage window of 0–1.8 V and exhibited a maximum energy density of 14.76 Wh kg−1at the current density of 1 A g−1. Additionally, the PU-NCNT/MnO2//PU-NCNT ASC exhibited long cycling stability with 80.5% specific capacitance retained after 1000 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1. These encouraging results show that PU-NCNT/MnO2could be promising materials for commercial use of supercapacitors.
