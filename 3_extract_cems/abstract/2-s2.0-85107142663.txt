The paper proposes a coordinated operation method of two independent storages for managing state-of-charge (SOC) and for providing ancillary service concerning frequency regulation (FR); furthermore, this article also introduces the power allocation scheme between two storages in consideration of the coverage of the frequency band for each storage along with the SOC management scheme of the supercapacitor and battery. We also provide a guideline for the storage sizing on the basis of the smoothing time constant. Additionally, we verify the advantage of the HESS in extending the lifetime of the battery, which is estimated by a real-time state-of-health (SOH) calculation method. The Bode plot of the proposed method is analyzed to observe the power spectrum coverage in the frequency domain through the case studies using PSCAD/EMTDC and MATLAB.
