In the present work, a MnO2/MWCNT hybrid nanocomposite was synthesized by the one-step hydrothermal method. The structural, vibrational, morphological, and chemical composition of the samples were investigated by powder XRD, FT-IR, FE-SEM, and XPS analysis techniques. The MnO2/MWCNT hybrid electrode exhibited remarkable electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance of 249 F/gat 0.5 A/g and the life cycling performance (95.5% retention after 2500 cycles at a current density of 10 A/g)in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Moreover, the constructed asymmetric-based supercapacitor (ASC) was used for PVA/1MNa2SO4 solid-state electrolyte. As-constructed ASC device achieved a high specific capacitance of 52 F/gat the current density 2 Ag−1and the high power density and energy density of 8000 W kg−1 and 19.50 W h kg−1, respectively. The ASC has exhibited excellent cycle stability of 2000 cycles at the current density of 10 Ag−1with capacitance retention of 94%. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
