A microwave irradiation involved process was applied to fabrication of graphene/polyaniline nanocomposite via in-situ polymerization of aniline monomers on graphene sheets. Structure and morphology of composites were characterized through scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectra, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectra. Electrochemical performances for energy storage applications were examined by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements. Owing to the homogeneous coating of polyanilline on the large surface of graphene, graphene/polyaniline composite-based electrode exhibits remarkably enhanced capacitive behavior with a specific capacitance of 429 F/g at 0.2 Ag-1, a good cyclic stability and an excellent conducting behavior, which are much superior to those of individual components of composites. The improved electrochemical behavior of the composite resulting from the irradiation of microwave suggests the promising potentials for supercapacitors.
