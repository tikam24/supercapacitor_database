In the current era, the automobiles/vehicles production trend in India is about 30 M units per year. Although majority of these fabricated automobiles is to consume conventional resources of energy as fuel. Meanwhile, output exhaust of these vehicles has a harmful effect in terms of pollution level and other global warming issues in metropolitical cities of India. Three-wheeler electric rickshaws have been used for public transport in metro cities. These vehicles are considered as green vehicles to reduce pollution issues. However, the primary concern with these vehicles is driving range due to low energy storage capacity system. Battery, supercapacitor, flywheel, and fuel cell or hybrid system are employed as energy storage medium in these vehicles. In the present study, an assessment has been prepared for energy flow concept in these vehicles along with different charging configurations.
