The proceedings contain 329 papers. The topics discussed include: design simulation of top ITO gratings to improve light transmission for gallium nitride LEDs; non-volatile memory devices based on chalcogenide materials; a remote sensing image segmentation method based on spectral and texture information fusion; low power ambient energy harvesting, conversion, and storage circuits; dynamic single-row routing technique for channel assignments; a new method to reduce the side-channel leakage caused by unbalanced capacitances of differential interconnections in dual-rail logic styles; using a supercapacitor to power wireless nodes from a low power source such as a 3V button battery; a novel EKF-GPS algorithm for bridge deformation monitoring system; a high-performance architecture of an XML processor for SIP-based presence; the two-level-turn-model fault-tolerant routing scheme in Tori with convex and concave faults; and generating rule-based executable process models for service outsourcing.
