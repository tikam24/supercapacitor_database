In this research, fan-shaped ZnMoO4 is deposited on flower-like ZnCo2O4 nanowire arrays by two-step hydrothermal method. ZnCo2O4 nanowire is synthesized first and used as the backbone to support ZnMoO4. The flower-like ZnCo2O4 nanowire arrays are fully overspread by ZnMoO4. And this unique structure shows a high capacitance of 1506 F g−1 when used as electrode for supercapacitor at a current density of 1 A g−1 and a good cycling ability (5000 cycles).
