Porous covalent organic materials (COM) are a class of multi-dimensional and multi-functional porous materials, which are built via covalent bond of colorful organic building blocks. COM materials possess inherent optimized pore size allowing ion migration, and high specific surface area, providing the possibility of formation of an electrostatic charge-separation layer, a conjugated system resulting in light-harvesting properties and a highly ordered structure, enabling the formation of conductive paths. In this review, we summary the applications on semiconductor, photolysis of water, solar cell, oxygen reduction reaction in fuel cell, lithium-ion/sulfur battery basing on COM materials. Meanwhile, we also propose the design strategy for photoelectronic materials. Although the development of COMs as photoelectronic materials is still in its infancy, COM materials has being attracting ever-increasing attention and open a new window in this field.
