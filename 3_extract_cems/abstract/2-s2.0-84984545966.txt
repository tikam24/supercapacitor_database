Preparation of activated carbon monolith (ACM) from rubber wood was investigated. Two kind of preparation method were carried out by pre-carbonized of rubber wood saw dust and rubber wood material as it is naturally. The samples were prepared with pelletizing method and small cutting of rubber wood in cross sectional method. Both of samples were characterized by physical and electrochemical technique. The physical properties such as morphology and porosity were investigated. The electrochemical properties of both samples such as equivalent series resistances (ESR) and specific capacitances were also compared. In conclusion, this study showed that both of different preparation method would propose a simple method of ACM electrode preparation technique for supercapacitor applications.
