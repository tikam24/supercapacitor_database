Petal-like MnMoO4/Ni(OH)2 ultrathin nanosheets were synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method, and their electrochemical performance was evaluated. Electrochemical analysis indicated that the specific capacitance was 1999.6F/g at 1 A/g, with an excellent cycling stability of 97.2 % over 5000 cycles at 10 A/g. An asymmetric supercapacitor MnMoO4/Ni(OH)2//AC exhibited a good energy density of 60.2 W-h/kg at 800 W/kg. Hence, the MnMoO4/Ni(OH)2 electrode material is a potential candidate for the design of high-performance next-generation supercapacitors.
