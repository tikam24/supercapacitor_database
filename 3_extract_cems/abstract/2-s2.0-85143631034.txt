Demand for energy is steadily increasing due to the ever-increasing population growth, changing lifestyle as well as the depleting natural resources. The result is the increase in the cost of conventional energy devices. Nanotechnology via the application of tailor-made nanomaterials has brought in revolutionary changes in the design and fabrication of various energy storage devices. There have been reports of increased efficiency, decreased cost because of which there has been an enhanced market growth of the energy storage devices. Immense research activities are focused on the fabrication of electrode materials having precise nano-dimensions and morphologies, fabrication of cost-effective storage devices and methods to enhance efficiency. Composite materials based on carbon, metal oxide and polymer-based nanomaterials have been used for fabrication of electrode materials. Nanosized particles in such composites have brought about enhanced material properties as compared to their bulk counterparts, which in turn has contributed to their improved energy storage efficiency. But despite the success attained due to nanotechnological interventions, some of the limiting factors identified that have put a restraint in the demand and market growth of applied nanomaterials for energy capture are related to toxic processes involved during the synthesis of nanomaterials and during the application process. An overview of different nanomaterials used till date for fabrication of electrodes (with special focus on supercapacitors) will be addressed in this study. While the focus is in addressing the advantages of the use of nanomaterials and their composites, the study will also highlight the challenges associated during the fabrication and application in energy devices. It is expected that an update of such literature will benefit those undergoing research on nanotechnology and renewable energy technology.
