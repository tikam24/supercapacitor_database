Abstract: Potential of mechanochemical methods has been studied as applied to the development of promising materials of electrodes for supercapacitors with MeOx/C composition (Me = Mo, Mn, V, Bi, Sb, Tb, Cd, and Pb; C = graphite). Optimal procedures have been elaborated for mechanical activation and pressing of pellets. The properties of activated systems have been studied by several methods: X-ray diffraction, adsorption (determination of BET specific surface area and porosity), electron microscopy, and measurements of conductivity and capacity. It has been shown that, under the selected activation conditions, metal oxide/carbon nanosized composites are formed with a large specific surface area (as large as 100 m2/g) and a rather high porosity. At the same time, no chemical reactions occur between the components. The large values of the specific surface area and porosity remain preserved when pellets are pressed. MoO3/5С, MnO2/5С, and V2O5/5С systems have turned out to be most promising. The resistance of these systems amounts to several tens and hundreds ohms per centimeter. For the MoO3/5С system, cyclic voltammetric measurements carried out in an electrochemical cell in the presence of H2SO4 as an electrolyte have yielded the specific capacity of the material equal to 36 µF/cm2.
