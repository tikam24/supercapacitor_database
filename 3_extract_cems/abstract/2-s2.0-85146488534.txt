In recent years, graphene has been widely utilised as a supercapacitor electrode, and doping heteroatom on graphene is reported to enhance the pseudocapacitance of the electrode materials significantly resulting in a high energy density. However, the relationship and charge storage mechanism of a so-called ‘synergistic effect’ between those doped atoms including oxygen-, nitrogen-, and sulphur-doping on supercapacitor performances remain inscrutable. In this study, machine learning models are used to predict the capacitance of heteroatom-doped graphene-based supercapacitors and establish the effects of heteroatom-doping. Trained artificial neural network can accurately predict the capacitance of the electrode, drawing the best synthesis conditions for the heteroatom-doped graphene. Furthermore, we successfully demonstrate the synergistic effect that arises from co-doping nitrogen, sulphur, and locate the optimised region for N/S-co-doping with high capacitance, and high retention rate. Machine learning methods allow us to consider a much larger space of heteroatom-doping combinations to maximise the supercapacitor performances and provide a useful guideline for co-doping graphene-based supercapacitors.
