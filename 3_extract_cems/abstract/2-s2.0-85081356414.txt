Energy storage devices in fiber shape are of great interest due to their promising applications in wearable devices, multifunctional electronics, medical implants, and renewable energy. Fiber-shaped supercapacitors (SCs) are one form of fiber-shaped energy storage device and they have been studied extensively because of their good mechanical properties, extraordinary power density, potentially high energy density, and, most importantly, their structural advantages that can be applied to many scenarios. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, and their assemblies could be made into fibers that exhibit outstanding properties compared to traditional carbon fiber. Those fibers have demonstrated great potential in their application as fiber-shaped SCs. This chapter discusses the synthesis, processing, and performance of fiber-like SC devices based on CNT, graphene, and their derivatives.
