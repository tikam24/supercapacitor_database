This article analysis the bidirectional operation of the so called Isolated Efficient Wide Range Converter (I-EWiRaC), equipped with synchronous rectification, including small signal modelling and controller design. The converter is used in fuel-cell-based back-up systems, with ultra capacitors (UC) as intermediated energy storage between the fuel cell and the power converter. Earlier, an additional converter was used to charge the UC to the required DC voltage. The presented idea can improving the system efficiency and reliability and reduce overall system costs.
