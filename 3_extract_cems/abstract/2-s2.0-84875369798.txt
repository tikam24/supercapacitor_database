Graphene-containing carbon aerogel was prepared by a sol-gel polymerization of resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) method using polyethyleneimine (PEI)-modified chemically exfoliated grapheme oxide, and its electrochemical performance as an electrode for supercapacitor was examined. The effect of PEI in the preparation of RFGO (resorcinol-formaldehyde and graphene oxide) solution on the physicochemical and electrochemical properties of graphene-containing carbon aerogel (CAPG) was investigated. For comparison, graphene-containing carbon aerogel was prepared using PEI-free graphene oxide (CAG). Graphene-free carbon aerogel (CA) was also prepared. CAPG showed the highest BET surface area (792 m2/g) and the largest pore volume (1.64 cm3/g) with well-developed porous structure. Various electrochemical measurements revealed that CAPG showed high specific capacitance (205 F/g), low equivalent series resistance (0.55 ), and superior capacitive behavior. The PEI-modified graphene oxide played an important role in enhancing physicochemical properties and supercapacitive electrochemical performance of CAPG. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
