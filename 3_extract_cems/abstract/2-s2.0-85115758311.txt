The present article describes a simple and accessible method for designing and fabricating a flexible electrode based on carbon nanotubes and iron oxide (OH) nanopetals for foldable hybrid capacitor applications. The FeO(OH)/CNTs composite was fabricated and directly furnished over the bendable carbon cloth (CC) through a single-step hydrothermal approach to get the binder-free and flexible electrode. The FeO(OH)/CNTs@CC electrode had a significantly greater specific capacity (1016 Cg-1) than the FeO(OH)@CC electrode (741 Cg-1) because of its hybrid composition, better electronic conductivity, and nanoarchitecture. The hydrothermally synthesized FeO(OH)/CNTs@CC electrode also had excellent cycling properties because it retained a specific capacity of 93.7% after 4500 GCD cycles in an aqueous electrolyte. The electrode of the composite sample shows an extraordinary rate-activity and maintains a specific capacity of 81.2%, even if the current density is 15 times greater. The unique performance of the FeO( OH)/CNT-based electrode lies in its hybrid composition, flexible design, nano-architecture, binder-free support, porous structure, and lower specific resistivity. Our FeO (OH)/CNTs@CC electrode, thanks to its binder-free and flexible design, has better supercapacitive ability. Hence, it is suitable for practical applications in hybrid capacitors.
