TiO2 nanotube arrays (TiO2 NTAs) were prepared by anodization method. The asprepared TiO2 NTAs were annealed at 450 °C for 3 h transforming amorphous TiO2 to anatase TiO2. The inner diameter and tube length of synthesized TiO2 NTAs are approximately 100 nm and 1.0 μm, respectively. Electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC) was fabricated using TiO2 NTAs as electrodes with 6 M KOH electrolyte. The internal resistance of the EDLC is relatively low (3.8 - 6.5 Ω) depending on the operating temperature. This work confirmed experimentally the use of TiO2 NTAs as EDLC electrodes.
