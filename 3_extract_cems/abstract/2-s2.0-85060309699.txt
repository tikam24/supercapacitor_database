In a battery ultra-capacitor (UC) hybrid energy storage system (HESS) for an electric vehicle (EV), one of the most important roles is played by the dc-dc converter interfacing these two sources and the drive-train. This paper proposes a quad-active bridge (QAB) converter as the on-board power electronic interface of a HESS for EV. Battery, ultracapacitor and drive-train are connected to three of the four ports while the fourth port has the provision to connect to a 380 V DC grid for charging. Power can be transferred among all the ports hence the storage elements of the system can be utilized in a vehicle to grid (V2G) scenario. The paper discusses the power transfer capability, modeling and control of the QAB converter based on-board EV charger. Further, a power management scheme is devised for the said HESS. Simulation and experimental studies are done to validate the performance of the system and the results are given.
