A Li-ion hybrid supercapacitor (Li-HSCs), an integrated system of a Li-ion battery and a supercapacitor, is an important energy-storage device because of its outstanding energy and power as well as long-term cycle life. In this work, we propose an attractive material (a mesoporous anatase titanium dioxide/carbon hybrid material, m-TiO2-C) as a rapid and stable Li+ storage anode material for Li-HSCs. m-TiO2-C exhibits high specific capacity (∼198 mA h g-1 at 0.05 A g-1) and promising rate performance (∼90 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1) with stable cyclability, resulting from the well-designed porous structure with nanocrystalline anatase TiO2 and conductive carbon. Thereby, it is demonstrated that a Li-HSC system using a m-TiO2-C anode provides high energy and power (∼63 W h kg-1, and ∼4044 W kg-1).
