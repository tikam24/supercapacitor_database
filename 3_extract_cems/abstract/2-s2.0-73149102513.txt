Co3O4 nanorods have been successfully synthesized by thermal decomposition of the precursor prepared via a facile and efficient microwave-assisted hydrothermal method, using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) with ordered chain structures as soft template for the first time. The obtained Co3O4 was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and electrochemical measurements. The results demonstrate that the as-synthesized nanorods are single crystalline with an average diameter of about 20 to 50 nm and length up to several micrometers. Preliminary electrochemical studies, including cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, are carried out in 6 M KOH electrolyte. Specific capacitance of 456 F g-1 for a single electrode could be achieved even after 500 cycles, suggesting its potential application in electrochemical capacitors. This promising method could provide a universal green chemistry approach to synthesize other low-cost and environmentally friendly transition metal hydroxide or oxide.
