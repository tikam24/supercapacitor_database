Flexible and asymmetric fibered-supercapacitor (AFS) has recently attracted increasing interests, due to versatilities of the device design and its potential applications in wearable electronics. However, its relatively poor performances are still limited practical applications. Herein, due to high capacitance resulting form the redox character of the unique Co3O4@PPy core-shell nanorod arrays, an AFS is fabricated using these materials as the positive electrode and active carbon fiber (ACF) as the negative electrode. Especially, the large work function difference between Co3O4@PPy core-shell nanorod and ACF help the AFS to exhibit a wide potential window of 1.5 V and a high areal capacitance of 1.02 F cm−2. As a result, the AFS exhibits excellent supercapacitive performances with a high energy density of 1.151 mW h cm−2 at a power density of 1.15 mW cm−2 and a perfect stability after 10,000 cycles at a current density of 50 mA cm−2, meanwhile, the AFS shows good flexibility and could withstand the bending test. The remarkable electrochemical and flexible properties of AFS can be extended to the fabrication of flexible wearable micro energy storage devices.
