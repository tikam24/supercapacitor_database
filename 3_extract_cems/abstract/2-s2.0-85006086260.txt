New solutions for electrochemical supercapacitors are currently sought to complement or even replace conventional battery elements. This report presents a novel and simple approach to fabricate a polyaniline (PANI)/poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) composite with KOH electrode materials. The fabrication procedure is simple (i.e., a thermal treatment performed in air at low temperature) and potentially suitable for large-scale applications of supercapacitors. The areal capacitance of the liquid device is 753 mF cm−2 with a mass loading of 20 mg cm−2 and the highest energy density is 108 μWh cm−2 with a power density of 6.8 mW cm−2. The areal capacitance of the all-solid-state device is 671 mF cm−2 with a mass loading of 20 mg cm−2 and the highest energy density is 75 μWh cm−2 with a power density of 5 mW cm−2. Both the liquid device and all-solid-state device based on the PANI/PVDF composite with KOH have good cycling stability. In particular, the newly developed, highly flexible all-solid-state supercapacitor showed only 4 % decrease in specific capacitance after 10 000 cycles; this is very competitive among recently reported research. Moreover, the new supercapacitor device is extremely light in weight and highly flexible in its structure. All of these unique characteristics make this novel supercapacitor suitable and innovative for flexible energy storage.
