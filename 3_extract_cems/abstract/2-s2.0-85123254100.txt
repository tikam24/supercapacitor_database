Nickel–cobalt tellurides are deemed as promising electrode materials for energy storage devices due to their superior conductivity and theoretical specific capacitance. Here, NiCoTe2 was successfully fabricated on carbon cloth by facile electrodeposition and hydrothermal synthesis, which can directly serve as a binderless electrode. The NiCoTe2 with interconnected nanosheet arrays on a conductive carbon substrate showed a high specific capacitance (924 F/g at 1 A/g) and robust long-term cycling stability (89.6% retention after 5000 cycles). In addition, the assembled NiCoTe2//activiated carbon hybrid supercapacitor achieved a high energy and power density with a short charging time (42.26 Wh/kg at a power density of 760.96 W/kg). This work provides a novel idea to produce bimetallic nickel–cobalt telluride nanosheet array electrodes for high-performance hybrid supercapacitors.
