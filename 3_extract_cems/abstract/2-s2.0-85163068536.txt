This paper spotlights the application of the water cycle algorithm (WCA) optimized fractional order (FO) PID (FOPID) controller for regulating the frequency of interconnected power systems (IPS). A dual area hydro-thermal (DAHT) system with geothermal power plant (GTPP) integration in area-1 is considered and put forward the investigation upon laying the perturbation of 10% step load (SLP) on area-1. However, the efficacy of the presented FOPID controller is revealed with the performances of PI, PID, PID plus double derivative (PIDD). Further territory control approach of supercapacitors (SCs) and Thyristor controlled series compensator (TCSC) is established in this work to attain performance improvement under significant load perturbations. Simulation results reveal the improvement in IPS dynamical behaviour with the presented control strategy. At last, the robustness of presented secondary and territory mechanisms is validated by conducting the sensitivity analysis.
