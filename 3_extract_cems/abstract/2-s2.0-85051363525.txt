To meet the demand of high-energy density supercapacitors, development of suitable electrode material with a wide potential window and high specific capacitance is most important. In this report, we have synthesized V2O5-PANI nanocomposite through in-situ intercalation and polymerization reaction of aniline with V2O5, which shows a wide potential window as well as high specific capacitance. XRD, SEM and FTIR have been used to characterize the electrode materials. Their electrochemical activity and pseudocapacitive performances were investigated. The correlation between morphology and electrochemical performances were investigated which is a vital way for the selection of electrode materials. Due to the organic-inorganic compatibility, V2O5-PANI exhibits good electrochemical charge storage in a wide potential window of 1.6 V (ranging between âˆ’0.4 V to 1.2 V) with excellent stability of 84.2% capacitance retention after 5000 GCD cycles. Moreover, asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled V2O5-PANI composite and NiMn2O4 electrodes which yield remarkable energy and power density.
