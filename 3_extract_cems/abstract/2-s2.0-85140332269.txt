Energy shortage imposes major global issues, and developing new energy storage devices has become extremely urgent. Because supercapacitors (SCs) have been regarded as inspirational energy storage technologies. Herein, a novel rGO/PANI/MnO2 material was developed via a chemical reduction method for high-rate supercapacitors. The morphological structural & textural properties of fabricated nanostructure been investigated with X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope (SEM) & Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET). Electrochemical characterization of advanced nanocomposite contains specific capacitance (Csp) of 1613.7 F g−1 with enhanced rate capabilities and cycling stability retention of 99.7% with original capacity after 2000 cycles in 2 M KOH. Excellent efficiency of fabricated material is attributed due to small crystallite size, good morphology, and enhanced electrochemical surface area. This study emphasizes the good electrochemical performance of rGO/PANI/MnO2 on carbon fiber. The flake like morphology of the composite provides numerous electronic conduction routes, and more active sites refer it to be potential candidate for energy storage devices.
