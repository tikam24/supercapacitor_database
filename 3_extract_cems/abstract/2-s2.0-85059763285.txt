In this study, we adopted a simple method to synthesize a graphene-like-structured nanoporous carbon using a jute stick as a carbon precursor and studied the electrochemical properties for supercapacitors. The synthesized nanoporous carbon is composed of a graphene sheet-like network and amorphous carbon, and the ratio between these two components is tuned by the activation temperature. As the activation temperature is increased, the amorphous carbon is converted into a stable graphene-like network with a high specific surface area of 2396 m 2 /g, with a graphene sheet-like morphology and a highly ordered graphitic sp 2 carbon. For supercapacitor application, the nanoporous carbon is studied in aqueous as well as organic electrolytes, and the material shows excellent electrochemical performance in both the cases. It exhibited a high specific capacitance of 282 F/g and shows excellent rate capability with almost 70% capacitance retention at high current rates. Furthermore, the assembled symmetric supercapacitor displays a remarkable energy density of 20.6 W h kg -1 at a high power density of 33600 W kg -1 , and the benchmark studies revealed that the nanoporous carbon developed in the present study is better than the commercially available supercapacitive carbon (YP-50 F). A cylindrical supercapacitor device of capacitance 20 F with 2.7 V was fabricated using the nanoporous carbon electrode and tested for running practical devices. The excellent electrochemical performance of the electrode material can be attributed to the high electrical conductivity of the ordered graphene network coupled with high specific surface area and optimum pore size distribution of nanoporous carbon. These results demonstrate a facile, low-cost, and eco-friendly design of materials for energy storage applications.
