An all-biomaterial originated film supercapacitor has been successfully fabricated for the first time based on a unique three-dimensional bacterial cellulose (BC) derived electrode and a novel BC-based gel electrolyte. The obtained supercapacitor displays an excellent specific capacitance of 289 mF cm-2 and an improved solution resistance of 7 Î©.
