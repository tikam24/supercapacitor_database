This article proposes a multi-terminal grid interactive power conditioning module (PCM) for integration of hybrid distributed energy resources (DERs) within single phase residential premises, along with the Energy Storage Stacks (ESSs). The PCM also features hybrid bus layouts with medium-low voltage dc (MVdc) and low voltage dc (LVdc), for dc load integrations, and ac bus layout for single phase ac loads. The bi-directional MVdc and LVdc bus facilitate the effective power management and bus voltage support. It operates in all grid feeding, forming and supportive modes. The ESSs includes battery for system energy management and the supercapacitor for dc bus stabilization during transient conditions. The coordinated control of the PCM is capable of interfacing multiple DERs, dc&#x002F;ac loads, and ESS. The controllers in the PCM are self-adaptive to the frequent islanding situations and ensure the system stability with minimum use of sensory feedbacks. The PCM has loop type dc bus feeder to make residential system operative during transient&#x002F;faulty conditions. Simulation results verify the feasibility of the proposed system in all active and passive grid feeding; and grid forming modes and experimental setup is used to test the performance of the proposed PCM control through a single microcontroller.
