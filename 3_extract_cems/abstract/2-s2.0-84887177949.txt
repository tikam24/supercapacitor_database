This article presents the possibility of implementing a solution for efficiently using supercapacitors to power a CubeSat. The system achieves a full powered CubeSat only by using supercapacitors and no other energy backup method. There are presented both advantages and disadvantages of such implementation. The article shows how much energy and power is available for the entire system for a specific amount of time. The data was collected using COTS parts, digital oscilloscopes and DAQ systems. There was also created a demonstrative structure (both CAD and real) to simulate and test the real life integration of a supercapacitor within a CubeSat. The data figures only a small part of implementing a supercapacitor power system within a CubeSat, further research needed to be made in each individual case of CubeSat that will be developed using such power system method. The article provides some suggestions about the electronic parts that can be used to develop such system, and some approximations for being able to compute fast power and energy values when comparing different supercapacitors, or other parts that would directly influence the usage of such system.
