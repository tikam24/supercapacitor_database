It is demonstrated that, via V2O5 coating by low temperature atomic layer deposition and subsequent pyrolysis, ubiquitous cotton textile can readily turn into high-surface-area carbon textile fully decorated with pseudocapacitive VxOy/VC widely usable as electrodes of high-performance supercapacitor. It is found that carbothermic reduction of V2O5 (C + V2O5 → C′ + VC + CO/CO2(g)) leads to chemical/mechanical activation of carbon textile, thereby producing high-surface-area conductive carbon textile. In addition, sequential phase transformation and carbide formation (V2O5 → VxOy → VC) occurred by carbothermic reduction trigger decoration of the carbon textile with redox-active VxOy/VC. Thanks to the synergistic effect of electrical double layer and pseudocapacitance, the supercapacitors made of the hybrid carbon textile exhibit far better energy density (over 30-fold increase) with excellent cycling stability than the carbon textile simply undergone pyrolysis. The method can open up a promising and facile way to synthesize hybrid electrode materials for electrochemical energy storages possessing advantages of both electrical double layer and pseudocapacitive material.
