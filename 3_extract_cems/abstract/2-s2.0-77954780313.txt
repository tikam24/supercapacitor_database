In order to estimate the lifetime of supercapacitor in operation accurately and avoid the deficiency of the traditional electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement method, the method of acquiring supercapacitor's lifetime parameters using on-line identification was proposed. The classical equivalent circuit model of supercapacitor was chosen as the identification object, and its transfer function and the corresponding difference equation were derived. The least squares recurrence algorithm was adopted to identify the lifetime parameters, and the self correlation function test method was used to verify the identification result. The comparison between the experimental and simulation results illustrates the rationality of the model and the credibility of the identification result.
