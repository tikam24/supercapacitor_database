Developing hybrid materials with hierarchical combination of different active materials is of great importance to improve its whole electrochemical performance. This study reports a facial approach to fabricate Co3O4@NiMoO4 composites on Ni foam as an efficient supercapacitor electrode. The synthesized Co3O4@NiMoO4 composites show high areal capacitance of 3.61 F/cm2 at a current density of 2 mA/cm2. And âˆ¼101.3% of its initial capacitance was still retained after 9000 cycles. The outstanding electrochemical properties are attributed to the uniquely hierarchical nanostructure and the components' synergetic effect, showing great potential for energy storage applications.
