Two-dimensional (2D) Mo1.33C MXene renders great potential for energy storage applications and is mainly studied in the sulfuric acid (H2SO4) electrolyte. However, H2SO4 limits the electrode potential to 0.9 V for symmetric devices and 1.3 V for asymmetric devices. Herein, we explore the electrochemical behavior of Mo1.33C MXene in LiCl electrolyte. In comparison to H2SO4, LiCl electrolyte is a neutral salt with high solubility at room temperature and low hazardousness. The analysis shows a volumetric capacitance of 815 Fcm−3 at a scan rate of 2 mVs−1 with a large operating potential window of -1.2 to +0.3V (vs. Ag/AgCl). This is further exploited to construct MXene-based asymmetric supercapacitors Mo1.33C//MnxOn, and the electrochemical performance is evaluated in 5M LiCl electrolyte. Owing to the wide voltage widow of the Mo1.33C//MnxOn devices (2V) and high packing density of the electrodes, we have achieved a volumetric energy density of 58 mWh/cm3, a maximum power density of 31 Wcm−3 and retained 92% of the initial capacitance after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles at 10 A g−1. One of the main value propositions of this work, aside from the high energy density, is the outstanding columbic efficiency (100%), which ensures excellent cyclic stability and is highly desirable for practical applications.
