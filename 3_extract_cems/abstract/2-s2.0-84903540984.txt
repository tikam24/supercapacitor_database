Silicon carbide microsphere/birnessite-type MnOx (SiC/B-MnO x) composites were prepared by removal of a SiO2 layer with redox deposition of birnessite-type MnOx for supercapacitor electrode materials. The characterization studies showed that the birnessite-type MnOx in the composite was homogeneously deposited on the SiC surface. The capacitive properties of the as-prepared SiC/B-MnO x electrodes were measured in a three-electrode system using 1 M Na2SO4(aq) as the electrolyte. The SiC/B-MnO x(6) electrode, fabricated using a MnOx/SiC feeding ratio of 6:1, displayed a specific capacitance of 251.3 F g-1 at 10 mV s-1. Such excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to an increase in the electrical conductivity in the presence of silicon carbide, an increase in the effective interfacial area between MnOx and the electrolyte, and the contact area between MnOx and silicon carbide. The deposition of birnessite-type MnOx on a SiC surface may be a prospective fabrication technique for electrode materials for supercapacitors. Â© 2014 American Chemical Society.
