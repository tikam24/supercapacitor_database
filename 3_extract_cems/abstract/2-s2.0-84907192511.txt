This paper deals with the problem of controlling a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) for electric vehicles. The storage system consists of a fuel cell (FC), serving as the main power source, and a supercapacitor (SC), serving as an auxiliary power source. It also contains a power block for energy conversion consisting of a boost converter connected with the main source and a boost-buck converter connected with the auxiliary source. The converters share the same dc bus, which is connected to the traction motor through an inverter. These power converters must be controlled to meet the following requirements: 1) tight dc bus voltage regulation, 2) perfect tracking of the SC current to its reference, and 3) asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. A nonlinear controller is developed, on the basis of the system nonlinear model, making use of Lyapunov stability design techniques. The latter accounts for the power converters' large-signal dynamics and for the FC nonlinear characteristics. It is demonstrated using both a formal analysis and simulations that the developed controller meets all desired objectives.
