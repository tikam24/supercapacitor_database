Electrically conducting carbon nanofiber (CNF) composite mats are prepared by electrospinning blended solutions of graphene oxide and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and their electrochemical properties are investigated as electrodes of supercapacitors. A graphene oxide concentration of 5wt.% in a PAN polymer solution offers a large specific surface area and good conductivity after a carbonization process at 1000°C. The supercapacitor electrode prepared with 5wt.% graphene shows high specific capacitance, 146.62Fg-1, and high energy density, 14.83-19.44Whkg-1, at power densities ranging from 400 to 20,000Wkg-1 in a 6M KOH aqueous solution. © 2013 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.
