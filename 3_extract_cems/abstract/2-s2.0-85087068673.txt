A novel gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) which is based on new synthesized boron-containing monomer, benzyl methacrylate, 1 m LiClO4/N,N-dimethylformamidel liquid electrolyte solution is prepared through a one-step synthesis method. The boron-containing GPE (B-GPE) not only displays excellent mechanical behavior, favorable thermal stability, but also exhibits an outstanding ionic conductivity of 2.33 mS cm−1 at room temperature owing to the presence of anion-trapping boron sites. The lithium ion transference in this gel polymer film at ambient temperature is 0.60. Furthermore, the symmetrical supercapacitor which is fabricated with B-GPE as electrolyte and reduced graphene oxide as electrode demonstrates a broad potential window of 2.3 V. The specific capacitance of symmetrical B-GPE supercapacitors retains 90% after 3000 charge–discharge cycles at current density of 1 A g−1.
