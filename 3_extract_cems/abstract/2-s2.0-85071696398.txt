Lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) represent a new type of energy-storage devices, which have combined merits of high energy density Li-ion battery and high power density supercapacitor. Nevertheless, one significant challenge for LICs is the imbalanced kinetics between the fast capacitive cathode and relatively slow intercalation anode that limit the energy-storage performance. Here, the asymmetric LIC devices were developed based on a nitrogen-doped, carbonized zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) cathode and a three-dimensional, nano-network-structured, conversion reaction-based Ni/NiO/C anode. These nanostructures associated with both the cathode and anode enable rapid electron and ions transport in the LIC devices, which allows the asymmetric LICs to be operated on either high energy mode (energy density of 114.7 Wh/kg at power density of 98.0 W/kg) or high power mode (power density of 60.1 kW/kg at energy density of 17.6 Wh/kg). The device also exhibited long-term cycle stability with 87% capacitance retention after 12 000 cycles. These results demonstrate that the rational design of nanoporous electrode structures can deliver a balanced, high-performance-activated cZIF-8|Ni/NiO/C-based lithium-ion capacitor.
