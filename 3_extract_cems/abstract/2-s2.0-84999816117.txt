A facile, cost effective and additive-free successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) technique is demonstrated to develop layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and MnO2 (MnO2-RGOSILAR) on a stainless steel current collector, for designing light-weight and small size supercapacitor electrode. The transmission electron microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy images shows uniform distribution of RGO and MnO2 in the MnO2-RGOSILAR. The LbL (MnO2-RGOSILAR) demonstrates improved physical and electrochemical properties over the hydrothermally prepared MnO2-RGO (MnO2-RGOHydro). The electrochemical environment of MnO2-RGOSILAR is explained by constant phase element in the high frequency region, and a Warburg element in the low frequency region in the Z-View fitted Nyquist plot. The equivalent circuit of the MnO2-RGOHydro, displays the co-existence of EDL and constant phase element, indicating inhomogeneous distribution of MnO2 and RGO by the hydrothermal technique. An asymmetric supercapacitor device is designed with MnO2-RGOSILAR as positive electrode, and thermally reduced GO (TRGO) as negative electrode. The designed cell exhibits high energy density of ∼88 Wh kg−1, elevated power density of ∼23,200 W kg−1, and ∼79% retention in capacitance after 10,000 charge-discharge cycles.
