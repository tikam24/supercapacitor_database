An aqueous suspension of a reduced composite of graphene oxide and humic acid has been prepared and used as ink to print conductive films and electrodes for supercapacitors. The dry powders of the composite ink before and after hydrazine reduction were characterized by IR and Raman spectroscopies and XPS. The surface areas of the reduced composite measured using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and standard contact porosimetry (SCP) methods were 6.5 and 200 m2/g, respectively. Moreover, the composite thin films obtained by printing exhibited island-like character. Further, the specific capacitance and other electrochemical properties of the supercapacitor using the composite electrode were studied.
