This article reports the superior specific capacitance, energy, and power density of a nanofibrillated mesoporous carbon derived from an ionic liquid source (IFMC). It was concluded that high specific capacitance and good electrical conductivity were originated from contribution of nitrogen content of IFMC, also the interesting nanofibrillated structure. A specific capacitance of 235 F g-1 at a high discharge current of 5 A g-1 was estimated for IFMC-based electrode which is higher than the most reported capacitance for carbon materials. An excellent performance of the nanofibrillated mesoporous carbon along with proper concentration of nitrogen constituent in the carbonaceous framework is indicative for important effects of tuning the carbon nanostructure for energy storage applications.
