Transition metal sulfides/carbon nanocomposites are being extensively studied as electrode materials since a rationally designed structure incorporated with carbonaceous materials can eliminate pulverization caused by volume expansion during the cycling process and promote electron transport in the electrodes. Herein, we report a cobalt sulfide/multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) nanocomposite with a novel structure where MWCNTs penetrate through hollow Co3S4 quasi-polyhedra and form conductive networks. The preparation of this unique structure involves sulfurization of ZIF-67/MWCNT precursors via solvothermal process and subsequent crystallization by thermal annealing. With the employment of TEM 3D reconstruction technology, a panoramic view of the as-prepared nanocomposites is demonstrated and the structure is thoroughly confirmed. Moreover, the hollow Co3S4/MWCNT nanocomposites exhibit high specific capacity and excellent cyclic stability as electrodes for both lithium ion batteries and supercapacitors. They delivered specific capacity of 1281.2 mAh g-1 after 50 cycles at 200 mA g-1 and 976.5 mAh g-1 after 500 cycles at 2 A g-1. Also, they show a high capacitance of 638.5 F g-1 at current density of 30 A g-1 and capacitance retention of 78.98% after 5000 cycles.
