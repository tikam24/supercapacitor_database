In the present work, we describe the synthesis of Co-MOF/PANI composite from cobalt nitrate, 1,3,5-benzene tricarboxylic acid and aniline via in-situ chemical oxidative polymerization method. The formation of as-synthesized Co-MOF/PANI composite was confirmed by several spectral and analytical tools. The electrochemical performance of the synthesized composite was investigated as an electrode material for supercapacitor application by cyclic voltammetry (CV), Galvanostatic Charge-discharge (GCD) and Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) techniques. The specific capacitance of Co-MOF/PANI composite was found to be 504 Fg−1 at the current density of 1 Ag−1 by GCD studies and moreover it sustained 90% of its initial capacitance even after 5000 GCD cycles at 2 Ag−1 current density. The study revealed that Co-MOF/PANI composite can be applied as a potential electrode material in energy storage devices.
