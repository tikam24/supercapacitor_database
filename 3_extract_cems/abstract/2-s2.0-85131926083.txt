Nowadays the most probable issues are occurring in electronic fields, necessities of high energy storage devices for electronic automobiles, consumer electronics, and comprehensive power stations. Supercapacitors (SCs) play an essential role in energy storage areas. A pertinent active/electrode material is playing a major role to boost SCs' efficacy, chattels of active materials will increase SCs performance. Carbonaceous materials and conducting polymers are extensively used as individual or composite electrodes. Scientists are attentively working for the progress of ground-breaking electrode materials to solve the issues in conversational capacitors (energy and power density) with outstanding performance. An in-depth examination of conducting polymer-carbsonaceous material composite are well studied. The synergic effects of conducting polymercarbonaceous material composite offer a wide range of applications in electrical and electronic fields. In this review, we have discussed the recent development of active electrode materials in SCs by compiling the recent literature. The overview of rapid developments, structures, and their electrochemical performance in SCs device application.
