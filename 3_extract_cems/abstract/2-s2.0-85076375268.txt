At present, developing a simple, inexpensive, and scalable technology to fabricate an energy storage system remains a challenge. In this study, MWCNTs/FeNi3/PANI nanocomposites were prepared by means of in situ polymerization. The morphologies and structure were characterized by the application of various spectral and analytical techniques. When the newly fabricated MWCNTs/FeNi3/PANI-20 ternary composite was taken as supercapacitor electrode, the specific capacitance was 398.1 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. In addition, the assembled symmetric supercapacitors displayed not only an excellent cycling property (80.9% capacitance retention after 2000 charge/discharge cycles) but also a remarkable energy and power density (9.1 Wh kg−1 and 500 W kg−1). As revealed by the results, the electrochemical properties of MWCNTs/FeNi3/PANI composites can be improved by the synergistic action of various components through the rational selection of electrode materials.
