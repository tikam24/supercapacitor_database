Carbon materials derived from marine waste have been drawing attention for supercapacitor applications. In this work, chitins from squid and prawn marine wastes were used as carbon precursors for further application as electrodes for energy storage devices. Chitins were obtained through a deproteinization method based on enzymatic hydrolysis as an alternative to chemical hydrolysis as commonly presented in the literature. The obtained porous carbons were characterized using a BET surface area analyzer to determine the specific surface area and pore size, as well as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), to characterize their morphology, composition, and structure. The electrochemical characterization was performed using a glassy carbon (GC) electrode modified with marine waste-based porous carbons as the working electrode through cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge using ethaline, a choline chloride-based deep eutectic solvent (DES), as an eco-friendly and sustainable electrolyte. Squid and prawn chitin-based carbons presented a surface area of 149.3 m2 g−1 and 85.0 m2 g−1, pore volume of 0.053 cm3 g−1 and 0.029 cm3 g−1, and an associated specific capacitance of 20 and 15 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, respectively. Preliminary studies were performed to understand the effect of -OH groups on the chitin-based carbon surface with DES as an electrolyte, as well as the effect of aqueous electrolytes (1 mol L−1 sulphuric acid (H2SO4) and 1 mol L−1 potassium hydroxide (KOH)) on the capacitance and retention of the half-cell set up. It is provided, for the first time, the use of chitin-based carbon materials obtained through a one-step carbonization process combined with an eco-friendly DES electrolyte for potential application in energy storage devices.
