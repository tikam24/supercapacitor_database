In this work, we propose a systematic study of the electrochemical behavior of an ultra-thin Lithium phosphorus oxinitride (LiPON) layer used as thin film ion conductor for inorganic solid-state on-chip supercapacitors. Metal-Ion conductor-Metal structures using blocking electrodes have been used to investigate the areal capacity variation with (i) LiPON ionic conductivity, (ii) electrochemical kinetics, (iii) and the potential window. The fabricated devices exhibit box-shape cyclic voltammograms, typical capacitance values as high as 50 μF cm−2 at scan rates below 100 V s−1 over 105 cycles and a high nominal voltage of 3 V. The obtained results highlight the very high potential of 2D and 3D LiPON based supercapacitors for on-chip power storage.
