Nowadays, the rapid development and demand of high-performance, lightweight, low cost, portable/wearable electronic devices in electrical vehicles, aerospace, medical systems, etc., strongly motivates researchers towards advanced electrochemical energy storage (EES) devices and technologies. The electrolyte is also one of the most significant components of EES devices, such as batteries and supercapacitors. In addition to rapid ion transport and the stable electrochemical performance of electrolytes, great efforts are required to overcome safety issues due to flammability, leakage and thermal instability. A lot of research has already been completed on solid polymer electrolytes, but they are still lagging for practical application. Over the past few decades, ionic liquids (ILs) as electrolytes have been of considerable interest in Li-ion batteries and supercapacitor applications and could be an important way to make breakthroughs for the next-generation EES systems. The high ionic conductivity, low melting point (lower than 100◦C), wide electrochemical potential window (up to 5–6 V vs. Li+/Li), good thermal stability, non-flammability, low volatility due to cation–anion combinations and the promising self-healing ability of ILs make them superior as “green” solvents for industrial EES applications. In this short review, we try to provide an overview of the recent research on ILs electrolytes, their advantages and challenges for next-generation Li-ion battery and supercapacitor applications.
