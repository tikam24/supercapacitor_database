This paper presents a set of experimental investigations related to the dynamic behavior of supercapacitors (SCs). The experimentally observed results are then used as inputs for the development of an improved version of one of the most common SC RC-equivalent circuit models. The key improvement concerns the accurate modeling of the diffusion phenomenon of the SC residual charge during charging/discharging and rest phases. The experimental procedure needed for evaluating the parameters of the proposed model is also given. The accuracy of the obtained model is then experimentally validated for different cycles characterized by different dynamics. Â© 1982-2012 IEEE.
