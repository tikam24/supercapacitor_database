Interfacial crosslinking is a useful and unique method for preparing films with desired structures. Here, a crosslinked structure film (Rc-mProdot) is obtained from the linear polymer (mProdot) with cross-linkable functional side-chains via the liquid/liquid interfacial crosslinking. Transmission phenomenon and Tyndall effect reflected the assembling progress of Rc-mProdot film. FT-IR and SEM data prove the formation of the desired cross-linked polymer film with loose structure precisely. Significantly, the desirable Rc-mProdot film not only retains the original color and similar electrochemical behaviors to these of the spin-coated mProdot polymer film, but also exhibits improved electrochromic and capacitance properties including a faster electrochromic discoloring time (0.26 s), larger capacitance (increasing by 60% than Rc-mProdot film) and a better charge-discharge stability (retaining 79.1% after 600 cycles). This work provides a simple and efficient approach to liquid/liquid interfacial Schiff-base reaction to construct conjugated polymer films with loose structure towards improving electrochromic and supercapacitor performance and applications.
