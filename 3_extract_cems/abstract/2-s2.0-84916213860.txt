A novel energy storage system with super-capacitors (SCs) which based on combined bidirectional DC/DC converter (BDC) was studied. The inconsonance of low monomer voltage rating of the SCs and the high voltage applications can be mitigated in this system. A double closed-loop control strategy for the combined BDC based ESS was presented, which decouples the inductance current control and the BDC voltage sharing control. Furthermore, the energy management strategy which is based on the DC bus voltage and the state-of-charge of the SCs was also proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategies was validated with the experimental results.
