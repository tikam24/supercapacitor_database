In this study, ordered mesoporous carbon imbedded with nanosized tungsten oxide (WO3-x) was employed as the anode material in lithium ion batteries. The nanosized tungsten oxide filled the small mesopores in the ordered mesoporous carbon while maintaining the ordered pore structure. When employed in a lithium ion battery as an anode, an improved volumetric capacity (384 mAh cm-3), initial Coulomb efficiency (36.8%), and a high rate performance (36.8%) were observed. This implied an improved performance when compared with ordered mesoporous carbon without tungsten oxide.
