Composite electrodes that possess both appropriate integration and reasonable structures are needed to provide eminent electrochemical performance in energy storage devices. At this work, an innovative electrode material with a composite structure of Ni3S2/NiV-LDH nanosheets fixed on the reduced graphene oxide/Ni Foam (rGO/NF) was fabricated by a convenient two-step hydrothermal process. The intriguing compositional/componental advantages significantly facilitate the efficient penetration of the electrolytes and increase active sites of redox reactions in energy storage application. The Ni3S2/NiV-LDH/rGO/NF electrode reaches a standout specific capacitance of 3004.3 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and a superb cycle stability with 92.2% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles. Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor (Ni3S2/NiV-LDH/rGO/NF//AC) was also assembled, achieving a high energy density of 59.4 Wh kg−1 at 852.3 W kg−1 and favourable cycle life, where 98.3% of the capacitance was retained after 8000 cycles. These consequences show that Ni3S2/NiV-LDH/rGO/NF composite is a potential electrode material in the future.
