Hybrid supercapacitors are the most recent energy storage systems in the world. Here we present a new hybrid supercapacitor FeMoO4/CuO as promising energy storage system. The hybrid FeMoO4/CuO was successfully synthesized using hydrothermal and wet impregnation methods. The morphological of the as-prepared FeMoO4/CuO was confirmed by transmission electron microscopes (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) tools. Our results indicate that the hybrid FeMoO4/CuO has significantly higher specific capacitance (534 F g−1) compared to FeMoO4 (110 F g−1) and CuO (210 F g−1). In addition, the initial capacitance for FeMoO4/CuO is retained about 95.4% even after 1000 cycles. Furthermore, the merging between FeMoO4 and CuO increases the surface area and pore volume of the as-prepared hybrid. Finally, using this as-prepared hybrid significantly increases the specific capacitance of supercapacitor.
