We conducted experiments in producing nitrogen-doped carbon foam using pomelo peels as a raw material. Pomelos are a citrus fruit similar in appearance to grapefruit, and native to South and Southeast Asia. Specifically, we fabricated nitrogen-doped pomelo peel derived carbon foam (N-PPCF) by using an ammonia gas treatment. The as-prepared N-PPCF had a high specific surface area of 1,218.5 m2 g–1, an average pore size of 1.36 nm, and a pore volume value of 0.50 cm3 g–1. Additionally, the N-PPCF had a nitrogen content of 8.1%, allowing for a high specific capacitance of 150.1 F g–1 at a density of 1.0 A g–1. Even at 4 A g–1, the N-PPCF still maintained an ideal capacitance of 115.6 F g–1. Ultimately, we believe that nitrogen doped carbon foam is a potential method for treating pomelo peels, and that N-PPCF can function as a potential binder-free supercapacitor electrode.
