As far as the current situation is concerned, the energy storage of supercapacitors is still a problem that is widely concerned and urgently needed to be solved in the industry. In this paper, we successfully prepared a multi-dimensional zinc-cobalt-molybdenum hybrid metal oxide nanocomposite as a high energy density supercapacitor device on nickel foam by hydrothermal method. Below, we will abbreviate the zinc-cobalt-molybdenum hybrid metal oxide as Zn-Co-Mo. The morphology and electrochemical properties of Zn-Co-Mo/Ni composites were systematically studied. Compared with ZnCo2O4/Ni or CoMoO4/Ni composites, it showed higher electrochemical energy storage performance. For example, when the current density is 60 mA cmâˆ’2, the Zn-Co-Mo electrode shows a high specific capacitance of 384 F/g. After 5000 cycles, the capacitance of the Zn-Co-Mo composite was kept at 81.25%, which indicates that the Zn-Co-Mo composite electrode is feasible as an electrode material in the field of supercapacitors.
