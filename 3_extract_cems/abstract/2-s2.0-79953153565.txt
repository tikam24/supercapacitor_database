In a traditionally embarked system the management of embarked electrical energy needs a storage device for peak load shaving, in order to compensate for the intrinsic limitations of the main energy source. The use of supercapacitors for this storage system is quite suitable, especially in regard to their energetic properties: appropriate characteristics, direct storage, and easy control by power electronic conversion. This paper deals with the use of supercapacitors as a storage device in electrical and hybrid vehicle. The different supercapacitors models will be given, the mathematical calculation for sizing this device and an example of their control will also be presented.
