In this paper the performance analysis of wind system connected to grid along with battery and Ultracapacitor (UC) is presented. The variation in battery discharge rate for varying wind speed has been shown. The battery-UC combination is used to smooth wind power output and to control battery discharge rate. The control schemes are employed for controlling and operating the wind based power generation system with storage in grid connected mode. The system performance for different wind speeds, load change is given. The charging of battery and ultracapacitor using wind power is presented. The dispatchable ability of wind system with storage is shown in this work. The power sharing between grid and inverter is also shown with simulation results.
