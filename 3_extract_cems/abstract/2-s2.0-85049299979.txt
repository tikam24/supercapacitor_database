A facile method of directly growing NiCo2O4 hybrid hierarchical nanostructures on nickel foam is developed by a hydrothermal and post heat-treatment method without using any surfactant, stabilizer or organic binder. Due to the rich porous nanostructures, relative large specific surface area (177.71 m2 g−1) of the NiCo2O4 hybrid structure and efficient electrical contact with the conductive nickel substrate, the NiCo2O4–NF hybrid electrode shows significantly enhanced specific capacitance (3105.1 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), outstanding rate properties (1621.3 F g−1 at 20 A g−1 and 1191.5 F g−1 at 50 A g−1) and high energy density (95.26 Wh kg−1). This facile and effective design method opens up new possibilities for producing binder-free electrodes in high-performance electrochemical supercapacitors and miniaturized devices.
