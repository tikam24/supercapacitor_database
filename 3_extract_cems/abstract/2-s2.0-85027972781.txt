Herein, hybrid energy storages (HESs) of battery-type Ni(OH)2 and supercapacitor-type electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) were fabricated using potassium ferricyanide (K3Fe(CN)6) as a redox additive in KOH electrolyte for high specific energy and power applications. The as-fabricated HES of Ni(OH)2//ERGO in a single coin cell (CR2016) size in 4 mM K3[Fe(CN)]6 in 1 M KOH provides a wide working voltage up to 1.6 V and exhibits a maximum specific energy of 85 W h kg-1 at the specific power of 726 W kg-1 with a high capacity retention over 88% after 10000 cycles, while the HES in 1 M KOH provides a lower maximum specific energy of 61 W h kg-1. A Fe(CN)6 3-/Fe(CN)6 4- redox couple has a great electrochemical reversibility in nature since Fe(CN)6 3- can obtain electrons from Ni(OH)2 through the reduction process and Fe(CN)6 4- can donate electrons to NiOOH for the oxidation process. The HES reported herein may be practically used for high energy applications.
