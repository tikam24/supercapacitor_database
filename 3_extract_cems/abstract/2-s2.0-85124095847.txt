An energy management strategy (EMS) is responsible for distributing the power between the electrochemical power sources of a fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle (FCHEV) with a view to minimizing the hydrogen consumption and maximizing the lifetime of the system. However, the energetic characteristics of the electrochemical devices (fuel cell, battery, and supercapacitor) are time-varying due to the influence of ageing, and different ambient and operating conditions. Any drift in the characteristics of the power sources can lead to the mismanagement of an EMS. According to the literature, ignorance of health adaptation can increase the hydrogen consumption from almost 6.5%â€“24% depending on the EMS. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a strategy which is aware of the actual state of the components while conducting the power split. Health monitoring techniques are potential candidates to deal with the uncertainties arising from the mentioned factors. In this respect, this paper first puts forward a concise review of the general modeling techniques which are essential for developing precise health monitoring techniques and in turn EMSs. Subsequently, the utilized methods for prognosis, diagnosis, and health state tracking of each of the mentioned power sources in a FCHEV are introduced. Then, a new taxonomy for the classification of the EMSs based on their health-awareness is proposed based on which three categories of prognostic-based, diagnostic-based, and systemic EMSs are formed. Each category is thoroughly explained, and a state-of-the-art review of these health-aware EMSs is presented. Finally, future perspectives of this new line of research and development are discussed before drawing a conclusion.
