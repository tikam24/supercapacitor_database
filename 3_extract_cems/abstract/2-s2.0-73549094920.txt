Carbon aerogel was prepared by polycondensation of resorcinol and formaldehyde using sodium carbonate as a catalyst with a resorcinol to catalyst ratio of 500. Co-doped carbon aerogels were then prepared by an impregnation method with a variation of cobalt content (1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15 wt.%), and their performance for supercapacitor electrode was investigated by measurement of specific capacitance in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte at a scan rate of 10 mV/s. Among the samples prepared, 7 wt.% Co-doped carbon aerogel showed the highest capacitance (100 F/g) and stable cyclability. The enhanced capacitance of Co-doped carbon aerogel was attributed to the faradaic redox reactions of cobalt oxide. On the basis of this result, 7 wt.% Cu-, Fe-, Mn-, and Zn-doped carbon aerogels were also prepared by an impregnation method for use as a supercapacitor electrode. Among the metal-doped carbon aerogels, Mn-doped carbon aerogel showed the highest capacitance (107 F/g) while Cu- and Fe-doped carbon aerogels exhibited the most stable cyclability.
