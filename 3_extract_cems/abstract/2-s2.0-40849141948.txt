Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) has been successfully electropolymerized using a purified 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([bmim][BF4]) as both the growth medium and the supporting electrolyte. The electrochemical performance of the PEDOT thin film was investigated in 1 mol L-1 H2SO4 solution. It possesses nearly ideal capacitive property, and its specific capacitance is about 130 F g-1. Compared with other conducting polymers, enhanced cycling lifetime (up to 70,000 cycles), which is close to that of active carbon materials, was observed on repetitive redox cycling.
