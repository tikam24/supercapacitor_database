The relevance of the study is the need for the implementation of energy saving policy on remote oil production areas, where there is a possibility of utilization of associated gas as a fuel in a distributed generation (DG). The use of energy storage systems (ESS) complete with a natural-gas-fueled reciprocating-engine power plant equipped with a synchronous generator (SG) allows you to prevent load rise and frequency dip of the alternating current under disturbing loads, as well as to maintain the required level of residual voltage during short circuits in the grid.
