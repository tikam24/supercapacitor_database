In this study, spheres composed of NiCo2O4 @Co3O4 as a supercapacitor electrode material were designed using the hydrothermal pathway. The micromorphology of the sample was changed by adding thiourea and carbon nanospheres, thus improving its electrochemical properties. With the addition of thiourea and carbon nanospheres to NiCo2O4 @Co3O4, it was observed that its micromorphology changed from sheets to sea urchin-like needles, showing excellent specific capacitance (822.36 F/g at 1 A/g) and cyclic stability of 84% after 3000 cycles. This work provides new ideas for methods to change the micromorphological structure of electrode materials, with great application potential in supercapacitors.
