N−O−S self-doped porous carbons (FAKC-T), possessing considerable specific surface areas (SSA, 640–873 m2 g−1), hierarchical porous structures and high heteroatom contents (14.4–19.4 at.%), were prepared via direct carbonization of biochemical fulvic acid potassium. FAKC-T undergoes relatively rapid decomposition of O-containing groups (O–I/O–II species) as carbonization temperature increases from 700 to 800 °C, which is closely related to mesopore evolution. Significant decrease in N content from FAKC-800 to FAKC-900, mainly due to the decomposition of N-6/N-5 species, results in remarkably increased micropore volume. FAKC-900 simultaneously possesses relatively high SSA and improved electrical conductivity based on its much higher sp2-carbon content. FAKC-800 exhibits larger specific capacitance at low current density than FAKC-900 and FAKC-700, which is attributed to the balance between effective SSA and heteroatom doping related to pseudocapacitance. FAKC-900 harvests an impressive rate capability of 82.1% from 0.25 to 10 A g−1 in 3 M KOH electrolyte. The supercapacitor based on FAKC-900 electrode delivers an energy density of 38.1 W h Kg−1 at 215.1 W kg−1 in ionic liquid electrolyte. It was found that there exists a critical N content value in the range of 4.4 to 6.1 at.% when evaluating the specific capacitance and rate capability of FAKC-T electrodes.
