Electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC) plays a major role in the area of energy storage devices. Still, efficient and long-lasting EDLCs using sustainable carbonaceous materials remain a challenge. In this research work, a novel and low-cost activated carbon soot has been derived from the sesamum indicum oil (sesame oil) using carbon obtained by flame synthesis method and further activated with ZnCl2 and KOH in different wt %. The main facilitator to the electrode fabrication for EDLC was the agglomerated carbon nano-onions like porous carbon material derived from sesame oil. The structural morphology was studied and examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and infrared spectroscopy. BET characterization shows that sesame oil derived carbon soot activated with KOH in 1:2 wt% (SoACSK2) shows excellent porosity and high specific surface area 1158 m2 g−1. Electrochemical investigation was done using 0.5 M NaPF6 as an electrolyte and SoACSK2 shows maximum specific capacitance 94 F g−1 at 0.5 mA g−1 with maximum energy density of 10.5 Wh kg−1 and power density of 1350 W kg−1 having good durability over more than 2000 cycles.
