A reduced graphene oxide/multiwalled carbon nanotube (RGO/MWCNT) hybrid sandwiched film with different MWCNTs content was prepared by vacuum-assisted self-assembly from a complex dispersion of graphene oxide (GO) and MWCNTs followed by heat-treating at 200°C for 1 h in a vacuum oven to reduce the GO into RGO. The free-standing RGO/MWCNT hybrid sandwiched film before heat-treatment showed a layered structure with an entangled network of MWCNTs sandwiched between the GO sheets. This unique structure not merely contribute to remove the oxygen-containing groups in GO during the heat-treatment, but also decrease the defects for electron transfer between RGO layers, which enhances the electrochemical capacitive performances of graphene-based films. A specific capacitance up to 379 F/g was achieved based on RGO/MWCNT with 30 % MWCNTs mass fraction at 0.1 A/g in a 6 M KOH electrolyte. The excellent performance of RGO/MWCNT hybrid sandwiched film signifies the importance of controlling the surface chemistry and sandwiched nanostructure of graphene-based materials. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.
