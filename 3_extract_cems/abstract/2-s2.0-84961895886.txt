Present work explains the preparation of manganese incorporated cobalt oxide thin film electrodes on stainless steel by spray pyrolysis technique, via non-aqueous (methanolic) media. Structural, morphological and electrochemical characterizations of the prepared samples were made by means of XRD, SEM and electrochemical measurements. Structural elucidation confirms Co3O4 has face centred cubic and Mn3O4 has tetragonal body centred cubic structure with polycrystalline nature. Surface morphological observation shows the continuous semi porous film growth with spherical grains. Cyclic voltammetry reveals the mixed capacitive behaviour with maximum specific capacitance 605.35 F/g at the scan rate 1 mV/s in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Chronopotentiometric measurement gives energy density 33.5 Wh/kg, power density 2 kW/kg and Columbic efficiency 99.23%. Electrochemical impedance study was carried out in the frequency range 1 mHz to 1 MHz to see the internal resistance. Randles equivalent circuit was developed by using ZsimpWin software to search the circuitry parameters associated with the cell.
