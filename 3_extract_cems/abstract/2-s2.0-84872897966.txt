High and constant current charging and discharging is necessary to improve the precision of supercapacitor parameters measurment. In this paper, three topics are discussed for high-precision measurment of supercapacitor parameters. Firstly, the analysis of the principle of capacitance measurement was described. Secondly, a model of high and constant current control was presented. The model used in the system of supercapacitor parameters measurement was in order to ensure the constant-current accuracy. Finally, several software compensation methods were used to improve accuracy. And then, the experiment results between our system and the American Arbin Instrument Company's Super Capacitor Test System were compared. The system designed by us shows good performance of high precision measurement. Â© (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
