With the surging demand for flexible and portable electronic devices featuring high energy and power density, the development of next-generation lightweight, flexible energy storage devices is crucial. However, achieving the expected energy and power density of supercapacitors remains a great challenge. This work reports a facile plasma-enabled method for preparing supercapacitor electrodes made of MoS2 nanosheets grown on flexible and lightweight N-doped carbon cloth (NCC). The MoS2/NCC presents an outstanding specific capacitance of 3834.28 mF/cm2 at 1 mA/cm2 and energy density of 260.94 µWh/cm2 at a power density of 354.48 µW/cm2. An aqueous symmetric supercapacitor fitted with two MoS2/NCC electrodes achieved the maximum energy density of 138.12 µWh/cm2 and the highest power density of 7,417.33 µW/cm2, along with the excellent cycling stability of 83.3 % retention over 10,000 cycles. The high-performance energy storage ASSSs (all-solid-state supercapacitors) are demonstrated to power devices in both rigid and flexible operation modes. This work provides a new perspective for fabricating high-performance all-solid-state flexible supercapacitors for clean energy storage.
