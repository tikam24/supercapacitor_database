A molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheet film was grown directly on a stainless-steel substrate by using an in-situ hydrothermal growth technique at 200 °C. The formation of an MoS2 hexagonal structure with a nanosheet-like morphology was confirmed by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) while a layered MoS2 nanosheet structure was observed under an energy-filtering transmission electron microscope (EF-TEM). The electrochemical supercapacitor properties of the MoS2 nanosheet electrode were measured in 1-M aqueous Na2SO4 electrolyte by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and charge/discharge technique, and the electrode’s specific capacitances were 91.29 F/g and 146.15 F/g, respectively. The concurrent double-layer capacitance and pseudo-capacitance behaviors of the electrode manifested themselves in the rectangular shape and redox peaks of the CV curve. The mesoporous MoS2 nanosheets were electrochemically stable for up to 1000 charge/discharge cycles.
