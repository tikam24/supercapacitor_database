In this work, a supercapacitor electrode material, Fe2O3/rGO composite, was fabricated by the hydrothermal method. A mixture of isopropyl alcohol and deionized water was used as the hydrothermal agent. Structural characterization revealed that the Fe2O3 particles in the composites exhibit a unique elliptical structure with significantly increased specific surface area compared to hexagonal Fe2O3 particles, thereby allowing more ions to penetrate. The Fe2O3/rGO composite has a lager specific capacitance than bare Fe2O3 particles in 1M KOH. Additionally, compared to that in 1M Na2SO3, 1M Na2SO4, 1M KOH and 6M KOH electrolytes, Fe2O3/rGO exhibits better electrochemical performance in 6M KOH with 3M methanol.
