In this work, we developed a synthetic method for preparing one-dimensional MnO2nanowires through a hydrothermal method using a mixture of KMnO4and MnSO4precursors. As-prepared MnO2nanowires had a high surface area and porous structure, which are beneficial to the fast electron and ion transfer during electrochemical reaction. The microstructure and chemical structure of MnO2nanowires were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller measurements. The electrochemical properties of MnO2nanowire electrodes were also investigated using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge with a three-electrode system. MnO2nanowire electrodes showed a high specific capacitance of 129 F/g, a high rate capability of 61% retention, and an excellent cycle life of 100% during 1000 cycles.
