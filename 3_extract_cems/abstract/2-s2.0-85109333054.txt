Carbon fibers (CFs) are a promising candidate as electrode materials for flexible supercapacitors given its light weight and moderate cost. In this study, the lignin used was partially separated from kraft bamboo pulping black liquor and the higher molecular weight fraction, unavoidably contains a small amount of silicon compounds, so named silicon-contained lignin. Novel CFs were prepared using commercial polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and the lignin by electrospinning and further carbonization. Even in the presence of silicon compounds, the fibrous morphology of precursor fibers was significantly good, and the CFs with uniform fiber diameter and high specific surface area up to 182 m2/g were obtained with an increase in silicon-contained lignin. The CFs fabricated from silicon-contained lignin and commercial PAN had higher specific capacitance (22.20 mF/cm2 at 10 mA/cm2) and superb cycling stability (94.21%) than that from silicon-free lignin or pure PAN separately.
