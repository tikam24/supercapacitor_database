The main aim of this work is to propose a new system of a hybrid photovoltaic system working with batteries and supercapacitors and to analyze its efficiency. The preliminary results of the study on the operation of the system are discussed. The results obtained while testing the operation of a hybrid system and a PV system working separately with batteries and supercapacitors are compiled and compared. The tests covered the systems efficiency for the following electrical loads: heater warming up water in a tank, and lighting - a LED light. The work of batteries and supercapacitors during discharge has been analysed. The use of a hybrid system made it possible to increase energy storage efficiency and the system operation flexibility, compared to solar systems offered by the sector.
