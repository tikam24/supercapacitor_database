A facile and general method is developed to fabricate one-dimensional (1D) spinel composite oxides with complex architectures by using a facile single-spinneret electrospinning technique. It is found that precursor polymers and heating rates could control the structures of the products, such as 1D solid, nanotube and tube-in-tubes structures. Especially, the tube-in-tube structures have been successfully fabricated for various mixed metal oxide, including CoMn2O4, NiCo2O4, CoFe2O4, NiMn2O4and ZnMn2O4. Benefiting from the unique structure features, the tube-in-tube hollow nanostructures possess superior electrochemical performances in asymmetric supercapacitors and Li-O2batteries.
