Using Ni foam as a template, Mn0.6Ni0.4CO3 nanosheet assemblies were synthesized by a hydrothermal method and calcination treatment. X-Ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), X-ray energy spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to determine the composition and the morphology of the sample. The electrochemical performance of the Mn0.6Ni0.4CO3 nanosheet assemblies was investigated. The results show that the area-specific capacity of the electrode material in a 2 mol L-1 KOH solution can reach 1.813 F cm-2 at a current density of 10 mA cm-2. The mass-specific capacity can reach 906.5 F g-1, and the capacity only decreases by 3.4% after 2000 cycles, indicating that the material has excellent capacity performance. In addition, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was also assembled by using the Mn0.6Ni0.4CO3 nanosheet assemblies and carbon as a cathode and anode, respectively, which delivered an energy density of 23.7 W h kg-1 at the power density of 269.7 W kg-1. The Mn0.6Ni0.4CO3 nanosheet assemblies can be seen as a promising electrode material in the field of supercapacitors. This journal is
