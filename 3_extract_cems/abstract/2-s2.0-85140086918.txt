Supercapacitors (SCs) have attracted increasing attention due to high power density, rapid charge/discharge, excellent cyclic stability, and withstands adverse environments. Two-dimensional (2D) Ti3C2Tx MXene is considered as a promising electrode material for electrochemical energy storage. However, undesirable low specific capacitance issues limit its practical applications. Herein, a facile heteroatom doping strategy is proposed to construct defect-rich Ti3C2Tx MXene with abundant active cites. Hence, P-doped Ti3C2Tx MXene was synthesized by a simple annealing method. The prepared P-doped Ti3C2Tx was used as the electrode material of SC, and it was found that the P-doped Ti3C2Tx exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance compare to the pristine Ti3C2Tx MXene, the P-doped Ti3C2Tx electrode could deliver a high specific capacity of 31.11 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Furthermore, a P-doped Ti3C2Tx based symmetric SC device is fabricated and displays excellent energy density of 8.2 Wh L−1 at a power density of 303.4 W L−1. This study provides a straightforward strategy to design and construct MXene-based electrode materials with enlarged layer spacing structure for high-performance K+ storage and even in other metal ion storages.
