The well defined microstructures of BiPO4 were successfully synthesized by the facile hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) assisted hydrothermal method. The low temperature monoclinic BiPO4 structure with space group P21/n, were obtained from X-ray diffraction (XRD) for the pristine and HMT-assisted BiPO4 with 1, 3, 5 and 10 mmole concentration. A transformation from low temperature monazite-type phase to the high temperature SbPO4-type phase of BiPO4 was observed at the 10 mmole concentration. There was a variation in the morphology from polyhedron to octahedra-like and finally into cube shape upon an increase in concentration of HMT. The role of reaction time in the morphology of BiPO4 particles was investigated. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern elucidated the ordered dot pattern and the calculated d-spacing revealed the formation of BiPO4. An increased specific capacitance of HMT assisted materials (202 F/g) compared with pristine BiPO4 (89 F/g) at 5 mA/cm2 was observed upon morphological variation due to HMT addition.
