Designing nanostructured electrocatalysts plays an important role in improving the electro-catalytic behaviors of energy storage devices. Achieving the high specific capacitance of these devices depends on the structure of nanomaterials and their synthesis process. Herein, we report a novel system consisting of 2D layered materials and 1D nanowire with desirable properties suitable for supercapacitor applications. Nickel-Cobalt layered double hydroxide (Ni-Co LDH)@Silver nanowire (Ag NWs)/graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanomaterial was successfully synthesized using hydrothermal and ultra-sonication methods. The structural studies of the synthesized Ni-Co LDH based electrode materials are characterized by using different analytical techniques namely, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDAX). The electrochemical performance of Ni-Co LDH@Ag NWs/g-C3N4 hybrid electrode is investigated using Galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), cyclic and voltammetry (CV) techniques. The designed 3D nanostructured composites (Ni-Co LDH@Ag NWs/g-C3N4) showed high specific capacitance of 848.5 F/g at a current density at 1 A/g as good cyclic stability after 2000 cycles charge-discharge duration (93.5% at current density 5 A/g).
