In the present work, a study of simple, low-cost and reproducible strategy to synthesis 3D-CoFe2O4 anode is reported. The 3D-CoFe2O4 nanoflowers thin film was prepared via chemical bath deposition onto stainless steel substrate. The investigation of an ideal active mass was carries out systematically by varying the deposition time as a function of the specific capacitance. XRD results confirm that the main phase formed is the CoFe2O4. SEM images, approves the formation of three-dimensional (3D) nanoflowers morphology. The electrochemical performances of CoFe2O4 electrode are evaluated by the cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Tafel polarization measurements. The 3D-CoFe2O4/SS thin film exhibited an excellent pseudocapacitifs property as a negative electrode with a specific capacitance, specific power and specific energy equal to 975.85 F g−1, 161.59 W kg−1 and 40.99 Wh kg−1 respectively. Furthermore, the negative electrode shows an excellent cycle stability over 3000 cycles with 95 % capacitance retention.
