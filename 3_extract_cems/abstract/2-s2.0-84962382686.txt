In this study, La0.85Sr0.15MnO3 powder was reported as an electrode material for supercapacitor. Perovskite structural of La0.85Sr0.15MnO3 was successfully prepared by the sol-gel method. LaMnO3 was also synthesized by the same preparation method in order to compare with the La0.85Sr0.15MnO3. The structure and morphology of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The results indicated that La0.85Sr0.15MnO3 and LaMnO3 showed sphere morphology. Electrochemical properties were characterized by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results suggested that the specific capacitance of the La0.85Sr0.15MnO3 and LaMnO3 electrodes reached as high as 198 F/g and 187 F/g at the current density of 0.5 A/g, and that the La0.85Sr0.15MnO3 shows a lower intrinsic resistance.
