Simple and convenient protocols for fabricating heteroatom-doped hierarchical porous carbon are highly imperative owing to their superior electrochemical performance. Here, nitrogen and oxygen co-doped hierarchical porous carbon materials (NOPCs) are facilely prepared by the one-step carbonization of PEG-200/melamine/MgO bulks within ten minutes. The solid bulks enable the synthesis more conveniently, and make the NOPCs have a uniform structure and high electrochemical performance. The optimized products, NOPC-900, has the largest specific surface area (the SBET of 1248 m2 g−1), abundant mesopore structures (average pore diameter of 9.40 nm), with thin carbon walls (3–10 graphene layers), and the effective heteroatom doping (the content of N atom is 2.67 at.%, and O atom is 12.49 at.%). As a result, The NOPC-900 displays the specific capacitance of 324 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and a low IR drop of 0.018 V at 50 A g−1. When assembling NOPC-900 into a symmetric two-electrode supercapacitor, it presents the cell capacitance of 54.18 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and perseveres 84.6 % of initial capacitance at 10 A g−1. Meanwhile, the energy density of 19.12 Wh kg−1 is achieved at the power density of 425 W kg−1. The convenient preparation approach and excellent electrochemical performance render the NOPCs to be promising candidates for supercapacitor application.
