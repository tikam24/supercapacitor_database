In this paper; we propose a hybrid electric system designed to meet sustained load demand. Our system is based on renewable energy source, namely Solar Energy Component (SEC). The SEC works as a primary source feeding a load through a DC converter. The system integrates also secondary energy components as an energy storage (ESC) that combines a water electrolyzer and a storage gas tank, an energy recovery (ERC) based on a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and an ultra-capacitor storage (USC). This components work together to keep the energy storage in one hand and to satisfy the load requirements in other hand. For this reason, we introduce a new advanced management method, based on Multi-Agent-Approach (MAA) that ensures the smooth operation of the system so smarter and more reliable. The main idea of the suggested approach consists in representing the various components of system by agents to establish fast communication between them. Finally, the performance of the MAA is extensively assessed through computer simulation using Matlab/Simulink software.
