The purpose of the current review article is to present a comprehensive understanding regarding pros and cons of graphene related nanocomposites and to find ways in order to improve the performance of nanocomposites with new designs. Nanomaterials including GR are employed in industrial applications such as supercapacitors, biosensors, solar cells, and corrosion studies. The present article has been prepared in three main categories. In the first part, graphene types have been presented, as pristine graphene, graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide. In the second part, nanocomposites with many graphene, inorganic and polymeric materials such as polymer/GR, activated carbon/GR, metal oxide/GR, metal/graphene and carbon fibre/GR have been investigated in more detail. In the third part, the focus in on the industrial applications of GR nanocomposite, including super capacitors, biosensors, solar cells, and corrosion protection studies.
