The NiO particles were synthesized by repeated immersion method. The as-prepared particles are NiO, which are well dispersed and have a wave-like shape. The electrochemical tests show that the particles have relatively high capacitance and excellent capacitive retention. The good structure and excellent performance suggest its promising application in supercapacitor. Â© 2013 by ESG.
