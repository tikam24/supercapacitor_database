MoS 2 and graphene composites are promising materials for high-performance supercapacitors. Here, we prepared a novel flower-like MoS 2 nanosheet/N-doped 3D graphene (MoS 2 /N-3DG) by hydrothermal method. Electrochemical characterizations indicate that the specific capacitance of MoS 2 /N-3DG can reach up to 301.2 F/g at 0.2 A/g and preserve 82% of the initial capacitance after 1000 cycles at 1 A/g. This result shows that MoS 2 /N-3DG can be applied in supercapacitors.
