Nickel manganese mixed oxides (NiyMn1-yOx; 0 ≤ y ≤ 0.4) have been synthesized by in situ inclusion of nickel during the growth of manganese oxide (MnOx). The e ffect of nickel concentration in MnOx is investigated by cyclic voltammetry, current-voltage characteristics, scanning electron microscopy and N2 adsorption-desorption analysis. Variations in electronic conductivity and specific capacitance suggest that nickel concentration in the MnOx matrix significantly affects the supercapacitor electrode performance. At Ni/Mn ∼0.25, i.e. Ni0.2 Mn0.8Ox, the material crystallizes into spinel NiMn2O4 as a prominent phase and exhibits a specific surface area (118 m2 g-1) with a granular morphology. Furthermore Ni0.2Mn0.8Ox exhibited low resistivity (2.07 × 104 Ohm cm) and consequently high specific capacitance ∼380 F g-1, endowing additional merits. The fabricated supercapacitor device (Ni0.2Mn0.8Ox//Ni0.2Mn0.8Ox) delivers 35 W h kg-1 energy density and 3.74 kW kg-1 power density with remarkably high capacitive retention ∼92% after 3000 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles. These encouraging results show great potential in developing energy storage devices from manganese oxide based electrodes incorporating nickel in the lattice.
