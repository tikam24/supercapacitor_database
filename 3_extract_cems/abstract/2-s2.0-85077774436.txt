Supercapacitors come under different names and scientific nominations as Ultracapacitors (UCs) or double layer capacitors, or electrochemical capacitors, they are considered as promising technological devices used for storing energy in the field of energy storage systems. They are able to deliver high power and enable high load currents in addition their ability to bridge power gaps. As we will notice, they have fast yet complicated charging/discharging mechanism interpretations. This paper will provide an overview on different equivalent circuits of a supercapacitor, and will highlight the concept of unbalanced series of connected ultracapacitors and different options in rectifying such unbalance. The balancing of supercapacitors connected in series can come in different modes passive or active and maybe hybrid. A comparison between the different modes will be executed using MATLAB/Simulink and results will be shown based on the economical and performance perspectives.
