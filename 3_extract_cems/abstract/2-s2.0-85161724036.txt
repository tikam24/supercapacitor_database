A novel 3D stacked corrugated pore structure of polyaniline (PANI)/CoNiO2@activated wood-derived carbon (AWC) has been successfully constructed to prepare high-performance electrode materials for supercapacitors. AWC functions as a supporting framework that provides ample attachment sites for the loaded active materials. The CoNiO2 nanowire substrate, consisting of 3D stacked pores, not only serves as a template for subsequent PANI loading, but also acts as an effective buffer to mitigate the volume expansion of the PANI during ionic intercalation. The distinctive corrugated pore structure of PANI/CoNiO2@AWC facilitates electrolyte contact and significantly enhances the electrode material properties. The PANI/CoNiO2@AWC composite materials exhibit excellent performance (14.31F cm−2 at 5 mA cm−2) and superior capacitance retention (80% from 5 to 30 mA cm−2), owing to the synergistic effect among their components. Finally, PANI/CoNiO2@ AWC//reduced graphene oxide (rGO)@AWC asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled, which has a wide operating voltage (0 ∼ 1.8 V), high energy density (4.95 mWh cm−3 at 26.44 mW cm−3) and cycling stability (90.96% after 7000 cycles).
