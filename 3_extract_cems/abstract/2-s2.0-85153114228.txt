Metal organic framework (MOF) as an electrode material is still a great challenge due to inherent instability and poor electrical conductivity. Herein, we design a material rGO/NiCo2S4, which by using GO and metal organic framework (ZIF-67) as the template and precursor. Additionally, the presence of GO and ZIF-67 can increase specific surface area and provide active sites for redox reactions and shortens ion transport pathways. The synthesized of rGO-10/NiCo2S4 has excellent electrochemical properties as electrode material, which has a high specific capacity of 171 mAh g−1 and 121.9 mAh g−1 (1 A g−1 and 10 A g−1). The as-obtained rGO-10/NiCo2S4//AC asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) of power density is 870 W kg−1 when the specific energy 41 Wh kg−1, and with 88.2 % capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1. Therefore, the rGO-10/NiCo2S4 derived from ZIF-67 as electrode materials for high-performance asymmetric supercapacitors has a good prospect.
