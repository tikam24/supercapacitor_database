In this paper a novel and high efficiency conversion system based on a Supercapacitor Recover System (SRS) and a Power Factor Correction circuit (PFC) is proposed and tested. It allows to greatly improve the performances of motion systems for residential application, such as elevators, both in terms of energy efficiency and power demand, allowing the compliance with the recents international standards on power quality.
