Lignin-based activated carbon fibers (ACFs) were prepared by electrospinning of hardwood acetic acid lignin (HW-AAL) solution followed by thermostabilization, carbonization, and steam activation. The thermostabilization process was able to be remarkably shortened from 38 h to 3 h with hexamethylenetetramine (hexamine) in binary solvents, AcOH/CCl4 (8/2), when compared with conventional thermostabilization processes. The resultant ACFs possessed higher specific surface area (2185 m2 g-1) than those from commercial activated carbon and electrospun lignin fibers without hexamine. These ACFs also exhibited good electrical capacitance (133.3 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1) as electrodes of electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) are efficient not only due to their large surfaces area but also due to their porous structure with well-developed micropores (diameter: 0.5-1.3 nm). High energy density and power density of this EDLC (42 Wh kg-1 and 91 kW kg-1, respectively) were also achieved.
