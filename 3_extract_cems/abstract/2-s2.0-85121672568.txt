Hexagonal nanoplates of Ni(OH)2 were provided using Tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) as a surfactant and an alkali wherein the particle dimensions and morphological attributes were controlled by TPAOH. The nanoplates of Ni(OH)2 were hexagonal with an average diameter of 62 nm and a 4.4 nm thickness. At a current density of about 0.5 A g−1, the hexagonal nanoplates of Ni(OH)2 were detected to exhibit a beneficial specific capacitive performance of 1462 F g−1. The Ni(OH)2 nanoplate//activate carbon (AC) asymmetrical supercapacitor (ASC) presented excellent energy density 30.0 W h kg−1 at a power density of 250 W kg−1. ASC manifested tremendous cycling stability, preserving 72.73 % of its primary capacitance following 7500 cycles.
