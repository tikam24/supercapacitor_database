A meter-length, graphene-confined polypyrrole (GP) film was fabricated by a scalable wet-spinning technology. The GP film-assembled supercapacitors had an extremely high cycling stability (115% retention after 50:000 cycles) due to the delicate graphene-confined polypyrrole-layered structures. Highly flexible supercapacitors with different sizes were further assembled with a gel electrolyte.
