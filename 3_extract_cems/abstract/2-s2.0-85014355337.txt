The crystalline metal-organic-framework (MOF) microrods from monosodium glutamate and zinc acetate dihydrate were spontaneously formed by mixing their solution at room temperature. After carbonization in an inert atmosphere, these MOF microrods are evolved into N and O co-doped nanoporous carbon with 3D-architecture. The model of gas bubbles is elucidated for the formation of these interconnected porous structure. As the electrode material for supercapacitor, the derived nanoporous carbon at the temperature of 800 Â°C exhibits good capacitance performance in alkali aqueous electrolyte.
