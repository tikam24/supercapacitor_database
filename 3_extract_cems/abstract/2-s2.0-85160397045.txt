The integration of two-dimensional molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) into a polypyrrole (PPy) matrix appears to be a productive method for improving the structural, optical, and electrochemical properties of pure PPy. rGO-PPy-MoS 2 composite was synthesized via in-situ polymerization process. The formation of the composite was confirmed using X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, and Raman investigations. Field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and EDX were utilized to analyze the surface morphology and elemental analyses of rGO-PPy-MoS 2 composite, because of their strong charge transport properties, the composites display both micro and meso-porosity with increased surface area. Elemental purity and composition of the synthesized materials were characterized through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The optimized composites’ band gap was 1.63 eV, with refractive index of 2.45 showed good optical conductivity and their photoluminescence characteristics reveal blue emission at 445 nm with color purity of 77.1%. The composite’s electrochemical characteristics provide an excellent potential response in the 0–1 V range. The specific capacitance of rGO-PPy-MoS 2 showed 235.6 F/g with maximum power density of 4300 W/kg and energy density of 11.61 Wh/kg. All of these findings point to rGO-PPy-MoS 2 composite as a potential emissive layer material with suitable materials for supercapacitor application.
