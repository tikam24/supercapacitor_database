Generating energy from the environment, extend the time for using electronic devices. Saving energy is important, but most current systems are powered by batteries without having a permanent connection to the mains electricity power supply. Wireless sensors need energy and this can be compensated using piezoelectric sources. Mechanical vibrations are widespread: in a car or sensors in the ambient environment. Piezoelectric crystals are the most efficient solution for energy from random motion - from renewable resources. An ultra-low power electronic converter is needed to transfer energy from the piezoceramic crystal to an energy storage device (supercapacitor, battery). The paper analyzes the optimal conditions for collecting energy from the piezoceramic element. This study is useful for ways to convert energy in conjunction with its storage, in Lithium-Ion batteries.
