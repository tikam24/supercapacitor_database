Crumpled MoS2 nanosheets were synthesized directly on carbon fiber paper (CFP) through hydrothermal procedure. Molybdenum sulfide precursor was first produced in the solution and then introduced into the autoclave. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images confirmed the uniform growth of crumpled nanosheets on the CFP that were assigned to MoS2 according to X-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy results. Electrochemical measurements of the as deposited MoS2 crumpled nanosheets performed in 1 M Na2SO4 evidenced a specific capacitance of 249 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 and the good rate capability by retaining 41.3% of initial capacitance at 10 A g−1. Electrochemical Impedance spectroscopy measurements showed very low charge transfer resistance and very short relaxation time accounting for the pseudocapacitive rectangular cyclic voltammetry (CV) and high rate capability.
