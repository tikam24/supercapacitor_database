The architectures of hydrogen/air fuel cell (FC) and methanol/air FC systems that are suitable for powering light traction vehicles are presented and discussed. Several design strategies to make the system simple and compact are outlined. Modeling and experimental work in the public domain are summarized, and critical design parameters and specifications are presented. Fuel cell and FC/battery (or supercapacitor) hybrid systems have shown clear advantages over battery systems with respect to operating hours per refueling and quality of vehicle performance.
