A facile method was adopted to synthesize reduced graphene oxide–Mn3O4 (rGO–Mn3O4) nanocomposites with flower-like structure, and the Mn3O4 particles were uniformly embedded onto the rGO layers. The structural features were characterized by XRD, Raman and FTIR. The surface morphologies were observed by FE-SEM and TEM. XPS was conducted to confirm the surface chemical state and composition of the composite. The morphological studies confirmed that the Mn3O4 nanoparticles were dispersed with the average size of 10 nm and high uniformity. The rGO–Mn3O4 nanocomposite exhibited a high surface area of 225 m2/g and manifested high capacitance with outstanding rate capability in supercapacitors. A highest specific capacitance of 368.2 F/g was displayed at a current density of 0.75 A/g and outstanding capacity retention at 5 A/g even after 5000 cycles. The outstanding electrochemical performance of rGO–Mn3O4 nanocomposites may be credited to the crystallized Mn3O4 particles with small size (about 10 nm), high porosity, high specific surface area, and effective conductive pathway from rGO. The developed rGO–Mn3O4 nanocomposite materials hold highly promising prospects in supercapacitors.
