Conducting polymer comprises main chain of Ï€-conjugation system and semiconducting properties. In addition to electrical conductivity, conducting polymer owns fine structural, chemical, and thermal stability features. Inclusion of nanoparticles have found to further enhance physical characteristics of conjugated polymer. Among nanocarbon nanofillers, fullerene has been reconnoitered to develop high performance conductive polymeric matrices. Accordingly, this review essentially presents progresses in field of conducting polymer and fullerene based nanocomposite. Common conjugated polymers used with fullerene include polyaniline, polypyrrole, polythiophene, and derivatives. Applications of conjugated polymer/fullerene nanocomposite have been observed in energy and electronics sectors such as solar cell, supercapacitor, sensors, etc.
