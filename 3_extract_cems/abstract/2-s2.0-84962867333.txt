Mn3O4 nanoparticles have been successfully synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method at low temperature. The microstructural and electrochemical properties are studied. The XRD data exhibited (211) predominant orientation at 2θ = 36.1° corresponding to tetragonal structure of Mn3O4 with I41/amd(141) space group and an estimated crystallite size of 65 nm. The SEM analysis reveals that the average grain size is 200 nm. The vibrational studies from Raman and FTIR measurements confirmed the presence of Mn-O bonding. The Mn3O4 nanoparticles exhibited high specific capacitance of 198 Fg-1 at a current density of 0.5 mAcm-2 in 0.5 M Li2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. The Mn3O4electrode retained up to 70% of initial capacitance even after 1000 cycles exhibiting good electrochemical stability and capacitance retention capability. These results suggest that the obtained Mn3O4 nanoparticles are the better candidate for supercapacitor applications.
