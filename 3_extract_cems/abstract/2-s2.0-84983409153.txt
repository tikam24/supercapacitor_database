A newly-designed multiport bidirectional power converter is studied to interface battery, supercapacitor and dc-bus of different voltage levels for hybrid electric/fuel-cell vehicle (HEV/FCV) system. The converter can be used to operate in both the step-down and step-up modes with bidirectional power flow control. The operating modes of proposed topology can be classified into low-voltage dual sources powering boost mode and high-voltage dc-link energy-regenerating buck mode. Also, It is possible to independently control power flow between any two low-voltage sources, i.e. low-voltage dual sources buck/boost mode. The operation, analysis, and design of the converter are proposed with different modes of power transfer. Experimental results for a 1-kW system are provided, validating the theoretical analysis.
