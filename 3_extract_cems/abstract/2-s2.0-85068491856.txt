Polyaniline has been widely used in high-performance pseudocapacitors, due to its low cost, easy synthesis, and high theoretical specific capacitance. However, the poor mechanical properties of polyaniline restrict its further development. Compared with polyaniline, functionalized carbon materials have excellent physical and chemical properties, such as porous structures, excellent specific surface area, good conductivity, and accessibility to active sites. However, it should not be neglected that the specific capacity of carbon materials is usually unsatisfactory. There is an effective strategy to combine carbon materials with polyaniline by a hybridization approach to achieve a positive synergistic effect. After that, the energy storage performance of carbon/polyaniline hybridization material has been significantly improved, making it a promising and important electrode material for supercapacitors. To date, significant progress has been made in the synthesis of various carbon/polyaniline binary composite electrode materials. In this review, the corresponding properties and applications of polyaniline and carbon hybrid materials in the energy storage field are briefly reviewed. According to the classification of different types of functionalized carbon materials, this article focuses on the recent progress in carbon/polyaniline hybrid materials, and further analyzes their corresponding properties to provide guidance for the design, synthesis, and component optimization for high-performance supercapacitors.
