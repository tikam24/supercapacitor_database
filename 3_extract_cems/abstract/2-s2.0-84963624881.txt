In this paper, willow leaves were used to prepare activated carbons (ACs) by one-step pyrolysis with ZnCl2 activation. The as-prepared AC-1-800 exhibits porous structure with high specific surface area of 1031 m2 g-1 and a large pore volume of 0.66 cm3 g-1. As a supercapacitor electrode, it shows a good capacitive performance in 6 M of KOH aqueous electrolyte, such as the specific capacitance reaches 216 F g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1 and the retention of specific capacitance is 97% after 1000 cycles at 2 A g-1.
