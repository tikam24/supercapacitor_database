In this paper, we report an effective, simple, and cost-effective strategy of electrochemical deposition to prepare hausmannite Mn3O4 thin films for the applications of supercapacitors. Various precursor concentrations and deposition durations were manipulated to tailor the surface morphologies of Mn3O4 nanostructures and to optimize their electrochemical performances. The Mn3O4 samples prepared at 0.05 M Mn(NO3)2 solution for 30 min delivered a large gravimetric specific capacitance of 210 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1, and a good rate capability over other samples. This superior electrochemical performance may be attributed to the improved electrode conductivity with increased accessible area for electrolytes ions. Furthermore, a nanocomposite film based on Mn3O4/carbon foam was fabricated by utilizing the developed optimized conditions. The Mn3O4/carbon foam films exhibit an excellent specific capacitance with negligible degradation in retaining specific capacitance values up to 4000 cycles. These findings could further broaden the applications of hausmannite Mn3O4 in electrochemical energy storage electrodes.
