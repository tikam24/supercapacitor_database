Due to their enormous theoretical capability and potential application in electrochemical energy systems, curiosity about metal phosphates and phosphonates has considerably expanded over the past couple of years in light of the significance of renewable power, economic, and ecological challenges. Several of these metal phosphates, phosphides, and hybrids outperform transition metal hydroxides/oxides, a family of electrode materials that have received substantial study for supercapacitor applications. We thoroughly cover the properties and fundamentals of metal phosphates with regard to electrochemical energy devices in this chapter. The synthetic procedures used to manufacture these metal phosphides and phosphates, as well as the underlying scientific principles, are explored since they have a significant impact on the effectiveness of electrochemical energy retention. Several aspects of metal phosphates-based electrochemical devices along with their basic operating principles and material compositions have been examined.
