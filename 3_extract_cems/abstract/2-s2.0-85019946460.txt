In order to boost the energy density of supercapacitors, the strategy of using advanced pseudo-capacitive electrode and asymmetric device architecture is feasible and effective. Herein, we report a significant advance in the design and synthesis of a new hierarchically nanostructures with a series of controllable Ni/Co molar ratios of NixCo3-xS4 (i.e., NiCo2S4 and Ni2CoS4) nanosheets coatings have in situ grown on NiCo2O4 nanowires arrays on a flexible carbon fiber paper (CFP). Remarkably, the hybrid Ni2CoS4@NiCo2O4 composite electrode delivers the highest discharge gravimetric capacitance of 1501 F g−1, and areal capacitance of 1.86 F cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2. Furthermore, coupled with nitrogen-doped carbon xerogels anode, we have fabricated a 1.6 V asymmetric supercapacitor (Ni2CoS4@NiCo2O4//nitrogen-doped carbon xerogels), such device delivers a maximum energy and power densities of 32.2 Wh kg−1 and 2.5 kW kg−1 in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, respectively, and an excellent cycling stability (∼87.6% retention after 10,000 cycles).
