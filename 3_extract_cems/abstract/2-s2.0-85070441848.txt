Nonlinear and pulsed loads cause various problems in DC microgrids (MGs). This paper presents a new control method to improve system performance using hybrid energy storage (HESS) in DC MG with the presence of different loads. In order to maintain system stability and reliability, HESS including battery and supercapacitor (SC) are used. The SC is used to supply oscillatory current which have been caused by pulse and nonlinear load. As the reliability of HESS depend on various parameters, the state of charge and current of hybrid energy storage elements are monitored to divide pulse current correctly between battery and supper capacitor. Fuzzy controller is used for HESS voltage control. The entire system is modeled in Matlab/simulink. The simulation results show that the proposed control strategy perform stable operation of system under different load condition especially pulsed load and nonlinear load conditions.
