The frequency in the electrical grid is, on the short time-scale, stabilized by the total rotational mass given predominantly by synchronously connected devices. These devices include the generators themselves and, on slightly longer timescales, the control system acting on turbine governors. As the inverter-connected technologies increase their share of total power, the total inertia in the grid is significantly reduced. One way to stabilize the frequency and reduce low frequency oscillations is to add synthetic inertia provided by a small energy, high power, storage devices combined with a fast control system. This paper describes a possible hardware topology for linear synthetic inertia. It uses an inverter coupled to a local energy storage unit comprised of supercapacitors. The paper presents the implementation and some selected experimental results. The system response is fast enough on a small test grid to act as inertia.
