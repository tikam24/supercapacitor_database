Novel porous Co3O4 nanowire with launching-like structure is vertically grown on its self-support via hydrothermal method and annealing precursors of Co(CO3)0.5(OH)â‹…H2O nanowires in air atmosphere. Here, crosslinked dense Co3O4 self-support is first freely grown on nickel foam. The Co3O4 nanowires are about 20 nm in diameter and composed of nanoparticles of 8 nm in diameter. Electrochemical test results show that the as-prepared Co3O4 nanowire structure has excellent specific capacitance of 2630 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g. After 5000 charge/discharge cycles, cycle stability is 98.7% at a current density of 50 A/g and 98.4% at a current density of 10 A/g.
