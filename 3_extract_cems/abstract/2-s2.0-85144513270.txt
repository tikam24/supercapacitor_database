We synthesized a novel polymer electrolyte membrane by combining poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) with graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets and a lithium salt of tungstosilicic acid (Li4SiW12O40, hereafter, referred to SiWLi). The impact of the addition of GO/SiWLi on the microstructure and morphology of the membrane were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). We found that adding the GO/SiWLi to the PVDF/LiTFSI polymer electrolyte membrane significantly reduced the pore size. Furthermore, the addition of the GO/SiWLi resulted in not only an increase of the ionic conductivity from 0.87 × 10−2 to 3.12 × 10−2 S cm−1 but also an increase in the lithium-ion transference number from 0.52 to 0.87. The polymer electrolyte membranes with and without GO/SiWLi were utilized to fabricate solid-state supercapacitors. The supercapacitors fabricated with the membrane containing GO/SiWLi displayed 37.2% lower equivalent series resistance and 88.2% greater specific capacitance than those fabricated using the membrane without GO/SiWLi at 200 mV s−1.
