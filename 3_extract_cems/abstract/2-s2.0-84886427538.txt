We have established a facile and scaleable approach to fabricate tubular graphitic-C3N4 using melamine. The construction of the unique tubular morphology is a result of the pre-treatment of melamine with HNO3. Herein, for the first time, we have explored the electrochemical properties of g-C3N4 as an electrode material for supercapacitors. Tubular g-C3N4 has significant advantages due to its distinctive morphology, high surface area (182.61 m2 g-1) and combination of carbon with nitrogen. Therefore, tubular g-C3N4 demonstrated a good specific capacitance of 233 F g-1 at a current density of 0.2 A g-1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte. Furthermore, tubular g-C3N4 maintained a high capacitance retention capability (90%) after 1000 cycles. The photocatalytic activity of tubular g-C3N4 was evaluated using the organic dyes such as Methylene Blue (MB) and Methylene Orange (MO) under visible light. Tubular g-C3N4 demonstrated good photocatalytic activity and enhanced stability compared to bulk g-C 3N4. The enhanced performance is because of the high surface area, which contains more active sites for reaction. The encouraging performance of tubular g-C3N4 in supercapacitors and as a photocatalyst points toward it being a prospective material for energy storage that is environmentally clean.
