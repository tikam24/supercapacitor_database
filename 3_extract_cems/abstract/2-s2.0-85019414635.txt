Micro-supercapacitors with small size, light weight, flexibility while maintaining high energy and power output are required for portable miniaturized electronics. The fabrication methods and materials should be cost-effective, scalable, and easily integrated to current electronic industry. Carbon materials have required properties for high-performance flexible supercapacitors, including high specific surface areas, electrochemical stability, and high electrical conductivity, as well as the high mechanical tolerance. Laser direct writing method is a non-contact, efficient, single-step fabrication technique without requirements of masks, post-processing, and complex clean room, which is a useful patterning technique, and can be easily integrated with current electronic product lines for commercial use. Previously we have reported micro-supercapacitors fabricated by laser direct writing on polyimide films in air or Ar, which showed highcapacitive performance. However, the conductivity of the carbon materials is still low for fast charge-discharge use. Here, we demonstrated the fabrication of flexible carbon/Au composite high-performance MSCs by first laser direct writing on commercial polyimide films followed by spin-coating Au nanoparticles ink and second in-situ laser direct writing using the low-cost semiconductor laser. As-prepared micro-supercapacitors show an improved conductivity and capacitance of 1.17 mF/cm2 at a high scanning rate of 10,000 mV/s, which is comparable to the reported capacitance of carbon-based micro-supercapacitors. In addition, the micro-supercapacitors have high bend tolerance and long-cycle stability.
