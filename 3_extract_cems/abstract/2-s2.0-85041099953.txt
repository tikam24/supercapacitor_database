Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) coupled with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) have been developed with an ultrahigh sensitivity for hazardous gas monitoring. Both the MOF/MWCNT and as-derived metal oxides (MOs)/MWCNTs hybrid fibers deliver an ultralow detection limit for NO2 down to 0.1 ppm without external heating, and they can be further bent into different angles without loss of sensing performance. Also, a high specific capacitance of 110 F cm-3 can also be obtained for MO/MWCNT hybrid fibers, demonstrating promising application for integrated wearable devices.
