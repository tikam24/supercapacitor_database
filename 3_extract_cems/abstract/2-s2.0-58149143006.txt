A simulation model was established by utilizing Cruise software to analyze the power performance and fuel energy consumption of hybrid electric bus SWB6105HEV, which is parallel heavy-duty hybrid electric bus and is equipped with supercapacitor and battery advanced hybrid drive system by adopting method of theory and experiment data combining. Road tests of hybrid bus SWB6105HEV were carried out according to the correlative standards of hybrid electric vehicles based on simulation analysis. The simulation research and road tests show that the SWB6105HEV hybrid electric bus can perform every kind of control function which is set in advance accurately and logically. The fuel consumption reduces a lot by comparing with the original traditional bus. The simulation research provides a theory basement for next cycle design research and optimization of control strategy.
