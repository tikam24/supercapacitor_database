Bimetallic oxide/graphene nanocomposite has been recognised as a promising electrode material owing to its admirable electrochemical activity and excellent electrical conductivity. Herein, a distinctive approach has been applied on exploiting the graphene/MnV2O6 nanomaterial as a promising electrode for supercapacitor. In order to achieve fascinating supercapacitive behaviours, an efficient liquid phase exfoliation coupled with solvothermal process is offered to construct these graphene/MnV2O6 nanocomposites for symmetric supercapacitor analysis. The hybrid G-8MVO electrode benefited from its optimal graphene/manganese vanadate ratio (1:8), interconnecting network architecture, rich redox activity and superior conducting feature exhibited the maximum specific capacitance of 348 Fg-1 at 0.5 Ag-1. Moreover, 88% of its initial capacitance was retained and columbic efficiency of nearly 100% was achieved after 3000 cycles at 1 Ag-1. Moreover, the symmetric supercapacitor provided a maximum specific energy of 48.33 Wh/kg at specific power of 880.6 W/kg. The comprehensive electrochemical output of the graphene/MnV2O6 nanocomposite advocates its potential as a high performance supercapacitor electrode.
