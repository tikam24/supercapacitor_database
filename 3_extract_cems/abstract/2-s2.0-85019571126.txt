Nickel-, cobalt- and nickel-cobalt carbonate hydroxides were prepared with hydrothermal method and the crystal structure, thermal property and morphology were characterized. The electrochemical performance was also studied using the three-electrode method in 6M KOH electrolyte. Nickel carbonate hydroxide and nickel-cobalt carbonate hydroxide have fluffy and hierarchical structures and exhibit much higher specific capacity compared to the as-prepared cobalt carbonate hydroxide. The specific capacity of nickel carbonate hydroxide achieves up to 169.6 mA h g-1 and that of the nickel-cobalt carbonate hydroxide reveals 127.4 mA h g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1. The two kinds of carbonate hydroxides exhibit superior cycling stability and have great application prospect for supercapacitor electrodes.
