Highly capacitive carbons are viewed as promising commercial materials for supercapacitors, but few species satisfy the requirements of high capacitance and low cost. Here, we demonstrate an extraordinary porous few-layer carbon by facile Pechini combustion of magnesium nitrate gel, which combined salicylic acid as a complexing agent with magnesium nitrate as an inorganic metal salt. The as-synthesized carbon material delivers a capacitance of 415 F g-1, mostly stemming from a large specific surface area (âˆ¼1312 m2 g-1), a fluent channel for transport of the electrolyte, as well as electrochemical redox reactions at O,N-associated active sites. Such porous few-layer carbons may accelerate the adoption of carbon-based supercapacitors for commercial high-power energy storage applications.
