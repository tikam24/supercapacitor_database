A novel zinc tartrate oriented hydrothermal synthesis of microporous carbons was reported. Zinc-organic complex obtained via a simple chelation reaction of zinc ions and tartaric acid is introduced into the networks of resorcinol/formaldehyde polymer under hydrothermal condition. After carbonization process, the resultant microporous carbons achieve high surface area (up to 1255 m2/g) and large mean pore size (1.99 nm) which guarantee both high specific capacitance (225 F/g at 1.0 A/g) and fast charge/discharge operation (20 A/g) when used as a supercapacitor electrode. Besides, the carbon electrode shows good cycling stability, with âˆ¼93% capacitance retention at 1.0 A/g after 1000 cycles. The well-designed and high-performance microporous carbons provide important prospects for supercapacitor applications.
