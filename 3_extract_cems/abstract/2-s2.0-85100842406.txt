Using laser as a technology of wireless energy transmission to supplement power for small electronic equipment, for the characteristics of fast charging speed, flexible and convenient implementation. The wireless energy transmission system consists of mobile charging station and mobile object. There are two-dimensional platform, laser and corresponding optical elements on the mobile charging station. The platform controls the laser beam to aim at the photovoltaic panel located in the mobile object. The mobile object is designed using Super-Capacitor to store electricity generated by photovoltaic panels. Grid charging working area, modeling for moving objects. The logic algorithm of mobile charging station to mobile object charging is designed to deal with the general working conditions and special conditions. The experiment obtained the I-V curve of the photovoltaic panel illuminated by the laser, calculated and selected the SuperCapacitor to meet the car's electricity demand. The results show that the wireless energy transmission using laser technology can realize the long distance transmission of the electrical energy required by small electronic equipment and fit the requirements of long time continuous operation.
