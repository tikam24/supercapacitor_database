The electrical conductivity of polypropylene (PP) was improved via the addition of carbon-based nanoparticles such as graphene and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT). In addition, a hybrid composite structure consisting of PP matrix, polyaniline conductive polymer, as well as carbon-based nanofillers. The samples were fabricated via melt blending technique which is capable for large scale industrial production. Electrical conductivity measurements determined that the electrical performance of nanocomposite was increased 10 orders of magnitudes to a maximum value of 2.5Ã—10-4 S/cm, achieved by 20wt.% polyaniline (PAni), 5wt.% MWCNT, and 75wt.% PP samples. The increase in electrical conductivity was attributed to the formation of conductive networks observed under SEM and AFM. The samples were further characterized via TGA analysis technique to verify its content. These nanocomposites are developed for future supercapacitor current collector applications.
