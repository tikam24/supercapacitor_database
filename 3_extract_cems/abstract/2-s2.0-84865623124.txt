A composite material was prepared through the electrochemical polymerization of aniline in the pores or on the surface of mesoporous carbon nanofibers by an electrochemical polymerization method. The surface morphology and structure of the composite material were characterized by scanning electron microscope(SEM) and transmission electron microscope(TEM). The supercapacitance performance of the composite material was investigated by cyclic voltammetry(CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge and Nyquist impedance test with a three-electrode system in 1 mol/L H 2SO 4 solution. The specific capacitance of the composite material is as high as 391 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g in the potential range of -0.2-0.8 V. The cycling stability is much better than that of pure polyaniline.
