This paper deals with the modeling of a hybrid system with a PEM fuel cell as the main source and supercapacitors as the auxiliary source. A static model of PEM fuel cell is used to simplify the hybrid model. The dynamic models of the other parts of the hybrid system are built according to physical principles. The PID regulators are adopted in hybrid system control. The proposed control algorithm does not need to define the operating mode with load changes. A good performance of this control strategy is illustrated in simulation.
