In this paper, the control and energy management strategy are proposed for an electric vehicle (EV) application. The hybrid source is composed of Fuel Cell (FC) and Ultracapacitors (UCs). The proposed energy management is used to share the EV energy requirement between the hybrid energy source, where the UCs are connected to DC-bus through a bidirectional DC/DC converter, and the FC is linked to the DC-bus through unidirectional DC/DC converter. The main purpose of this paper is focused on EV requested power sharing in real time operations between the FC stack and the UCs according to the electrical characteristics of these sources using polynomial correctors. In this study, only the traction operation mode is considered. The validity of the control is proofed through reduced scale experimental tests.
