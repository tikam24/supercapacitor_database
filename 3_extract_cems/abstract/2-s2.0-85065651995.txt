A supercapacitor is a new device of energy storage which shares similar properties with conventional capacitors and batteries. To optimize the energy storage as well as energy release cycling, we should observe in detail the one face electrode before use in the manufacture as a supercapacitor. An interesting materials' properties from various studies of supercapacitor are graphene, Mn2O3, and ZnO. It could be more intriguing when those materials deposited on nickel foam substrate. The manganese oxide Mn2O3 exhibits remarkable potential as a supercapacitor electrode because it has low cost, abundant and high specific theoretical capacitances. So far, many carbon-based materials have been studied as supercapacitor material electrodes, but still, show a low volumetric capacity and hamper several physical limitations. More practical and long-term use of high-performance supercapacitors is hard to find in the literature on ZnO, G, Mn2O3 system supercapacitors. The Mn2O3 nanoparticle has been synthesized using chemical co-precipitation methods. The film of supercapacitor ZnO-G-Mn2O3/Ni foam system was characterized using SEM-EDX, XRD, and LCR meter. It was found that the increase of manganese oxide gives rise to increase the capacitance, specific capacitance as well as dielectric constant. The behavior of its dielectric constant as a function of temperature is not a simple relationship.
