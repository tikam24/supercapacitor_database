Supercapacitors are attractive as a major energy storage device due to their high coulombic efficiency and semi-permanent life cycle. Transition metal oxides are used as electrode material in supercapacitors due to their high conductivity, capacitance, and multiple oxidation states. Nanopowder transition metal oxides exhibit low specific surface area, ion diffusion, electrical conductivity, and structural stability compared with the three-dimensional (3D) structure. Furthermore, unstable performance during long-term testing can occur via structural transition. Therefore, it is necessary to synthesize a transition metal oxide with a high specific surface area and a stable structure for supercapacitor application. Transition metal oxides with a perovskite structure control structural transition and improve conductivity. In this study, a NiMnO3 perovskite oxide with a high specific surface area and electrochemical properties was obtained via hydrothermal synthesis at low temperature. Hydrothermal synthesis was used to fabricate materials with an aqueous solution under high temperature and pressure. The shape and composition were regulated by controlling the hydrothermal synthesis reaction temperature and time. The synthesis of NiMnO3 was controlled by the reaction time to alter the specific surface area and morphology. The prepared perovskite NiMnO3 oxide with a three-dimensional structure can be used as an active electrode material for supercapacitors and electrochemical catalysts. The prepared NiMnO3 perovskite oxide showed a high specific capacitance of 99.03 F g-1 and excellent cycle stability with a coulombic efficiency of 77% even after 7000 cycles.
