Abstract- Here in, CeMoO4 nanostructure were successfully prepared by a co-precipitation route without capping agent. The characterization and morphological of as-prepared samples were examined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, filed emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. SEM and XRD results show that CeMoO4 nanostructure obtained with average nano-plate thickness 30 nm and average crystal size of 10 nm. The evaluations on CeMoO4-based electrodes revealed the material to have a specific capacitance (SC) of 327 F g−1 at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1, an energy density of 24.5 W h kg−1, and a high rate capability. Continues cyclic voltammetry evaluations using CeMoO4-based electrodes proved the electrodes to be capable of maintaining almost 96.3% of its initial SC after 4000 cycles. To the best of our knowledge, this study is considered as the start point of using lanthanide molybdates as an electrode materials for supercapacitors and the results obviously consent to outstanding properties of CeMoO4 for the mentioned application.
