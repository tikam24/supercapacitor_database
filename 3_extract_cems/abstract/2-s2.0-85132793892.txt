Quasi-solid-state electrolytes (QSSEs) via incorporating low-viscous ionic liquid (IL) into a copolymer matrix were fabricated for electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs). It is found the IL amount brings about notable effects on the structure, physicochemical properties of the QSSE and electrochemical performance of the EDLC. The QSSE based on optimized polymer/IL mass ratio exhibits acceptable ionic conductivity, favorable thermal/structural stability and wide operation potential window. Consequently, the constructed EDLC yields a high gravimetric specific energy, rapid and reversible charge/discharge capability and outstanding capacitance retention over long-term cycling at the cut-off voltage of 3.0 V.
