High energy density, durability, and flexibility of supercapacitors are required urgently for the next generation of wearable and portable electronic devices. Herein, a novel strategy is introduced to boost the energy density of flexible soild-state supercapacitors via rational design of hierarchically graphene nanocomposite (GNC) electrode material and employing an ionic liquid gel polymer electrolyte. The hierarchical graphene nanocomposite consisting of graphene and polyaniline-derived carbon is synthesized as an electrode material via a scalable process. The meso/microporous graphene nanocomposites exhibit a high specific capacitance of 176 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in the ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIBF4) with a wide voltage window of 3.5 V, good rate capability of 80.7% in the range of 0.5–10 A g−1 and excellent stability over 10 000 cycles, which is attributed to the superior conductivity (7246 S m−1), and quite large specific surface area (2416 m2 g−1) as well as hierarchical meso/micropores distribution of the electrode materials. Furthermore, flexible solid-state supercapacitor devices based on the GNC electrodes and gel polymer electrolyte film are assembled, which offer high specific capacitance of 180 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, large energy density of 75 Wh Kg−1, and remarkable flexible performance under consecutive bending conditions.
