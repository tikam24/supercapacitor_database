When hybrid energy storage technology is applied in different occasions, there are key problems in topology design and configuration optimization. For electromagnetic emission application scenarios with strict volume-weight constraints and large power-energy requirements, a hybrid energy storage group chopper discharge topology is designed, and its working principle and operation boundary are introduced. Then, taking the single maximum power demand, continuous maximum energy demand and multiple constraints of the transmitting load as the design input, the optimal con-figuration of supercapacitor and lithium battery is carried out. Taking the weight, volume and cost as the comprehensive optimization objectives, iterative approximation is carried out, and finally the optimal configuration solution of the hybrid energy storage system is obtained. The effectiveness of the topology is verified by simulation.
