The particulate matter (PM) pollution from vehicle exhaust is one of the main pollution sources in atmospheric environments. Triboelectric particular filter (TPF), coupling triboelectric effect and electrostatic absorption, can effectively controls the emission of nanoscale particulate matter in vehicle. In this work, the captured carbon collected by TPF presents regular graininess particles closed to 100 nm. It is designed as electrode material of the supercapacitor (SC) for energy storage. The SC directly fabricated by the captured carbon without any treatment process displays excellent capacitance performance, which capacitance remains stable during 100,000 continuous cycles. Furthermore, a self-powered system was integrated from triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and SCs, which can sustainably power an electronic watch by harvesting biomechanical energy. This work not only presents a novel method to reduce the particular nanoscale particle emission of vehicle but also provides a novel technique to reuse of the captured carbon as energy storage devices to achieve the recycling of waste and the environmental protection simultaneously.
