Abstract In this work, three dimensional Co9S8 nanorod@Ni(OH)2 nanosheet core-shell structure is directly fabricated on flexible carbon cloth by a simple low temperature hydrothermal method. This structure with good electrochemical performance could be applied for supercapacitor electrode material. Firstly, this three dimensional structure possesses high specific capacitance of 1620 F g-1, which is 1.7 times of the specific capacitance of the pure Ni(OH)2 electrode and 2.5 times of that of the pure Co9S8 electrode. Secondly, this hybrid electrode exhibits a very high energy density of 70.0 Wh Kg-1 at the power density of 305.7 W kg-1. In addition, the hybrid electrode displays good cycling stability with 104.5% of the initial capacitance after 2000 continuous cycles. Furthermore, the hybrid electrode with three dimensional structure possesses excellent flexibility and has almost the same cyclic voltammetry curve under different bending angles. Thus, the designed electrode holds great promises for light weight, flexible, high energy density supercapacitor applications.
