Due to the growing concerns regarding environmental and economic issues in power systems, nowadays the application of renewable energy sources (RES), especially wind energy has been increased. However, the increasing penetration of wind power plants (WPPs) into the grid has raised numerous challenges including output power fluctuations as well as the significant role these sources play in low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) in case of short circuit fault conditions. Energy storage systems (ESSs) are commonly employed to enhance WPP output power smoothing. On the other side, flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) can be utilized to enhance dynamic transients of the WPPs under short circuit contingencies. This paper presents the utilization of unified inter-phase power controller (UIPC) and the super-capacitor to fulfill the aforementioned challenges in connection of WPPs to the grid. To achieve this, a novel power control scheme is proposed to compensate for output power variations. The WPP model studied here is of doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) type wind turbine. Simulations and comparisons are performed in the MATLAB/SimulinkÂ® environment to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in smoothening WPP output power as well as enhancing their LVRT capability.
