Interconnected porous carbon nanosheet/nickel foam (PCNS/NF) composites were prepared directly from coal tar pitch on three-dimensional (3D) NF via microwave-assisted heating using Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O as template precursor coupled with in-situ KOH activation. For comparison, the electrochemical properties of porous carbon nanosheets (PCNS) prepared at the absence of 3D NF were also investigated. The specific capacitance of PCNS/NF reaches 3000 mF cm−2 at 0.6 mA cm−2 in 6 M KOH electrolyte, obviously higher than that of PCNS (1288 mF cm−2). Meanwhile, the contact resistance of PCNS/NF (0.74 Ohm) is smaller than that of PCNS (1.69 Ohm), and the charge transfer resistance of PCNS/NF (0.21 Ohm) is also smaller than that of PCNS (0.34 Ohm). This work provides an efficient method for the fabrication of composite electrode materials from coal tar pitch by using NF as framework for supercapacitors.
