The present investigation deals with controlled synthesis of nanostructured NiCo2O4 thin films directly on stainless steel substrates by facile and economical chemical bath deposition technique, without adding a surfactant or a binder. The consequences of different compositions of solvents on morphological and electrochemical properties have been studied systematically. We used different solvent composition as Double Distilled Water (DDW), DDW:Ethanol (1:1) and DDW: N, N dimethylformamide (1:1). The films have been named as NCO-W for DDW, NCO-WE for DDW: Ethanol (1:1) solvent and NCO-WD for DDW: N, N dimethylformamide (1:1) solvent. The morphologies of NiCo2O4 thin films modify substantially with change in a solvent. NCO-W exhibited the spikes of Crossandra infundibuliformis like nanostructures. The NCO-WE favored the formation of uniformly distributed leaf-like nanostructure whereas NCO-WD showed randomly oriented nanoplates all over the surface area. The Electrochemical performance of these NiCo2O4 thin films were studied using cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques. The NCO-W, NCO-WE and NCO-WD electrodes showed specific capacitance values of 271, 553 and 140 F/g respectively at the current density of 0.5 mA/cm2 and excellent capacitance retention of 90%, 91% and 80% after 2000 cycles for NCO-W, NCO-WE and NCO-WD samples respectively. This result reveals that NiCo2O4 is a prominent electrode material for supercapacitor application.
