In order to study the effect of carbonization temperature on the performance of carbon nanofiber electrode, polyacrylonitrile/linear phenolic resin(PAN/PF)nanofibers were prepared by the electrospinning method. Following this, carbon nanofibers (CNF) with different structures and properties were obtained by adopting different carbonization temperatures, which were used as electrode materials. The surface morphology, specific surface area, pore structure, graphitization degree and element content of the carbon nanofibers were measured and characterized. The results show that PAN/PF carbon nanofibers have high specific surface area, hierarchical porous structure, good fiber connectivity and excellent graphitization. When the carbonization temperature is 1 000℃, the specific surface area of CNF is as high as 1 468 m2/g, the total pore volume is as high as 0.89 cm3/g, and the specific capacitance of the corresponding electrode is as high as 395 F/g. When the carbonization temperature is 1 200℃, the conductivity of CNF is at its best (8.23 S/cm), and the corresponding electrode reaches the highest capability retaining rate (63%).
