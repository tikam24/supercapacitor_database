Due to high capacitance resulting from the redox character of the MnO<inf>2</inf>-PPy-carbon and V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf>-PANI-carbon fiber composites, a flexible wire-shaped fiber asymmetric supercapacitor (WFASC) was fabricated using these materials as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. Especially, the large work function difference between MnO<inf>2</inf> and V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf> help the device to exhibit a wide potential window of 2.0 V and a high areal capacitance of 0.613 F cm<sup>-2</sup>. As a result, the WFASC showed a maximum energy density of 0.340 mW h cm<sup>-2</sup> at a power density of 1.5 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> and a maximum power density of 30 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> at an energy density of 0.294 mW h cm<sup>-2</sup>. Furthermore, the device exhibited a perfect stability after 5000 cycles at a current density of 30 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, meanwhile, it could withstand the bending test and drive a LED under bending states. All of the above results prove the potential application of WFASC devices.
