Synthesis of functionalized mesoporous carbon by an easy-accessed method is of great importance towards its practical applications. Herein, an evaporation induced self-assembly/carbonization (EISAC) method was developed and applied to the synthesis of sulfonic acid group functionalized mesoporous carbon (SMC). The final mesoporous carbon obtained by EISAC method possesses wormlike mesoporous structure, uniform pore size (3.6 nm), large surface area of 735 m2/g, graphitic pore walls and rich sulfonic acid group. Moreover, the resultant mesoporous carbon achieves a superior electrochemical capacitive performances (216 F/g) to phenolic resin derived mesoporous carbon (OMC, 152 F/g) and commercial activated carbon (AC, 119 F/g).
