Proper selection of electrode material with sensible scheme is definitely significant to dodge commercial obstacles of supercapacitors. This challenge has been addressed by engineering prototype symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) device fabricated with enhanced supercapacitive vanadium (V) oxide integrated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) composite as electrode material with Li-ion associating LiClO4 electrolyte. The V2O5/MWCNTs composite with nanoscale architecture has been synthesized with inexpensive and simple chemical bath deposition (CBD) method. The cyclic voltammetry of SSC device has exhibited the involvement of electrochemically active reversible redox process in the composite. The specific capacitance of 569.7 F/g at scan rate of 2 mV/s including excellent electrochemical stability of 89.2% at 4000 CV cycles have been achieved with operating potential window of 2 V. Furthermore, the device exhibits excellent energy density of 62 Wh/kg and exceptional power density of 11.5 kW/kg. The low resistive factors have driven the device towards the potential application as glowing of red LED for 10 s.
