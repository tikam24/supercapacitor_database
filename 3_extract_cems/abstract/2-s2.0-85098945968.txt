Ionic liquids are regarded as one of the most prodigious materials for sustainable technological developments with superior performance and versatility. Hence, in this study, we have reported the design and synthesis of electroactive disubstituted ferrocenyl ionic liquids (Fc-ILs) with two different counter anions and demonstrated the significance of their anion tuneable physicochemical characteristics towards multifunctional electrochemical applications. The Fc-IL synthesized with chloride counter anion (Fc-Cl-IL) displays water-solubility and can be used as a redox additive in the fabrication of supercapacitor. Supercapacitor device with Fc-Cl-IL based redox electrolyte exhibits outstanding energy and power densities of 91 Wh kg−1 and 20.3 kW kg−1, respectively. Meanwhile, ferrocenyl IL synthesized with perchlorate anion (Fc-ClO4-IL) exhibits water-insolubility and can serve as a redox mediator towards construction of a glucose biosensor. The biosensor comprising Fc-ClO4-IL is able to detect glucose at an exceptionally lower potential of 0.2 V, with remarkable sensitivity and selectivity. This study implies that the introduction of electroactive ILs could afford supercapacitor devices with high energy and power densities and biosensors with less detection potential.
