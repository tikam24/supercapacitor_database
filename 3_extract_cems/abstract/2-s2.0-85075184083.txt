We present the design of a high-performance 2 V asymmetric supercapacitor made of graphene-based hybrid nanocomposites in 1 M KOH electrolyte. rGO-CNT-FeOOH (GC-F) was used as the cathode and rGO-CNC-MnO2 (GC-M) as the anode. Both composites well balanced each other in the asymmetric device and gave a high electrochemical performance. The energy density of this ASC is 66.6 W h kg-1 at 3.8 kW kg-1 power density with an excellent capacitance retention of 88% after 3000 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles.
