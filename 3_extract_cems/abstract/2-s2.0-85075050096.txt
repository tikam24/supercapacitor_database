An electrochemical exfoliation method adopted in this study presents the variations quality of GO produced under different applied voltages. The GOs production was characterized using FESEM, AFM, micro-Raman, FT-IR, and UV–Vis spectroscopies. Further characterizations were done using I-V, C-V, mechanical, and TGA analysis. As evident, GOs at 10 V shows the highest quality and several thin GO layers produced with moderate crystallinity of 0.91. In this study, GOs filled in the nanocomposites synthesized at 5 to 10 V shows higher electrical conductivity and acceptable capacitance performance at approximate ~×10− 5 to ×10− 7 S cm− 1 and up to 2.5–103 F g− 1, respectively. These thin films paved the way and great potential to be implemented as flexible electrodes materials in supercapacitor application.
