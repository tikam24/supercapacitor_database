High-performance electrode materials with high capacitance and excellent stability are critically important to flexible advanced asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs). Among various electrode materials, MnO2 is emerging as an advanced cathode material for ASCs. However, the poor electrical conductivity and low cation diffusivity of MnO2 severely limit its energy density and rate performance. Herein, we constitute the demonstration of using titanium nitride (TiN) nanowires as conductive scaffolds to markedly promote the capacitive performance of MnO2. At a high current density of 2 mA cm−2, the TiN@MnO2 core shell nanowires yield a significant areal capacitance of 352.5 mF cm−2. Furthermore, a wearable high energy density ASC device is fabricated by using the as-obtained TiN@MnO2 core shell nanowires as cathode and TiN nanowires as anode. The TiN@MnO2//TiN-ASC device delivers a remarkable volumetric energy density of 0.55 mWh cm−3 and excellent rate capability as well as outstanding cycle performance.
