Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) gained large attention in the research community in various sectors including water treatment, catalysis, medical, agriculture, display devices and energy storage devices (batteries and supercapacitors). CNT for achieving desired properties has been attempted in almost all fields of science and engineering. In the present chapter, we will highlight the different techniques used to functionalize the CNTs. We will also discuss the various application of pristine and functionalized CNT. The effect of functional groups in CNTs to tune the efficiency of various devices such as supercapacitors, batteries and water electrolysis will also be discussed.
