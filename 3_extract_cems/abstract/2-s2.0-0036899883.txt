Studies on redox supercapacitors employing electronically conducting polymers are of great importance for hybrid power sources and pulse power applications. In the present study, polyaniline (PANI) has been potentiodynamically deposited on stainless steel substrate and characterized in a gel polymer electrolyte (GPE). Use of the GPE facilitates a voltage limit of the capacitor to 1 V, instead of 0.75 V in aqueous electrolytes. From charge-discharge studies of the solid-state PANI capacitors, a specific capacitance of 250 F g-1 has been obtained at a specific power of 7.5 kW kg-1 of PANI. The values of specific capacitance and specific power are considerably higher than those reported in the literature. High energy and high power characteristics of the PANI are presented.
