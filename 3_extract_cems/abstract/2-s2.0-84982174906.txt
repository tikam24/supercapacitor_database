Three-dimensionally porous oxide composite materials have recently attracted increasing interest because of their exciting potential in electrochemical energy conversion and storage. Herein, novel carbon-NiCoO2 microsphere composites with a pitaya-type structure have been prepared for the first time via a one-pot hydrothermal synthesis followed by annealing treatment. These composite microspheres are composed of NiCoO2 nanoparticles inserted into porous carbon microspheres. Furthermore, the prepared carbon-NiCoO2 electrodes exhibit excellent rate capacity when used as supercapacitor electrodes. Under a current density of 1 and 10 A g-1, the optimized composite electrode exhibits specific capacitance of 507 and 390 F g-1, respectively. The excellent electrochemical properties can possibly be attributed to the intrinsic nature of NiCoO2, the ultrafine NiCoO2 particles, and sufficient space being available to interact with the electrolyte. This facile synthesis method may be extended to prepare other carbon-based metal oxides, which may find application in catalysts and adsorption due to their unique structural features.
