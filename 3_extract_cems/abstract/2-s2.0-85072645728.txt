The specific surface area, pore volume, and pore size distribution of biomass-derived porous carbon are crucial factors when they are applied in energy and gas storage. Each application has specific requirements, and a large number of porous carbons with various characteristics have been designed to tailor their applications. In this work, using Neolamarckia cadamba (NC) as the starting material, a simple method is applied to synthesize hierarchically porous carbon with a high specific surface area (2743-3462 m2 g-1) and a large pore volume (1.09-1.67 cm3 g-1). The various characteristics of porous carbon caused by varying degrees of activation have great potential in supercapacitors and hydrogen storage. Applied as an electrode material, NC-4700, activated at a KOH/C ratio of 4 and 700 °C, exhibits a high specific capacitance of 411 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 with a long-term stability of 97% after 20 000 cycles at 20 A g-1 in a three-electrode system. As for hydrogen storage, NC-3800, activated at a KOH/C ratio of 3 and 800 °C, is more suitable and shows a capacity of 2.81 wt % at 1 bar and 77 K, which is a relatively high hydrogen uptake at low pressure. Porous carbon with various activation levels is more suitable for different applications, which is of great significance for its multifunctional applications.
