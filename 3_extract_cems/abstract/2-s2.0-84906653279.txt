Amorphous nickel oxide-carbon composite powders have been prepared using a facile spray-drying process. The nickel nitrate-citrate hydrate precursor powders were transformed into an amorphous NiO-carbon composite powder through a post-treatment at 250°C for 1 h. The excellent supercapacitor performance of the amorphous NiO-carbon composite powder can be ascribed to the unique electrochemical behavior of the ultrafine amorphous NiO nanoclusters. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
