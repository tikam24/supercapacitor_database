Microglobules of polyaniline (PANi) synthesized by chemical bath method on commercial steel plates that have been used as the catalyst support for tungsten trioxide (WO3) particles fabricated by hydrothermal method. The crystalline phases and surface analysis of the WO3, PANi and WO3/PANi film were examined using x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, while electrochemical capacitive properties were determined using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD). The PANi incorporated WO3 film influences significant catalytic performance wherein a pseudo-capacitor was obtained. The constant phase element was considerably eliminated in WO3/PANi hybrid film. The cyclic stability was scrutinized via GCD technique. The degradation of specific capacitance observed low (2.61%) after 3000 GCD cycles, indicating superior cycling stability of WO3/PANi supercapacitor.
