Our paper highlights the role of supercapacitors in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), the current response to the worldwide demand for a clean and low fuel-consuming transport. The main strategies for increasing the specific energy of supercapacitors, which are electrochemical energy storage/conversion systems of high-specific power, are discussed, with the focus on electrode material, electrolyte and electrode/electrolyte interface properties. Particular emphasis is given to the use of ionic liquids (IL), which are attracting much attention as green and solvent-free electrolytes, and to the development of high-voltage, IL-based hybrid supercapacitor with high surface area carbon negative electrode and poly(3-methylthiophene) positive. Based on the results of laboratory cells featuring N-butyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide and 1-ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonylimide) ILs, the specific energies of hybrid supercapacitor modules are evaluated and compared to those expected for double-layer carbon supercapacitors displaying the same ILs.
