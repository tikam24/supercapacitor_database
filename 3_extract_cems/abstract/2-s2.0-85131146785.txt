We report a triple hybrid electrode (MXene/activated carbon (AC)/polyoxometalates (POMs)) combining the merits of three materials: MXene (high volumetric capacitance), AC (high gravimetric capacitance) and Phosphotungstate (fast redox). Phosphotungstic acid (HPW12) and tetraethylammonium phosphotungstate (TEAPW12) were the two POMs used to prepare MXene/AC/POMs triple hybrids. MXene/AC/TEAPW12 outperformed MXene/AC/HPW12 in 1 M tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEABF4)/acetonitrile. Nano-dispersion of POMs facilitates charge storage through surface capacitive processes (91% at 2 mV s−1). MXene/AC/TEAPW12 delivered significantly higher gravimetric capacitance (87F g−1 at 1 mV s−1) than MXene (40F g−1 at 1 mV s−1) in the same organic electrolyte, without sacrificing much volumetric capacitance (less than 10%). The gravimetric capacitance of the triple hybrid was similar to that of MXene/AC, whereas its volumetric capacitance was 1.5 times higher. Replacing TEA cations with 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium cations (EMIM+), the capacitance improved by 21%. Coupled with AC positive electrodes in an asymmetric cell, MXene/AC/TEAPW12 delivered 4.6 times higher gravimetric energy density and 3.5 times higher volumetric energy density than a similar MXene asymmetric cell at relatively high-power densities. This study proves that MXene/AC/TEAPW12 combines the merits and compensates for the demerits of each component and is a promising electrode material for organic-electrolyte supercapacitors.
