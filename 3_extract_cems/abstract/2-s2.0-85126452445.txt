As research on new technologies for the creation of flexible electrochemical energy storage systems continues, they are widely used in industries such as public portable devices, mobile electronics, and electronic products worldwide. Flexible supercapacitors (FSCs) are widely used in wearable electronics and medical fields, with high power density, excellent mechanical integrity and cycle stability. Researchers devoted a lot of time in recent years promoting several kinds of transition metal oxides (TMOs) for SCs. Organometallic frameworks (MOFs) are commonly utilized for the production of metal oxide-based electrodes for high-performance SCs as precursors or templates. These MOF-based metal oxides have a porous and adjustable structure, a large specific surface area, strong electrical conductivity, and good electrochemical stability, and they fulfil the specific capacitance and long-cycle power requirements of electrochemical double-layer capacitors. The latest developments in the production and application of MOF-derived metallic oxide compounds in FSCs are summarized in this study.
