Tuning the composition and microstructure of heterogeneous nanocomposites is an effective way to get high-performance electrode materials. In this study, we demonstrate an optimized structural-engineering strategy to fabricate the core-shell Cu2-xS @ CoS2 (CCS) nanowire array to maximize the electrochemical properties of composite materials. Structure and composition of the resultant are determined by various characterization methods, like transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. When applied as electrode material, the well-designed CCS sample exhibits large reversible capacity (1007 F g−1 at 2 A g−1) and superior cycling stability (113.6% over 5000 cycles). Assembled asymmetric supercapacitor employing CCS and reduced graphene oxide electrode also shows high energy density (35.4 W h kg−1) and power density (8250 W kg−1), as well as excellent cycling performance (104.7% after 8000 cycles). Microscopic characterizations and electrochemical measurements demonstrate that the excellent supercapacitive performance is attributed to the abundant reactive sites originated from the synergistic effects between the heterogeneous composition and superior structural stability from ingenious core-shell nanowires.
