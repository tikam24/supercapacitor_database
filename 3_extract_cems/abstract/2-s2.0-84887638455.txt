TiO2/C tube in tube nanocomposite was fabricated by anodic oxidization, hydrothermal reaction and successive annealing. This top open nanotube arrays with a conductive carbon layer and order pore structure offer a large effective surface area and a facility channel for electrolyte, which ensures the high capacitance and perfect long ability.
