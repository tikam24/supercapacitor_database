Photovoltaic power generation is changing day by day, but its system has drawbacks. To compensate for the shortcomings of PV power generation system, the micro-grid system of PV power generation with HES is constructed by using the complementary characteristics of battery and supercapacitor. On the basis of this, we introduce a fuzzy control to realize the fast response of hybrid energy system. A micro-grid model is built based on Matlab/Simulink to verify the feasibility and rationality of the proposed control strategy.
