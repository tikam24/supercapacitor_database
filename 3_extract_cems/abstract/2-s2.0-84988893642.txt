This paper gives performance analysis of a novel Supercap (Superacitor) based energy harvesting battery charging device operated by a Maglev (Magnetic Levitation) VAWT (Vertical Axis Wind Turbine). A 200W PMSG (Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator) was adopted into the system. A 9 bladed hybrid VAWT, with a radius of 15.5cm and a height of 60cm, was driven at a fixed wind speed of 5m/s. The rated power (W), voltage (V) and diameter (cm) of PMSG were 200, 12 and 16 respectively. Data Acquisition, NIUSB-6009, was used interfacing with Labview software to collect the reading from sensors. 3 cases have been compared for performance analysis. "Case A" showed a battery of 6V, 3.2AH, being charged from 4.2V to 5V through a DC DC converter followed by a series of 4 Supercapacitors (2.7V, 35F). "Case B" and "Case C" demonstrated the direct charging of the battery; where "Case B" was experimented with the converter and "Case C" was without converter. Taking "Case C" as a reference, the result showed an increase of 21% of the charging time while charging through Supercapacitor. Case A, Supercap based charging, was also found to be 133% more efficient than direct battery charging with a converter. For a low voltage small VAWT system, this novel energy harvesting circuit could bring a significant improvement that can help off-grid areas where on-grid system is not approachable.
