In this study, a facile and low cost free-template hydrothermal precipitation method was used to synthesize mesoporous Ni-Co based bimetallic carbonates (CO3)2- and/or hydroxides (OH)−micro/nanostructures with different morphologies (1D, 2D and 3D) based on variant stoichiometric compositions. The effect of the growth temperature, synthesis time as well as the Ni/Co-precursors ratio on the physico-chemical properties and faradic electrochemical behavior of these products was investigated. The as-obtained bi-phase nanohybrids were characterized extensively structurally and morphologically. The textural analysis results confirmed the presence of mesoporous products with a BET-SSA ∼50 m2 g−1 (0.52 cm3 g−1 pore volume) for the 3D urchin-like structure and a BET-SSA ∼ 47.14 m2 g−1 (0.31 cm3 g−1 pore volume) was obtained for the 2D nanoflakes structure. The electrochemical measurements performed in a 6.0 MKOH aqueous electrolyte depicted excellent electrochemical performance ascribed to the optimized composition of Ni-Co LDH (or α-Ni(OH)2) with Co2(OH)3Cl and their unique hierarchical mesoporous nanoflake and urchin-like architectures. In addition, an exceptionally notable specific capacitances (capacities) of 1700 F g−1 (161 mAh.g−1) and 1379 F g−1 (192 mAh.g−1) were obtained for both structures at 5 mV s−1 scan rate (0.5 A g−1 gravimetric current density) respectively. These are much better than mono - hydroxides synthesized in same conditions with 351 F g−1 (90 mAh.g−1) for Ni and 216 F g−1 (21.5 mAh.g−1) for Co. A good cyclic stability of ∼98% after 2000 charge-discharge cycles at 30 A g−1 was recorded depicting their potential as suitable materials for energy storage devices.
