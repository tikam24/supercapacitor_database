High-performance electrode materials were obtained by isomorphism and intercalation methods, resulting in multi-types of redox reaction centers and a bridge for charge transfer. Some of the Co ions (clusters) were replaced by Ni ions with little difference in radius and different types of redox reactions were constructed. At the same time, the introduction of 2-methylbenzimidazole in the intercalation of two-dimensional (2D) Ni/Co-MOF accelerated the charge transfer. The synthetic composite electrode material exhibited high specific capacitance of 2422.7 F g-1 at a current density of 1.0 A g-1 in three systems and cycle retention of 86% after 3000 cycles. An asymmetric supercapacitor device assembled with the composite material and activated carbon exhibited a maximum energy density of 82.8 W h kg-1 at a power density of 700 W kg-1, showing that the composite has good potential application value.
