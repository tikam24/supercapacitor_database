Nanostructural nickel hydroxide electrode doped with cobalt hydroxide was prepared by directly depositing nickel hydroxide on the surface of foam nickel using electrochemical deposition technology. The characterization of the nickel hydroxide electrode was studied by X-ray diffraction(XRD), scanning electron microscopy(SEM), energy-dispersive spectrometry(EDS), and constant-current charge-discharge, cyclic voltammetry(CV) and AC impedance(IMP). The results show that α-type nickel hydroxide doped with quantitative cobalt hydroxide can be prepared by electrochemical co-deposition method, the samples are composed of many uniform 3D flowerlike nanostructures formed by dozens of flakelike nanopetals or nanowires, moderate cobalt hydroxide additive can significantly improve specific capacitance and cycle performance of α-type nickel hydroxide electrode. The study also found that nickel hydroxide electrode with cobalt hydroxide has higher discharge potential and the overpotential of oxygen precipitation, and also has higher proton diffusion coefficient and lower diffusion impedance.
