The porous activated carbon nanosheet derived from Syzygium oleana leaves biomass was prepared by one-stage integrated pyrolysis through both carbonization and physical activation for supercapacitor electrode as energy storage application. Carbonization was performed in three different temperatures, including 500°C, 600°C, and 700°C. The 1M potassium hydroxide was selected to produce activated carbon progressively. Importantly, the surface morphology and the samples were characterized by Scanning electron microscopy at a voltage of 15kV and nitrogen adsorption/desorption at a temperature of 77K. The results showed a like-flower nanosheets structure decorated by nanofiber increases the surface area of activated carbon from 216 m2 g-1 to 1218m2 g-1 with tuneable well-confirmed mesopores sizes. Degree of crystallinity and chemical composition also were characterized by using X-ray diffraction and Energy dispersive spectroscopy. Furthermore, electrochemical measurements had the best performances with a high specific capacitance of 188F g-1 at two-electrode system with a scan rate of 1mV s-1.
