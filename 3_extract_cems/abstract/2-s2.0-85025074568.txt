A bioinspired soft and stretchable triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is developed as energy-harvesting skin to drive personal electronics by scavenging biomechanical energy. Drawn inspiration from biological cells, the TENG consists of patterned interconnected cellular structures, with physiological saline as the electrode and silicone rubber as the encapsulation and triboelectric layer. The TENG can withstand a strain of 600% and has a transmittance of as high as 62.5%. The TENG can keep its high performance under various strain. The TENG also has the desirable features of biocompatibility, simple fabrication, light weight and environmental protection. The maximum instantaneous power density (2.3 Hz) and direct current power density of the TENG are ~ 11.6 W/m2 and ~ 2.65 mW/m2 respectively. Mounted on the skin, the TENG integrating with a power management unit can sustainably drive an electronic watch sorely by harvesting energy from hand motion. A stretchable self-charging power unit with a TENG and a micro supercapacitor sharing the same solution is created, with the solution as both the electrode of the TENG and the electrolyte of the supercapacitor. This work opens up new insights for clean power sources of skin-mounted electronics and promotes the development of sustainable energy supply for wearable and portable electronics.
