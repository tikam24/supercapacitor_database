Preparation of free-standing electrode materials with three-dimensional network architecture has emerged as an effective strategy for acquiring advanced portable and wearable power sources. Herein, graphene/vanadium oxide (GR/V2O5) free-standing monolith composite has been prepared via a simple hydrothermal process. Flexible GR sheets acted as binder to connect the belt-like V2O5 for assembling three-dimensional network architecture. The obtained GR/V2O5 composite can be reshaped into GR/V2O5 flexible film which exhibits more compact structure by ultrasonication and vacuum filtration. A high specific capacitance of 358 F g−1 for GR/V2O5 monolith compared with that of GR/V2O5 flexible film (272 F g−1) has been achieved in 0.5 mol L−1 K2SO4 solution when used as binder free electrodes in three-electrode system. An asymmetrical supercapacitor has been assembled using GR/V2O5 monolith as positive electrode and GR monolith as negative electrode, and it can be reversibly charged-discharged at a cell voltage of 1.7 V in 0.5 mol L−1 K2SO4 electrolyte. The asymmetrical capacitor can deliver an energy density of 26.22 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 425 W kg−1, much higher than that of the symmetrical supercapacitor based on GR/V2O5 monolith electrode. Moreover, the asymmetrical supercapacitor preserves 90% of its initial capacitance over 1000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g−1.
