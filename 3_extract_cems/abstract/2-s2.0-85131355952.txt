The safe disposal and resource utilization of biomass waste are of great significance. For the first time, we have prepared penicillin fermentation residue (PR) N self-doped porous carbon through hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) combined with activation. Mild HTC method keeps stable carbon skeleton, rich nitrogen and oxygen functional groups. The hydrochar is activated as a precursor material to realize high specific surface area and naturally doped nitrogen. At 600 ℃, the hierarchical porous carbons obtained with KOH and ZnCl2 as activators are BC@KOH600 and BC@ZnCl2600, with specific surface areas of 615.68 m2/g and 792.58 m2/g, respectively. The porous carbon prepared with ZnCl2 as an activator has higher N content than KOH. BC@ZnCl2600 has 4.75% N content, among which Pyridine-N is up to 36%. The BC@KOH600 and BC@ZnCl2600 supercapacitors have specific capacitances of 160.3 F/g and 209.2 F/g at 1.0 A/g in the three-electrode system, respectively, which display excellent rate performance and cycle stability. The BC@KOH600 and BC@ZnCl2600 symmetric supercapacitor, constructed with a two-electrode configuration, shows an energy density of 8.55 Wh kg−1 and 8.79 Wh kg−1 respectively and outstanding capacitance retention of 91.01% and 87.98% after 10,000 charge-discharge cycles at 5.0 A/g in an aqueous 6 M KOH electrolyte system. These results demonstrate a very effective method for the preparation of porous carbon using antibiotic residue for supercapacitors, which also provides a solution for the treatment of similar hazardous biomass wastes.
