Recent developments in the field of supercapacitors have led to the achievement of high specific energy and high specific power devices. Due to capacitances of several hundred farads and serial resistances of less than one milliohm, these new components are suitable for energy storage in high power electronic applications, especially in the field of management of embarked electrical power (hybrid power sources, energy recovery). This paper presents theory, characterisation and experimental validation of an accurate electric double-layer supercapacitor model based on the physics of phenomena governing charges storage, which theoretically leads to a transmission line with voltage dependant distributed capacitance.
