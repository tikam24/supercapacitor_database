ZnCo 2 O 4 -rGO composite with intertwined sheets grown onto nickel foam substrate is prepared through a facile hydrothermal deposition and followed thermal annealing treatment, which can be directly employed as binder free electrode of supercapacitor. The hierarchically porous texture of ZnCo 2 O 4 -rGO composite with high specific surface area and efficient ions diffusion channels ensures sufficient faradic reaction of ZnCo 2 O 4 component, therefore enables an ultrahigh electrode specific capacitance (C s ) of 3222 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 in alkali electrolyte, and the C s still retains to be 860 F g −1 at 20 A g −1 . When used as positive electrode of full cell, the ZnCo 2 O 4 -rGO//activated carbon (AC) asymmetric supercapacitor can offer a maximum device specific capacitance (C cell ) of 139 F g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 and therefore an energy density (E cell ) of 49.1 Wh kg −1 at power density (P cell ) of 400 W kg −1 . Even at high P cell of 7625 W kg −1 , the E cell of the asymmetric device can still retain to be 18.8 Wh kg −1 . More significantly, the asymmetric supercapacitor demonstrates only 6% C cell fade subjected to 5000 successive charge-discharge cycles. The balanced E cell , P cell delivery abilities and high cycleability highlight the potential of the faradic ZnCo 2 O 4 -rGO composite in high performance and long lifetime energy storage devices.
