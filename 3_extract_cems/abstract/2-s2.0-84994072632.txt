The porous nanostructured material is a prime requirement of energy storage devices, as it contributes maximum surface area for charge storage. In present paper, a simple and cost effective electrodeposition route has been adopted to prepare highly porous sponge-like selenium thin films. The selenium surface displays porous nanostructure with specific surface area of 35.9 m2 g−1 and suitable pore size, providing auspicious trails for transportation as well as penetration of electrolyte ions. The structural study confirms the formation of trigonal structure. The electrochemical properties of selenium films are reported. The film exhibits maximum specific capacitance (Cs) of 29.25 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 scan rate in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte along with electrochemical stability of 91% after 1000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles. This investigation implies that selenium thin films in composite form may be useful for charge storage applications.
