We explore the effect of solvation and micropore structure on the energy storage performance of electrical double layer capacitors using constant potential molecular dynamics simulations of realistically modeled nanoporous carbon electrodes and ionic liquid/organic solvent mixtures. We show that the time-dependent charging profiles of electrodes with larger pores reach the plateau regime faster, while the charging time has a nonmonotonic dependence on ion concentration, mirroring the composition dependence of bulk electrolyte conductivity. When the average pore size of the electrode is similar to or slightly larger than the size of a solvated ion, the solvation enhances ion electrosorption into nanopores by disrupting anion-cation coordination and decreasing the barrier to counterion penetration while blocking the co-ions. In these systems, areal capacitance exhibits a significant nonmonotonic dependence on ion concentration, in which capacitance increases with the introduction of solvent in the concentrated regime followed by a decrease with further dilution. This gives rise to a maximum in capacitance at intermediate dilution levels. When pores are significantly larger than solvated ions, capacitance maximum weakens and eventually disappears. These findings provide novel insights on the combined effect of electrolyte composition and electrode pore size on the charging kinetics and equilibrium behavior of realistically modeled electrical double layer capacitors. Generalization of the approach developed here can facilitate the rational optimization of material properties for electrical double layer capacitor applications.
