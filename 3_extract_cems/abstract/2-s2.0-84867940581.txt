Because there are great differences between different kinds of electrochemical supercapacitor's working principles, the mechanism analysis method is not suitable to model the electrochemical supercapacitor due to its poor generality. In this paper, a new model of electrochemical supercapacitor based on system identification was presented. Firstly, the sampling period and length of the experimental data were calculated and wavelet analysis was used to filter the data. Secondly, the determinant ratio was adopted to determine the model's order. Then the parameters of the model were identified. Finally, the model was simulated and verified. The experimental and simulated results prove that the modeling method is feasible and effective and the model presented can depict the characteristics of supercapacitor exactly. In addition, the filtered data can greatly improve the precision of the model.
