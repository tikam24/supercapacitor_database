In this work, self-charging pouch-type hybrid supercapacitor (HSCs) is fabricated by extrinsic integration of wind and solar energy power systems. Initially, the synthesized mesoporous 3D-rhombohedral Mn2O3 shows a specific capacity of 37.61 mA h g−1 in KOH plus redox additives electrolyte. Further, the oxygen vacancy of Mn2O3 is tuned by fast-reduction (FR) and mild-reduction (MR) techniques. The rich oxygen vacancy of FR-Mn2O3 (rich Ov-Mn2O3) exhibits a specific capacity of 66.64 mA h g−1. On the other hand, the different morphologies of Cu2SnS3@SnS are synthesized by time-dependent solvothermal technique. The 3D-microsphere Cu2SnS3@SnS shows higher electrochemical performance than the others. In order to further improve the electrochemical performance, the heterostructure of rich Ov-Mn2O3@Cu2SnS3@SnS composite is prepared that provides a maximum specific capacity of 126.07 mA h g−1 at 8 mA cm−2 and rate capability of 66.09% with retention of 93.89% after 10 000 cycles. This is ascribing to high electrical/ionic conductivity, larger faradaic reactions, lower interfacial resistance, and synergistic effect. Then, the fabricated pouch-type HSC delivers a maximum specific energy density of 47.97 Wh kg−1 and power density of 5120 W kg−1. Finally, the pouch HSCs are employed for practical self-charging applications.
