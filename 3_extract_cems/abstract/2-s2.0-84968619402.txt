In this study, advantages and disadvantages of supercapacitors and batteries which are energy storing sources were examined and furthermore, energy density, voltage and current behaviors of 6 serial connected supercapacitors and 6 serial connected battery sequences were compared. While establishing these circuits, full shunting balancing methods were used. When 4 units of 6 serial connected batteries/supercapacitors reached to the 100% charged level, system passed to discharging mode from charging mode and total charge ratios of the systems were calculated.
