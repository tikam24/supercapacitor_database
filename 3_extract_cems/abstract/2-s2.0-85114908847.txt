Mesocrystals have received intense attention in the electrochemical energy storage field owing to their favourable electronic conductivity, high crystallinity and large specific surface area. However, a critical limitation to the wide applications of mesocrystals is the lack of a facile synthesis approach for high-performance mesocrystals. Here, we report a one-step self-assembly solvothermal method to prepare 3D hierarchical highly-ordered Nb3O7F nanowire cluster mesocrystals (denoted NOF-NCMs), of which the diameter of each nanowire is within 10 nm. Through kinetic analysis, NOF-NCMs can be confirmed to provide unique intercalation pseudocapacitance, enabling rapid charge transfer. When used as an anode material, the NOF-NCM electrode displays a high capacity of ∼356.7 mAh g−1at 800 mA g−1, excellent rate performance and a long cycle life with ∼88.3% capacity retention after 3000 cycles. The improved electrochemical properties of NOF-NCMs are attributed to the unique highly-ordered nanowire cluster architectures. A lithium ion capacitor (LIC) is constructed by using well-prepared NOF-NCMs as an anode and commercial AC as a cathode. The NOF-NCMs//AC LIC can hold a maximum energy density of 74.5 W h kg−1at 87.5 W kg−1, and has a long cycle lifespan with a 92.5% capacity retention after 3000 cycles and low self-discharge rate, demonstrating a bright candidate for applications in both high-energy and high-power electrochemical energy storage.
