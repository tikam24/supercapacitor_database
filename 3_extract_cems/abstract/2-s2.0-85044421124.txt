This paper presents a unique control strategy for reducing the number of charge/discharge cycles of a battery in a standalone photovoltaic system with Direct Current (DC) loads. The fluctuation in both photovoltaic power and load power affects the DC bus voltage. Regulation of DC link voltage leads to a random and frequent charging/discharging profile for the battery, which in turn has a detrimental effect on the life of the battery. The proposed scheme involves a two layered voltage regulation for the DC voltage by incorporating a supercapacitor along with the battery. Two different control methods, namely, Integer order Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) and Fractional order PID, have been designed for the proposed system, and their performance has been discussed. Simulations of the proposed system with two different control methods are implemented in MATLAB for validating the proposed control algorithm, and its performance under various operating conditions of the load has been analyzed.
