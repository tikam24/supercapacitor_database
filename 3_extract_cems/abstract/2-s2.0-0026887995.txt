Solid state electrolyte generators (batteries as well as supercapacitors) can find several applications of major interest for electric utilities. Even if the electric vehicle is still the main goal, other needs for signalization, communications, standby power, substation powering, high quality voltage grids, can be fulfilled with the proposed characteristics of these generators. As far as electric traction is concerned, the first objective would be the realization and testing of a prototype in the range of 1 kWh which can be linked to the traction system for an electric scooter. The requirements and expectations of solid state batteries are described in relation with the application considered. Â© 1992.
