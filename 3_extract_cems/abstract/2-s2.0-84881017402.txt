The carbon aerogel(CA) is prepared via sol-gel process, then treat it in the following three ways: activate by nitric acid; composite with polypyrrole (PPY) by chemical oxidation polymerization; composite after activation. Explore the effects of these approaches. Constitution and morphology of these materials were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscope and scanning electron microscope. The electrochemical performances of materials were tested by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge test, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic test. The results show that the best treatment process is composite after activation. The specific capacitance is two times higher than CA, the specific capacitance reaches 311 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV/s; after 1000 cycles the specific capacitance nearly at a fixed high value; the conductivity is also improved.
