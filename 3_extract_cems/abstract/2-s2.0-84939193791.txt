A novel manganese dioxide-carbon fiber composite with coaxial cable structure is successfully prepared by a direct redox reaction with KMnO<inf>4</inf> and carbon fiber. The composite is combined by carbon fiber cable tracer and MnO<inf>2</inf> cable jacket and it is investigated by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The supercapacitor performance of the composite is tested by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic charge-discharge. Its initial capacitance is 196 F g<sup>-1</sup> at the current density of 0.6 A g<sup>-1</sup>. The coulombic efficiency is almost 100% with the capacitance above 131.3 F g<sup>-1</sup> during the continuous 10,000 cycles. The results indicate that the composite has high capacitance retention and a superior coulombic efficiency at long cycles. It is a promising canadiate for supercapacitor in practical applications.
