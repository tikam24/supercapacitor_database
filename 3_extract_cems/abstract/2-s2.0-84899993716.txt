In this study, we demonstrated the formation of nanoarchitectures of nest like Ni3S2 grown directly on Ni foam by a one pot hydrothermal route and used it as a binder free electrode for high performance supercapacitors. The formation of Ni3S2 on the Ni foam is confirmed by the X-ray diffraction analysis. Field emission scanning electron microscope study revealed the formation of nest like Ni3S2 grown on the Ni foam has been obtained by the hydrothermal method. A plausible mechanism for the formation of Ni3S2 phase is discussed. The electrochemical properties of the as prepared Ni3S2/Ni electrodes are studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge analysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies. The CV study revealed the presence of redox peaks suggesting the pseudocapacitive nature of the prepared Ni3S2/Ni electrode. Galvanostatic charge-discharge analysis showed a maximum specific capacitance of 1293F/g was achieved for the Ni3S2/Ni electrodes at a constant current density of about 5mA/cm2. Further, EIS results (such as Nyquist and Bode plots) confirmed the pseudocapacitive nature of the Ni3S2/Ni electrode. The experimental results suggested the design of hierarchical nanostructures of Ni3S2 grown on Ni foam as a binder free electrode material will be an ideal candidate for supercapacitor applications.
