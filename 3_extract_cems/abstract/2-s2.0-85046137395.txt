The carbon film over the current collector in supercapacitor requires high internal surface area, and favourable access to the internal surface through pore network. This work describes the electrospray of polymeric sol on current collector, followed by in situ curing, drying and carbonization for making carbon film electrodes. In particular, the use of highly volatile (organic) solvent is economical in many ways. On the contrary, the electrospray of aqueous sol has to be followed by solvent removal protocol such as slow evaporation under ambient condition, or lyophilisation. However, the removal of solvent at controlled rate may leave significant mesoporosity in the final film. The specific capacitance of such carbon electrode from aqueous sol is found to be 200 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 of current density using 2 M KOH as electrolyte.
