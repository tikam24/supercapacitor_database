As one of new electrical energy storage systems, supercapacitors possess higher energy density than conventional capacitors and larger power density than batteries, integrating substantial merits with high energy, large power delivery, long cycle life, obvious safety, and low cost. However, the unsatisfying energy density is the inhabiting issue for the wide commercial applications. As the energy density (E, W h kg−1) is directly proportional to specific capacitance (C, F g−1) and the square of operating voltage (V, V), in this review, we summarize the recent progress in two sections: the exploration of high-performance electrode materials to achieve high specific capacitance and the construction of high-voltage supercapacitor systems for high working voltage. The progressive explorations and developments in supercapacitors could guide the future research towards high-performance, low-cost, and safe energy storage devices.
