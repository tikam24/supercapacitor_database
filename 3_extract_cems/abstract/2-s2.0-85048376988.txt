Novel zinc-nickel-cobalt ternary oxide nanosheets were successfully synthesized via an easy solvothermal method followed by calcination and were tailored to have different numbers of wrinkles by controlling the volume ratio of the components in the mixed solvent. Nanosheets with more wrinkles yielded a large specific surface area(111.61 m2/g), which improved their electrochemical properties. The resulting products were characterized using a three-electrode system in 6 mol/L KOH electrolyte solution. With unique structures, the nanosheets with more wrinkles displayed a good capacitive behavior and an excellent specific capacitance retention of 97.18% after 2000 continuous charge-discharge cycles. Considering their high electrochemical performance and simple fabrication, we proposed that these unique zinc-nickel-cobalt oxide nanosheets are promising supercapacitor electrodes for energy storage applications.
