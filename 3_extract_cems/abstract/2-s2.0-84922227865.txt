Any interruption in the power supply can lead to significant environmental and economic damage. One of the most sensitive elements of the oil production (in terms of sensitivity to a power failure) are units with submersible electric submersible pumps (ESP), which is controlled most often by adjustable speed drive. In this paper discusses reasons of short-term power failure that can disrupt the stability of the dynamic stability, as well as suggested ride-through solutions for asynchronous motor with adjustable speed drive. Presented graphs obtained by modeling in MATLab Simulink.
