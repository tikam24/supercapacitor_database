Three-dimensional (3D) monolithic structures (i.e., aerogels/sponges/scaffolds) assembled from fragmented electrospun nanofiber mats/membranes represent an emerging research topic in the electrospinning field. Owing to extremely high porosity, as well as excellent structural flexibility and stability, these 3D nanofibrous structures have attracted significant interests for various applications. In this review, the preparation of 3D monolithic structures are thoroughly discussed; and the properties of 3D structures and their various applications in the fields of environment (e.g., organic compound removal, dye adsorption, and filtration and separation), energy (e.g., supercapacitor), electronics (e.g., pressure sensor), chemical engineering (e.g., catalyst support, thermal insulator, and Joule heater), and biomedical engineering (e.g., tissue engineering, hydrogel, and drug delivery) are summarized. Additionally, the future perspectives and challenges are also presented. It is envisioned that, this review will provide important guidance in designing novel 3D electrospun nanofibrous structures and exploring their potential applications.
