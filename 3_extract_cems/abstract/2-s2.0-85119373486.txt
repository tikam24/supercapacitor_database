Recently, high-entropy materials (HEMs) have gained increasing interest in the field of energy storage technology on account of their unique structural characteristics and possibilities for tailoring functional properties. Herein, the development of this class of materials for electrochemical energy storage have been reviewed, especially the fundamental understanding of entropy-dominated phase-stabilization effects and prospective applications are presented. Subsequently, critical comments of HEMs on the different aspects of battery and supercapacitor are summarized with the underlying principles for the observed properties. In addition, we also summarize their potential advantages and remaining challenges, which will ideally provide some general guidelines and principles for researchers to study and develop advanced HEMs. The diversity of material design contributed by the entropy-mediated concept provides the researchers numerous ideas of new candidates for practical applications and ensures further research in the emerging field of energy storage.
