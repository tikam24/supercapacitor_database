Hybrid electric trams equip with additional on-board energy storage devices to improve the performance of power sources. Both of optimal energy management and velocity control are important to maximum the energy efficiency for catenary-supercapacitors hybrid trams. An optimal control model has been developed to minimize energy consumption from traction substations with supercapacitors voltage limitations. Multiple phases model transformation and solving methods are implemented to obtain the optimal voltage trajectory and speed profile simultaneously. Finally, the effect of trip time on energy consumption is assessed.
