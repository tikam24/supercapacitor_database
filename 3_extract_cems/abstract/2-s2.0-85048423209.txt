Supercapacitors have many attractive characteristics such as high power density, fast charge and discharge rates, environmental protection, a consequent ability to bridge the gap between conventional capacitors and rechargeable batteries, and long cycle life. Electrode materials based on electrochemical double-layer capacitors are porous carbon materials with high surface areas and suitable pore size, but the carbon component introduces the weakness of low specific capacitance, which limits their further wide application as electrode materials. These limitations may be overcome by using various composites consisting of porous carbon material and redox-active transition metal oxides as electrode materials for electrochemical capacitors. Our research objective is to design hierarchical porous carbon materials containing various metal oxides as an electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors. Moreover, these hierarchical porous composites with well-dispersed mesopores in the carbons lead to rapid ion transport and low resistance for charge diffusion in the electrolyte, thereby maintaining high specific energy at high power densities. This impressive electrochemical property of the hierarchically structured carbon nanofibers containing various metal oxides as the supercapacitor electrode highlights the importance of incorporating the metal oxide nanoparticles and hierarchical structure, owing to the combinative contribution of the redox pseudocapacitance and the electric double-layer capacitance. Thus, tailoring the suitable pore morphologies and the number of functional groups can strongly improve their electrochemical performance, resulting from an increased electroactive surface area.
