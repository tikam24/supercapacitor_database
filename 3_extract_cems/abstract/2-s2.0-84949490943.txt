Ionic liquid mediated Bi2Se3 nanosheets synthesized. The Bi2Se3 nanosheets wrapped onto Ni-foam and applied supercapacitor studies which improved specific capacitance due to the intercalation of Ni(OH)2 particles. The intercalated layered Bi2Se3 nanosheets were confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The surface composition was confirmed by high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The intercalated layered Ni(OH)2@Bi2Se3 composites display good specific capacitance 439 F g-1 at 4 A g-1.
