In the present scenario, development of green and sustainable energy sources becomes an enormous challenge due to the rising environmental problems and diminution of natural energy sources like gas, coal and oil. To fulfill the requirement researchers from all over the world have typically focused on the development of various energy storage devices like accumulators, capacitors, batteries as well as supercapacitors utilizing different functional materials. Graphene, a novel type nano-sized carbon, has drawn significant research interest as an electrode material for supercapacitor due to its superior properties like high mechanical strength, better electrical conductivity, good chemical stability, excellent flexibility, as well as board electrochemical windows. For the fabrication of nanofiber, electrospinning technique has been known as the main adaptable as well as versatile technique. To enhance high energy storage capacity along with the environment impact of electrospun supercapacitors, researchers have widely established original resolution for storing and harvesting energy from nanofiber. The present chapter presents a clear overview of the electrospinning processes, the basic concept of the supercapacitor electrode materials and 3D graphene-based nanocomposites via electrospinning techniques for the electrode materials for supercapacitor.
