Recently, the number of waste carbon fiber composites has been increasing rapidly, which causes serious damage to human living environment. In order to realize the high-value utilization of resin in waste composites, in this research, waste resin-based carbon materials were prepared by one-step carbonization method. And the effects of carbonization temperature on the structure and properties of carbon materials were studied. Meanwhile, the electrochemical performance of supercapacitor electrodes prepared by the carbon materials was investigated. The surface morphology, pore properties, chemical composition, graphitization degree and formation principle of carbon materials were analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM), specific surface area tester, fourier infrared spectrometer (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman tester (Raman), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), respectively. The results showed that the carbon material possesses a hierarchical porous structure, and the pore properties and graphitization degree are the best under a carbonization temperature at 800 â„ƒ. And the prepared supercapacitor electrode shows excellent electrochemical performances. The specific capacitance is as high as 299 F / g under the current density of 1 A / g, and it is as high as 296. 6 F / g after 10 000 charge and discharge cycles, which indicates an excellent cycling stability.
