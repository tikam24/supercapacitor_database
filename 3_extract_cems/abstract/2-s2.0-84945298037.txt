Novel three-dimensional flower-like heterostructured SnS2/MoS2 was produced via a one-step hydrothermal method. The full potential of the heterostructured SnS2/MoS2 material could be realized because of a strong synergetic effect, which was not only able to effectively weaken the agglomeration and restacking problems during the electrochemical reaction, but also able to ensure the high-rate and long-life. We found that SnS2/MoS2 had better electrochemical performance compared to MoS2, due to the rapid electronic transport and volume change buffering of the formation of the SnS2/MoS2 heterostructure. The electrochemical tests showed that the SnS2/MoS2 electrode had a specific capacitance of 105.7 F g-1 at a current density of 2.35 A g-1 and it displayed good cyclic stability of 90.4% retention even after 1000 cycles, which indicated that the SnS2/MoS2 was an useful potential electrode material for the application of energy storage and deserves to be further investigated.
