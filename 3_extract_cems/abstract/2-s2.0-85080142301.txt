Electric vehicles have gained more attraction throughout the world due to its advantage of green technology and decreased emission.. Moreover, they are being powered by battery would be the best option of replacing current petrol or gas dependent vehicles. There are some drawbacks associated with battery; it has limited lifetime and cost is very high. Hence, it is hybridized with other energy storage systems such as Ultracapacitor/Supercapacitor. This work uses a fuzzy and PI control for Energy management system for Electric Vehicle and Simulation environment chosen is Matlab/Simulink.
