The advantages and preparation methods of one-dimensional ordered polyaniline (PANI) nanoarrays were described in detail based on their structural characteristics and conductive mechanisms, and the advantages of using PANI nanoarrays as supercapacitor electrode materials were also pointed out. According to the classification of electrode materials, the application progress of compositing of PANI-based ordered nanoarrays with conductive polymer materials, carbon materials and metal oxide composites as electrode materials in supercapacitors was also reviewed in detail. Furthermore, the structural characteristics, preparation methods of these electrode materials, as well as their electrochemical energy storage improvement mechanism and application problems in supercapacitors were discussed. Finally, the preparation methods and strategies to further optimize the electrochemical performance of PANI array structure-based electrode materials were proposed, and their future development in supercapacitors was prospected.
