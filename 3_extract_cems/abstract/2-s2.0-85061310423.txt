A binary transition metal oxides MnCo 2 O 4 with hierarchical porous sphere structure (MnCo 2 O 4 PSs) electrode material for supercapacitor was prepared by a moderate methanol solvothermal and calcination method. The MnCo 2 O 4 PSs presents a large specific surface area (213.2 m 2 g −1 ). Hierarchical porous sphere is beneficial for forming conductive networks and furnishing more electrochemically active sites. Amazingly, the MnCo 2 O 4 PSs exhibits brilliant electrochemical properties that a relatively high specific capacitance of 1044 F g −1 and remarkable cycling stability (133.3% retention after 10000 cycles) are owned. A mimetic asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was constructed by the MnCo 2 O 4 PSs and the starch-derived carbon foam material (SCF) as positive and negative electrode, respectively. The MnCo 2 O 4 PSs//SCF ASC shows excellent specific energy (42.27 Wh kg −1 ) at the specific power of 400 W kg −1 under the optimal output potential difference of 1.6 V and long-term cycling stability. Herein, the MnCo 2 O 4 PSs electrode material prepared in this work is a distinguished candidate material for supercapacitor.
