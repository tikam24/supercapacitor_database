3 D printing is a promising advanced technology in the design and manufacturing of energy storage devices due to its superiority in shape customization and rapid manufacturing. Up to now, various electrodes and electrolytes are printed via different printing methods and showing their unique advantages in device miniaturization and integration, which is difficult by conventional fabrication. However, the lack of printable materials is the bottleneck for the further development of printed energy storage devices. Current commercial printable materials are used as structural materials, but their poor performance in conductivity and electrochemical activation prevents its application in energy storage devices. To address this problem, researchers were committed to designing and developing reasonable ink according to the printing principle, and different types of batteries and supercapacitors with remarkable performance were printed successfully. Moreover, the 3D printing technology offers unprecedented opportunities in structure design and optimization, which can further improve the electrochemical and mechanical properties of devices, obtaining high-performance energy storage devices with flexible and miniaturization characteristics. Herein, the recent advances of 3D printing for energy storage devices are reviewed. The basic principle of 3D printing technology and the research progress of printed electrode and electrolyte materials are first summarized. Then the application of 3D printed devices in wearable devices, micro-electronics, and other aspects are discussed. Finally, this paper analyzes the problems and future development direction of 3D printed energy storage devices, expecting to provide the reference for the application of 3D printing in energy storage devices.
