Transition metal oxides are best research materials used for energy saving in electrochemical supercapacitor applications. CuCoO2 electrodes are introduced for supercapacitor applications. The pristine and different variations of NaOH concentrations have been investigated. CuCoO2 electrode specific capacitance is 274, 336, 342F/g at 10 mV/s from CV and 208, 218, 250F/g at 0.5 A/g from GCD. 81.36% capacity has been maintained after 5000 cycles in high current density range. Therefore, these transition metal oxide CuCoO2 electrodes are very gifted for future energy storage applications.
