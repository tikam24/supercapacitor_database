The operating voltage and current through integrated devices are effective ways to explore the practical applications of supercapacitors. In this study, CoSe2nanoparticles were fabricated by a facile hydrothermal method. As supercapacitor electrodes, CoSe2nanoparticles exhibited a specific capacitance of 389.6 F g-1at 1 A g-1. When CoSe2served as a positive electrode for the asymmetric solid-state supercapacitor, it presented 47.4 F g-1specific capacitance, 46.4 Wh kg-1energy density with 1512 W kg-1power density, and superior stability (92.06% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles). Especially, the integrated all-solid-state supercapacitors connected in series displayed the typical voltage extension capability (2.8 V for two devices in series), and the ones in parallel exhibited charge/discharge time expand capabilities (390 s for two devices in parallel). Therefore, the study shows the promising practical applications of CoSe2-based supercapacitors for energy storage.
