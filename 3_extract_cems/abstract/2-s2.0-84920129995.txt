The paper describes the modeling of supercapacitor impedance with fractional order calculus and Cole-Cole relaxation model application. The basis of the modeling are frequency responses. The fractional order models are compared with integer order transfer functions. The accuracy of both methods of modeling and difficulties of the optimization of parameters values of the models are discussed. The applications of both types of transfer function in control circuits are presented.
