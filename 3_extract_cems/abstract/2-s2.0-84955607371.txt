The supercapacitor based piezoelectric material composite (Na,K)NbO3-CaCu3Ti4O12 (NKN-CCTO) is investigated for possible application in piezoelectric devices. (1-x)NKN-xCCTO (0.015≤x≤0.06) with different sintering conditions is researched for supercapacitor based piezoelectric applications. The 0.94NKN-0.06CCTO composite sintered at 975 °C shows the highest dielectric permittivity of 796. Clear SEM images of (1-x)NKN-xCCTO reveal that these compositions have high density well-crystallized structures. The composition and sintering temperature dependence of dielectric permittivities and piezoelectric coefficients, plotted in three dimensions, show that the 0.985NKN-0.015CCTO composite sintered at 1025 °C has a moderate dielectric permittivity of 405 and a piezoelectric constant of 98 pC/N.
