Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which have attracted widespread interest, are used for electrode materials in renewable clean energy production and storage because of the large surface area, high porosity, and tailorability. Herein, we reported a three-dimensional (3D) flower-like Co-N-codoped carbon material derived from ZIF-67, which was deposited on cobalt-nanoparticle-embellished flexible carbon cloth (CoNC/Co@CC), directly acting as a high-activity bifunctional electrode for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and supercapacitors. The overpotential of CoNC/Co@CC is 360 mV with a modest Tafel slope of 76.9 mV dec-1 and exhibits high stability for the OER in 1 M KOH electrolyte when the current density is 10 mA cm-2. Meanwhile, the specific capacitance of CoNC/Co@CC reaches 192.0 F g-1 at 0.25 A g-1. CoNC/Co@CC exhibits a capacitance retention of 90.6% at 2 A g-1 after 3000 cycles. The results suggest that CoNC/Co@CC shows promising applications in the OER and supercapacitors as a low-cost catalyst.
