Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are an attractive class of material that can certainly address the needs of today's energy storage technologies and are seizing immense interest for numerous technological applications. MOFs are highly porous, and their structural pillars mainly comprise of a metal node and organic linker. With its intrinsic unique characteristics, MOFs’ properties such as its high surface area, porosity, morphology, and stability can be tailored as per desire. Herein, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time 1, 2, 4, 5-benzenetetracarboxylic acid (BTC) and 2-mthylimidazole (C4H6N2) bi-linker copper MOF (Cu-B-MI MOF) is being synthesized and implied to hybrid supercapacitor applications. The synthesized MOF with favorable pore dimensions and structure for ion intercalation is being characterized structurally, morphologically, elementally, and electrochemically. Following a thorough standard three-electrode electrochemical analysis, an asymmetric supercapacitor (Cu-B-MI MOF//activated carbon (AC)) is being fabricated which showcases a maximum specific energy and power density of 52 Wh kg−1 and 4000 W kg−1, respectively. The sublime outcomes of Cu-B-MI MOF elevate its competitiveness as cathode material for futuristic energy storage applications.
