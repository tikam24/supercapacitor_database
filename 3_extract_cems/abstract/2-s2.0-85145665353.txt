MXene has been considered a viable 2D electrode material for supercapacitors due to its good conductivity and remarkable cycling stability. However, its low specific capacitance has limited its applications. To address this, we deposited nickel-metal–organic-framework (Ni-ZIF-67) on MXene. Firstly, Ni-ZIF-67 composites were synthesized at various temperatures (150–450 ℃), with different masses of Ni. Among the Ni-ZIF-67 (NZ) composites, the NZ-R-2-200 electrode exhibited the largest specific surface area of 549.78 m2/g, and the highest specific capacity of 365.5 C/g at 0.5 A/g. Then, the NZ-R-2-200/K-Ar-MXene composite was prepared by decorating intercalated 2D MXene (K-Ar-MXene) with NZ-R-2-200. NZ-R-2-200 were anchored on the surface of K-Ar-MXene. Significantly, an electrode based on NZ-R-2-200/K-Ar-MXene composite demonstrates a remarkable specific capacity of 557 C/g at 0.5 A/g and long-time stability of 66 % capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 2 A/g. An assembled asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) based on NZ-R-2-200/K-Ar-MXene as the positive and porous carbon composite of (NPC/rGO) as the negative electrodes showed a high energy density of 27.48 Wh/Kg and a power density of 400 W/Kg combined with cyclic stability up to 2000 cycles.
