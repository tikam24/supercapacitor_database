Pore structure of active material plays important roles on energy storage of supercapacitor (SC), since charges are accumulated in and released from pores during charge/discharge process. Carbonized zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) with high surface area and electrical conductivity is widely applied as active material. Easy removal of Zn and ZnO simplifies pore engineering of carbonized ZIF-8. It is the first time using chemical and physical methods to create pores in carbonized ZIF-8. Chemical method is removing ZnO and Zn using HCl treatment, and physical method is evaporating Zn at 1000 °C. Due to larger size of ZnO and lower annealing temperature without Zn evaporation, carbonized ZIF-8 synthesized using 800 °C shows the highest specific capacitance (CF) of 186.79 F/g at 20 mV/s, while that prepared using physical method merely presents CF value of 43.82 F/g. With HNO3 and H2SO4 treatments, carbonized ZIF-8 shows reduced electrochemical performance due to serious structure damage. Symmetric SC composed of optimized carbonized ZIF-8 electrodes presents CF value of 214.8 F/g at 20 mV/s and maximum energy density of 10.71 Wh/kg at power density of 800 W/kg. Excellent charge/discharge cycling stability is achieved with CF retention of 83% and Coulombic efficiency of 90% after 8000 times charge/discharge process.
