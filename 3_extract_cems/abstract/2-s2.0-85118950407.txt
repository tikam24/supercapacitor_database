The supercapacitors currently existing on the market are produced from activated and pyrolyzed wood, plants and from oil and phenolic resins (aerogels and cryogels)1. New ways to store energy are being explored, as example, carbon nanostructures due to their high surface area can convert capacitors (low storage capacity with quick charge/discharge) to supercapacitors which combine the advantages of capacitors and batteries (high storage capacity with quick charge/discharge)2, 3.
