In order to reduce the high cost of the hybrid electric vehicle(HEV) and prolong its battery lifespan, a mild HEV with a compound power supply was suggested. The fuel economy of the mild HEV can be improved by stopping the vehicle driving without the engine idling and regenerating the braking energy. The time required for gear shifting can be shortened because of the motor active synchronizing technique. The supercapacitor with high power density and long lifespan was used to form a compound power supply with the battery to buffer the power load of battery to prolong its lifespan. The parameter matching was performed for the powerdrive components of the mild HEV and validated by simulation analysis. The feasibility of applying the compound power supply system in the mild HEV was summarized.
