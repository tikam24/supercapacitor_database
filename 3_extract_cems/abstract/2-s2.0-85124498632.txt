At present, carbon materials derived from biomass precursors have many limitations in the field of energy storage. In this study, boron and nitrogen (B/N) co-doped carbon nanospheres are successfully prepared by emulsion crosslinking method using chitosan and boric acid as raw materials. After carbonization at high temperature, the carbon nanospheres can be facilely prepared with controllable particle size, showing excellent structural stability and sphericity. In addition, the heteroatoms co-doping endows the carbon nanospheres with large specific surface area, high graphitization degree and excellent electrochemical performance. Applying the carbon nanospheres for supercapacitors, the specific capacitance can reach up to 336.7 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1. Even after 10,000 cycles, the Coulomb efficiency and specific capacitance still remain at 98.61% and 96.8%, respectively, demonstrating the great promise of B/N co-doped carbon nanospheres for the state-of-the-art supercapacitor electrodes applications.
