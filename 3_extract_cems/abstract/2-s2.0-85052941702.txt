Recently, the incorporation of foreign atoms (e.g. nitrogen, phosphorus, fluorine, and oxygen, etc.) into the carbocycle has been demonstrated to be very promising for enhancing the electrochemical property of carbon-based supercapacitor. Herein, for the first time, fluorine and oxygen co-doped porous carbons (FOPCs) were successfully prepared by employing third-class red dates as precursor, which showed high specific surface area (1229 m2 g−1), highly-developed micropores (~ 93%), rich oxygen-content (22.8 wt%) and moderate fluorine doping (1.0 wt%). Owing to the aforementioned advantages, the resultant FOPC-800 electrode displayed high specific capacities of 261 and 168 F g−1 at 1 and 20 A g−1 respectively, in 6 M KOH electrolyte. Moreover, high energy density (23.2 W h kg−1) of the FOPC-800-based symmetric supercapacitor was achieved in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, with outstanding cyclic stability (93.5% retention after 5000 cycles).
