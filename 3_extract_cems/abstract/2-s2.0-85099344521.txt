A robust self-supported electrode based on nanocellulose fibers (CNF), multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT), and polypyrrole (PPy) was prepared by a facile combination of ultrasonic dispersion and consequent in situ polymerization. In addition, the feasibility of utilizing this ternary composite as an electrode for supercapacitors was studied. The results revealed that the obtained CNF/CNT/PPy composite exhibited a large specific capacitance of 200.8 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1. Equally important, the electrode capacitance retained about 90% of its initial value after 5000 charge/discharge cycles at a current density of 1 A g-1, which thus demonstrated its excellent cycling stability. The simple integration route and outstanding electrochemical properties distinguish this new composite as a prospective candidate for use as a high-performance electrode in supercapacitors.
