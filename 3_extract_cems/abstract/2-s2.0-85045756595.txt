ZnCo2O4 nanomaterial was synthesized using three different methods such as, reflux, hydrothermal and sol-gel for supercapacitor application. Structural and morphological studies of the nanomaterial were investigated using XRD and SEM analysis. Electrochemical performance of the material was analyzed using three electrode system. The maximum specific capacitance of ZnCo2O4 nanorod synthesized from the reflux route gave 138 F g-1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1 and 126 F g-1 at a current density of 1.5 A g-1. This result suggested that ZnCo2O4 nanomaterial synthesized by reflux method is suitable for supercapacitor application.
