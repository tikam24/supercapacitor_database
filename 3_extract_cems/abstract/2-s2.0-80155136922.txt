Nowadays, no electrochemical energy system presents a competitive operation if compared with internal combustion engine, which is the reason for combining electrochemical energy systems to obtain a hybrid energy storage system. This paper presents a fuel cell-battery-ultracapacitor system for vehicle application. The objective of this paper is to present the Energetic Macroscopic Representation (EMR) of the multi-source power system. Â© 2011 IEEE.
