The SnO2 and SnO2 combined RuO2 thin films were synthesized by chemical synthesis. The films were characterized for their structural, morphological and electrochemical properties. From the structural study it was observed that the SnO2 films are nanocrystalline in nature which changed to amorphous when combined with RuO2. The supercapacitive studies showed that the specific capacitance of SnO2 is enhanced from 4 to 185 F.g-1 when combined with RuO2. Â© 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.
