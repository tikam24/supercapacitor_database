The present paper reports the fabrication of NiCo2O4 as grain-like nanostructures via facile Co-precipitation method. X-ray Diffraction (XRD), FTIR and Raman spectroscopy confirms the spinel NiCo2O4 structure having a single cubic phase with the Fd3m space group of synthesized sample. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) revealed the grain-like nanostructured morphology. The electrochemical characteristics of the as-prepared sample were investigated through electrochemical workstation using a three-electrode set up in a 2 M KOH electrolyte. As an electrode material, the NiCo2O4 exhibited a high specific capacitance of 1860 F/g at current density 1 A/g with good cycle stability of 75% after 1500 cycles.
