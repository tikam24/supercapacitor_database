An energy management methodology for enhancing the resilience of ship power systems (SPS) is presented in this paper. The proposed methodology manages different types of energy storage systems (ESS), such as battery energy storage systems (BESS) and supercapacitor energy storage systems (SCESS), to maximize load operability. Taking ramp-rate characteristics of these ESS and generators into account, the proposed energy management system (EMS) can effectively manage the SPS under the operation of the high ramp-rate load. In addition, the proposed EMS can balance ESS's state-of-charge (SoC) and prioritize the SoC level of SCESS. To reduce the computational burden, the optimization problem in this paper is solved by the receding horizon optimization (RHO) technique, making the proposed EMS feasible for real-time applications. An all-electric MVDC ship power system is utilized to assess the performance of the proposed method. Simulation results show that the proposed EMS effectively manages ESS to enhance the system's resilience under generation power shortage. In addition, the proposed RHO approach significantly decreases the computation burden encountered in the fixed horizon optimization technique while retaining an acceptable resilience performance.
