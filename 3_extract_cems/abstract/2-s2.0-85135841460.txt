Nickel phosphides are widely used as cathode materials for supercapacitors owing to their outstanding advantages such as high conductivity and electrochemical activity. In this work, the different microstructures of Ni12P5 are controllable synthesized based on a simple one-step hydrothermal method. The nanoparticle (NP), nanowire (NW), and nanomesh (NM) structures of Ni12P5 tend to be formed under ethanol, water, and ethylene glycol based on different polarity, separately. And then, these three kinds of Ni12P5 nanostructures were used as the cathode materials for supercapacitors. The specific capacitance of Ni12P5 NPs is about 955 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 (676 F g−1 at 5 A g−1), which is higher than Ni12P5 NWs (871 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and Ni12P5 NMs (423 F g−1 at 1 A g−1). The Ni12P5 NPs, NWs, and NMs have good cyclic stability with 81 %, 69 %, and 78 % of the initial specific capacitance after 1500 cycles at 5 A g−1, respectively. Meanwhile, the Ni12P5 NPs//activated carbon hybrid supercapacitor provides an energy density of 122.3 Wh kg−1 (vs. 0.75 kW kg−1) and power density of 7.5 kW kg−1 (vs. 26.4 Wh kg−1), and good cycle stability. This work provides a novel technical basis for cathode materials of high-performance electrochemical energy storage devices.
