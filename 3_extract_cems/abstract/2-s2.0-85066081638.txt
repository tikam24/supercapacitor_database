In this study, pyroprotein-incorporated freestanding papers (PFPs) were fabricated using silk proteins and carbon nanotubes through a facile filtration and heat treatment, and hierarchically nanoporous pyroproteins (HNPs) were fabricated using silk protein fibers via thermal treatment with activation using an alkali agent. The PFPs formed a monolith without any binder and exhibited a surface area of ∼97 m2 g−1 with a microporous structure, whereas the HNPs maintained a fibrous structure with a high surface area of ∼2,880 m2 g−1. The pyroproteins presented in PFP and HNP led to the charge storage capacity originating from heteroatoms such as oxygen and nitrogen. The reversible capacities of the PFP and HNP as the anode and cathode, respectively, were ∼228 and ∼205 mA h g−1, respectively, at current density of 0.1 A g−1. In particular, the PFPs exhibit a high cycling stability over 1,000 cycles at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. Furthermore, energy storage devices based on all-fibrous pyroprotein electrodes achieved a high specific power of ∼12,100 W kg−1, a high specific energy of ∼150 Wh kg−1, and an excellent cycling performance with ∼83% capacitance retention after over 2,000 cycles.
