Due to the emergence of various new infectious (viral/bacteria) diseases, the remote surveillance of infected persons has become most important, especially if hospitals need to isolate infected patients to prevent the spreading of pathogens to health care personnel. Therefore, we develop a remote health monitoring system by integrating a stretchable asymmetric supercapacitor (SASC) as a portable power source with sensors that can monitor the human physical health condition in real-time and remotely. An abnormal body temperature and breathing rate could indicate a personâ€™s sickness/infection status. Here we integrated FePS3@graphene-based strain sensor and SASC into an all-in-one textile system and wrapped it around the abdomen to continuously monitor the breathing cycle of the person. The real body temperature was recorded by integrating the temperature sensor with the SASC. The proposed system recorded physiological parameters in real-time and when monitored remotely could be employed as a screening tool for monitoring pathogen infection status.
