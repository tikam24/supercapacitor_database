Cu-WO3 and CuWO4 nanopowders have been successfully synthesized by simple microwave irradiation method. The prepared nanopowders were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy techniques. The XRD pattern revealed the formation of orthorhombic and anorthic phase for the as-synthesized and heat-treated samples, respectively. The formation of nanoporous structure was confirmed by SEM for both as-prepared and heat-treated samples. The electrochemical performance of the Cu-WO3 and CuWO4 modified electrodes was investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic chargeâ€“discharge techniques. The specific capacitance of 15.08 F/g was achieved for the Cu-WO3 nanopowder.
