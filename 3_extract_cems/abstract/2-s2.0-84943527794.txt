This paper deals with a frequency domain based power controller for overhead line and electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) hybrid railway vehicles. The loss of EDLC causes an error in the proportional feedback control of the EDLC energy management. In this paper, a design method of the energy reference for compensating the error of the EDLC energy by using assumed average loss is proposed to improve the energy management accuracy of this controller. The effectiveness of this design method is verified by a small-scale experimental system.
