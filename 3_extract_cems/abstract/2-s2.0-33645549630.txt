Carbon nanofibers (CNF) were obtained by chemical vapour diposition (CVD), decomposing ethanol over finely dispersed Fe -Ni alloy catalyst at 500°C. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) image reveal that the nanofibers are densely packed. A supercapacitor of configuration "Pt/CNF//30% KOH/Pt" was developed by using purified CNF, a capacitance of 14 F/g (based on weight of active material) was obtained.
