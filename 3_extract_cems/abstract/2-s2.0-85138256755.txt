Graphene, an SP2 hybridized 2-D atomic crystal, has been one of the most significant materials of the current century. Researchers in the recent years find graphene to be highly appealing for its superlative electrochemical energy storage applications and some of its unique features such as fractional quantum hall effect which is even exhibited in normal temperatures such as room temperature, ballistic conduction of charge carriers along with the exhibition of ambipolar electric field effect and modifiable bandgap. Enhanced electrochemical performances have been achieved by coalescing graphene with other electrochemical materials. This review focuses on various bio-precursors involved in the synthesis of graphene and its diverse production methods along with their merits and demerits. It also summarizes the ensuing features and macro-structural complexity of the graphene-derived structural composites as well as its applications as competent electrode material in energy storage devices. It specifically endeavors in providing a comprehensible idea on the availability of a variety of biomass sources and its synthesis techniques for a better and optimized mass production of graphene with uncompromising purity as well as the perspectives of the graphene-based composites that pave path for its improved application in advanced storage devices. This review article casts light upon the enormous opportunities of graphene production with easy synthesizing techniques that could aid in the fabrication of high performance of supercapacitors.
