In this paper, a flexible supercapacitor electrode with high electrochemical performance was fabricated via a electroless plating-electrodeposition combined method which was facile and efficient. The low-cost and available cellulose paper (CP) was employed as flexible substrate loaded highly conductive current collect materials and electrochemical active materials. Results indicate that the as-fabricated electrode is sandwich-structured and flexible and the electrode itself is easy to be bended, twisted and rolled. The electrochemical data showed that the as-fabricated composite electrode displays excellent areal specific capacitance (2485 mF/cm2 at scan rate of 5 mV/s) and the series resistance of the electrode was about 2.2 Î©, which is relatively low enough to be used.
