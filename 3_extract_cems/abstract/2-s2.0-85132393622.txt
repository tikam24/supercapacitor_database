As one of the energy storage devices, supercapacitors (SCs) have the advantages of high-power density, short charging time and excellent cycle stability, and have received widespread attention. Therefore, designing and synthesizing a supercapacitor material with high energy density has become a key factor to promote the development of SCs. In this work, the inter-crosslinked Co3S4 nanosheets which derived from ZIF-67 are successfully loaded on Co2(CO3)(OH)2 nanowires (CoCH NWs) can significantly facilitate the diffusion of electrolyte ions and enhance mass/electron transfer. The obtained Co3S4@CoCH composite grows directly on nickel foam (NF) substrates without binder, which improves the conductivity of Co3S4@CoCH/NF electrode. Consequently, the obtained Co3S4@CoCH/NF electrode possesses an excellent capacitance of 2697.1 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 and outstanding rate capability (84.4 % retention at 2–20 A g−1). In the three-electrode system, the capacitance retention is 79.8 % after 8000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g−1. An asymmetric supercapacitor assembled from Co3S4@CoCH/NF and activated carbon as cathode and anode respectively which has fabulous energy density of 42.2 W h kg−1 at 799.0 W kg−1 and stability (74.0 % retention after 8000 cycles). It improves that Co3S4@CoCH/NF is a promising cathode material for supercapacitors.
