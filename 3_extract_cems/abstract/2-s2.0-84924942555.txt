Industrial microgrids functioning under islanded mode of operation are often subjected to large and fluctuating demands from loads like crushers, excavators, and steel rolling mills. This paper studies the supercapacitor cycle life when multiple small-rated but distantly located distributed energy resources (DERs) are supplying a cement plant crusher-conveyor load. Each DER consisted of a fuel cell supplemented with a supercapacitor. After carrying out extensive modeling, simulation, and analysis, this paper demonstrated that the supercapacitor cycle life can be equalized by employing the cooperative framework of Flexible Distribution of EneRgy and Storage resources (FDERS).
