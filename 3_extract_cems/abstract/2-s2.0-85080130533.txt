The two-dimensional (2D) hydroxides nanosheets perform excellent electrochemical properties due to their unique layered structure shortening the ion diffusion distance, rich in active sites and various valence states. Herein, bimetal CoFe hydroxides nanosheets (thickness about 60 nm) were synthesized by one-step liquid phase reflux method and spontaneous crystallization into two-dimensional nanosheets with regular hexagons, which showed the highest specific capacitance of 2358.4 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1, exceeding most of the previous reports. The assembled solid device showed the energy and power densities of 28.3 Wh kg−1 and 512 W kg−1, respectively.
