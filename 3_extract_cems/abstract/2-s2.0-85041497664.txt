The CeO2 nanorod framework was synthesized via a facile-dealloying method coupled with calcination treatment for supercapacitors. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterizations identified the cubic phase and nanorod morphology of the synthesized sample. Their electrochemical performance was also evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge tests, and cycling performances. The results show that CeO2 nanorod framework possesses high-specific capacitance and superior charge/discharge stability, which are mainly ascribed to its high-Brunauer-Emmett-Tellar surface area (110.6 m2 gâˆ’1). Notably, the CeO2//AC (Active Carbon) asymmetric supercapacitor device exhibits excellent cycling stability with capacity retention of 133.6% after cycling for 30,000 cycles.
