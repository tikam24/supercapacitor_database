Mesoporous carbon materials were prepared in the presence of triblock copolymer Pluronic F127 as a template agent from phenol formaldehyde and resorcinol resins by pyrolysis and activation at 900Â°C. These samples have a specific morphology, i.e., mainly consist of globular particles 2-5 nm in size with curved graphene-like walls. The samples have high specific surface areas and demonstrate high capacities. The high capacity values are caused not only by a high surface area but also by the easy accessibility of mesopores and an additional contribution of pseudocapacitance due to the presence of electrochemically active surface groups.
