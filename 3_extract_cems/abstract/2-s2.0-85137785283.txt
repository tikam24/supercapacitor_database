Intermittent nature of renewable energy sources is one of the main causes which create the doubt in mind of project planner. Probably this is one of the key barriers to damp in their huge penetration. Now days, energy storage system are in spotlight to produce electricity from renewable energy resources as they may be resolve problems of the oscillated power supply by energy resources which are irregular by nature. The energy storage system can reduce frequent islanding from load as well as smoothen out the balance of supply and demand supply, if any mismatch occurs. In this paper a simulation based work is done to observe the crucial role of storage. It comes out that with DC voltage 412V and output RMS 242V. The voltage THD is 2.87%. But at time 0.2 sec when radiation is reduced to 200W/m2, the output comes down to 292V and output RMS 177V with voltage THD 3.97%.
