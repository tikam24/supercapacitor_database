A three dimensional (3D) micro supercapacitor was designed with an interdigital structure which increases surface area by about 20 times compared with planar structure for the same footprint. The supercapacitor consisting of current collectors, electrodes and solid state electrolyte, was micromachined using UV lithography, RF magnetron sputtering, electroplating, electrochemical polymerization and spin coating methods. Electrochemical tests showed that the single electrode can be used for supercapacitor in application of broad frequency range up to 300 Hz and the specific capacitance of the 3D supercapacitor was about 0.03 F cm-2 while the specific was about 2 mW cm-2 at relative large discharge rate.
