Heteroatom doped carbonaceous material with high specific surface area (SSA) is vital for assembling advanced supercapacitor. Here, a moderate and valid strategy is proposed to synthesize N, S co-doped porous carbons (NSPCs) which are derived from porous resorcinol-melamine-formaldehyde-thiourea (RMFT) resins via high internal phase emulsion (HIPE) template. The morphology, structure, porous characteristics and chemical ingredients of the prepared NSPCs are investigated by SEM, XRD, Raman spectra, and XPS systematically. The obtained NSPCs show typical open-cell morphology. As the molar ratio of thiourea to melamine (T/M) increased from 0:1 to 2:1, the SSA of NSPC increases gradually from 927 to 1721 m2 g−1. Electrochemical tests show that when T/M is 2:1, the specific capacity of NSPC reaches 213.5 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. After 10,000 charge–discharge cycles at 10 A g−1, the retention ratio of specific capacitance is 99.6%, indicating an excellent cycling stability. Excellent performances together with facile preparation make NSPC via HIPE template a potential candidate as electrode of advanced supercapacitors.
