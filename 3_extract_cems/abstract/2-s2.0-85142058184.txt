In this paper, management and control problem of hybrid energy storage system (HESS) has been solved by master-slave control strategy. Heuristic fuzzy rules based algorithm is developed for optimal power sharing between different power sources. The master control is followed by a slave level controller, designed by using terminal synergetic control method for tracking. Moreover, the stability analysis of closed-loop system has been carried out by using lyapunov theory. Finally, the proposed method has been tested in MATLAB/Simulink environment under Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP).
