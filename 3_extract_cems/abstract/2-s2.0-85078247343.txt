The electrochemical capacitor (EC) is a key enabler for the miniaturized self-powered systems expected to become ubiquitous with the advent of the internet-of-things (IoT). Vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (VACNTs) on graphite holds promise as electrodes for compact and low-loss ECs. However, as with all ECs, the operating voltage is low, and miniaturization of higher voltage devices necessitates a bipolar design. In this paper, we demonstrate a bipolar EC using graphite/VACNTs electrodes fabricated using a joule heating chemical vapor deposition (CVD) setup. The constructed EC contains one layer of double-sided VACNTs on graphite as bipolar electrode. Compared to a series connection of two individual devices, the bipolar EC has 22% boost in volumetric energy density. More significant boost is envisaged for stacking more bipolar electrode layers. The energy enhancement is achieved without aggravating self-discharge (71.2% retention after 1 h), and at no sacrifice of cycling stability (96.7% over 50000 cycles) owing to uniform growth of VACNTs and thus eliminating cell imbalance problems.
