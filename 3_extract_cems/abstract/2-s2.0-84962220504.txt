Solid-state organic electrochemical supercapacitors (OESCs) have been fabricated using poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) electrodes, a biohydrogel as electrolyte system, and polyaniline fibers as redox additive. The effectivity of sodium alginate, κ-carrageenan, chitosan and gelatin hydrogels as electrolytic media has been evaluated considering different criteria. Results indicate that κ-carrageenan-based hydrogel is the most suitable to perform as electrolyte due to the appropriate combination of properties: mechanical stability, ease of preparation, lack of water leaking, and good medium for the electrochemical response of PEDOT electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge assays indicate that OESCs based on PEDOT electrodes and κ-carrageenan hydrogel as electrolyte exhibits a good supercapacitor response in terms of specific capacitance, cycling stability, small leakage current and low self-discharging tendency. On the basis of these good properties, four OESC devices were assembled in series and used to power a red LED, confirming that, in addition to advantageous characteristics (e.g. elimination of liquid leaking and enhancement of the device compactness), the designed biohydrogel-containing OESC exhibits potential for practical applications. On the other hand, preliminary assays have been performed loading the κ-carrageenan hydrogel with polyaniline nanofibers, which act as a redox additive. OESC devices prepared using such loaded biohydrogel have been found to be very promising and, therefore, future work is oriented towards the improvement of their design.
