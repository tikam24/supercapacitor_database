In this paper, we report a simple and cost-effective method for fabricating hierarchical NiO nanoflake arrays on nickel foam. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope are employed to study the morphology and structure of the as-synthesized NiO materials. Galvanostatic charge/dischargemeasurements demonstrate that the hierarchical NiO nanocomposite displays excellent capacitive behavior between the potential range of -0.1-0.5 V, and a maximum specific capacitance as high as 823 F g-1 can be achieved at a charge/discharge current density of 4 A g-1, and it only decreases by 20% when the current density increases to 12 A g-1. The remarkable electrochemical performance of this hierarchical NiO nanocomposite indicates the great application potential in supercapacitors.
