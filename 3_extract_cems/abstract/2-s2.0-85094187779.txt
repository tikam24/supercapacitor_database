Transition-metal dichalcogenides have attracted exceptional attention in the field of energy storage such as lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors because of their unique electronic, optical, and mechanical properties. In this work, we synthesized rhenium disulfide (ReS2) on high-throughput, electronics industry-standard, screen-printed electrodes (SPEs) to use as an electrode material for supercapacitor application. The ReS2 nanoparticles were grown by a room-temperature, aqueoussolution- based electrochemical deposition method, which is capable of parallel modification of SPEs. The topographic detail and electrochemical activity of the sample surface were characterized by a spatial electroanalytical mapping technique known as scanning electrochemical microscopy. The charge storage kinetics are appraised with deep insight following diffusion-controlled and capacitive-like mechanisms. The ReS2-coated SPE displayed a promising specific capacitance of 156 mF cm-2 at a current density of 1.6 mA cm-2, which shows that ReS2 can be used as a potential pseudocapacitive material in supercapacitors.
