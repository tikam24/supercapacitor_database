LixMnO2 nanowires with controllable morphology and excellent electrochemical performance are synthesized by a hydrothermal method with tunable lithium contents. Both double layer capacitive process and diffusion-controlled Faradaic process play roles in the charging-discharging process. Aqueous Li-ion hybrid supercapacitors are assembled using LixMnO2 nanowires as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode. The hybrid devices deliver high energy density of 88.56 Wh kg−1 and 25.2 Wh kg−1 at the high power density of 151.8 W kg−1 and 2155.8 W kg−1, respectively. The device also shows superb cycling life with capacitance retention of 95.2% after 10,000 cycles and 85.2% after 20,000 cycles.
