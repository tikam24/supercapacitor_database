We report a novel pseudocapacitor based on KCu7S4 nanowires. To improve the electrochemical performance of the KCu 7S4 capacitor, we changed the structure of the KCu 7S4 nanowire electrode by coating Mn particles (Mn/KCu7S4). The preferable capacitance is shown by the Mn/KCu7S4 hybrid capacitor, which displays large specific capacitance (1620 F g-1) at a scan rate of 1 mV s-1, high energy density, good cyclic stability and three supercapacitor units in series light 400 light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for 2 min. The much-increased capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability may be attributed to the Mn/KCu 7S4 hybrid structure, which enhances ionic and electronic transport through the electrode system.
