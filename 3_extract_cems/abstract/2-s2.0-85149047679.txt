Graphene and its derivatives have emerged as peerless electrode materials for energy storage applications due to their exclusive electroactive properties such as high chemical stability, wettability, high electrical conductivity, and high specific surface area. However, electrodes from graphene-based composites are still facing some substantial challenges to meet current energy demands. Here, we applied one-pot facile solvothermal synthesis to produce nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) nanoparticles using an organic solvent, ethylene glycol (EG), and introduced its application in supercapacitors. Electrochemical analysis was conducted to assess the performance using a multi-channel electrochemical workstation. The N-rGO-based electrode demonstrates the highest specific capacitance of 420 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 current density in 3 M KOH electrolyte with the value of energy (28.60 Whkg−1) and power (460 Wkg−1) densities. Furthermore, a high capacitance retention of 98.5% after 3000 charge/discharge cycles was recorded at 10 A g−1. This one-pot facile solvothermal synthetic process is expected to be an efficient technique to design electrodes rationally for next-generation supercapacitors.
