The parameters in the control strategy of hybrid energy storage system have certain influences on the control effect so,quantitative analysis should be performed to optimize the parameters. This paper which is based on the state of the lithium battery charge and discharge control strategy based on hybrid energy storage system has put forward the super capacitor energy storage charged state response margin index and coordination by considering the self-discharge rate and affecting factors, such as charge and discharge efficiency of energy storage system mathematical model. At the same time,this paper has established a hybrid energy storage system based on lithium battery life of quantitative coordination control parameter optimization model in combination with irregular which is suitable for the practical application of the charging and discharging lithium battery life quantitative model. Through example analysis, it shows that the reasonable choice hybril energy storage system coordination control parameter can prolong the service life of the lithium battery, and thus improving the overall performance of the hybrid energy storage system.
