Piezoelectric nanogenerator has promising application for harvesting mechanical energy to power small electronics. However, the power output of the piezoelectric nanogenerator is determined by the mechanical energy input, which will be intermittent if the mechanical energy is not continuous and is a fatal drawback for electronics requiring sustaining power. Here, a nano-energy cell (NEC), which can harvest intermittent mechanical energy, convert it into electricity, and store electricity, is successfully built. The new NEC uses high density piezoelectric nanowires to harvest mechanical energy and large electrolyte-NWs interface to store electricity in one simple system. NEC can continuously export electrical energy for more than 90 s after each single mechanical pulse shock, which is more than 400 times higher than that of nanogenerator. Additionally, the mechanical-electrical energy conversion efficiency of the NEC can be over 10 times higher than that of nanogenerator. The NEC potentially has important applications for effectively harvesting mechanical energy with low frequency.
