Numerous novel materials for the next-generation of energy storage and conversion devices have been prepared through simple and green methods to meet the urgent requirement for sustainable development. In this regard, lotus pollen, which is cheap and common biomass waste, can be used as a potential carbon source for developing efficient electrode materials with a unique structure for high-performance supercapacitors. Following this aim, we successfully prepared hierarchical and interpenetrating three-dimensional (3D) hollow MnO2/C composites via a facile and rapid dipping method, employing the renewable, cost-effective and widespread naturally porous lotus pollen as both the skeleton and carbon source. Benefiting from the synergistic effect between manganese dioxide and the porous carbon matrix, the composite has a high specific capacitance of 257 F g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1 and a high energy density of 51.5 W h kg-1. In addition, the prepared composite exhibits good cycling stability even after 2000 charge/discharge cycles. The approach developed in this work directs the way to take full advantage of sustainable resources provided by nature, and opens up a novel route to design and prepare high-performance materials with greater potential applications in high-performance energy storage systems.
