Current investigation explores the role of the phyto-metabolites of the Amaranthus viridis for development of the energy-active nanocomplex. The green route adopted for synthesis of doped nanocomplexes signifies economic viability and ecological convivial. Biomimetically prepared nanoparticles synthesized in different doping concentrations exhibited bandgap in the range of 2.5 to 3.2 eV. Average crystallite sizes of 13.97, 19.64, 16.11, and 11.16 nm were determined through XRD for the doped concentrations of 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10%, respectively. Synthesized doped nanoparticles exhibit porous sheet-like morphology. The synthesized material was then explored for HER and OER potential through linear sweep voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies. Overpotential value of 154 mV was obtained for hydrogen evolution reaction and 445 mV for oxygen evolution reaction. Furthermore, highest capacitance of 287 F/g was obtained at 2 mV/s through cyclic voltammetry.
