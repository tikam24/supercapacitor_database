Rare earth group elements have gained the renewed interest in applications of energy storage and conversion. Apparently, supercapacitive performances of electrodes based on yttrium (Y+3) element are still left uncovered for exploration as energy storage device. In this study, the binder free yttrium hydroxide (Y(OH)3) electrodes have been prepared through easy, economical and industry applicable successive ion layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. The Y(OH)3 has been deposited over the stainless steel (SS) substrate for 10 (Y_10), 20 (Y_20) and 30 (Y_30) SILAR cycles. The prepared electrodes have been characterized by using X‐ray diffraction (XRD), fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), high resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The electrochemical performances of the prepared electrodes have been studied in presence of 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The Y_20 shows the superior electrochemical performance than others. The highest specific capacity of 237 C g−1 has been observed for Y_20 at 1 mA current rate along with good cycle stability. Thus, by observing our results, one can say that the prepared electrode has a great potential in area of energy harvesting, power back up, portable devices, etc.
