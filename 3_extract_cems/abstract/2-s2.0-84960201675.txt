This chapter presents and introduction to nanostructured electrochromic electrodes. It focuses on ordered three-dimensional nanostructures with structural features ranging in size from 1 to 100 nm. An especially interesting subset of these are the mesoporous nanostructures that exhibit interconnected pores with diameters between 2 and 50 nm and therefore high surface-to-volume ratios. The most important feature of mesoporous electrodes when applied in electrochromic devices is their extremely large accessible internal surface area. The chapter summarizes the features of an effective and efficient mesoporous three-dimensional nanostructure concerning electrochromism. It describes polymer self-assembly and the gyroid nanomorphology. It explains the synthesis of mesoporous double-gyroid (DG) templates. The chapter also talks about the electrochemical characterisation and electrochromic displays based on gyroid-structured vanadium pentoxide and nickel oxide electrodes. It discusses the electrochemical properties of electrochromic vanadium pentoxide supercapacitors.
