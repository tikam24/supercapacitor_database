The distributed photovoltaics' large scale access in distribution network will bring many unfavourable factors due to its fluctuating output power. In this paper, an adaptive control strategy will be proposed based on the hybrid energy storage, by coordinating the power distribution between the battery and the super capacitor, to reach a fully use of fast responding characteristic of super capacitor. In addition, the state of charge (SOC) feedback function in proposed strategy will have a strong adaptive ability for taking into account the SOC changing, to realize the optimization of energy utilization. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy are verified using the simulation results.
