Electronic devices have driven modern lifestyle demands for efficient and environmentally friendly energy storage appliances. This paper reports the simple design of an efficient, cost-effective pseudocapacitor electrode based on copper sulfide (Cu2S) and silver sulfide (Ag2S) composites with cobalt oxide (Co3O4) for high-performance energy storage devices. A simple one-pot approach was used to synthesize hexagonal sheets of Co3O4 and a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method was exploited to coat these sheets with nanostructures of Cu2S and Ag2S. The resulting three-dimensional (3D) Co3O4/Cu2S and Co3O4/Ag2S composite electrode contained a high loading of Cu2S and Ag2S nanoparticles (metal sulfides) on the hexagonal sheets of Co3O4 (metal oxide), which offers a highly conductive network assisting in rapid charge-transfer reactions and reduces the internal resistance of the electrode. A symmetrical supercapacitor based on Co3O4/Cu2S//Co3O4/Cu2S showed a high areal capacitance of 1080 mF cm−2, which was significantly higher than that of the Co3O4/Ag2S//Co3O4/Ag2S symmetric supercapacitor (645 mF cm−2). These results show that the Co3O4/Cu2S composite heterostructure is a promising electrode architecture for high performance pseudocapacitors.
