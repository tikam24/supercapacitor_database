Supercapacitors have evolved as the premier choice of the era for storing huge amounts of charge in the field of energy storage devices, but it is still necessary to enhance their performance to meet the increasing requirements of future systems. This could be achieved either through advancing the interfaces of the material at the nanoscale or by using novel material compositions. We report a high-performance material composition prepared by combining a transition metal (palladium)-doped conductive polymer with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). MWCNTs/palladium-doped polyaniline (MWCNTs/Pd/PANI) composites and multiwalled carbon nanotube/polyaniline (MWCNTs/PANI) composites (for comparison) were prepared via in situ oxidative polymerization of aniline monomer. The reported composites were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), x-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies. FESEM and TEM studies indicated the narrow size distribution of the π-conjugated polymer-protected palladium nanoparticles on the surface of the carbon nanotubes. All the electrochemical characterizations were executed using a three-electrode system in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis was performed to observe the capacitive performance and redox behavior of the composites. The ion transfer behavior and cyclic stability of the composites were investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis and cyclic charge-discharge (CCD) testing, respectively. The MWCNTs/Pd/PANI composite was found to exhibit an especially high specific capacitance value of 920 F/g at scan rate of 2 mV/s. © 2013 TMS.
