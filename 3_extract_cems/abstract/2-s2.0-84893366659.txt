The design of an Energy Storage System (ESS) based on SuperCapacitors (SCs) for Metro Network (MN) regenerative braking energy recovery system is investigated. A simulation tool is implemented in order to estimate the power flow among the metro vehicles and the ESSs through the MN. Several simulations are performed in order to design the number, the position along the track and the required capacity of the SCs. The energy delivered from the electric substations and the energy saved using a particular ESS configuration computed by joint sizing and siting approach are estimated to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
