The voltage of symmetrical supercapacitors with water as the electrolyte is usually limited to about 1 V due to the decomposition of water. The voltage can be expanded to a certain extent by modifying the electrode. K+ and Li+ doped MnO2 were prepared on carbon cloth by electrochemical deposition with satisfied conductivity and electrochemical properties herein. The voltage of the mixed structure electrode is expanded to 1.3 V by using the synergistic effect of the pseudo capacitance of doped-MnO2 and electric double-layer capacitance of carbon cloth. Structural analysis of the samples was performed using scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The specific capacitances of the K+ and Li+ doped MnO2 were 231.2 F/g and 283.4 F/g at 10 mV/s, respectively. Excellent integrated electrochemical performance of Li-MnO2/C suggest that this strategy can serve as a novel approach to synthesize materials for energy storage in the wide voltage range.
