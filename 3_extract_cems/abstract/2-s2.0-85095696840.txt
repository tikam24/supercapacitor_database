Two-dimensional (2D) materials are attractive for energy storage applications owing to their layered structures and active surface areas. The electrolyte ion intercalation technique separates the energy storage processes in batteries and supercapacitors. This chapter discusses the energy storage processes, reaction mechanism, and recent research progress in advanced 2D materials for both supercapacitor and supercapattery applications.
