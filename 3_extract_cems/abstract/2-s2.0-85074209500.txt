Owning to the high corrosion-resistance, stable structure, unique surface properties and sustainability, the carbon-base catalysts have attracted increasing interest in heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, we report a facile combining strategy to fabricate a novel three-dimensional (3D) interconnected porous nitrogen-doped carbon hybrid foam featuring with the interconnected nitrogen-doped carbon foam coated by porous nitrogen-doped carbon (NCMS@NCGlu-NH4Cl) by annealing the freeze-dried NH4Cl-glucose containing aqueous solution soaked melamine sponge (MS@Glu/NH4Cl). The as-prepared NCMS@NCGlu-NH4Cl hybrid foam shows 1.6 times high steady-state styrene rate (4.77 mmol g−1 h−1) with 96.4 % of selectivity for direct dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene as compared to the well-established nanodiamond. This work not only generates an excellent carbon catalyst to replace the established nanodiamond for direct dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene, but also opens up a potential avenue for designing novel carbon materials towards the adsorption and supercapacitor besides acting as a promising catalyst for diverse transformations.
