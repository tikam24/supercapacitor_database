The Graphene nanosheets/SnO2 composites were synthesized using stannous chloride to restore the semi-reduction graphene oxide (SRGO) under a simple hydrothermal reduction procedure. First graphene oxide was pre-reduced by glucose for a certain time to get SRGO, which keeps the good water-solubility of graphite oxide (GO) and has a good conductivity like graphene nanosheets. The higher electrostatic attraction between SRGO and Sn2+ makes SnO 2 nanoparticles tightly anchor on the graphene sheets in the hydrothermal reduction process. The formation mechanism of the composite was investigated by SEM, TEM, XRD, AFM and Raman. Moreover, the electrochemical behaviors of the Graphene nanosheets/SnO2 nanocomposites were studied by cyclic voltammogram, electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and chronopotentiometry. Results showed that the Graphene nanosheets/SnO2 composites have excellent supercapacitor performances: the specific capacitance reached 368 F g-1 at a current density of 5 mA cm-2, and the energy density was much improved to 184 Wh kg-1 with a power density of 16 kW kg-1, and capacity retention was more than 95% after cycling 500 cycles with a constant current density of 50 mA cm-2. The experimental results and the thorough analysis described in this work not only provide a potential electrode material for supercapacitors but also give us a new way to solve the reunification of the graphene sheetsÂ© 2013 Elsevier B.V.
