Layered structural Co-MOF nanosheets were synthesized and then used as an electrode material for supercapacitors for the first time. This material exhibited a high specific capacitance, a good rate capability, and an excellent cycling stability. A maximum capacitance of 2564 F g−1 can be achieved at a current density of 1 Ag−1. Moreover, the capacitance retention can be kept at 95.8 % respectively of its initial value after 3000 cycles. To the best of our knowledge, both the specific capacitance and the capacitance retention were the highest values reported for MOF materials as supercapacitor electrodes until now. Such a high supercapacitive performance might be attributed to the intrinsic characteristics of this kind of Co-MOF material, including its layered structure, conductive network frame, and thin nanosheet.
