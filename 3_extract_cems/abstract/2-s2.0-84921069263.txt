Hybrid material consisting of α-Fe2O3 and nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO/Fe2O3) for supercapacitor electrode material has been synthesized via an easy one-step hydrothermal method, where urea serves as nitrogen source, reducing agent and precipitant. As a result, the reduction and nitrogen doping of graphene oxide and the in situ formation of α-Fe2O3 are achieved simultaneously. The results show that the synthesized N-rGO/Fe2O3 composite exhibits much better electrochemical performance than the sample without nitrogen doping. Moreover, thanks to the positive synergetic effect between N-rGO and α-Fe2O3, the N-rGO/Fe2O3 composite shows superior electrochemical property, including high capacitance, excellent rate capability, and good cycle life. Consequently, the easy preparation approach in this work will be considered as an efficient pathway for the development of metal oxide or hydroxide/N-rGO electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.
