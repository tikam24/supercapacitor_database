Cobalt ferrite nanoparticles are synthesized by facile combustion method using aspartic acid and glycine as fuels in three different pH conditions (5, 7 and 10) and employed as a negative electrode for supercapacitors. For positive electrodes, Co(OH)2 and Co2Fe(CN)6 particles are prepared by wet chemical method and studied its structural and morphological features. The electrochemical properties revealed that the aspartic acid assisted CoFe2O4 (CA7) negative electrode exhibits an enhanced specific capacitance of 758 F g-1 at 2 mV s-1 in 1 M KOH. Similarly, the galvanostatic charge-discharge analysis (GCD) shows a specific capacitance of 356 F g-1 at 1 mA cm-2. On the other hand, Co(OH)2 and Co2Fe(CN)6 shows the specific capacitance of 932 and 817 Fg-1 at 2 mV s-1, respectively. Interestingly, the fabricated asymmetric supercapacitors, CoFe2O4∥AC, CoFe2O4∥Co(OH)2 and CoFe2O4∥Co2Fe(CN)6 provides the specific capacitance of 339, 127 and 125 F g-1 at 1 mV s-1 in 1 M KOH, respectively.
