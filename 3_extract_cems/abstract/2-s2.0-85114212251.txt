The bi-directional DC-DC converter is always adopted for the battery/supercapacitor to realize flexible power management. The current and voltage control of the DC-DC converter is the fundamental for the realization of the power management. This paper focuses on the inner current control of the DC-DC converter and proposes a novel state-space-based control method. A zero-pole cancellation algorithm is proposed to design the control parameters. Consequently, the proposed control method can accomplish outstanding dynamic response. Finally, the experimental results are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control method.
