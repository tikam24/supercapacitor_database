Bimetallic selenides have aroused great interest as the electroactive materials for energy storage because of their high conductivity, robust electrochemical activity, and the synergistic effect. Herein, (Ni0.75Co0.25)Se2 nanoparticles embedded in N-doped nanocarbon ((Ni0.75Co0.25)Se2@NC) hybrids were derived from nickel and cobalt bimetal-organic frameworks (NiCo-MOFs), which were synthesized by ethylene glycol solvothermal method. Due to the synergistic contributions and unique architecture, (Ni0.75Co0.25)Se2@NC hybrids electrode presents a considerable specific capacity of 536.6 C g−1 at a discharge current density of 1 A g−1. In addition, an as-assembled (Ni0.75Co0.25)Se2@NC//activated carbon (AC) hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) ((Ni0.75Co0.25)Se2@NC//AC HSC) shows large specific capacitance (73.6 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1), outstanding energy density (26.2 Wh kg−1 at 400 W kg−1) with superior cyclic performance (88.7% of capacity retention after 5000 cycles). Furthermore, a (Ni0.75Co0.25)Se2@NC//AC device could drive a mini-fan running for 67 s. Thus, (Ni0.75Co0.25)Se2@NC is an outstanding active material for electrochemical energy storage.
