In this study, we have reported a facile fabrication of pristine zinc sulfide (ZnS), manganese sulfide (MnS), and ZnS/MnS nanocomposites (NCs) via cost-effective chemical precipitation method for electrochemical supercapacitor applications. The XRD, HR-TEM, and XPS analyses confirm the formation of ZnS/MnS NCs in the synthesized product. The electrochemical properties of ZnS/MnS NC electrode showed high specific capacitance of 884 F g−1 at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1. Besides, we have fabricated a symmetric supercapacitor using ZnS/MnS NCsǁZnS/MnS NCs which exhibited a maximum energy density of 91 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 7.78 kW kg−1 with stable capacitance retention after 5000 cycles. Thus, the synergetic effect generated from the wurtzite-type hexagonal structure of ZnS/MnS leads to superior electron/ion transfer resulting in the enhanced electrochemical performance of the ZnS/MnS NCs which might be an ideal choice for cost-effective, high-performance supercapacitor applications.
