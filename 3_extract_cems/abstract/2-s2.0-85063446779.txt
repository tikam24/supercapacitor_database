It is an effective approach for recycling the energy during the process of lowering drill string and casing to reduce the cost of the oil drilling rig lifting system. In the present work, for the multi-model drilling rig, the total energy recovery and energy-saving ratio are calculated with considering the effect of hook without loading. The total energy recovery and energy-saving ratio is significantly increased when hook without loading is considered. Employing the supercapacitor, an automatic energy storage system is designed, and the control strategy of this system is discussed. The energy of lowering drill string and hook without loading is recycled for the energy replenish of lifting drill string and hook without loading. The selection and analysis of the supercapacitor in the system configuration must take into consideration the quantity, volume, quality, and the utilization of the supercapacitor at the same time, selecting the suitable capacity of the supercapacitor for reducing the cost of drilling effectively.
