In this study, reduced graphene oxide/MXene-based composite electrodes combined with Fe2O3 and NiCo-P as the negative and positive electrodes are prepared by a facile in-situ solvothermal route. Both rGO/MXene@Fe2O3 and rGO/MXene@NiCo-P have an interconnected nanostructure with the specific surface areas at 17.1 and 131.9 m2·g−1. The specific capacitance of the as-prepared rGO/MXene@Fe2O3 and rGO/MXene@NiCo-P composite electrodes are 248.13 and 214.66 mAh·g−1 under current density at 1 A·g−1. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is further assembled using rGO/MXene@Fe2O3 and rGO/MXene@NiCo-P as the negative and positive electrodes, respectively. The maximum energy density of the assembled ASC is 29.46 Wh·kg−1 at a power density of 700.34 W·kg−1. After 10,000 cycles, 70.87 % of the capacity can be retained. These results demonstrate the potential application of composite electrode materials for supercapacitors.
