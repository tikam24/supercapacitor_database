In this work, the usage of electrochemically produced NiFe nanowires (NW) as an electrode active material for supercapacitors has been investigated. Different concentrations of NiFe NWs were dispersed on thin conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) films by spin coating system. NiFe NW networks/PEDOT:PSS electrode was used as a positive electrode in the three-electrode cell. Electrochemical capacitive performance tests such as; electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, galvanostatic charge-discharge tests (GCD) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were performed in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The CV curves of the designed electrodes have been found to be similar to the CV curves of the ideal supercapacitor and they have almost rectangular in shape. The specific capacitance of 2 mg NW mass loading was evaluated 332 F/g at a current density of 2 A/g from GCD measurements with excellent cyclability up to 5000 times. These good electrochemical performances arise from network structure of NiFe NW based electrode.
