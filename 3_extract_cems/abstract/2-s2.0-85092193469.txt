Manganese phosphates have shown excellent performances and great potential in electrochemical energy storage, which are demonstrated by research works published in recent years. For manganese phosphates, the open-framework structures with large channels and cavities endow them with good ion conductivity and charge storage capacity. In this review, we present the recent progress on manganese phosphates, by focusing on their advantages/disadvantages and potential applications as a new class of electrode materials in supercapacitors. The structural characteristics, synthesis methods, and mineral sources to prepare these manganese phosphates are investigated, together with the modification, as they strongly affect the electrochemical energy storage performance. Attentions are paid to those hybrid-type materials, where strong synergistic effects exist. In the summary, interlayer engineering for the manganese phosphates and hybrid-types are proposed and discussed.
