In this study, graphene oxide, lanthanum sulfide and their composite thin films are prepared using simple and inexpensive chemical methods and their supercapacitive performance is evaluated. The X-ray diffraction study shows the formation of mixed-phase lanthanum sulfide with monoclinic α-LaS2 and tetragonal La5S7. Field emission scanning electron microscopy images show porous surface morphology of lanthanum sulfide and composite thin films. The supercapacitive performance of composite film tested in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte shows highest specific capacitance of 312 F g−1 at a 5 mV s−1 scan rate.
