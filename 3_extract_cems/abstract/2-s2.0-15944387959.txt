The nano-MnO2 as active electrode material for supercapacitor was synthesized by solid-state reaction between KMnO4 and manganese acetate at room temperature. The products annealed at 100°C and 200°C were characterized by XRD and TEM. The results showed the sample annealed at 100°C was poorly crystallized phase with an average grain size of <20 nm. Electrochemical performances of manganese oxide electrode were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and constant current charge/discharge. The manganese oxide electrode annealed at 100°C in 1 mol·L-1 Na 2SO4 aqueous electrolyte exhibited excellent capacitive behavior between -0.2 and +0.8 V (vs SCE). By 5 mA and 10 mA constant current charge/discharge, the nano-MnO2 annealed at 100°C can provide a specific capacitance of 158.5 F·g-1 and 151.2 F·g -1, respectively.
