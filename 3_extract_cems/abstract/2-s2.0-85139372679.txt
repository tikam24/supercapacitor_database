In the last decade, the production of clean and sustainable energy sources for energy storage purposes have grown dramatically due to the population growth and increasing demand for energy in the world. In this regard, supercapacitors have proved to be promising candidates in energy storage applications. Therefore, in this study, polyaniline/cadmium oxide/graphene oxide (PANI/CdO/GO) nanocomposite was prepared by co-precipitation method to evaluate the electrochemical performance. The structural and surface properties, morphology and particle size distribution were analyzed by XRD diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), N2 adsorption-desorption, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Furthermore, the synthesized nanocomposite was applied as an active electrode material and its performance was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in terms of energy storage. The results of these tests confirmed that PANI/CdO/GO nanocomposite provides great electrochemical behavior, including specific capacity of 647 F g−1, energy density of 116.6 W h kg−1, power density of 388 W kg−1 compared to the other electrode. According to the stability test, the initial capacity maintenance was about 82% after 500 charge-discharge cycles, which indicated relatively good electrochemical stability. Moreover, the impedance spectroscopy studies showed that the nanocomposite possessed much lower internal strength and charge transfer reaction resistance in comparison to the other synthesized materials. Based on these results, it was found that the prepared nanocomposite has a good performance in the field of energy storage.
