Herein, the successful synthesis of tin sulfide compounds by a facile one-step solvothermal method is reported, and its evolution of hierarchically formed petal-like 3-dimensional layer structures for SnS2 via ratio control of Sn/thiourea(TU) is systematically investigated. With the increase of TU content, the two-dimensional layered structure is clearly changed from discrete to hierarchically dense nanostructure. Thus, among various conditions, SnS2 with 1:2 ratio (SNS12) shows superior electrochemical performance associated with its discrete nanostructure. In this study, sample SNS12 shows a high specific capacitance of 1403 F g-1 at 1 mVs-1, a high power density of 456.42 W h kg-1 at an energy density of 46.84 W kg-1 with the stable cyclic performance of 85.87% up to 5000 cycles. The enhanced electrochemical performances are attributed to its unique ultrathin petal discrete structure, which allows for fast ion/electron transfer, high active sites, short diffusion distance, and more electrolyte/electrode interface access. Moreover, a fabricated symmetric supercapacitor device has a high capacity to operate commercial LED, leading to the validation of its practical operation durability for synthesized material on a device-level application. This study suggests that favorably layered 3D SnS2 electrode materials and their controllable protocols via Sn/TU ratio modulation could be one of the beneficial direction for the envisioned energy storage applications.
