Herein, we designed and prepared a one-dimensional (1-D) cobalt-based metal organic coordination polymer (2,4-pdc-Co) by hydrothermal method. 2,4-pdc-Co has the molecular formula of Co4(H2O)10(2,4-pdc)4 and possesses orthorhombic symmetry Pna21 space group. In the same synthesis method, we added urea as a template. On the premise of maintaining this 1-D microstructure, we modified the block-shape 2,4-pdc-Co into a 1-D wire (2,4-pdc-Co-W). As an electrode material for supercapacitors, compared with 2,4-pdc-Co, the modified 2,4-pdc-Co-W shows better electrochemical performance. The specific capacitance of the optimized electrode material can reach 325 F g-1at 1 A g−1. 2,4-pdc-Co-W is also assembled with activated carbon to form a battery-type hybrid supercapacitor. As the positive material for the device, an assembled hybridcapacitor delivers an energy density of 17.7 Wh kg−1 at power density of 400 W kg−1.
