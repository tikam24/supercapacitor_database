Graphene was synthesized from rice husks by the alkaline treatment process, which was used as a dopant to produce graphite: graphene composite electrodes for supercapocitor application. The composite electrode material was characterized by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). At 5 mV/s, the graphite (G) and graphene (Gr) ratio of G0.3 gGr0.15 g produced the highest specific capacitance of 16,007.02Fgâ€“1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) revealed the low resistance property of the prepared electrode samples. The results show that the graphene derived from rice husk doped graphite electrode material has great potential for supercapacitor electrodes because of its low cost and excellent electrochemical performance, thus possessing great potential in future energy development.
