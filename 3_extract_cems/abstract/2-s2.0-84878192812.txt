Manganese oxides with different structures and morphologies were synthesized by hydrothermally treating KMnO4 and MnSO4 with varying molar ratio. As the molar ratio of KMnO4 and MnSO4 is 6:1, the urchin-like δ-MnO2 superstructures with the diameter of 0.5-1 μm were prepared, which consist of agglomerate petal-shaped thin nanosheet. By adjusting the molar ratio of KMnO4 and MnSO4 to 2:3, the uniform α-MnO2 nanowires were fabricated with the diameter of 30 to 50 nm and the length up to 1 μm. With a decrease molar ratio of 1:3, the short rod-like β-MnO2 were obtained with the diameter of 500 nm and the length ranging from 2 to 4 μm. The electrochemical properties of obtained MnO2 samples as supercapacitor electrode materials were examined by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge in a three electrode system, the results indicated that spherical urchin-like δ-MnO2 possessed excellent supercapacitive performance. The specific capacitance of δ-MnO2 was about 162 F/g at a constant current of 1 A/g, which was much higher than the specific capacitance of α-MnO2 nanowires (62 F/g) and β-MnO2 nanorods (8 F/g).
