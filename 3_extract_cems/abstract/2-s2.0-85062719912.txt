HY zeolite (solid acid) doped poly(aniline)/SnO2 nanocomposite were successfully prepared by in situ chemical polymerization method of aniline doped by 5 wt% of HY zeolite (solid acid) using ammonium persulfate as oxidant in aqueous solution containing 5 to 20 wt% of SnO2 with respect to aniline monomer. The composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman analysis, UV–Vis spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electrical conductivity and electrochemistry. The XRD patterns of the prepared samples showed the presence of SnO2 with an affected crystalline structure. The FTIR and Raman analysis confirmed the attachment of PANI/HY on the SnO2 surface having a nanostructure as a main shape. The UV–Vis absorption spectra of PANI/HY/SnO2 nanocomposites were studied to explore the optical behavior after dedoping of nanoparticles into the PANI/HY matrix. The electrochemical properties were investigated by using the cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Both PANI/5 wt% HY/5 wt% of SnO2 ternary nanocomposite achieved a maximum capacitance of 1085 g−1 at 5 mV s−1. The results indicated that the PANI/HY/SnO2 nanocomposites have a synergistic effect with the complementary properties of both components.
