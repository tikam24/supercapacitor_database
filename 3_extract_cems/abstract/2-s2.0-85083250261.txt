A high energy-density supercapacitor is currently undergoing exciting development with an entirely new kind of electric power device: a biosupercapacitor in which electric energy is simultaneously acquired and stored. This new hybrid device integrates the energy harvesting function of an electrochemical energy storage device (e.g. bio-solar cells) with the high-power operation of an internal supercapacitor. Manganese oxide/carbon nanotube/poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate nanocomposites on carbon cloth were developed as a novel anode for the biosupercapacitor. Cyanobacterial biofilm formed on the anode provided 3-D double-functional electrode concurrently exhibiting solar-driven energy-generating and storing features, generating maximum power and current density of 25.48mu mathrm{W}/text{cm}-{2} and 115.81mu mathrm{A}/text{cm}-{2}, respectively, which is the highest reported success of any existing biosupercapacitors. The 3-D dual-feature bioanode demonstrated superior capacitive behaviors, electrochemical properties, a high rate of bacterial extracellular electron transfer, and efficient mass transfer to and from the electrode, all of which led to high power generation.
