In the past decade, MXenes, a new class of advanced functional 2D nanomaterials, have emerged among numerous types of electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage devices. MXene and their composites have opened up an interesting new opportunity in the field of functional materials, owing to their transition metal nitrides/carbides/carbonitride-based unique layered structures, higher electrical and thermal conductivity, higher charge carrier mobility, high negative zeta-potential, high mechanical properties, tunable bandgap, superior hydrophilicity, metallic nature and rich surface chemistry, which enhance the number of metal active redox sites on the surface and short ion diffusion path. However, in the case of electrochemical energy storage applications, the unavoidable problem of aggregation and nanosheet restacking significantly reduces the accessibility of the active surface sites of MXene materials for electrolyte ions. Currently, there is a number of research efforts devoted to solutions in order to avoid these deficits. This Review complies extensively with the recent advances in the application of MXene-based materials in the energy storage devices such as batteries and supercapacitors. Particular attention is paid to the understanding of the relation of MXenes chemical composition, and morphology with their electrochemical performances. Moreover, the challenges of MXenes and MXene-based composited for the commercial application are considered and the ways to overcome their drawbacks are provided. Finally, opportunities given with MXenes for future research on novel energy storage materials are highlighted.
