Heteroatom doping in carbon displays exciting chemistry and plays an extremely important role in improving electrochemical performances. For instance, in energy storage devices, carbon allotropes showed excellent capacitive characteristics, however, their limiting ion storing capability cannot meet current requirements. Herein, the work discusses a simple technique for developing functionalized N-doped carbon to provide an easy access to ion percolation with high specific surface area of 709.09 m2g−1. The optimized carbon material delivers high gravimetric capacitance 295Fg−1 with high volumetric capacitance of 270Fcm−3. Also, the high electrochemical performance of its symmetric device 268Fg−1 at 0.25 Ag−1 current density with noticeably high cyclic stability of 100 000 cycles with 90% capacitance retention reveals an excellent approach to the device applications. These results imply an optimized nitrogen content that strongly influences the electrochemical performance of carbon material and opens up opportunities for designing high-performance energy storage devices.
