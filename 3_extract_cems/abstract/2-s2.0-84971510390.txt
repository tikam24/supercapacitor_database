Graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are nanosized carbon materials with large specific surface areas, outstanding electrical conductivities, excellent mechanical properties, and other remarkable characteristics. Preparation of graphene oxide is by a redox method, followed by vertical deposition to prepare graphene oxide/carbon nanotube GO/CNT) composites. Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to characterize the morphology and microstructure of the materials. Electrodes were made by deposition of graphene oxide/carbon nanotube composites on an indium tin oxide glass slide, and its electrical properties were characterized by cyclic voltammetry. The GO/CNT composites exhibit excellent energy and power densities and are ideal materials for the preparation of supercapacitor electrodes.
