Single-phase hierarchical manganese selenide (α-MnSe) microflowers assembled by nanosheets were synthesized through a facile-solvothermal strategy and applied for symmetrical supercapacitor's electrode material for the first time. The α-MnSe microflowers supported on carbon textile exhibit well balanced capacitive (56.85%) and surface-redox charge storage (43.15%) in aqueous electrolyte. Interestingly, the all-solid-state flexible symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) based on α-MnSe electrodes can operate at high potential (1.8 V) and exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance (200 F g−1 and 55.42 Wh kg−1 at 1 A g−1) with excellent cycling stability (97.15%) over 5000 cycles and surpasses all previously reported symmetric and asymmetric SCs based on MnSe.
