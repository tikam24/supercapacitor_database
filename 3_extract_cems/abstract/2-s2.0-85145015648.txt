Carbon cloth (CC)-based electrodes have attracted extensive attention for next-generation wearable energy-storage devices due to their excellent electrical conductivity and mechanical flexibility. However, the application of conventional CC-based electrodes for zinc (Zn) storage severely hinders Zn ion transport and induces deleterious Zn dendrite growth, resulting in poor electrochemical reliability. Herein, a novel oxygen plasma-treated carbon cloth (OPCC) is rationally designed as a current collector for flexible hybrid Zn ion supercapacitors (ZISs). The modified interface of OPCC with abundant oxygenated groups enables enhanced electrolyte wettability and uniform superficial electric field distribution. A prolonged working lifespan for Zn electrodeposition is achieved by the OPCC due to the improved interfacial kinetics and homogenized ion gradient. The as-prepared hybrid ZIS also delivers excellent cycling endurance (98.5% capacity retention for 1500 cycles) with outstanding operation stability under various extreme conditions. This facile surface modification strategy provides a new way for developing future flexible electrodes for wearable electronic products. Graphical Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
