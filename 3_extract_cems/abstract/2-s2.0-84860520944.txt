High-throughput production of flexible, all-solid-state supercapacitors can be accomplished by integrating redox-functionalized commercial carbon nanotube sheets with H 2SO 4/PVA/H 2O polymer hydrogel electrolyte. The chemical composition, elemental oxidation states, and crystallinity of the pristine and 0.02 M potassium perruthenate-treated multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) sheets are examined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. In assembled hydrogel-based supercapacitor cells, ruthenium oxide-decorated MWCNT sheet electrodes exhibit a specific capacitance of 96 F/g at 1.0 A/g and good cycle stability. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.
