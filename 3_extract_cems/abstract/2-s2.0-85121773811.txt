Composite of black phosphorus and graphene is a promising energy storage material and rarely used in supercapacitor. Here, composites of black phosphorus and reduced graphene oxide (BP/rGO) were prepared by solvothermal method and oil bath method for contrast, respectively. BP/rGO prepared by solvothermal method (S-BP/rGO) shows block morphology with thickness of 20 μm. BP/rGO prepared by oil bath method (O-BP/rGO) shows flower-like morphology with BP quantum dots evenly dispersed on rGO flakes. O-BP/rGO has a better energy storage performance with specific capacitance of 143 F/g at 1 A/g, and a retention rate of 96.8% after 10,000 cycles. The flower-like structure allows for efficient charge storage and the C–P bond between BP and graphene can enhance ion transport, which results in synergistic energy storage performance.
