First attempt of practical realization of new interface engineering approach "from advanced materials to advanced devices" for nanosystems of Advanced Superionic Conductors (ASICs), based on AgI (Cul) compounds is presented. Crystallochemical method of symmetry perfect ASIC//electrode interface searching is developed. Some new theoretical results of ASICV/indifferent electrode conjugated commensurate heteropairs with coherent interfaces and preliminary experimental results of the creation of thin-film supercapacitor - prototype based on the lattice matched heterojunction - are given. Future perspectives of the ASIC//electrode interface design suited for micro(nano)electronics and microsystem technology (MST) are discussed.
