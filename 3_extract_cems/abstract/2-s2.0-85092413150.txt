Hybrid nanocomposite containing poly o-toluidine, copper nanocomposite (CuONC), and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) was fabricated by in-situ oxidative synthesis method. The electrochemical performance of the hybrid composite was inspected as a supercapacitor material by three-electrode cyclic voltammogram analysis. Physicochemical aspects of synthesized OT/MWCNT/CuO nanocomposite were justified by FTIR, UV-vis. spectroscopy, XRD, FESEM and EDX techniques. The composite comprising of metal oxide, polymer and MWCNTs offers a promising alternate for developing better supercapacitor electrode materials. The highest specific capacitance of 1900 F/g at a scanning rate of 5 mV/s and 1800 F/g and current density of 1A /g was achieved in an aqueous solution of 0.5M H2SO4 with good cycle stability.
