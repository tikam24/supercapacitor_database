A highly flexible solid-state micro-supercapacitor based on a pen ink-carbon-fiber (Ink-CF) thread structure was fabricated with excellent electrochemical performance such as a high capacitance of 4.31 mF cm-2 and an energy density of 3.8 × 10-7 W h cm-2 at a power density of 5.6 × 10-6 W cm-2. This fabricated structure shows excellent characteristics such as lightweight, small volume, flexibility and portability. By integrating it with a triboelectric nanogenarator, the micro-supercapacitors could be charged and power 8 commercial LEDs, demonstrating its feasibility as an efficient storage component for self-powered micro/nanosystems.
