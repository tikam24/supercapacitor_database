This paper reports structural and electrochemical characteristics for polyaniline (PANi) incorporated ZnCo2O4@N-GO hybrid nanocomposite synthesized by thermal reduction. The prepared composites were characterized using XRD, Raman, SEM, TEM, XPS, BET, and CV studies. The ZnCo2O4@N-GO/PANi composite exhibited enhanced porosity and electrochemical activity. SEM and TEM analysis revealed spherical and plate shaped particulates of ZnCo2O4@N-GO and ZnCo2O4@N-GO/PANi composite, respectively, indicating PANi effects in forming flakey shapes. XRD results confirmed multifaceted PANi-incorporated composite, with higher surface area and porosity, and enhanced electrochemical activity compared with pristine ZnCo2O4@N-GO. The PANi included composite electrode exhibited excellent electrochemical performance with good cyclic stability above 96%, significantly superior to ZnCo2O4@N-GO composite. Thus, the proposed PANi included composite is a promising catalytic material for supercapacitor applications.
