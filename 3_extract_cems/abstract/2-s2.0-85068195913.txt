Successfully propagating electrons and storing them in the electrolyte is a significant challenge that would allow supercapacitors to exceed their current limit, especially in terms of energy density. With this objective in mind, we have synthesized new ionic liquid molecules that allowed a limited electron propagation and storage in the electrolyte. These new molecules are named as biredox ionic liquids. In the present paper, we will show how biredox ionic liquids build a new paradigm in the field of supercapacitors. Despite our encouraging results, storage of electrons in the electrolyte still has a long way to go before being mastered, given the remaining scientific and technological issues to consider. These challenges will also be outlined in this paper.
