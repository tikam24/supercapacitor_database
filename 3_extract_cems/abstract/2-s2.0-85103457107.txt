Bimodal NiCo2O4·MnO2(NCM) nanorods were grown on carbon fiber paper (CFP) using a hydrothermal process. The structural and morphological studies were performedviapowder X-ray diffraction and field-emission scanning electron microscopy, respectively. The aspect ratio of the developed electrode significantly improved up to a threshold concentration of manganese in the Ni/Co binary oxide, and thereafter decreased. The capacitive performance and electrochemical parameters of the developed NCM nanorods were analyzed using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and impedance spectroscopy. The maximum specific capacitance of the developed NCM nanorods was found to be 2575 F g−1(305 mA h g−1) at a current density of 5 A g−1. Additionally, the excellent cyclic retention of nearly 92.5% was achieved for the NCM nanocomposite even after 5000 cycles. Also, the response time (τo) calculated from the Bode plot was found to be ∼22 s, which validated the fast charging of the developed electrode material. Furthermore, an asymmetric solid-state supercapacitor (ASC) device was successfully assembled utilizing NCM (1 : 2 : 2) nanorods and activated carbon as positive and negative electrodes, respectively. The developed device achieved a capacitance of 130 F g−1(176.1 mA h g−1) with an energy density and power density of 138 W h kg−1and 722 W kg−1, respectively, which could illuminate an LED bulb (1.8 V) for 50 min.
