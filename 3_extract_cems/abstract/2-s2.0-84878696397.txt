The work unit for 100 V voltage of the hybrid supercapacitor is synthesized by using Ta/Ta2O5 as the anode, activated carbon as the cathode. Compared with the usual electrochemical capacitor working voltage, the capacitance had improved. The electrochemical performance shows that it has high energy storage density and rapid charging and discharging ability, electrochemical spectrum impedance (EIS) analysis shows that it has good impedance characteristics and the frequency characteristics.
