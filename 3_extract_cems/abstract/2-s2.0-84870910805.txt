A novel high performance electrode material for supercapacitor applications, terephthalonitrile-derived nitrogen-rich network (TNN), is developed successfully via temperature-dependent cross-linking of terephthalonitrile monomers. This work opens up a new window for seeing a versatile modular toolbox derived from various aromatic nitrile monomers for developing better electrode materials in the future.
