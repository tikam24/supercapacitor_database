Modern trams use pure electric to drive. Trams are currently new popular railway transportation products. They are convenient and environment friendly, comfortable and efficient. But since the overhead power network in some particular environment or section has an adverse impact on the landscape, it brings some difficulties to the line planning. With the development of new energy storage technology, research and development of catenary free low floor tram are to adapt to the current market demand of the technology development direction. In this chapter, the supercapacitor-based energy storage system is used to achieve full range of catenary free tram design, and the feasibility of this scheme is checked and verified by the traction calculation.
