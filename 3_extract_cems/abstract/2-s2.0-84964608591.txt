A new three-dimensional (3D) nanoporous ZnWO4 nanoparticles with WCl6 and Zn(NO3)2Â·6H2O as the precursors was prepared by electrospinning through a simple and facile progress of electrospinning. The 3D nanoporous ZnWO4 nanoparticles(3DN ZnWO4) were used as the electrode for supercapacitor application, and the electrochemical performance was analyzed, indicating the 3DN ZnWO4 supercapacitor is an ideal electrode material with an outstanding cycle, high specific capacitance and excellent rate capacitance, especially it can resist a high current charge and discharge with a little capacitance fading(specific capacitance decreases only 10% with the current density being increased from 40 A g-1 to 100 A g-1).
