Hierarchical Bi2S3 nanoflowers consisting of one-dimensional nanorods have been successfully synthesized via a topotactic transformation process. In this fabrication route, hierarchical Bi2WO6 nanoflowers composed of two-dimensional nanosheets were used as the precursor template. Investigated by a time-dependent experiment, the possible formation mechanism of hierarchical Bi2S3 nanoflowers has been proposed. Furthermore, the key role played by thioacetamide (TAA) in the formation of hierarchical structures has also been investigated by controlling its content. In addition, the as-fabricated hierarchical Bi2S3 nanoflowers exhibited high specific capacitance and electrochemical stability, and the intriguing capacitive behavior might be ascribed to their special three-dimensional hierarchical structure.
