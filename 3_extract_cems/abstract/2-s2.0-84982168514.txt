Nest-like hollow structure of MnO2 was synthesized via a simple and facile hydrothermal procedure without using any template or surfactant. The morphology of MnO2 nanostructures can be easily controlled by altering the reaction time. The architectural feature of hollow nest-like MnO2 was investigated by using field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. This nest-like hollow nanosphere of MnO2 exhibits prominent electrochemical properties, such as the considerable specific capacitance of 211.1 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, excellent voltammograms property and the remarkable long-term cycling stability with 93.6 % surplus of capacitance after 1000 cycles. From the above, this nest-like hollow nanostructured MnO2 is a promising electrode material for supercapacitor.
