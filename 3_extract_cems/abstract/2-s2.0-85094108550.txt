A three-level dual-output dc-dc converter (TLDOC) suitable for medium voltage DC input was designed for the ultraca-pacitor energy storage of electromagnetic launch system. The topology of the converter was analyzed, and the phase shift pulse width modulation strategy was designed. The parameters of the main components were calculated and the small signal model of the converter was established. To solve the problem of the uneven voltage of two ultracapacitors, a constant current control strategy with maximum output current feedback was proposed. The simulation verification and the experiment verification of the hardware in the loop (HIL) were carried out. On this basis, an experimental prototype was built according to the design parameters. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the maximum output current feedback constant current control strategy.
