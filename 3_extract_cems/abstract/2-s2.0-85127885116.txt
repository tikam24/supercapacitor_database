As per the high requirement of energy storage, the hybrid mechanism of supercapacitors (SCs) and batteries are gradually widespread as an alternative for conventional and traditional batteries. The supercapacitor has enlarged consideration due to its exceptional properties like high power, density, long life cycle, exceptional specific capacitance, rate capability, and virtuous electrochemical reversibility. SC is the link between high-energy storage devices like fuel cells/batteries and high-power energy density devices like a capacitor. There are various types of energy storage devices used for high energy delivery. This article mainly introduces the higher efficiency hybrid mechanism of supercapacitor and battery, fundamentals, applied aspects, materials and the future of research & development.
