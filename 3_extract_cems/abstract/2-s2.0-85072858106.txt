Nanostructured electrodes for supercapacitors made by combination of electrical double layer and pseudocapacitive based-nanomaterials within a single hybrid composite has a great potential on expanding the range of use of these devices and increase their electrochemical performance. In this work, we developed several nanostructured composites with combinations of such types of materials with potential applicability as electrodes in supercapacitors. In particular, these composites were obtained by easy, cost-effective and scalable procedures, and were composed by NiCo2O4 cores as the main reversible fast faradaic-based nanomaterial and either the conductive polymer polyaniline (PANI), multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), or reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) as the electrical double layer-based carbonaceous-based nanomaterials in order to enable the combination of both type of energy storage processes within a single nanostructured electrode. These constructions allowed us to obtain specific capacitance as large as 1760 F/g, 900 F/g and 734 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g for NiCo2O4/PANI, NiCo2O4/MWCNT, and NiCo2O4/r-GO nanostructured composite electrodes, respectively. Besides, the stability of NiCo2O4/MWCNTs and NiCo2O4/r-GO-based electrodes was outstanding, with capacity losses below 10% after the periods of operation (>1000 cycles).
