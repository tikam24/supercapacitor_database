Rational design of electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to efficiently evolve oxygen molecules with low overpotential and electrode material disclosing high power density for supercapacitor remains a challenge. Pristine g-C3N4, MnCo2O4/g-C3N4 and cation modified MnCo2O4 intercalated with g-C3N4 (Mn0路4Ni0路6Co2O4/g-C3N4) were prepared and investigated its efficacy towards catalyzing OER. Mn0.4Ni0.6Co2O4/g-C3N4 electrocatalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 320 mV @ current density of 10 mA/cm2 and a small Tafel slope of 75.2 mV/dec. It follows simultaneous evolution of oxygen from oxyhydroxide species during the electrocatalytic performance. The same electrocatalyst also reveals excellent stability during its long term operation. Simultaneously, the same material discloses elevated specific capacitance of 1987.2 F/g at 1 A/g and a maximum retention of capacitance even after its cycling for 8000 cycles than pristine g-C3N4 and MnCo2O4/g-C3N4 composite. This observation greatly insists that Mn0路4Ni0路6Co2O4/g-C3N4 composite can be employed as an electrode material for high performance supercapacitors due to its excellent capacitance and outstanding cycling stability.
