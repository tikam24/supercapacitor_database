The nanostructured composites of MWCNTs are widely used in the field of optoelectronics, sensing, and photocatalysis for their excellent optical and electrical properties. In the present work, nanocomposites of functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (FMWCNTs)/SnO2 are fabricated by hydrothermal method with 1 and 4 wt% of SnO2 nanoparticles. The fabricated nanocomposites are characterized and analysed by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The electrical properties of these nanocomposites are study by Keithley source meter with two probe setups. These FMWCNTs/SnO2 nanocomposites can be utilized in gas sensing, supercapacitor and hydrogen storage.
