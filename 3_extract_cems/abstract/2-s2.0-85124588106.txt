This work is designed to investigate the chickpea skin activated carbon (CPSAC) as a promising reproducible and renewable alternative electrode material for supercapacitor applications. Structural, physical and chemical properties of chickpea skin activated carbon material were examined by FE-SEM, TEM, XRD, RAMAN and XPS analyses. N2 adsorption/desorption analysis confirm the porous structure of activated carbon materials with increased surface area of 474 m2gâˆ’1 for CPSAC. The specific capacity of 412 F/g at 1 A/g is attained for CPSAC. The obtained findings clearly demonstrate the improved electrochemical performances for CPSAC's electrode. The findings prove that, chickpea skin activated carbon is an excellent choice for future energy and developing systems such as electric vehicle.
