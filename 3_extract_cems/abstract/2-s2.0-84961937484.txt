This paper proposes the hybrid energy system control strategy considering the State of Charge (SOC) of battery and the fuel consumption of diesel generator. The hybrid energy system is composed of diesel generator, PV unit, and Energy Storage System (ESS) with battery and supercapacitor. To optimize the fuel consumption of diesel generator it should be operating at the rated power based on the BSFC (Brake Specific Fuel Consumption). And the ESS has to compensate the change of required amount of the load. In this paper, it shows the PSiM modeling of each system and proposes the control strategy for improving the efficiency with considering the SOC of battery.
