We present a facile and low-cost in-situ growth of Ni(OH)2–NiFe2O4 nanosheet arrays on nickel foams via one-pot hydrothermal process. Different amounts of Fe(NO3)3 solutions as the oxidant have been used to optimize morphology of the nanosheet arrays on nickel foams without any templates and nickel salts. The nanosheet arrays show excellent electrochemical stability as well as good electroconductivity. As an electrochemical electrode, it presents an optimized areal capacitance (1.434 F cm−2 at the current density of 1.0 mA cm−2) and excellent cycling stability (retaining 75.9% after 5000 cycles at 3.0 mA cm−2). This strategy holds great potential for low-cost and readily scalable production of high performance electrode materials for supercapacitors.
