Recently, efficient green energy conversion and storage systems attracts attention due to global environmental pollution and the depletion of fossil fuels. Here, we firstly proposed a novel triboelectric nanogenerator based on the rigid-flexible coupling design (RF-TENG) using the acrylate structure glue (ASG) and the silicic acid gel (SAG) as triboelectric materials. The fully packed ASG layer and SAG layer can be easily prepared by coating ASG/SAG on the Ni foam surface, and Ni foam plays the role of conductive electrode. Remarkably, the reasonable collocation of a rigid ASG layer and soft SAG layer can bring full and effective contact during the triboelectricity process for enhancing the output performance. Moreover, the RF-TENG can work in adverse environment. The corresponding electrical properties, such as the peak value short-circuit current (Isc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and output power density can achieve 42 μA, 345 V, and 143 μW/cm2, respectively, and 122 commercial light-emitting diodes (LEDs) can be easily lighted up by the RF-TENG. Except for that, an effective strategy for energy conversion and storage was designed, and through the proposed power management circuit (PMC), the charging efficiency of MnSe-Supercapacitor (MnSe-SC) has been significantly improved. Due to the high performance of energy conversion and storage, this research is considered promising for promoting the practical application of green energy.
