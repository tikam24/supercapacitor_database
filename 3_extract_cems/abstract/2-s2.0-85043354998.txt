The monodisperse MnO 2 @NiCo 2 O 4 core/shell nanospheres for good-performance supercapacitors are designed and synthesized by a two-step solution-based method and a simple post annealing process. In the composite, both MnO 2 (the “core”) and NiCo 2 O 4 (the “shell”) are formed by the accumulation of nanoflakes. Thus, nearly all the core/shell nanoflakes are highly opened and accessible to electrolyte, making them give full play to the Faradaic reaction. Our results demonstrate that the composite electrode exhibits desirable pseudocapacitive behaviors with higher specific capacitance (1127.27 F g −1 at a current density of 1 A g −1 ), better rate capability (81.0% from 1 to 16 A g −1 ) and superior cycling stability (actually 126.8% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles and only 3.7% loss after 10,000 cycles at 10 A g −1 ) in 3 M KOH aqueous solution. Moreover, it offers the excellent specific energy density of 26.6 Wh kg −1 at specific power density of 800 W kg −1 . The present MnO 2 @NiCo 2 O 4 core/shell nanospheres with remarkable electrochemical properties are considered as potential electrode materials for the next generation supercapacitors.
