The proceedings contain 148 papers. The topics discussed include: conductivity of vanadium flow battery (VFB) catholytes: dependence on sulfur and vanadium concentration and temperature; technical performance of a hybrid thermo-electrochemical system for high pressure hydrogen compression; photopotential and polarization characteristics of ruthenizer complex sensitized TiO2 electrode for marine microbial fuel cell; novel short-circuit detection in Li-ion battery architectures; charge-discharge property of non-stoichiometric lithium iron silicate; characterisation of heat and gas emissions in thermally induced battery failure on commercially available 18650 Li-ion cells; comprehensive modeling of temperature-dependent degradation mechanisms in lithium iron phosphate batteries; combined RLS-ΕKF method for simultaneous SOC and parameter estimations for lithium-ion batteries; stabilized lithium, manganese AB2O4 spinel for rechargeable lithium electrochemical systems through A and B site doping; rechargeable aluminum–air battery using various air-cathode materials and suppression of byproducts formation on both anode and air cathode; cellulose acetate derived free-standing electrospun carbon nanofibrous mat as anode material for rechargeable lithium-ion battery; and electrospray of carbon precursor sol on supercapacitor current collector: effect of fast evaporation of solvent.
