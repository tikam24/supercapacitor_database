In this study, we successfully synthesized, designed, and constructed three porous organic polymers (POPs) without or with acetylene as the bridgeπBz-Th, TPA-Th, and P-Th-POPsπthrough a robust and efficient coupling reaction of 2,8-dibromothianthrene (Th-Br2) as a building unit with 1,3,5-tris(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzene (Bz-3BO), tris(4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)phenyl)amine (TPA-3BO), and 1,3,6,8-tetraethynylpyrene (P-T). Our POP materials displayed exceptional heat stability (char yields of more than 70% for each POP) and superior Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface areas. According to electrochemical testing, a P-Th-POP-containing acetylene group as a bridge has a specific capacitance of 217 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 and an excellent cycling stability of over 5000 times at 10 A g-1. Compared to other porous materials, P-Th-CMP exhibits the highest specific capacitance, which may be attributed to its enormous surface area and extended conjugation system.
