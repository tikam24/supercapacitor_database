Worldwide, the research on advanced materials for energy storage devices has drawn greater attention. Numerous works on different energy storage materials has been reported and still continuing. Among the energy storage devices, electrochemical supercapacitors (ESs) are one of the most investigated topics. The globalization and increasing demand of smart and flexible devices has forced the current research to develop low-cost, high-energy density and stable ESs. In this regard, metal sulfides (MSs)â€“based materials have been envisioned for ESs applications owing to their unique and promising properties. Recently, several research articles have been published on MSs-based electrodes for ESs with enhanced performances. This review presents a brief survey on such recent developments towards synthesis of MSs and their use as an efficient electrode material in ESs. The challenges and future aspect involved with MSs to develop and establish it as a promising energy storage material are also discussed.
