Because of the poor specific capacitance of transparent and flexible supercapacitors reported recently, exploring electrode materials with high electrochemical properties for such devices is still a big challenge. We reported that the Ni3V2O8@PANI composite has been synthesized using an in situ chemical bath method. It was found that the synthesized Ni3V2O8@PANI composite has outstanding electrochemical behaviors (specific capacitance value of 2565.7 F/g at 5 mV/s, wide potential window, good rate capability), which are much superior to those of Ni3V2O8 and PANI electrodes. The improved electrochemical behaviors result from the synergistic effect between Ni3V2O8 and PANI. A symmetric flexible and transparent supercapacitor was fabricated using the Ni3V2O8@PANI composite as the working electrode. The device demonstrated a maximum areal capacitance of 58.5 mF/cm2 at 5 mV/s and an energy density of 20.8 Î¼W h/cm2 with 1.6 V potential window. Furthermore, the capacitance retained nearly 88% of its original value after 20 000 galvanostatic charging and discharging cycles. These results favor the promising potential of the Ni3V2O8@PANI composite as the electrode material for the application in flexible and transparent supercapacitors.
