This paper discusses the properties of some Ni-Cu deposits obtained on a steel substrate, which may be employed as supercapacitor plates. In order to achieve plates with different properties, one has varied the parameters of the deposition process such as deposition time, current density and temperature. Scanning electron microscopy and dispersive energy spectrometry were employed for the determination of the structure and composition of the Ni-Cu deposits. The plates with the Ni-Cu deposits were used to create supercapacitors and their capacitance values were also determined.
