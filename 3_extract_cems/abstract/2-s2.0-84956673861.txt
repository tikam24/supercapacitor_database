A facile chemical route was developed to fabricate cobalt oxide nanoflower (NF) on nickel foam substrate. The morphology, microstructure and crystalline form of the cobalt oxide NF were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron and X-ray diffraction. The capacitive performance of the prepared cobalt oxide NF was investigated by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance and galvanostatic charge-discharge test. The results show that the cobalt oxide NF shows high specific capacitance of 2612.0 F·g-1 in 6.0 M aqueous KOH electrolyte at 4 A·g-1 and excellent cyclic stability with capacity retention of 85.3% after 2000 cycles at 30 a ·g-1.
