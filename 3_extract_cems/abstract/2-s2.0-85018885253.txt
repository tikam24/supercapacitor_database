The traditional oxidation of activated carbons (ACs) by chemical oxidants has many defects, such as the destruction of pore nanostructures and the specific surface area, the formation of unstable oxygen functional groups, which can cause negative effects, especially as electrodes for the aqueous supercapacitors, they can also enhance the capacitance fading, and the pseudo-capacitance is not stable. A new strategy was devised to prepare modified AC with the stable surface properties and developed porosity that can solve these problems. Hydrogen peroxide, as a cheap and clean oxidant, was used to modify the biomass-based chars under the ultrasonic energy, so as to improve the chemical and physical properties of ACs. The whole process can be considered as a reconstruction of the carbon surface, the quantum-size carbon dots (CDs) can be released under the ultrasonic energy from the char surface and combined with oxygen free radical species in the liquid phase and eventually return onto the surface. The recombination of free radical species and CDs can not only form stable oxygen groups, but also create more active sites of chars to form the channels, which can generate surface pores of chars before the further formation of pores by activation. The modified ACs have stable oxygen groups, great surface wettability, electrical conductivity, and excellent electrochemical performance. It can be understood that the physical&chemical properties and the electrochemical performance of modified ACs can be significantly improved. The above results can promote the development of modified activated carbon materials and the practical application of aqueous supercapacitors for electric vehicles.
