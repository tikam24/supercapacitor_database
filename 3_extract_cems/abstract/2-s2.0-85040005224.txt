Supercapacitors are one of the promising energy storage devices of future energy technology. In this regard, rapid progress is proceeding in the field of fundamental and applied aspects of supercapacitors. The development of electrode materials are the most significant factor as the electrode is the key part of electrochemical capacitors. Numerous efforts have been made for the development of electrode materials with unique structure, charge storage capacity and long-term cyclic stability. The carbonaceous materials store the charge by non-faradic mechanism and possess high stability and perfect electrochemical double-layer properties. On the other hand, the metal oxide, metal sulphide and conducting polymers show rich faradic properties. The development of hybridized faradic and non-faradic electrode materials can exhibit highly improved electrochemical properties in terms of high energy and power density. This chapter describes the latest advancement in the development of nanostructured electrode materials with a particular focus on hybrid nanostructure. This review starts with an overview of energy storage mechanisms for different types of supercapacitors and materials characterization techniques. It also emphasizes the exciting development of hybrid nanomaterials as supercapacitor electrodes and their applications in modern technology.
