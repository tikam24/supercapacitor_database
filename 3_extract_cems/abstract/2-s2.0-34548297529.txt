Presented is a self-powered computing system, Sunflower, that uses a novel combination of a PIN photodiode array, switching regulators, and a supercapacitor, to provide a small footprint renewable energy source. The design provides software-controlled power-adaptation facilities, for both the main processor and its peripherals. The system's power consumption is characterized, and its energy-scavenging efficiency is quantified with field measurements under a variety of weather conditions. Â© 2007 EDAA.
