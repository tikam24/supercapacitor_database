Supercapacitor behavior has been reported in a number of oxides including reduced BaTiO3 ferroelectric ceramics. These so-called giant properties are however not easily controlled. We show here that the continuous coating of individual BaTiO3 grains by a silica shell in combination with spark plasma sintering is a way to process bulk composites having supercapacitor features with low dielectric losses and temperature stability. The silica shell acts both as an oxidation barrier during the processing and as a dielectric barrier in the final composite. Â© 2009 American Institute of Physics.
