PANI/MWCNT nanocomposite supercapacitor electrodes were synthesized by in-situ microwave plasma polymerization of aniline in the presence of MWCNT-COOH. The SEM image of the composite illustrates the formation of the core-shell MWCNT-PANI ordered structure that has a strong effect on the electrical conductivity and porosity, in addition to the appearance of agglomerated polymerized islands. The electrochemical performance of PANI/MWCNT composite was evaluated with respects to the obtained specific capacitance, energy and power density, and cyclic stability, using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge at a constant current and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The highest obtained specific capacitance was 112 F/g at a charging current density of 1.6 A/g, provides the highest energy density of 34.8 Wh/Kg and a power density of 1670 W/Kg. While the highest achieved power density was 8381 W/Kg with an energy density of 12.8 Wh/Kg. The delivered energy density crossed the threshold energy density limit of the battery, which meets the scientific motivation to use supercapacitor as an independent energy source.
