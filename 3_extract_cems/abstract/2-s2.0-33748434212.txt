Gas-phase activated monolithic glassy carbon was used as electrochemical double layer capacitor electrode by a research team of Siemens AG in the early 1980s [1], J. Miklos, K. Mund, W. Naschwitz, Siemens AG, Offenlegungsschrift DE 30 11 701 A1, German Patent (1980). Wen et al. [2] (Y.H. Wen, G.P. Cao, J. Cheng, Y.S. Yang, New Carbon Mater. 18(3) (2003) 219, and [3] Y.H. Wen, G.P. Cao, Y.S. Yang, J. Power Sources 148 (2005) 121, have repeatedly questioned the performance of this glassy carbon based supercapacitor electrode concept. This asks for some comments.
