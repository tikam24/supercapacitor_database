The objective of this study is to enhance the PEM fuel cell performances and increase its lifetime by using a Neutral-Point Clamped (NPC) seven-level inverter without any additional device in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) application. The multilevel inverter is used to feed a traction motor, which is in our system a permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) of a hybrid electric vehicle. The energy management of the hybrid source (Fuel cell/ultracapacitor) using fuzzy logic is given and the vehicle speed is controlled by using the sliding mode control. The simulation results are compared to the conventional two-level inverter. Through this study,it was found that the use of seven-level inverter improve the power quality of traction motor,decrease the value of current and voltage THD (total harmonic distortion), reduce the constraint of the fuel cell, improve its efficiency and ensure length lifetime of hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) system. The main contribution of this paper is to show the advantages of using a seven-level inverter to increase the performance and lifetime of fuel cell in HEV application.
