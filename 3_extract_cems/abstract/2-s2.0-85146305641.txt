Designing flexible electrodes with high-specific capacitance is crucial for creating a high-performance flexible supercapacitors (SCs) for use in portable, wearable, and compact electronics. In this study, to combine the advantages of different electrode materials, synergistic composites electrodes were designed and prepared. Carbon fiber (CF) was used as the flexible conductive framework, and polyaniline (PANI) and Ti3C2Tx as active materials were introduced into the CF surface via in-situ “co-growth” polymerization. A thick layer of MXene/PANI composites on CF surface with desired 3D interconnected porous topography and foam-like structure was realized by controlling MXene content and polymerization duration. The as-built microstructure afforded pathways for fast and efficient ion/electron transfer, which was contributed by the MXene nano-lamina and the PANI. MXene helped not only to improve the electronic conductivity of the PANI as well as a role of nucleation effect for PANI molecular chain propagation. In case of MXene, the intercalation of PANI molecular chain into the multilayer structure prevented its restacking and aggregation. Eletrochemical performance characterization shows that an excellent specific capacitance of 193.75 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g was achieved as well as good stability of 89% retention rate after 2000 charge/discharge cycles. This study provides a facile and effective approach for modifing CF with active materials and for constructing high-specific-area coating-structured electrodes for high-performance flexible SC applications.
