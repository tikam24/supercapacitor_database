Indeed, achieving control over the morphological as well as structural attributes of materials is highly desirable to fabricate the high-performance electrodes for their utilization as supercapacitors. In an attempt to demonstrate this aspect, a low-cost and facile method is developed to synthesize the three-dimensional (3D) core–shell composites based on hollow N-doped carbon (HNC)@MnO2 for supercapacitors application. In this framework, the ZIF-8-based hollow polyhedron carbon core serves not only as a templating support but also as the conducting material for the MnO2 shell to improve the performance of the capacitor. Notably, these unique core–shell architectures resulted in an extensive interfacial surface area, which substantially allowed the rapid diffusion of electrolyte through its hollow framework towards achieving a swift electronic movement through the carbon backbone. Such core–shell hybrids displayed an excellent electrochemical capacitance performance of 247.9 F g−1 in Na2SO4 electrolyte (1 M) at 0.5 A g−1 and a tremendous cycle capacity with the retention capacity of 82.9% even after 2000 cycles at 5 A g−1. Together, our findings explicitly demonstrate the optimization of the construction of innovative composite materials toward synergistic effects for improved electrochemical performances.
