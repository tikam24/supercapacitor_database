We report on the synthesis and electrochemical properties of diamond grown onto vertically aligned carbon nanotubes with high surface areas as a template, resulting in a composite material exhibiting high double-layer capacitance as well as low electrochemical impedance electrodes suitable for applications as supercapacitor devices. We contrast results from devices fabricated with samples which differ in both their initial substrates (Si and Ti) and their final diamond coatings, such as boron-doped diamond and diamond-like carbon (DLC). We present for first time a conducting model for non-doped DLC thin-films. All samples were characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy. Our results show specific capacitance as high as 8.25 F g−1 (∼1 F cm−2) and gravimetric specific energy and power as high as 0.7 W h kg−1 and 176.4 W kg−1, respectively, which suggest that these diamond/carbon nanotube composite electrodes are excellent candidates for supercapacitor fabrication.
