The design of multicomponent core-shell heterostructures is considered to be an efficacious way to develop excellent performance supercapacitor electrode materials. A new strategy CePO4@CuCo2S4core-shell heterogeneous structure is devised by preparing porous CePO4nanosheets as cores via hydrothermal reaction and solid-state phosphating methods and electrochemically deposited CuCo2S4nanosheets as shells. Binder-free three-dimensional (3D) porous CePO4@CuCo2S4nanosheets grown on foam nickel substrate can provide an ordered porous nanoframe, promote electrode/ion transport, and generate the effective synergy of good conductivity from CePO4and excellent redox activity from CuCo2S4. As a consequence, the CePO4@CuCo2S4electrode exhibits an outstanding specific capacitance (2897.8 F g-1at 0.5 A g-1), a superb capacity retention rate (70.1% at 20 A g-1), and excellent cycle stability (after 10,000 cycles or maintain 94.4%), superior to those of bare CePO4and CuCo2S4electrodes. In addition, an asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor is assembled by CePO4@CuCo2S4and activated carbon, when the energy density is 80.4 Wh kg-1and the corresponding power density is 799.5 W kg-1
