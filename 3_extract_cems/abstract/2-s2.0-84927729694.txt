Graphenated carbon nanotubes (g-CNTs) were investigated as the electrode support in MnO<inf>2</inf> composite cathodes for aqueous asymmetric supercapacitors. The electrode performance could be tuned by optimizing the density of graphene foliates on the g-CNTs, which enabled geometric/morphologic control over the MnO<inf>2</inf> electrodeposits. The synergy and optimization of the g-CNT hybrid structure led to a high specific capacitance (640 F/g) at high MnO<inf>2</inf> specific loading (2.3 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>), thus creating a unique pathway toward improved practical performance.
