Supercapacitors are normally used as stand-alone energy storage devices or in combination with other energy storage devices such as batteries. In these common applications, DC terminal voltage, energy storage capability and the usable temperature range and maximum charge/discharge currents are considered as important parameters. However, from 2009, a research team in New Zealand has started investigating their special-applications in the areas such as (i) enhancing linear regulator efficiency (ii) surge absorption systems (iii) surge resistant UPS systems. This paper summarizes these findings and the need to characterize supercapacitors for these unique applications. Â© 2013 IEEE.
