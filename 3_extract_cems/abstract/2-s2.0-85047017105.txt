In this paper, we present a facile fabrication for wearable stretchable micro-supercapacitors with porous carbon nanotube-polydimethylsiloxane (CNT-PDMS) conductive elastomer, which combines laser cutting with electrolyte transferring process. Taking advantage of porous structure with large surface area and highly conductive elastomer, such device demonstrates great areal capacitance, reliable flexibility and cycling stability after 2,000 charging-discharging cycles. Meanwhile, with in-planar and parallel layout, the electrochemical performance of the double-sided micro-supercapacitor (D-MSC) is greatly enhanced compared with single-sided MSC. Therefore, the wearable D-MSC shows promising potentials in the wearable electronics and smart energy systems.
