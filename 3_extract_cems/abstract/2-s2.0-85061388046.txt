Highly porous 3D honeycomb-like carbons were synthesized by a template-free method. Herein, the low-cost coal tar pitch is used as a carbon source. NH 4 Cl is employed as a blowing agent to form 3D honeycomb-like carbons, and followed by KOH chemical activation to form porous structure. The as-prepared porous 3D honeycomb-like carbons possess a large specific surface area of 2881.7 m 2 g − 1 with a total pore volume of 2.18 cm 3 g − 1 . The unique structure allows for exhibiting a high specific capacitance of 324 F g − 1 at a current density of 0.1 A g − 1 in the three-electrode system. Moreover, the assembled symmetric supercapacitors exhibit an energy density of 9.72 Wh kg − 1 at a power density of 250 W kg − 1 and 6.43 Wh kg − 1 at a power density of 5000 W kg − 1 , and excellent cycle performance of 92.2% retention over 5000 cycles at 1 A g − 1 .
