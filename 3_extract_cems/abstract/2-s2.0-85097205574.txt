The supercapacitor (SC) assisted low dropout regulator (SCALDO) is a new DC-DC converter technique. By using a supercapacitor as lossless voltage dropper in series with the power transistor of the linear regulator, eciency can be increased by a multiplication factor such as 1:33 to 3 while eliminating the RFI/EMI issues endemic to high frequency switching converters. The supercapacitor creates a large time constant circuit in which energy recirculation occurs at very low frequency, allowing construction of linear DC-DC converters with eciencies in the range of 80 to 90+ percent. SCALDO has many advantages and useful applications are discussed in many recent IEEE/ IET publications. This paper describes how the SCALDO technique can be extended to handle the high currents and voltages required in practical DC-DC converters at low component cost, specifically designed for the 48 V Google rack supplies powered by AC mains rectified DC. As a proof of concept project, a scaled down version of a 100 to 120 V DC to 48 V DC high current SCALDO type DC-DC converter is presented.
