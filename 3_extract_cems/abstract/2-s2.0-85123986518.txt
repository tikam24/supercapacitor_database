A cellulose gel electrolyte (XWD-NaOH) was obtained through static hydration and crosslinking of cellulose pulp viscose solution, followed by introducing potassium ferrocyanide into XWD-NaOH to give a gel electrolyte (XWD-NaOH-K4[Fe(CN)6]). XWD-NaOH-K4[Fe(CN)6] has excellent redox activity and ionic conductivity (15.3 mS/cm). At 0.5 A/g current density, XWD-NaOH-K4[Fe(CN)6] electrolyte supercapacitor exhibits an increase of the electrode specific capacitance, power density and energy density by 57%, 111% and 214% compared to those of XWD-NaOH system. The XWD-NaOH-K4[Fe(CN)6] system has low internal resistance, charge transfer resistance and high cycle stability
