The proposed Stochastic Energy Source Access Management (SESAM) comprises renewable energy sources coupled via a direct current bus with storage modules of complementary characteristics to achieve co-generation of hydrogen and electric power on a continuous duty basis. As complementary solutions, hydrogen energy storage to provide a large capacity and access-oriented storage based on magnetic, electric or kinetic energy with less capacity but a faster response time are considered. These are arranged to form a multi-level storage that can compensate stochastic fluctuations of power over diverse time scales. The developed energy management coordinates the operation of the diverse storage modules. In this context, the access-oriented storage acts as a shock absorber in order to shield fuel cells and electrolysers from fast fluctuations of wind power and load. The functions of the plant are validated through simulation using meteorological information obtained from the National Wind Technology Center in the USA. The plant is shown to provide the scheduled output of hydrogen and electric power. Since seen from its terminals SESAM behaves in the same way as a power plant with controlled fuel input, it can be readily integrated with given infrastructures.
