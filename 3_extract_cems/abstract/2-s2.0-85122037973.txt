Supercapacitors are widely used in China due to their high energy storage efficiency, long cycle life, high power density and low maintenance cost. This review compares the differences of different types of supercapacitors and the developing trend of electrochemical hybrid energy storage technology. It gives an overview of the application status of supercapacitors in Chinaâ€™s smart grid and Energy Internet in detail. Some strategies and constructive suggestions are put forward to solve the existing problems. With the improvement of the grid-connected capacity of new energy power generation during the 14th Five-year Period of China, the supercapacitor market in China will usher in a good development opportunity. The role of the supercapacitor in achieving carbon peak carbon neutralization is prospected.
