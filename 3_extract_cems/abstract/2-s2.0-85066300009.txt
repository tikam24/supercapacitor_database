Noble metal doping has been a promising efficient way to improve the performance of supercapacitor. Herein, we report on the incorporation of Pt into MoS2 nanosheets grown on carbon cloth via a hydrothermal method. Compared with pristine MoS2, Pt-doped MoS2 exhibited excellent enhanced capacitance of 250 F/g at 0.5 A/g, which was nearly twice of specific capacitance at 10 A/g. Simultaneously, asymmetric supercapacitor prepared demonstrated superior flexibility and capacitance of 42 F/g at 0.4 A/g with no obvious changes in performance under different angles.
