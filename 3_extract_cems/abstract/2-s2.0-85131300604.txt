A nanocomposite with erbium-doped graphene quantum dots embedded in highly porous coffee-ground-derived biochar (Er-GQD/HPB) was synthesized as a promising electrode material for a highly efficient supercapacitor. The HPB showed high porosity, with a large surface area of 1295 m2 g−1 and an average pore size of 2.8 nm. The 2–8-nanometer Er-GQD nanoparticles were uniformly decorated on the HPB, subsequently increasing its specific surface area and thermal stability. Furthermore, the intimate contact between the Er-GQDs and HPB significantly reduced the charge-transfer resistance and diffusion path, leading to the rapid migration of ions/electrons in the mesoporous channels of the HPB. By adding Er-GQDs, the specific capacitance was dramatically increased from 337 F g−1 for the pure HPB to 699 F g−1 for the Er-GQD/HPB at 1 A g−1 . The Ragone plot of the Er-GQD/HPB exhibited an ultrahigh energy density of 94.5 Wh kg−1 and a power density of 1.3 kW kg−1 at 1 A g−1 . Furthermore, the Er-GQD/HPB electrode displayed excellent cycling stability, and 81% of the initial capacitance remained after 5000 cycles. Our results provide further insights into a promising supercapacitance material that offers the benefits of both fast ion transport from highly porous carbons and electrocatalytic improvement due to the embedment of Er-doped GQDs to enhance energy density relative to conventional materials.
