Ever since conjugated polymers were discovered, they have gained considerable interest owing to their advantages of high electrical conductivity, good processability, tunable bandgap, and high flexibility as electrode materials. These properties make them very promising candidates for lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitor applications. They have been widely studied in the past few decades. This chapter covers the working principles of conjugated polymers alone and combined with other efficient materials. Their applications in lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors were also presented. It is expected that this chapter will help researchers to expand understanding about these conjugated polymers and accordingly lead to novel research arenas.
