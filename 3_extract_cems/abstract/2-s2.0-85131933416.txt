High-mass loading fiber-type three-dimensional (3D) electrodes with improved energy storage properties have attracted widespread attention in developing the feasible hybrid supercapacitors. Herein, we fabricated the porous 3D nickel foam-like microarchitectures on braided Ni wires (NF wires) followed by facile growth of ternary manganese-doped nickel–cobalt oxysulfide nanostructures (MNC OS/NF wires). The electrochemical properties in alkaline electrolyte revealed the battery-type redox performance of MNC OS/NF wires with a high capacity of 185.4 mAh/g at the discharge current of 3 mA and good cycling durability of 94.8% after 4000 charge–discharge cycles. Moreover, the liquid-electrolyte mediated cable-type hybrid cell was assembled with the battery-type MNC OS/NF wires and capacitive-type activated carbon. Specifically, hybrid supercapacitor showed a maximum cell voltage of 1.6 V with high energy and power densities of 31.5 Wh/kg and 2616.3 W/kg, respectively. Having high mass loading and excellent electrochemical activity of MNC OS nanostructures with high ionic conductivity of the liquid electrolyte, the cable-type hybrid device showed superior energy storage properties, which are useful to energize portable electronic display and light-emitting diodes for a long time. The obtained results suggest that the porous conductive architectures with excellent redox activity of battery-type ternary electrodes are promising for the development of high-performance energy storage applications.
