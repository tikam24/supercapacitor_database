Here we present a facile and efficient process for the preparation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles (about an average diameter of 5 nm) grown on reduced graphene oxide (Fe3O4/rGO) with high supercapacitive properties. The novel composite with high surface area and mesoporous structure are prepared by a one-step hydrothermal method with the help of glucose, which can serve as a binder for the assembly of Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) and a reducing agent for the reduction of graphene oxide simultaneously. Benefiting from the combined rGO and Fe3O4 in such a unique structure, the Fe3O4/rGO electrode material possesses a high specific capacitance of 241 F/g at 1 A/g within the potential range from -1 to 0 V and an excellent cycling stability of 79.2% after 1000 cycles at a high current density of 10 A/g. These results demonstrate that such synthetic route may open a new pathway to design and fabricate other materials with largely enhanced electrochemical properties, which can be of great potential in the development of energy-storage systems.
