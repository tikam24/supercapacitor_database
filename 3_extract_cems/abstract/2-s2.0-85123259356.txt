Due to its natural and rich porous structure, biomass wood-based materials have potential applications in electronic devices such as supercapacitors and sensors, which is also in line with the concept of green and sustainable development and has attracted extensive attention of more and more researchers. However, due to the poor conductivity of wood-based materials, in order to enhance their conductivity, they have to be carbonized or compounded with other materials with good conductivity. Here, we first synthesized the rGO-LiOH/wood micro-spring composite with high strength, high specific capacitance, high elasticity and elastic recovery rate via vacuum suction and carbonization. The as-obtained wood-based hybrid is applied to supercapacitors and sensors, and shows good supercapacitance and sensing characteristics. Under a scan rate of 200 mV s−1, the specific capacitance is 352 F g−1, the energy density is 48.89 Wh kg−1, the power density reaches 9780 W kg−1, and the capacitance retention still maintains at 98% (346 F g−1) after experiencing 1000 cycles, showing excellent energy storage and working stability. More importantly, the composite still shows stable energy storage effect under repeated compression rebound conditions. After 5000 compression-recovery, a high elastic recovery rate of 91.67% and high capacitance retention of approximately 80% are still obtained. These outstanding properties highlight the great application potential of the rGO-LiOH/wood micro-spring composite in biomass based wearable electronics, portable power supply equipment and sensors.
