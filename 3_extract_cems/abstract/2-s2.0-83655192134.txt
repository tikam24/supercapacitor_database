A novel ordered mesoporous Co(OH) 2 nanowire structure has been successfully fabricated by a dual-template method utilizing porous anodic alumina (PAA) and lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) through potentiostatic electrodeposition technique. The mesoporous ordered hexagonal structure with cylindrical channels in Co(OH) 2 nanowires is confirmed by low-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A capacitance of 993 F g -1 for the mesoporous Co(OH) 2 nanowire array is obtained from charge/discharge measurement at current density of 1 A g -1, indicating that the unique mesoporous nanowire structure can enhance its electrochemical properties.
