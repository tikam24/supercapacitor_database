This paper concerns the improvements of the isolated symmetry half-bridge bidirectional DC/DC converter when applied in supercapacitor (SC) energy storage system. The guidelines to calculate the ZVS resonance elements were proposed. Meanwhile, a novel model of the converter contains duty ratio as control element was derived. With the model, a phase-shifted plus feed-forward control system was proposed, which could stabilize the primary voltage of the transformer and reduce the leakage inductance current. Simulation and a series of experiments reveal that the proposed technologies improve the performance of the isolated symmetry half-bridge bidirectional DC/DC converter in SC energy storage system.
