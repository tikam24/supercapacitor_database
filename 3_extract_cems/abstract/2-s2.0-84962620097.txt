Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have recently received increasing interest due to their potential application in the energy storage and conversion field. Herein, cobalt-based layered MOF ({[Co(Hmt)(tfbdc)(H2O)2]Â·(H2O)2}n, Co-LMOF; Hmt = hexamethylenetetramine; H2tfbdc = 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroterephthalic acid) has been evaluated as an electrode material for supercapacitors. The Co-LMOF electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance and excellent cycling stability. Its maximum specific capacitance is 2474 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1, and the specific capacitance retention is about 94.3% after 2000 cycles. The excellent electrochemical property may be ascribed to the intrinsic nature of Co-LMOF, enough space available for the storage and diffusion of the electrolyte, and the particles of nanoscale size.
