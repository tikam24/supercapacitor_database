High-performance yet flexible all-in-one fiber supercapacitors (FSCs) hold a great potential in powering the next-generation wearable/portable electronics. Rational design and scalable construction of unique three-dimensional structures are challenging for assembling these types of FSCs. Here, we demonstrate a unique laser-induced bi-metal sulfide/graphene nanoribbon (GR) hybrid framework for high-performance all-in-one flexible FSCs. The bi-metal sulfide/GR hybrid framework performs a superior electrochemical performance to both of GR and single-metal sulfide/GR hybrid frameworks. In addition, the as-assembled all-in-one flexible FSCs based on laser-induced molybdenum disulfide/manganese sulfide/GR (MoS2/MnS/GR) hybrid frameworks exhibit a high areal specific capacitance of 58.3 mF/cm2 at 50 μA/cm2, a high areal energy density of 7.0 μWh/cm2 at 50 μA/cm2, a high areal power density of 49.9 μW/cm2 at 50 μA/cm2, as well as a high cycling stability (93.6%, 10000 cycles). It's proposed that the synergistic effects of bi-metal sulfide as well as the unique laser-induced three-dimensional frameworks account for the excellent electrochemical performances of the as-designed framework electrodes. The concept of designing this laser-induced three-dimensional hybrid structure based on bi-metallic pseudocapacitive material and capacitive GR can provide an insight for assembling high-performance flexible fiber supercapacitors and show promising for integrating and powering portable and wearable electronics.
