In this work, cross-linked graphene aerogel (CL-GA) and its composite with Fe2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized through a one-step hydrothermal procedure by using p-phenylenediamine (PPD). Structural characterizations revealed that in the preparation of the composite PPD acts as a cross-liker and provides high surface area by decreasing restacking of graphene sheets and functions as nitrogen source simultaneously. The electrochemical characteristics of the nanocomposite were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Fast Fourier transform continues cyclic voltammetry (FFTCCV). The results show that cross-linked graphene aerogel/Fe2O3 (CL-GA/Fe2O3) nanocomposite displays enhanced supercapacitive performance, where it has capacitance of 445 at 1 A g−1, high energy density of 63 W h Kg−1, and 89% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles in 3 M KOH. Presence of PPD considerably improved supercapacitive performance of nanocomposite as a result it could be promising material in synthesis of efficient graphene/metal oxide-based electrode material for high performance supercapacitors.
