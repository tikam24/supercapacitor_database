A novel type of composite electrode based on multiwalled carbon nanotubes coated with sheet-like cobalt hydroxide particles was used in super-capacitors. Cobalt hydroxide cathodically deposited from Co(NO3)2 solution with carbon nanotubes as matrix exhibited large pseudo-capacitance of 322 F/g in 1 mol/L KOH. To characterize the cobalt hydroxide nanocomposite electrode, a charge-discharge cycling test, cyclic voltammetry, and an impedance test were done. This cobalt hydroxide composite exhibiting excellent pseudo-capacitive behavior (i.e. high reversibility, high specific capacitance, low impedance), was demonstrated to be a candidate for the application of electrochemical supercapacitors. A combined capacitor consisting of cobalt hydroxide composite as a cathode and activated carbon fiber as an anode was reported. The electrochemical performance of the combined capacitor was characterized by cyclic voltammetry and a dc charge/discharge test. The combined capacitor showed ideal capacitor behavior with an extended operating voltage of 1.4 V. According to the extended operating voltage, the energy density of the combined capacitor at a current density of 100 mA/cm2 was found to be 11 Wh/kg. The combined capacitor exhibited high-energy density and stable power characteristics. Â© 2006 Chinese Physical Society.
