Flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) electrodes based on pristine single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and acid-treated single-walled carbon nanotubes (A-SWCNTs) were prepared by spray coating technique. Flexible A-SWCNTs electrodes showed enhanced electrochemical properties compared to the pristine SWCNTs electrodes. The electrochemical properties of the flexible A-SWCNTs electrodes were optimized with various types of aqueous electrolytes including sulfuric acid (H2SO4), sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), potassium chloride (KCl), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and potassium hydroxide (KOH). The electrochemical performance of the A-SWCNTs electrodes as a function of bending to 30° were evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) measurements in 1 M H2SO4. The specific capacitance value of the unbent A-SWCNTs electrode was 67 F g− 1, which decreased to 63 F g− 1 (94% retention) after 1000 GCD cycles. Interestingly, the specific capacitance of the unbent A-SWCNTs electrode with application of the 1000 GCD cycles was retained even after 500 bending to 30° with 6000 GCD cycles.
