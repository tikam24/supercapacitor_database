Functional materials and devices that can efficiently store and convert energies have attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. The composites of layered double hydroxide and graphene (LDH/G) are important energy materials. They have excellent physical and chemical properties of both components. Furthermore, their performances in energy-related systems can be improved by increasing the electrical conductivity of LDHs by blending graphene and partly preventing the aggregation of graphene sheets using LDH nanostructures. Therefore, LDH/G composites can be used in various energy applications, particularly for developing high-performance supercapacitors and efficient electrocatalysts for electrochemical splitting of water. In this review, we summarize the recent advances on the synthesis of LDH/chemically modified graphene (CMG, e.g., graphene oxide, reduced graphene oxide and their derivatives) composites and their application in electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Furthermore, the challenges and future perspectives in this research field are also outlined.
