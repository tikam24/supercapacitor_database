Herein, a 1D zinc coordination polymer [Zn(bibp)Cl2]∞ (CP-2-ZX) was assembled from the reaction of 4,4′-bis(imidazol-1-yl)-biphenyl (bibp) with ZnCl2. Through a calcination-thermolysis strategy, sponge-like highly porous carbon AC-Zn-CP was prepared by employing the coralloid sample of CP-2-ZX as the precursor. For comparisons, a series of activated carbon (AC-n) was obtained by the similar heating process on the mixture of bibp with ZnCl2 at different mass ratios. The results illustrate that the atomically dispersed ZnCl2 dot in the 1D chain of CP-2-ZX has an in situ activation effect on the generation of AC-Zn-CP, which can greatly promote the porosity and achieve high-efficiency utilization of ZnCl2. Therefore, the atomically dispersed activating agent provides a new method for environmentally friendly production of porous carbon materials. Significantly, the AC-Zn-CP electrode displays specific capacitance of 215 F g-1 in 3 M KOH solution, which will be largely promoted to 1419 F g-1 in the redox active electrolyte of K3[Fe(CN)6]/KOH. AC-Zn-CP also shows remarkable cycling stability (the capacity retention is 89.0% after 5000 cycles). Moreover, the fabricated symmetric supercapacitor owns a high energy density of 34.8 Wh kg-1 at 785.5 W kg-1. So, the AC-Zn-CP∩K3[Fe(CN)6] system has wide application prospects in supercapacitors.
