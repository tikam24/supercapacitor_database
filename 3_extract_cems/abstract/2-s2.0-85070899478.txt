Optimizing the structure of electrodes to decrease electrolyte transport resistance is essential for high electrochemical performance in supercapacitors. Here, we prepare ultralight carbon aerogels containing tubular structures and N-containing sandwich-like walls based on the natural structure of kapok fibers, by in-situ polymerization of pyrrole and carbonization. The resulting carbon aerogels are composed of microtubes with a diameter of 10 μm, an ultralow density of 6 mg cm−3, and also N-containing sandwich-like walls composed of pyridinic nitrogen, pyrrolic/pyridine nitrogen, and quaternary nitrogen/oxidized nitrogen. The unique tubular structure promotes transport of electrolyte, yielding higher electrochemical performance. Consequently, the tubular structure produces a 72 F g−1 increase in the capacitance compared with that of a cattail carbon aerogel without a tubular structure. The N-containing sandwich-like walls provide more active sites, greater pseudocapacitance, and increase the thickness of the microtube to protect the tubular structures from damage during carbonization. Specifically, the optimal sample has a specific capacitance of 274 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 with an energy density of 8.51 Wh kg−1, a superior rate capability, and excellent cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 97.7% after 4000 cycles.
