Fast-growing energy demands for the next generation quest for the development of engineered nanostructured electrode materials. In this direction, we report the performance and design of well crystalline cobalt ferrite nanoparticles (NPs) decorated on graphitic carbon nitride (CoFe2O4/GCN composite) for supercapacitor. The glycol functionalised composite material that was synthesized by a solvothermal process exhibits high specific capacitance (Csp) with long cyclic stability. The superior electrochemical properties are attributed to the presence of multiple oxidation states of cobalt ions, high surface area, nitrogen-rich structure, and porous nature that enables fast ion diffusion. Moreover, polyol functionalization increases hydrophilicity and improves the wettability of the composite which enhances the utilization rate of specific surface area. The composite based electrode exhibited a high Csp of 524 F/g @ 2 mV/s with superior capacitance retention (~ 98%) even after 5000 cycles at 8 A/g in 2 M KOH aqueous electrolytes. The power law and Trasatti method provide a qualitative analysis of the diffusivity of the NPs at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Presence of an ample number of electrochemically active sites and defect sites in the nanosheet structures of GCN modulate the electrochemical properties. The results evident that GCN composite can be one of the economical and active candidates as energy storage electrode materials.
