As a good film electrode material for supercapacitor, carboxyl ruthenium oxide was prepared using precursor of isopropyl alcohol solution of RuCl3·3H2O by in-situ decomposition. The micro-morphology, thermal decomposition mechanism and capacitance of the film were studied by means of scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared spectrometer and electrochemical method, respectively. The results show that carboxyl ruthenium oxide film is produced through phase transition of synthesis and decomposition of the precursor of isopropyl alcohol solution of RuCl3·3H2O with heating. Carboxyl has significant influence on performances of the film. Treated at 300°C for 2 h, specific capacitance of the film is 728 F·g-1 and maintains at 99.47% after 1000 charge-discharge cycles. The adhesive force of the film to tantalum substrate is measured to be 24.56 MPa.
