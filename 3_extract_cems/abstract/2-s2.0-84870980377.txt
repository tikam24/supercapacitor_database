Fe2O3-graphene nanocomposite with high capacitive properties had been prepared friendly and facilely by hydrothermal method in one-step. The morphology and structure of the obtained material were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) techniques. It was revealed by TEM images that Fe 2O3 nanoparticles grow well on the surface of graphene and the formation of Fe2O3 nanoparticles hinders the aggregation of graphene (reduced graphene oxide, namely, RGO). Electrochemical properties of the synthesized materials were characterized by serials of electrochemical measurements in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Fe2O3-graphene nanocomposite electrode show higher specific capacitance than graphene, indicating an accelerative effect of Fe 2O3 and graphene on improving the electrochemical performance of the electrode. The specific capacitance of Fe2O 3-graphene nanocomposite is 226 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g. These attractive results indicate it is possible to seek and develop the promising, environmentally benign and commercial electrodes material based on Fe2O3 and graphene.
