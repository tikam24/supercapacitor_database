Here, we report a one-pot preparation method of a ruthenium-based reduced graphene oxide hybrid (Runano-based RGO). The synthesis is based on a single step for the reduction of Ru3+ (RuCl3) into Ru nanoparticles, and graphene oxide (GO) into reduced graphene oxide (RGO) without the use of any reducing agent. The structure of the hybrid material was ascertained using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy and high resolution transmission spectroscopy (HRTEM). The change in pH of the synthesis media resulted in different structures and morphologies. A mixture of Ru and RuO2 (3 : 2) was obtained at pH 8.0, while only Ru-nanoparticles were obtained at pH 4.0. The supercapacitor performance of the hybrid was investigated in a neutral electrolyte, 1.0 M NaNO3, in a three-electrode setup. Runano-based RGO prepared at pH 8 exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 270 F g−1 (238.5 mF cm−2), and maximum energy and power densities of 15 W h kg−1 and 76.4 kW kg−1, respectively. The proposed supercapacitor has a stable potential window up to 1.1 V with very good cycling stability over 5000 cycles at 24 A g−1.
