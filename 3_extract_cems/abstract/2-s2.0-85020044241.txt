Nitrogen and sulfur co-doped glucose (GC)-based porous carbon electrode materials for supercapacitors have been prepared by a hydrothermal process using thiourea as nitrogen and sulfur sources and subsequent activation with KOH at 750Â°C. The specific surface area of doped porous GC reaches 561.44 m2 g-1 when the mass ratio of KOH to GC was 1:1 and the mesoporous volume is 0.125 cm3 g-1. The electrochemical performances of the electrode made with the doped porous GC were tested in a three-electrode system with 6 M KOH solution as electrolytes. The specific capacitance of the activated porous GC reaches 281 F g-1 at the current density of 1 A g-1 and increases about 7% at the current density of 5 A g-1 after 5000 charge-discharge cycles, indicating its excellent electrochemical stability as a promising electrode.
