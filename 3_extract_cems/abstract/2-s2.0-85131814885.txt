The energy output, lifespan, and availability of flexible quasi-solid-state zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSCs) are closely related to the carbon cathode and polymer hydrogel electrolyte. Herein, well-configured hollow carbon nanoboxes (APZC) with crystalline microdomains were synthesized through the ZIF-67 template-guided approach combined with chemical activation for boosting the ionic and electronic transport. Together with the structural advantages, including hollow architecture, porous texture, N doping, and disordered/ordered hybridization structure, the resultant APZC exhibits favorable Zn2+ storage. Thus, an aqueous APZC-based ZHSC presents a high capacity of 112.9 mA h g−1 at 0.25 A g−1 with a satisfactory rate performance. Additionally, a zwitterionic polymer hydrogel electrolyte (P(SBMA-co-AA)/Zn(CF3SO3)2) was successfully fabricated. The synergism of different structural units in the zwitterionic polymer endows P(SBMA-co-AA)/Zn(CF3SO3)2 with high ionic conductivity (27.6 mS cm−1) and reinforced stretchability/compressibility (tensile strength of 22.4 kPa at 313.4% stretchability; compression strength of 35.7 kPa at 60.0% strain). In particular, the ionic migration channels constructed by zwitterionic groups are propitious to regulate ion transport, which is beneficial for suppressing the formation of dendrites on the Zn surface in the hydrogel electrolyte and extending the service life of the device. Amalgamating the merits of the hollow carbon cathode and zwitterionic polymer hydrogel electrolyte, the as-assembled flexible quasi-solid-state ZHSC manifests admirable cycle durability (106.0% capacity retention after 10 000 cycles) with a decent energy/power density of 89.8 W h kg−1/14 482.7 W kg−1 and the ability to withstand deformation without distinctly sacrificing the performance, demonstrating its application potential in flexible electronics.
