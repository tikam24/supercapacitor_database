With the continuous updating of smart electronic devices, developers have begun to develop electronic devices that are more in line with people's needs, so a flexible wearable electronic device has come to people's eyes, and flexible supercapacitors have also received a lot of attention as a type of portable energy storage device. Among them, the electrode is the core of the supercapacitor, and the choice of electrode material is directly related to the energy storage capacity and other properties of the supercapacitor. Therefore, the flexible electrode material that determines the mechanical properties and electrochemical properties is our main research object. At present, the research on electrode materials of supercapacitors is not limited to a single material, but focuses on the composite of materials. Especially, the research on doped modified electrode materials is mostly. This article first introduces the performance characteristics and research progress of supercapacitors, and then focuses on the mechanical and electrochemical properties of different electrode materials. Finally, the research on the electrode materials of flexible capacitors is prospected, hoping to provide information for the research of flexible capacitors.
