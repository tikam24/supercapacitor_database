Carbon aerogels (CA) with uniform pore structures were prepared by the polycondensation of phloroglucinol, resorcinol, and formaldehyde, using carboxylated chitosan as a soft template. The CA were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, and surface area analysis. When carboxylated chitosan was added, the time for wet gel formation was reduced by 60%, and the CA showed a more uniform pore structures. The electrochemical performance of the CA was measured in a three-electrode electrochemical cell. The CA prepared with added carboxylated chitosan showed lower charge transfer resistance on the electrode surface, and the specific capacitances were also enhanced, showing a specific capacitance as high as 135 F/g at a resorcinol-to-carboxylated chitosan mass ratio of 250:1 at a current density of 0.5 A/g. This specific capacitance is much higher than that of the CA without carboxylated chitosan. The capacitance retention under increasing discharge current density was also enhanced by the addition of carboxylated chitosan. The electrochemical performance of the CA in different electrolytes (1 M LiOH, 1 M NaOH, 1 M KOH, 3 M KOH, 6 M KOH, and 9 M KOH) was investigated. The results show that the electrochemical performance in 6 M KOH was better than those in other electrolytes.
