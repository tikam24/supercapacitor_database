A method for the interfacing of a super capacitor in a hybrid vehicle power system is demonstrated. The use of the Split-Pi bi-directional DC-DC power converter is proposed to overcome the problems of interfacing large voltage swing super capacitors to narrow input voltage range motor controllers. The Split-Pi DC-DC power converter topology and operational characteristics are presented. Results from using the Split-Pi DC-DC converter for super capacitor terminal voltages below and above the motor controller input voltage range in drive mode and regeneration mode are presented. Gain control of the Split-Pi DC-DC converter is demonstrated using feed forward control by direct computation of the required converter gain.
