Nowadays, a large amount of energy storage devices is required for wireless and miniaturized electronics devices such as mobile phones, smartwatches, laptops, including electric vehicles. Hybrid battery-supercapacitor (BatCaps) devices emerged by replacing any one of the electrodes of a symmetric supercapacitor with a battery type electrode, which has wider cell voltage, higher capacity, and cycleability. The hybrid BatCaps are generally required in the thin film, flexible, lightweight, high energy and power densities, and higher charge-discharge rate capability, along with a large number of cycle stabilities. It should also be have low cost and charge within a much shorter time. In this chapter, progress on materials, structure-property relationship, and factors affecting the different kinds of hybrid BatCaps device performances, and challenges faced in future developments are discussed.
