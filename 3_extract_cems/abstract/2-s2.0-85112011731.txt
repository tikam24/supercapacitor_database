Carbon aerogels are prepared by a thermal treating-freeze drying approach from chitosan, with glycine hydrochloride ionic liquid (IL) acting as solvent and nitrogen source. Different post-treatments such as ball milling and high temperature carbonization are employed to functionalize the obtained carbon aerogels with tuned properties, making it promising candidates as fluorescence material (NACs-Q), electrode material (FDC-800) and catalyst support (NACPd-C). NACs-Q is water-soluble quantum dot with average particle sizes of 3.8 nm, presenting excitation-/emission-independent and pH-sensitive properties, which could be used as sensor for testing acetone vapor or an “on-off-on” sensor for detections of Fe3+ and vitamin C in fruits. FDC-800 exhibits fluffy lamellar structure with developed micro-mesopores and nitrogen-containing groups on their surfaces, which is beneficial for building flexible solid-state supercapacitor with excellent performance, delivering a capacitance of 208F/g at 0.5 A/g, and achieving an energy density of 7.2 W h/kg at a power density of 50 W/kg. Moreover, NACPd-C can be used as catalyst for phenol hydrogenation, and phenol conversion of 100% with cyclohexanone selectivity of 98.3% is achieved, due to the synergetic effects of the Pd active-site, the N-containing groups, and the Lewis acid sites on the support.
