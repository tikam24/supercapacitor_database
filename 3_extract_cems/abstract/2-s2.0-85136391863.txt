Energy storage systems (ESSs) are extensively investigated solutions for voltage regulation and energy saving in traction railway system. Furthermore, ESSs can have a considerably impact on the AC grid also by mitigating voltage drops and peak currents. In this paper, the impact of on-board ESSs and those installed along the track in support of the DC feeder system is investigated focusing on the voltages and currents of the AC grid. The AC/DC power flow is solved by implementing an iterative algorithm. A simulation framework based on a real Italyn DC railway system show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, and the obtained results are commented and discussed.
