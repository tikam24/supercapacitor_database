Under the strategic background that all countries in the world are seeking sustainable development, all countries in the world are constantly studying the hybrid control strategy of port cranes to reduce their energy consumption. This paper takes the port 40.5T gantry crane as the research object, configures a reasonable energy storage-super capacitor, and proposes a super capacitor DC charging control strategy and a DC bus voltage control strategy based on the super capacitor voltage change. The simulation analysis and potential energy feedback experiment are carried out for the formulated control strategy. The results show the platform's outstanding performance that the total efficiency can reach 90% and the actual energy used by the super capacitor of the hybrid power system can reach 60% in one operation cycle.
