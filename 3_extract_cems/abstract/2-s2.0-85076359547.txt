A facile microwave-assisted method has been successfully established for the preparation of manganese molybdate (MnMoO4) materials. The surface morphologies of the MnMoO4 specimens were altered by varying the duration of microwave irradiation, and various morpholologies such as rounded rectangular shaped nanosheets and ultra-small nanorod structures have been attained. The proposed use of MnMoO4 as an active electrode material for supercapacitor application was evaluated by cyclic voltammetric and chronopotentiometric measurements. It is interesting to note that the observed specific capacitance of the MnMoO4 electrode depends on its surface morphology. A unique one-dimensional MnMoO4 demonstrated excellent electrochemical properties, which provide 836 Fg−1 of specific capacitance at a scan rate of 5 mVs−1 with an excellent cycling stability (84% of the initial specific capacitance retained after 3000 cycles). These outstanding electrochemical features of MnMoO4 materials may be associated with their inherent properties such us small size, distinctive nanorod architecture and intriguing physicochemical properties. These results will render the MnMoO4 materials as new and attractive active material for promising application in supercapacitors.
