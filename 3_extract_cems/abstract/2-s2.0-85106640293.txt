A novel structured composite of polyaniline/pristine graphene (PG)-bacterial cellulose (BC) as electrodes fabricated in a facile approach and the foldable all-solid-state supercapacitors with high performance were reported in this work. The shear mixed PG-BC substrate was fixed with in situ polymerized polyaniline as a solder, improving its charge carrier transfer rate and cycling stability, while hydrophilic BC greatly improved the ion diffusion rate of the electrolyte. The as-prepared composites possessed a high areal capacitance of 3.65 F/cm2 at 5 mA/cm2, and the electrode was able to be bent into different shapes without fracture. The assembled all-solid-state supercapacitor was flexible and exhibited excellent areal capacitance of 1389 mF/cm2, energy density of 9.80 mWh/cm3, and 89.8% retention of its initial capacitance after 5000 cycles at a current density of 2 mA/cm2. The composite is expected to have applications in making flexible supercapacitors applied in wearable devices.
