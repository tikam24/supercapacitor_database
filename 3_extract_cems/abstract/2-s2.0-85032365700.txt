The cell inconsistency in the power lithium battery pack of electric vehicle under dynamic cyclic conditions will seriously lower the overall performance of battery pack. In view of this problem, an active equalization system for battery pack based on wide voltage bidirectional DC/DC is designed to realize the efficient energy transfer among any single cell or adjacent multiple cells. The system includes the gating switch array unit, the bidirectional DC/DC unit and the super capacitor energy storage unit etc. The equalization strategy is studied with the real-time voltage of single cell as equalization variable, and a corresponding test rig is constructed to conduct equalization test under both static state and constant-current charging state. The results show that the active equalization scheme proposed can quickly improve the voltage consistency between cells within battery pack, with the energy transfer efficiency in both states reaching above 83%.
