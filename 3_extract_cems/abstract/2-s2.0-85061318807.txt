The present work deals with a simple and cost-effective sonochemical assisted synthesis of binary transition metal oxide (BTMOs) (NZnO–Mn2O3) and NZnO–Mn2O3@rGO ternary nanohybrid using a imidazole derivative as an organic precursor aimed at the application in supercapacitor and sensing of ammonia in aqueous medium. Morphological analysis using various physicochemical techniques, like FESEM, TEM, XRD, and BET, revealed surface enriched property (high surface area and porous nature) with uniform decoration of binary metal oxides (NZnO–Mn2O3) over reduced graphene oxide (rGO). Formation and synergistic interaction of nanohybrid materials were confirmed from FTIR and Raman analysis. Electrochemical measurements showed maximum capacitance performance via cyclic voltammetry (CV) achieved by ternary nanohybrid NZnO–Mn2O3@rGO (252.77 Fg−1 at scan rate 50 mV s−1) which is in good agreement with the charging–discharging (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. Further, the ternary nanohybrid material exhibited good sensing of ammonia in aqueous medium as indicated by continuous amperometric reponse with a lowest sensitivity of 0.47 ppm.
