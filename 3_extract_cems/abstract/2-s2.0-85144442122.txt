Polyphosphazenes (PPNs) are considered an ideal class of inorganic–organic hybrid materials with structural stability inherited from inorganic backbone (-P = N-). PPNs are being employed as precursors for codoped porous carbon materials which are highly suitable for energy production and storage due to their intrinsically enriched heteroatoms like phosphorous, oxygen, and nitrogen. PPN-based codoped carbon materials owe micro- and meso-porous structures, outstanding pore volume, high surface area, exceptional ion transportation, good surface wettability, and high capacitive performance, which is pre-requisite for energy storage applications. With this inspiration, we prepared codoped porous constructed simply by adjusting the ramp conditions with better char yield, disordered structure, ultra-high surface area of 3407.8 m2/g, and ~ 10–13% heteroatom content. The codoped porous carbon microspheres (PZM-MS) were elucidated by XRD, Raman spectroscopy, XPS analysis, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The fabricated intrinsically doped N, P, and O carbon material provides a good capacitance output of 265.0 F/g at 0.5 A/g current density in a 6 M-KOH electrolyte in the symmetric-electric-double-layer capacitors (EDLCs). The PZM-MS delivers 75% columbic efficiency and 91% cycling stability after 10,000 GCD cycles with a 5.0 A/g current density. The codoped material delivers 6.5 W h/Kg energy density at a power density of 24.68 W/Kg at 0.1 A/g and surges down with an upsurge of power density.
