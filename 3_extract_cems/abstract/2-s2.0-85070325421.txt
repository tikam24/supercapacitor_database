To meet the demands of modern energy storage devices it is essential to synthesize novel electrode materials with unique morphologies that could have high porosity, high cyclic stability and high electrical conductivity. The high electrical conductivity enables the electrode materials to achieve high specific capacitance with high energy density. Herein, we have synthesized perovskite SrZrO3 nanorods, which exhibit superior electrochemical performance due to high specific surface area of 146.13 m2/g and a pore width of 1.475 nm. The fabricated electrode consisting of SrZrO3 nanorods achieves a specific capacitance of ‚Åì1225.8 F/g, at low current density (10 A/g) and high energy density (65 Wh/kg) with a power deliverance of ~4000 W/kg, which is almost twice higher than previously reported results. The electrode consisting of SrZrO3 nanorods exhibits high cyclic stability up to 1000 CV cycles. High energy & power density and excellent cyclic stability suggest a significant promise for SrZrO3 nanorods to be used as an electrode material in future supercapacitor devices.
