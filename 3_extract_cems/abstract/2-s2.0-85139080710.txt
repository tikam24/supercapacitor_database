The current study employs density functional theory (DFT) for systematic verification of the impact of vacancy, single-doping, and co-doping of light element atoms (B, N, Al, Si, P, S) and transition metals (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni) in stanene on the geometric, electronic structures, and quantum capacitance. The results suggested that the vacancy and doping both enlarged the quantum capacitance (CQ) of stanene, and co-doping was more effectively than that of single-doping. According to the electron density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level, it was found that the improvement of CQ was attributed to the dopants and Sn-atoms located at vacancy. Moreover, the stanene structures by co-doping have performance of quantum capacitance at positive potential was at a disadvantage to that of negative bias. It was hoped that the results could give new ideas for the enhancement of the CQ of stanene-based supercapacitors.
