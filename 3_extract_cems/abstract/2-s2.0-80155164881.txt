Straight to Ti-V movie: Binary oxide mesosponge layers were fabricated by self-organizing anodization of Ti-V alloys. The etched mesosponge layers exhibit a specific capacitance of 100-130 F g-1, with perfect reversibility and long-term stability. Such mesosponge structures greatly facilitate ion transport during rapid charge/discharge processes. Ti-V binary oxide mesosponge layers are promising candidates for applications in energy-storage devices. Â© 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
