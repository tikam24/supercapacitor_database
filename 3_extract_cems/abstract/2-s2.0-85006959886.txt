Herein, nanocage MnCo2O4 is synthesized by using a dual metal zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF, Mn-Co-ZIF) as both precursor and template, which shows great potential for high performance supercapacitor. The as-obtained MnCo2O4 exhibits hollow polyhedral nanostructure, that inherit from the dual Mn-Co-ZIF. Moreover, the nanocage MnCo2O4 is composed by numerous nanoparticles, which help to short ion diffusion pathway, provide porous structure, and collaborative electronic transmission. The MnCo2O4 electrodes exhibit excellent supercapacitor performances, that possess a high specific capacitance of 1763 F g−1 (1 A g−1), and a reversible capacitance of 840 F g−1 (10 A g−1). After 4500 cycles at 1 A g−1, the MnCo2O4 electrode shows a capacitance retention of 95%, which demonstrates its superior cycle stability. The nanocage MnCo2O4 exhibits good electrochemical properties, due to its unique hierarchical hollow structure can be maintained during the electrochemical cycling.
