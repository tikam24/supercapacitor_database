Using coal-tar pitch as raw material, the mesophase pitches with carbonaceous crystallites were produced at 500 °C. With mesophase pitches of different particle sizes, the ultra-high surface area activated carbons of supercapacitors were prepared by chem-physical activation. Using the prepared activated carbons as electrode materials and Et4NBF4/PC solution as electrolyte, the coin type cells were assembled. The effects of distribution of particle size of mesophase pitches on the electrochemical behaviors of activated carbons were investigated. The results show that the specific surface area of activated carbons increases and then decreases with decreasing particle size of mesophase pitches, and the activated carbons prepared by mesophase pitch of 150-250 μm show the largest BET specific surface area of 2 476 m2/g. When the particle size decreases, the tep density decreases. The activated carbons prepared by mesophase pitch of 150-250 μm show the highest specific capacitance of 103.5 F/g. The activated carbons prepared by mesophase pitch of 75-96 μm show good power discharge behavior, and the specific capacitance is 87 F/g at the current of 1 mA and 83 F/g at the current of 20 mA.
