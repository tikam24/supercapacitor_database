Polyvinyl alcohol based organogel electrolytes are a promising class of materials for lithium batteries and electrochemical supercapacitors. Amongst various classes of polymer electrolytes polymer based gel electrolytes have proven to be a materials for safer battery assembly with fast ion carrying capacity and better mechanical strength. Internal structure of gel is responsible for its ion conduction mechanism. This paper presents small angle X-ray scattering(SAXS) results for polyvinyl alcohol during its gelation in an organic solvent and salt system. Structural changes are observed during and after gelation for samples with varying polymer and lithium salt concentration and has been well documented by the SAXS results.
