In this work, terephthalic acid (TPA) is chosen as a plasticizer and pore-forming additive to promote the stabilization and improve the electrochemical performance of polyacrylonitrile based carbon nanofibers film (PANCF). The plasticizing mechanism of TPA is systematically investigated. Meanwhile, the effect of TPA on the nanostructural characteristic and electrochemical performance is also studied. The introduction of TPA could promote the oxidation, cyclization and dehydrogenation reaction among PAN molecules by the forming of anhydride compounds during the stabilization. TPA modified PANCF (T-PANCF) exhibits better flexibility, smaller diameter, higher weight residual, more defective sites, suitable heteroatom content and larger specific surface area and pore volume compared to those of PANCF. When used as the electrode material for supercapacitors, T-PANCF shows a high specific capacitance of 182 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 81 % capacitance retention of it at 100 A g−1. This method is very fascinating for preparing high performance PANCF due to its simple operation and short production time.
