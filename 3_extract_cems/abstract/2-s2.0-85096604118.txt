Conducting polymers are the most promising electrode materials for supercapacitors. In the present study, polyaniline (PANI)-Graphene Oxide (GO) nanocomposites are synthesized via in-situ chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline in different weight ratios with respect to GO. PANI/GO composites in the weight ratio of 1:30 (PGO30) and l:50(PGO50) are prepared. The structure and morphology studies were done by means of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray Diffraction Spectroscopy (XRD), and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM). The FT-IR spectra of PGO composites reveal the well interaction of oxygen functional groups of GO with the polymer chain. The disappearance of reflection peak related to GO in the XRD plots of composites indicate that the GO was fully exfoliated in the polymer matrix during the in-situ polymerization. The FESEM images show that PANI is formed on the surface of GO sheets and retains its morphology. From the Cyclic Voltammetry studies, it was found that the PANI with 30 Wt. % GO nanocomposite has the higher specific capacitance value of 297 F/g at a scan rate of 2 mV/s and also shows good rate capability. Hence, it is a potential candidate for the supercapacitor application.
