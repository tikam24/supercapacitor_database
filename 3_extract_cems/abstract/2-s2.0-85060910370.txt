It is a great challenge to prepare high capacitance negative electrodes for high energy density supercapacitor devices. In this work, nitrogen doped carbon spheres in-situ grown on Ni foam (N doped CS/NF) are prepared as a binder-free negative electrode for supercapacitors. Due to the formation of hierarchical porous structure and N contents after nitrogen-doping, the specific area and electrochemical active sites on the surface of the electrode are effectively increased. Therefore, the specific capacitance of N doped CS/NF electrode is remarkably improved compared to pristine carbon spheres electrode. The synthesized N doped CS/NF negative electrode provides a high areal specific capacitance (CA) of 5.75 F cm−2 at 5 mA cm−2 and mass specific capacitance (Cm) of 287.5 F g−1 at 0.25 A g−1. Furthermore, the electrode shows an excellent cycle stability of 115.6% after 10000 cycles at 100 mA cm−2. This study proposes a synergistic approach to enhance the electrochemical performance of supercapacitor's negative electrode.
