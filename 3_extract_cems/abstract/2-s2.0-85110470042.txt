Vanadium nitride (VN) thin films with high specific capacitance are desirable in microsupercapacitors. Considering the integration with the silicon-based microelectronics, VN thin films on silicon wafers are needed. Here, hierarchical-porous VN thin films are deposited on silicon wafers through a solution-processable method. The prepared VN/silicon thin films show a high areal specific capacitance of ~60 mF cm−2 at 5 mV s−1 in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Symmetric devices deliver a high energy density of 21.2 and 12.8 mWh cm−3 at a power density of 2.0 and 16.8 W cm−3, respectively. Excellent retention 91.2% is achieved after 15,000 cycles. The results will provide a solution method for preparation of hierarchical-porous VN thin films on silicon wafers with excellent performance.
