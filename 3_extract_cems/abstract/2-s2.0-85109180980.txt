In the present study, pristine and Ce1-xNixO2(x = 0.1) nanoparticles are grown by low cost modified combustion process. The surface morphology and phase pureness of the pristine and Ce1-xNixO2(x = 0.1) nanostructures is achieved by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and powder X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) techniques. The closed and open mode Z-scan studies reveal that these synthesized nanostructures possess excellent reverse saturation absorption behaviour, which can be utilized for optical limiting applications in defence and healthcare systems. By analyzing the photocatalytic properties against Eosin Yellow dye, the degradation efficiency of synthesized samples is found to be 91% and 93% respectively. Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Galvanostatic Charge-Discharge (GCD) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopic (EIS) are the techniques which help to study the electrochemical properties of the synthesized materials for electrode materials of supercapacitor. From GCD, the specific capacitance of pristine and Ce1-xNixO2(x = 0.1) is 305 and 446 F g-1 respectively. Even after 2000 GCD cycles, the cyclic stability and coulombic efficiency of Ce1-xNixO2(x = 0.1) remains at 96.1% and 97.5%, while for pure CeO2 it is 88.3% and 91% respectively.
