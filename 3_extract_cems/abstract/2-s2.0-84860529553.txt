This work demonstrates the directly grown graphene-like carbon nanowall (GNW)-carbon nanotube (CNT)-polyacrylonitrile-based carbon fiber (CF) paper structure for use as a highly efficient supercapacitor. The CF was prepared by electrospinning, and was then treated by carbonization. The CNTs were directly grown on the CF paper by microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition using CH 4/H 2 precursors at 800°C. The GNW was further reconstructed onto the CNT surface by microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition using CH 4/H 2 precursors at 1500°C (GNW-CNT/CF). Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that the capacitance of the GNW-CNT/CF electrode is around 176 F g - 1 at a charging/discharging current density of 0.5 mA/cm 2. The stand-up structure of GNW-CNT/CF has a high capacitance, attributable to its large surface area, high electrical conductivity and direct growth with low energy-loss. This novel stand-up structure of GNW-CNT/CF with a high surface area and low electron-transfer resistance has great potential for developing a revolutionary new class of nanostructured electrodes in supercapacitors or other energy-conversion applications. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.
