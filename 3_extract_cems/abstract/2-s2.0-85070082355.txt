We design and prepare a novel hierarchical carbonaceous electrode material (SBA-C-K-N) for supercapacitor. The combination of micro/mesoporous structure and extra-framework cations endow SBA-C-K-N with outstanding electrochemical performance, including high specific capacitance of 134.4 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and ideal rate capability. Meanwhile, 97.3% of the specific capacitance is well-maintained after 1000 cycles. Surprisingly, comprehensive characterization showed extra-framework cations (K+) could boost capacitance and decrease charge-transfer resistance, which might result from pre-fixed extra-framework cations decreased interfacial barrier between electrode surface and electrolyte and sped up mass transport between both phases.
