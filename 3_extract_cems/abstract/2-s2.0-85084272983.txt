WO3 has attracted widespread attention as an important semiconductor for supercapacitors. However, applications of WO3 are limited by its poor performance regarding capacitance and conductivity. In this paper, a novel method is presented for preparing a WO3/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) composite, based on poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) as a linker. PIL enables a tight contact between WO3 and graphene to exploit the excellent electrical conductivity of graphene. Results of the morphology for the as-prepared WO3/PIL/RGO composite indicate that the WO3 nanoparticles are distributed uniformly on the surface of the RGO. The WO3/PIL/RGO electrode displays a much higher specific capacitance, 316 F g-1 at 1 A g-1, than that of the pure WO3 electrode. Furthermore, WO3/PIL/RGO also has good rate and long cycling performance for supercapacitors, making it a promising electrode material.
