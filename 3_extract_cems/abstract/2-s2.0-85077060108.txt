Development of efficient electrochemical catalysts is crucial for clean energy technologies such as water splitting, and batteries, etc. Despite large amounts of electrocatalyst research, it remains a challenge to eco-friendly non-metal catalyst showing high performance as much as novel metal. To achieve high performance as much as noble-metal, carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) have been attracted as a candidate to the widespread application using electrochemical reaction. Herein, we report nitrogen, and fluorine co-doped graphene quantum dot (N,F-GQDs) synthesized by two-step functionalizing method for highly efficient overall water splitting. N,F-GQDs demonstrate electrocatalytic effect toward HER, and OER, and is fabricated as two-electrode full-water splitting showing good stability at various potential points. Furthermore, due to fluorine treatment, prepared N,F-GQDs exhibits enhanced electrochemical reaction property, which can induce capacitance due to the large difference of electronegativity between fluorine and carbon. N,F-GQDs is applied for the anode of super capacitance in the three-electrode system and reveal specific capacitance of 270 F g−1 at 1 mV s−1 from CV curves, and GCD capacitance of 244 F g−1 at 3 mA cm−2. This work provides a new avenue for enhancing both activities of the electrocatalytic and electrochemical reaction.
