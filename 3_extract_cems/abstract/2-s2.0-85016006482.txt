In order to improve the pore structure and electrochemical performance of commcercially available activated carbons, the coal-based activated carbon (CAC), coconut shell-based activated carbon (CSAC) and bamboo-based activated carbons (BAC) were chosen for the steam re-activated. The pore structure and electrochemical performance of the activated carbons were characterized by using nitrogen adsorption, galvanostatic charge/discharge, cyclic voltammetry curve and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The effects of the re-activation parameters of the activation temperature and dosage of steam on the pore structure and electrochemical properties of activated carbons were investigated. The results showed that the steam re-activation could significantly improve the development of pore structure, especially the mesopores, and the adsorption capacity of iodine and methylene blue as well as the electrochemical performance. The properties of coconut shell-based activated carbon was significantly improved by the re-activation compared with other activated carbons. After re-activation, the specific capacitance of the coconut shell-based activated carbon could reach 106 F/g, which was 2.5 times of the pristine activated carbon.
