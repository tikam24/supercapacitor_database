Activated carbon bio-wastes-based have been extensively studied as electrode material for symmetric supercapacitor. In this work, the activated carbon stink bean pod peel-based was synthesis with simplest possible technique without involving complicated techniques as electrode material for supercapacitor. Stinky bean pod peel-based activated carbon is prepared through pre-carbonization, chemical activation, carbonization, and physical activation. ZnCl2 in four different concentrations of 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 m L-1 was selected as chemical reagent. Furthermore, the carbonization and physical activated were performed in furnace tube in high temperature. The physical features obtained indicate the potential of stink bean pod peel as activated carbon with a nanofiber structure and decorated by rod-like structure. In symmetric supercapacitor, the capacitive behavior was obtained as high as 265 F g-1 in 1 M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. In addition, the maximum energy density was found of 36.18 Wh kg-1 with power density of 125.06 W kg-1. This simple method of obtaining activated carbon from stink bean pod peel provides a perspective for the further development of high-performance electrode materials for supercapacitor applications.
