A chemical bath deposition method is used for preparing SnO 2-RuO2 composite films. The films with varying RuO 2 composition are prepared by varying the vol% of RuCl3 in the bath and their structural, morphological and supercapacitive properties are studied. The structural study revealed that the composite films are amorphous. FT-Raman spectrum showed the fundamental vibrations of SnO2 and RuO2, confirming the formation of SnO2-RuO2 composite. The elongated particle structures are observed from morphological studies. The supercapacitive studies showed highest specific capacitance of 150 F g-1 for SnO2-RuO2 composite containing 15 vol% of RuCl3 in the deposition bath. The charge-discharge curves showed the pseudocapacitive performance with maximum energy density of 4.9 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 0.42 kW kg-1 for optimized SnO2-RuO2 composite. An equivalent series resistance (ESR) of 12 Ω is observed from the electrochemical impedance studies. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
