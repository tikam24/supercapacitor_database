A supercapacitor exhibits unique features including high capacitance value and low voltage limit as compared to normal capacitors. It can transfer charge very quickly than rechargeable batteries and further handle more cycles of charging and discharging. Supercapacitors are generally of different types depending upon the charge storage and their performance, i.e. electric double layer, pseudo and hybrid capacitors. Electric double layer capacitor works on the adsorption process while pseudo-capacitors works on the basis of redox reaction. Nanomaterials having the ability to restore their functionalities after damage can be used to fabricate self-healable supercapacitors. This characteristic improves the lifespan of a supercapacitor. Metallic nanomaterials including titanium oxide nanoflowers, manganese nanosheets, gallium nanodroplet and carbon-based nanomaterials such as single or multiwalled nanotubes, graphene oxide and their composites are the best form of self-healable nanomaterials for supercapacitors. They can be used to modify the electrode utilized in different types of capacitors for flexible, self-healable supercapacitors. These materials impart very important properties including higher stability, catalytic activity, durability, and a low economical cost. This chapter covers the use of self-healable nanomaterials to increase the shelf life of supercapacitors as compared to rechargeable batteries which make them extremely suitable for industrial and medical diagnostic applications.
