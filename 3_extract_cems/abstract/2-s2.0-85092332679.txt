Self-assembed α-Fe2O3/reduced graphene oxide hydrogel(3DGH) composites were synthsized by facile hydrothermal method. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction(XRD), Raman spectroscopy(Raman), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS), scanning electron microscopy(SEM) and transmission electron microscopy(TEM). The α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles(about 100 nm in diameter) grow on the three-dimensional porous structure of reduced graphene oxide(RGO). In addition, the particle size of α-Fe2O3 can be controlled from 200 nm to 30 nm via adjusting the loading of Fe3+. This results show that the α-Fe2O3/3DGH composite with a Fe3+ loading amount of 40% and particle size of 100 nm has the maximum specific capacitance(750.8 F/g at 1 A/g) and good cyclic performance(the specific capacitance retention is 81.9% after 5000 cycles at 10 A/g), which is higher than that of pure α-Fe2O3(251. F/g at 1 A/g and 43.8% after 5000 cycles).
