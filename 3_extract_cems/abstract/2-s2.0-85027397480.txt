Three-dimension (3D) conductive network was successfully constructed by carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene sheets (G) on the polyester fabric (PETC) using a “dipping-drying” process and electrophoretic deposition method, which facilitates to greatly enhance the electron transportation rate and shorten the electrolyte ion diffusion distance. The resultant composite fabric provides a promising substrate to prepare textile-based electrodes for flexile supercapacitors. After further coating the CNTs with polyaniline (PANI), the polyaniline/carbon nanotubes/graphene/polyester (PANI/CNTs/G/PETC) textile electrode exhibited high electrochemical performances. The composite electrode showed a maximum areal capacitance of 791 mF cm−2 at a current density of 1.5 mA cm−2. Compared to some reported PANI electrodes with fast decay in capacitance capacity, the capacitance retentions of the composite electrode was over 76% even after 3000 charge-discharge cycles. Moreover, the composite electrode also exhibited stable electrochemical performances under the mechanical bending and stretching conditions.
