A unique three-dimensional hybrid NiCo(CO3)(OH)2 nanowire/NiMn(CO3)(OH)2 nanosheet composite was fabricated using a facile hydrothermal method as a binder-free electrode directly grown on Ni foam for supercapacitors. We examined the synergistic effect by fabricating Ni-Co-Mn ternary electrodes that used Ni-Co with a large specific surface area and Mn with a very high theoretical capacity. The new hybrid electrode had good electrochemical characteristics, exhibiting remarkably high specific capacitances of 1673.3 and 453.0 F g−1 at 3 and 15 A g−1, respectively. Compared with other samples, the capacitance showed less reduction as the current density increased. This result indicates stable electrode properties with increasing voltage. The cycling stability of the hybrid NiCo(CO3)(OH)2/NiMn(CO3)(OH)2 composite was measured as 82.1% after 5000 cycles. Additionally, we fabricated an asymmetric supercapacitor employing the NiCo(CO3)(OH)2/NiMn(CO3)(OH)2 composite as the positive electrode and graphene as the negative electrode, which exhibited a high energy density of 27.2 W h kg−1 at a power density of 702.7 W kg−1 and a remarkable cycling stability, with 89.4% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles. Thus, for the first time, we investigated the dual nano-type structure of an NiCo(CO3)(OH)2 nanowire/NiMn(CO3)(OH)2 nanosheet electrode for supercapacitors and obtained satisfactory results.
