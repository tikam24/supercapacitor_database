Many researches involving in the solvent treatment of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) have been carried out for enhancing the electric conductivity. Herein, the capacitive performance of commercial PEDOT:PSS (trade name: PH1000) treated by NMP, EG and DMSO solvents were studied, including their conductivity, morphology, surface roughness and surface composition. Compared with pristine PH1000 film, the electrochemical active windows of the solvent-treated PH1000 films were negatively shifted to about âˆ’0.8 V from 0 V, and more excitedly, the operating voltage of all-solid-state symmetrical supercapacitors based on the treated PH1000 films could enhance up to 1.8 V from about 1.2 V with an excellent stability during 2500 charge/discharge cycles. Moreover, the effects of the three solvents on the capacitive performance of devices were compared in detail, which discovered that the device built with DMSO-treated PH1000 showed superior capacitance behaviors.
