In the study, we proposed a new formula for the hydrogen consumption of fuel cell under non-constant current behavior. We used supercapacitors as auxiliary energy source to form a hybrid system and change the current behavior of the fuel cell. We performed hybrid system tests for different supercapacitor values. We extracted the fuel cell current, voltage, hydrogen consumption for each configuration. We compared the measured values and expected values from known equations. We see that, results from hydrogen consumption equations does not match the hybrid system hydrogen consumption. Finally, we proposed a new formula for hydrogen consumption including the current gradient and current peak value for hybrid systems.
