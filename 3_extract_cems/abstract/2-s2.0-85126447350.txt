Electric Vehicles are silent and emissions are low. In regenerative braking technology, the motor can be used as a generator and is used to charge the electric vehicle battery. In above technology, the battery is not returned fully with regenerated energy. The motor armature loss and switching loss occurs during conversion. An energy storage system comprised of an ultra-capacitor module and nickel-metal hybride battery connected through a DC-DC converter to a PMDC motor for a motor drive system has been discussed in this paper. It is inferred from study that during braking, non-isolated topologies were used to store energy. A new DC-DC converter with isolated topology has been discussed and this Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) is compared with a standalone battery system. It is seen that the overall system efficiency is improved compared with standalone battery system.
