Porous zinc-manganese oxide (ZnMn2O4) microstructures are prepared by calcination using a precursor method, and the material is successfully applied as the supercapacitor electroactive materials in a three-electrode cell. Due to the unique micro/nanostructure, the as-prepared sample obtained under the calcination condition of 450Â°C for 6h achieved a high specific capacitance of 1093Fg-1. The electrode also exhibited high cycle stability for 5000cycles.
