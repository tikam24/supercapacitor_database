This chapter describes the importance of energy storage devices and renewable energy global status and investment. There are different types of energy storage devices such as the battery, fuel cell, and supercapacitor of different operation mechanisms that are explained in short. In addition, the differences between the supercapacitors, fuel cells, and batteries, the advantages and disadvantages of supercapacitors, and their possible applications are also well-covered. Finally, the importance of bismuth ferrites in electrochemical studies has also been highlighted.
