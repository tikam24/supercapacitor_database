The installation of stationary ultracapacitor storage devices, as widely recognized, allows the recovery of the braking energy for increasing the energy efficiency as well as a better pantograph voltage profile. In the paper a new methodological mean is proposed for determining the fundamental characteristics of this kind of storage device, characterized by high power density, interfaced with the railroad by a bidirectional dc-dc converter. More specifically, the parameters of the storage system can be determined by employing an optimization technique which in a quite general way is able to take contemporaneously into account several aspects in an integrated manner. Some considerations are performed for properly taking into account the stochastic aspects of the design procedure. Numerical simulations with respect to a case study are presented, pointing out the potentiality of the tailored technique. Experimental results are also reported, with reference to an electromechanical simulator, in order to put in evidence the effectiveness and the actual implementation of the proposed optimization technique.
