Smart sensors, monitoring systems and IoT can be used to improve farm animal productivity and wellbeing. Dairy cow rumen pH level can be measured using a smart bolus. A critical bolus subsection is the power supply system. The selection criterions of main elements: battery, supercapacitor and voltage regulator, have been reviewed and applied. A set of selected elements have been experimentally tested for self-consumption, peak current, step response and long-term performance in an improvised thermal chamber. The result is a complete bolus power supply.
