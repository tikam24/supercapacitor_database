Higher-voltage, 540V, aircraft DC-bus power quality is examined experimentally and by computer simulation during a short-circuit fault across the phase terminals of a 70kW, five-phase, permanent magnet fault-tolerant generator. The DC-bus transients caused by the short-circuiting of the generator phases are seen to exceed the limits in MIL-STD-704F and a control algorithm is proposed for a supercapacitor-based energy storage device that mitigates the transients. The controller performance is illustrated by computer simulations for a range of bus switching scenarios. Â© 2011 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.
