The limitation of low-cost and high-safety aqueous manganese-based materials for electrochemical energy storage is largely hampered by their poor cyclic stability, which is usually caused by the manganese dissolution and interfacial kinetics. Here we synthesize a composite electrode which possesses unique structural properties for aqueous supercapacitor application and exhibits higher area specific capacitance. The remarkable long cycle stability of Mn3P2O8/TiN on titanium (Mn3P2O8/TiN@Ti) outperforms that most manganese-based pseudocapacitive electrode materials. The designed unique structure is attractive for quick charge migration, which confirms that the appropriate anodizing of substrate, electrodeposition of active substances and their in situ loading, is an efficient strategy to improve kinetics for high power density pseudocapacitive supercapacitor energy storage application.
