In this paper, we study the model electrical circuit containing a supercapactor. For solve the electrical circuit operation used fractional definition: the Caputo definition, Conformable Fractional Derivative (CFD) definition and combination of both definition of non-integer order containing fractional time derivatives the Conformable Fractional Derivative in Caputo sense. The state equation for a given electrical circuit has been developed. An electrical circuit model was built and were performed in three measurement series each with a different external resistance. The results of the electrical circuit with calculations using differential equations and the classical method were analyzed.
