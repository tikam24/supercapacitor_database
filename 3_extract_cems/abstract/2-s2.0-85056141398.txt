This work is concerned with the use of the engine start module (ESM) ULTRA 31/900/24V ultracapacitor in specific hybrid systems consisting of a photovoltaic (PV) module, battery, and internal combustion engine (ICE). The test bench research on the ESM cooperating with the photovoltaic module to prevent its self-discharge has been tested, analyzed, and discussed. Moreover, the power distribution between electrochemical batteries and the ultracapacitor is shown. The potential application of the ultracapacitor connected with batteries for the start-up of an ICE engine is also presented. Furthermore, we analyze the possible application of the ultracapacitor plus battery system in heavy transport vehicles and buses. The main advantages and disadvantages of the system consisting of an ultracapacitor and a battery is presented along with the problem of self-discharge and the conditions of ultracapacitor and battery cooperation. This work also features the assumptions made for the conducted tests, selected accordingly for nominal current values of typical starter motors available on the market.
