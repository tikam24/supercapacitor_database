In this work, the MgCo2O4@Mn2O3 coaxial hollow core-shell structure (Pipe-in-Pipe) was synthesized by electrospinning technology. The morphology of MgCo2O4 was controlled by adjusting the annealing temperature, and the coaxially hollow core-shell structure was prepared on this basis. This method synthesizes the MgCo2O4@Mn2O3 coaxial hollow core-shell structure with excellent porosity and specific surface area in one step. In this work, not only the influence of annealing temperature is studied, but also the performance of the coaxial hollow core-shell structure in supercapacitor is tested.
