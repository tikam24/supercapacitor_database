The ever-growing demand of portable and wearable electric devices requires energy storage devices with flexibility and wearable compatibility while not sacrificing the performance too much. This requires the electrode and electrolyte materials becoming robust and durable under mechanical deformations, which grants the polymers with inherent advantages. Therefore, polymers for supercapacitors, either as substrate/matrix or active materials have received prime concerns. Viewing from the requirements of the flexible and wearable supercapacitors, this review provides an essential guidance to choose and/or design the proper polymer materials for both electrode and electrolyte. More importantly, supercapacitors with additional functions that are achieved by utilizing polymer materials are also specifically highlighted.
