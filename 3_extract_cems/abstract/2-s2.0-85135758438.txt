The proceedings contain 9 papers. The topics discussed include: thermal effects on the surface of flexible organic photovoltaic solar cells (FOPSC); 3D electrode architectures for high energy and high power lithium-ion batteries; a hybrid in-parallel TEG-TPV system for harvesting electrical energy from highly varying high-temperature sources; a farm animal kinetic energy harvesting device for IoT applications; non-exponential discharge dynamics in electrochemical capacitors; thermal conductivity prediction of nanofluids containing SiC particles by using artificial neural network; hybrid alpha power source; novel thermoelectric generator systems for harvesting electrical energy from highly varying and high-peak temperature sources; and direct battery electrolyte and supercapacitor heating and temperature maintenance at low temperatures.
