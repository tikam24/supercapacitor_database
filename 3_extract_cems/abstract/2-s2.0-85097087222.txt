An effective strategy for the fabrication of aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor (AASC) with an ultra-high mass loading of electroactive materials (~38.3 mg cm−2) is reported in the present work. The electrodeposited ruthenium oxide on bare carbon cloth (RuO2@BCC) serves as a flexible, lightweight and conductive current collector for the AASC. The synthesized tin oxide (S-SnO2NPs) and commercially available titanium dioxide (C-TiO2NPs) nanoparticles were spin-coated on RuO2@BCC current collector and utilized as positive and negative electrodes for the fabrication of AASC respectively. The electrochemical measurement showed that the AASC delivered maximum areal capacitance of 58 mF cm−2 at a scan rate of 1 mA cm−2 and capacitance retention rate of 86.5% after 10,000 charge-discharge cycles within working voltage of 1.2 V for the total areal mass loading up to ~38.3 mg cm−2 of electroactive materials. This work provides a new approach to built AASC with an ultra-high areal mass loading of electroactive materials with good electrochemical properties, demonstrating its promising practical application for energy storage devices.
