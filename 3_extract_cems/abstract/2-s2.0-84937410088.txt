The surface modification of ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) material by nitric acid (HNO3) was studied. The structure of the HNO3-modified OMC (OMC-H) was characterized by Fourier transform infrared, N2 adsorption-desoprtion measurement and transmission electron microscopy. The electrochemical performances of the supercapacitor using OMC and OMC-H as electrode material were compared by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results showed that the structure of the OMC samples was changed after surface modification, the specific surface area and the pore volume was increased. Meanwhile, the electrochemical performance of the supercapacitor was enhanced after HNO3 modification.
