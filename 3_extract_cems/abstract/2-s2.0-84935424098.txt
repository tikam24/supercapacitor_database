Co3O4 submicron particles were prepared by a facile molten salt method at 280 ℃ using Co(NO3)2·6H2O as raw materials. The phase and morphology of the samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical performance of the samples were characterized by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge. Experimental results show that, in an electrolyte of 6 mol/L KOH, when the soaking time is 3 h, the Co3O4 nanoparticles show a specific capacitance of 187 F/g at a current density of 0.4 A/g, and 51.4% of the initial specific capacitance maintains after 1000 cycles at a current density of 1 A/g.
