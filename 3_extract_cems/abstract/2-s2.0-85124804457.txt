A Microgrid (MG) might experience power shortage and frequency disturbances during islanded operation which necessitates the utilization of an energy storage system (ESS). Battery ESSs are widely used for this application. In order to prolong the batteries life, it has been proposed to use a super-capacitor (SC) alongside with the battery. For this purpose, the batteries handle low-frequency disturbances while the SC deal with high-frequency fluctuations to reduce the stress on battery. This combination of batteries and SCs is referred to as Hybrid ESS (HESS). In this paper, simulation studies are conducted to size the required parts of HESS for operation in a typical MG in islanded mode. Various commonly-used batteries are sized to be used in the HESS. Considering that the life cycle and cost of each battery type is different from one another, the life cycle per cost is used as a criterion to determine which of them is more economically suitable for HESS application. The results show that Na-S battery with total cost of 64516.14 is more cost-effective than the other battery technologies for a 10-year operation of MG.
