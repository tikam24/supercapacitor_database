In this paper, we have studied electrochemical performance of rod shaped ZnO nanostructure (NS) for supercapacitor application. We have performed the electrochemical performance by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chrono charge-discharge galvanostatic with three electrode systems. Herein we have synthesized the ZnO NS by using leaf extract of Tabernaemontana divericata as capping/stabilizing agent at 40Â°C. The morphology of synthesized ZnO NS has been determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD) have been used for elemental composition. The band gap has been calculated 3.01eV with talc plot by using data of UV-Visible spectrum. The specific capacitance of the drop casted ZnO supercapacitor on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) has been investigated by using CV curves at the voltage scan rates 20mV/s, 40mV/s, 60mV/s, 80mV/s and 100mV/s. The obtained values of specific capacitance are 535.7142 F g-1, 401.7857 F g-1, 304.7619 F g-1, 229.9107 F g-1 and 189.2857 F g-1 respectively. The values of energy density and power density have also been calculated. The obtained values at the abovementioned scan rates are 36.4583Wh/kg and 65.6249W/kg, 27.3438 Wh/kg and 49.218820W/kg, 20.7407 Wh/kg 37.3332W/kg, 15.6470, Wh/kg and 28.1646W/kg, 12.8819 Wh/kg and 23.1874W/kg respectively.
