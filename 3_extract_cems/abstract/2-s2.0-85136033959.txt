Recently, Ti3C2 MXene with facile physicochemical properties is a fascinating candidate material for energy storage applications. Herein, solvothermal method was employed to fabricate the novel D-Ti3C2/MoO3@IL by incorporation of imidazolium based ionic liquid to MoO3 nanorods (MoO3@IL); which was intimately anchored onto the surface of D-Ti3C2 MXene. Additionally, this D-Ti3C2 MXene acts as a promising conductive substrate not only to maintain structural stability, but maintains the electrophilicity of electroactive centers as well. Similarly, MoO3@IL improves electrical conductivity due to ionic liquid, and improves reaction kinetics by supplying effective channel for charge transport system with improved pseudocapacitance. Owing to the intimate interaction, the D-Ti3C2/MoO3@IL electrode exhibited exceptional electrochemical performances with specific capacitance of 1680 F g–1 at 1 A g–1, outstanding rate performance, and excellent cyclic stability. Moreover, the symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) device from D-Ti3C2/MoO3@IL demonstrated excellent energy densities of 41 Wh kg–1 and 9.6 Wh kg–1 at power densities of 990 W kg–1 and 3456 W kg–1 respectively. We have employed this novel hybrid electrode material for SSC device application for the first time. The results proved that D-Ti3C2/MoO3@IL is an advanced electrode material, and this scheme provides the valuable method to fabricate MXene and ionic liquid based electrodes with superior electrochemical performance for supercapacitors.
