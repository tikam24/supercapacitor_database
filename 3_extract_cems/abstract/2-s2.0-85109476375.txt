Transition metal oxide (TMO) nanomaterials with regular morphology have received widening research attention as electrode materials due to their improved electrochemical characteristics. In this study we present the successful fabrication of an Fe3O4/TiO2nanocomposite grown on a carbon cloth (Fe3O4/TiO2@C) used as a high-efficiency electrochemical supercapacitor electrode. Flexible electrodes are directly used for asymmetric supercapacitors without any binder. The increased specific surface area of the TiO2nanorod arrays provides sufficient adsorption sites for Fe3O4nanoparticles. An asymmetric supercapacitor composed of Fe3O4/TiO2@C is tested in 1 M Na2SO3electrolyte, and the synergistic effects of fast reversible Faraday reaction on the Fe3O4/TiO2surface and the highly conductive network formed by TiO2@C help the electrode to achieve a high areal capacitance of 304.1 mF cm−2at a current density of 1 mA cm−2and excellent cycling stability with 90.7% capacitance retention at 5 mA cm−2after 10 000 cycles. As a result, novel synthesis of a binder-free Fe3O4/TiO2@C electrode provides a feasible approach for developing competitive candidates in supercapacitor applications.
