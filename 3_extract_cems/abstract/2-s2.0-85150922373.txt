Carbon materials derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are considered ideal electrode materials for supercapacitors owing to their unique porous structure and large specific surface area. In this paper, highly ordered honeycomb-like activated porous carbon (APC) was synthesized by one-step carbonization and KOH etching of Mg-MOF. The changes of elements during the preparation process and the structural characteristics of the materials were analyzed by XRD, TEM, XPS, and other testing methods. The results show that APC is amorphous carbon with a large specific surface area (3247 m2 g−1) and porous structure. The APC electrode exhibits 368.0 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and retains 96.25 % of the initial capacitance after 150,000 cycles at 50 A g−1, showing excellent electrochemical performance. The assembled electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) also exhibits a high energy density of 17.4 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 375.0 W kg−1. Therefore, the APC is a prospective electrode material for constructing high-performance supercapacitors in the future.
