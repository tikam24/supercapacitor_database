ZrTiO4 (ZTO) nanoparticles (NPs) are synthesized by solution combustion method using chemical fuel (Glycine) (ZTOG) and green (Aloevera) extract (ZTOA) as a reducing agent (15–25 ml) and calcined at 700 °C. The synthesized samples are characterized and its multi-functional properties such as Photoluminescence, Sensor and Supercapacitor properties were discussed in detail. Powder X-ray diffraction pattern of ZTOG and ZTOA shows the Bragg's reflection corresponding to ZrTiO4. The pure orthorhombic phase is retained in ZTOA whereas in ZTOG, monoclinic and cubic phases are observed. The crystallite size estimated by PXRD matches well with TEM analysis. From the Wood and Tauc's relation, the energy band gap was found to be 2.8 and 3.2 eV which was further confirmed by band structure using density of states. The photoluminescence emission peaks (λ = 350 nm), CIE and CCT of ZTOA and ZTOG clearly confirms that the present nanophosphor might be a good nanophosphor material for blue light emitting diodes. X-ray/Gamma ray absorption properties are also studied which clearly shows the ZrTiO4 might be a good absorbing material. Furthermore, Cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis of ZTOA nanorods shows very good redox peaks as compared to ZTOG. From the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, the charge-transfer resistance for prepared nanorods ZTOA and ZTOG was found to be 180 and 261 Ω respectively. The modified graphite electrode with ZTOA shows good sensing activity for both paracetamol and ascorbic acid rather than ZTOG.
