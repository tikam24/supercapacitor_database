This paper analyses, simulates and verifies an experimental prototype of a four-phase interleaved DC-DC converter. It is based on a SEPIC-Cuk combination. The developed prototype has been used in single-input multiple-output (SIMO) applications. This combined converter allows obtaining dual output voltages of the same value, from a single input DC voltage and with only a power switch. Multiphase interleaved DC-DC converters achieve a better dynamic response and low ripple, maintaining their efficiency. Each converter is connected in parallel, thereby managing their losses by distributing them between more components, which facilitates the thermal management of the multiphase converter and allows handling high power values in small sizes with respect to solutions for a single phase. Two control strategies were applied: synchronous operation mode (SOM) and interleaved operation mode (IOM). The simulation results allow the comparison of both operational modes, verifying that the IOM presents advantages with respect to the ripple at the input and output currents. The experimental prototype was designed for a distributed power architecture and bipolar DC microgrid (MG).
