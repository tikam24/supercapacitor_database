A functional power flow control for an optimized energy management system (OEMS), enabling the peak shaving in an autonomous microgrid, supported by a hybrid energy storage (HESS) is the matter of this paper. The microgrid configuration features two diesel generators, photovoltaic panels, lead acid batteries and supercapacitors. The OEMS directs the power flow to minimize emissions, while extending the life of the batteries. Modelling and simulations are presented together with the optimization analysis which determines the best environmental and economic outcomes for the microgrid management in standalone mode. The application is thought for isolated small communities (i.e. on mountains, islands or isolated locations) or small resorts/hotels.
