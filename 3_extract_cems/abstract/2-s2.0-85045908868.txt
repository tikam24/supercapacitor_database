Nowadays it is mandatory sustainable energy production and storage. In this scenario, supercapacitors play an important role as ultrafast energy storage devices with long lifetime and high efficiency features. The new era of these devices is based on new materials and electrolytes that are environment-friendly during manufacturing and applications. This paper presents a high surface area mesoporous Carbon (MC) material direct growth on aluminum current collector on an environment-friendly process. MC material showed specific capacitance of ~ 8 F gâˆ’ 1 and impressive chemical stability. Prepared with two MC electrodes, low-cost cellulosic separator and aqueous neutral electrolyte, the supercapacitor coin cells presented very low equivalent series resistance, ~ 100% device storage and supply efficiency, then almost no Capacitance, Energy and Power lost after dozen thousand cycles (on the optimized cell). The Ragone plot contrasts our data with conventional capacitors, electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC) and batteries, fitting them well into the EDLC category. For our best understanding, the excellent electric contact of MC and Al current collector is the key parameter to achieve a minimal ESR, higher efficiency and longer lifetime. The detailed characterization of material and devices are presented herein, evidencing MC as promising materials for energy storage applications.
