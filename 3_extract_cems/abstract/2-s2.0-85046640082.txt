This paper presents a five port converter with generation source, ultra capacitor, battery and asymmetric bipolar output for microgrid and hybrid electric vehicles applications. Proposed converter has two asymmetric bipolar outputs. This makes it suitable for interfacing with multilevel inverter in hybrid microgrid applications. On the basis of power sharing between ports, charged and discharged of the battery and ultra capacitor, three operating modes are defined. Proposed structure uses a three winding coupled inductor with high gain. Operation and analysis, simulation, and design consideration of the proposed structure is presented. To validate the simulation and theoretical analysis a laboratory prototype of 450 W by using DS1104 dSPACE is presented.
