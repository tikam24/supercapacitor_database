Multilayer graphene oxide was prepared via anodic oxidation of dispersed graphite, and the efficiency of its use as an electrode material for a supercapacitor was evaluated. In an alcohol suspension, the thickness of multilayer graphene oxide particles was less than 0.1 &mu;m with an area of more than 100 &mu; sq m. The multilayer graphene oxide electrode had a high specific capacity of 107 F/g and a high charge retention rate of 97% after 5000 cycles at a current of 2 A/g. The multilayer graphene oxide electrode demonstrated a maximum specific energy of 8.7 W h/kg at a current density of 0.1 A/g and a maximum power of 2291.1 W/kg at a current density of 4 A/g. The impedance data at various DC voltages showed that after 5000 cycles, the charge transfer resistance increases by 26%. With these properties, synthesized multilayer graphene oxide is a promising electrode material for producing a symmetric supercapacitor.
