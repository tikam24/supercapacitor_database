Energy storage devices and systems are playing a major role in all electrical systems from small electronics devices and automotive systems to the utility grid. The main objective of this article is to review energy storage devices, management, control, interface, and demonstrations for electrical power systems. Various types of energy storage systems are discussed, but the main focus is on batteries and ultracapacitors. Different types of batteries and their electrical models are explained. Three major types of ultracapcitors are also discussed. The battery management system and its functions, controls, and hardware are discussed. Various power electronics-based interface systems for battery and ultracapcitor charging and discharging are presented. Applications of energy storage systems for utility applications, including renewable firming, power shifting, and ancillary services, are discussed.
