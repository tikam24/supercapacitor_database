This paper proposes a control algorithm for photovoltaic hybrid power system with a supercapacitor storage device and an energy management of AC distributed system supplied by a hybrid source that uses supercapacitor (SC) as secondary source, in association with a photovoltaic (PV) as the main source. In this power plant, the PV (1.5 kW) is used as the main source to supply power to the load and charge the SC, and the SC (41 F, 192 V) functions as an secondary power source to regulate the AC output voltage and control system performance when electrical loads demand high energy in a short time. The experimental results presented that the control algorithm of the hybrid power system can work efficiently.
