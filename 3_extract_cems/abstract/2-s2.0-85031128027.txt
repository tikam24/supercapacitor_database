Rapid improvement of wearable electronics stimulates the demands for the matched functional devices and energy storage devices. Meanwhile, wearable microsystem requires every parts possessing high compressibility to accommodate large-scale mechanical deformations and complex conditions. In this work, a general carbon nanotube–polydimethylsiloxane (CNT–PDMS) sponge electrode is fabricated as the elementary component of the compressible system. CNT–PDMS sponge performs high sensitivity as a piezoresistance sensor, which is capable of detecting stress repeatedly and owns great electrochemical performance as a compressible supercapacitor which maintains stably under compressive strains, respectively. Assembled with the piezoresistance sensor and the compressible supercapacitor, such highly compressible integrated system can power and modulate the low-power electronic devices reliably. More importantly, attached to the epidermal skin or clothes, it can detect human motions, ranging from speech recognition to breathing record, thus showing feasibility in real-time health monitor and human–machine interfaces.
