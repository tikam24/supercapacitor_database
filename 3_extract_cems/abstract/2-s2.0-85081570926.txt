The demand for energy and energy storage devices is the urgent need of our society due to heavy dependence on electric appliances. Hence, the demand of graphene-like smart materials has grown tremendously in the past years. Herein, we investigated the binder-free graphene allies named reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as electrode materials for the supercapacitor after the reduction of graphene oxide by sinking and leaving process. The rGO-based devices show the areal specific capacitance of 80.2 and 7.89 mF cmâˆ’2 with aqueous 1M phosphoric acid (H3PO4) and poly (vinyl alcohol)-H3PO4 polymer gel electrolytes, respectively, over the graphite sheet.
