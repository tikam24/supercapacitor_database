Herein, we developed a flexible and high-energy dense, solid-state supercapacitor with a yarn-like geometry. In our approach, conductive Ni was sputtered on oxidized carbon nanotubes-coated cotton yarn templates, which were directly used as functional electrodes to construct the supercapacitor. The as-prepared device offered a remarkable specific capacitance of 258.47 mF/cm2 and a superior energy density of 51.7 Î¼Wh/cm2. The device retained long-term cyclic stability after 5000 cycles of use, with a negligible reduction of electrochemical performance observed under severe bending states. The functional device has great potential to be embedded as a high-performing storage device for versatile miniaturized electronics.
