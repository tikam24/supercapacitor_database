Flexible supercapacitors have potential for wearable energy storage due to their high energy/power densities and long operating lifetimes. High electrochemical performance with robust mechanical properties is highly desired for flexible supercapacitor electrodes. Usually, the mechanical properties are improved by choosing high flexible textile substrates but at the much expense of electrochemical performance due to the nonideal contact between conductive materials and textile substrates. Herein, the authors present an efficient, scalable, and general strategy for the simultaneous fabrication of high-performance textile electrodes and yarn electrodes. It is interesting to find that the conformal reduced graphene oxide (RGO) layer is uniformly and successively painted on the surface of SnCl2 modified polyester fibers (M-PEF) via a repeated “dyeing and drying” strategy. The large-area textile electrodes and ultralong yarn electrodes are fabricated by using RGO/M-PEF as substrate with subsequent deposition of polypyrrole. This work provides new opportunities for developing high flexible textile electrodes and yarn electrodes with further increased electrochemical performance and scalable production.
