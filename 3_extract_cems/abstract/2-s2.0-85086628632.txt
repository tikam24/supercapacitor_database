The electrical energy storage is an factor which plays an important role from the era of electrical energy generation. The only option available for storage for a very long period were different form of electro-chemical energy storage device known as battery. But now an amalgamation of electrostatic device with chemical element is available for storage known as Ultra-capacitor (UC). Both the devices store the electrical energy in DC. The battery have high energy density while the UC have high power density. In case of smart grid the energy generated is varying due to the different environment conditions. This varying of energy supply from the smart grid to the battery and from the battery to the load reduces the reliability of the system. The Hybrid Energy Storage system (HESS) can provide reliability by providing the energy to the load from battery and UC. An electric vehicle (EV) is the emerging trend in automobile sector. HES installed in EV will increase the reliability of the vehicle energy storage system. The simulation results provided validates the above statement by providing the power for a 2 kW load with transients in it.
