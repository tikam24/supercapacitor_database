Recently, metal molybdates have drawn significant attention due to their excellent electrochemical properties and remarkable performances in various fields, especially for supercapacitors. The rod-like α-MnMoO4 crystallites were designed and synthesized via a microwave-assisted hydrothermal process followed by annealing and used as electrode materials for supercapacitors. The effects of different microwave reaction time on the electrochemical properties of samples were investigated. The formation of nanorods and the microwave heating mechanism involved were introduced. Thorough characterization of the electrochemical properties was performed, and the results demonstrated the extraordinary supercapacitor properties with a high specific capacitance (446.7 F g−1 at current densities of 1 mA cm−2), excellent rate capability, and superior cycling stability (81.12% retained after 3000 cycles at 8 mA cm−2). This work provided a rapid, facile, and environment-friendly strategy for active molybdates material synthesis and outlined the superior electrochemical properties of rod-like α-MnMoO4 crystallites and its great potential in supercapacitor applications.
