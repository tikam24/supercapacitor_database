Phosphorus in energy storage has received widespread attention in recent years. Both the high specific capacity and ion mobility of phosphorus may lead to a breakthrough in energy storage materials. Black phosphorus, an allotrope of phosphorus, has a sheet-like structure similar to graphite. In this review, we describe the structure and properties of black phosphorus and characteristics of the conductive electrode material, including theoretical calculation and analysis. The research progress in various ion batteries, including lithium-sulfur batteries, lithiumâ€“air batteries, and supercapacitors, is summarized according to the introduction of black phosphorus materials in different electrochemical applications. Among them, with the introduction of black phosphorus in lithium-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries, the research on the properties of black phosphorus and carbon composite is introduced. Based on the summary, the future development trend and potential of black phosphorus materials in the field of electrochemistry are analyzed.
