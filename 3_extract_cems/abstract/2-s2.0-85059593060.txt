Advanced energy storage devices are becoming more important with the development of the ever-increasing demand for energy consumption and worse environmental problems. Resorcinol-formaldehyde based carbon aerogels (RF-CAs) are considered to be a promising candidate for advanced energy storage, owing to their low density, high electrical conductivity, high porosity and chemical inertness, etc. It has been found that numerous researches have focused on the preparations of RF-CAs (such as polymerization process, drying method, carbonization temperature and activation modes, etc.) and their applications in energy storage devices. However, systematic investigations into the surface chemistry, microstructure and applications of RF-CAs are rarely documented. Herein, this review has summarized the recent progress in tailoring RF-CAs toward supercapacitors and other advanced energy storage, such as lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries and lithium sulfur batteries. Additionally, we put an emphasis on the physico-chemical principles of synthesis strategies and specific illustration of structure-performance relationship. Finally, some hints on the challenges and opportunities for RF-CAs which can provide the further fundamental understanding and extend the practical applications in energy storage have been given in this review as well.
