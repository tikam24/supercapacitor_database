Core-shell structured carbon nanofibers embedded with various amounts of non-covalently functionalized graphene were fabricated by single-nozzle electrospinning technique using phase-separated solution of polyacrylonitrile and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PAN/PVP) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). The concentration of graphene varied from 0 wt% to 15 wt% (relative to PAN). These core-shell structured electrospun nanofibers were first stabilized at 250°C in air and consecutively carbonized at 850°C in nitrogen atmosphere. The resulting ultra-fine fibers possessed average fiber diameters in the range of 60-80 nm. These nanofibers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and nitrogen adsorption at 77 K. The specific surface area and pore volume increased to 627 m2 g-1 and 0.35 cm3 g-1 respectively by embedding graphene nanosheets. The electrochemical performance of the CNF/G composites were investigated in 6M KOH electrolyte by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge. Electrochemical measurements of CNF/G nanofibers exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 265 F g-1 after addition of 10 wt% graphene nanosheets.
