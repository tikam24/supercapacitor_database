Two dimensional (2D) layered materials have recently attracted significant research interest owing to their unique physical and chemical properties for efficient electrochemical energy storage devices. Here, we present a neoteric approach to fabricate high performance MoS2 thin film supercapacitor electrodes by using a direct magnetron sputtering technique. The novel three-dimensional (3D) porous structure of the MoS2 film exhibits an excellent capacitance of âˆ¼330 F cm-3 along with a high volumetric power and energy density of 40-80 W cm-3 and 1.6-2.4 mW h cm-3, respectively. Moreover, the optimized MoS2 electrode shows an outstanding cyclic stability, yielding capacitance retention over 97% after 5000 cycles of charging/discharging. The contemporary approach to MoS2 supercapacitor electrode fabrication will enable new opportunities in flexible electronic and energy devices.
