In this paper, the topologies for battery power management using the boost converters and the super capacitors have been modelled and explained with various advantages and the best topology is defined and simulated using solar radiation as input. This battery power management topologies are designed in HEV using a DC motor-generator set which is connected to the wheels of the vehicle which will rotate the rotor wheel irrespective of the speed and sudden jerks in the system, which makes it a better and more accurate vehicle system than the existing one. One can use this system in renewable energy-based vehicle systems which makes it low in cost and more advantageous.
