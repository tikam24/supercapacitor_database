Electrodeposition of the layered manganese oxide was conducted in a colloidal crystal template formed by self-assembly of polystyrene particles on an indium tin oxide substrate. The resulting macroporous film exhibited good pseudocapacitive behavior in neutral electrolyte, as a result of contributions of the surface of macropores and the interlayer space of the multilayered structure.
