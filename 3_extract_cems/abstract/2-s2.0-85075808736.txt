Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have received extensive research attention as an electrode material for supercapacitors. Current application of TMPs as electrodes is restricted by their limited electrochemical reaction activity and electrical conductivity. Herein, we report an effective strategy for fabricating highly porous oxygen doped NiCo-phosphides (O–NiCoP) immobilized in reduced graphene oxide network (O–NiCoP@rGO). The control of phosphorization degree is studied in this paper. Abundant interior and surface channels are created in O–NiCoP particles, leading to easy electrolyte infiltration and facilitated redox reaction kinetics. In addition, the rGO nanosheets functioned in providing continuous electron pathways and buffering interior stress of the electrode during redox reactions. The Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveals that the band gap can be eliminated during phosphorization, and the charge accumulation can be produced at the interface gap between graphene and O–NiCoP (001) plane after the introduction of graphene. The O–NiCoP@rGO electrode demonstrates superior capacitive performance with a remarkable capacitance of 1663.2 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and high capacitance retention of 89.3% after 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1. Asymmetrical supercapacitors (ASCs) are also prepared demonstrating a high energy density of 21 Wh·kg−1 at a power density of 775 W kg−1 and predominant cycling performance (91.0% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 2 A g−1). The ASCs are used to light up LED bulbs and a mobile phone, further demonstrating its superior performance.
