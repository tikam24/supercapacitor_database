Here we report a nanohybrid of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets at which monodispersed starburst carbon spheres (MSCSs) are intercalated for the use in high-performance supercapacitor electrodes. MSCSs that have large electrolyte ions-accessible surface area enlarge the interspacing between rGO nanosheets as a result of intercalation so that a hybrid electrode can increasingly form electrical double layers that store energy. Such electrode organization provides facilitated transport paths for both electron and ion. The volumetric capacitance of the hybrid electrode is 25 F cm−3 that is obtained at a constant current of 0.073 A cm−3, at least 2.5-fold greater than that of rGO electrode. The hybrid electrode also shows a good rate-retention capability of 81% as specific currents change from 0.073 to 1.5 A cm−3. The initial capacitance of the hybrid electrode remains unchanged, nearly 100% for at least 5000 charge/discharge cycles. The electrode also delivers high energy density, 1.7 × 10−3 Wh cm−3, and power density, 2.7 W cm−3.
