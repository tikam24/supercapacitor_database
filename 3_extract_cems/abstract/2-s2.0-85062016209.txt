Aqueous Li-ion capacitors (ALICs) have been extensively studied in recent years due to their safety, environmental friendliness and low availability. In this paper, we constructed an ALIC using carboncoated lithium iron phosphate (LFP) as the positive electrode, activated reduced graphene oxide as the negative electrode and studied its electrochemical performance in 1MLi2SO4 electrolyte. Here, coating of LFP particles is carried out by dopamine polymerization to form a uniform carbon layer on the surface of the particles, which increases the conductivity and cycle performance of LFP. The optimal ALIC can achieve 82.8 F g-1 (based on the total mass of the positive and negative materials) at a current density of 0.2 A g-1, and shows good cycling stability. The specific capacitance can still retain 73% of the initial value after 1000 charge and discharge cycles. The specific energy density can reach 11.5Whkg-1 at a power density of 100Wkg-1.
