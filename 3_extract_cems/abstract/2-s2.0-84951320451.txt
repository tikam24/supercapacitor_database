Through the effective combination of energy storage technologies, distributed generations, load and various controllers, Microgrid is energy-efficient and could realize the independent control. Microgrid is an important direction for the development of future grid. Microgrid is now actively promoted all over the world. Its technical requirements of operation control and protection have not been standardized. This paper focuses on the research of transient power quality analysis for Microgrid, and power quality analysis for the switching operations control of Microgrid. Based on the existing mature control technique, the transient process of the energy storage technologies in Microgrid under fault conditions is studied. The model of the super-capacitors energy storage devices is established. The power quality improvement of the energy storage system on power system in fault condition and switching operations is discussed. At the last, simulation results in PSCAD show that the energy storage devices can effectively improve the transient power quality of the system.
