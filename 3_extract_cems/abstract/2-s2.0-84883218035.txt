In comparison with graphene sheets, graphene quantum dots (GQDs) exhibit novel chemical/physical properties including nanometer-size, abundant edge defects, good electrical conductivity, high mobility, chemical inertia, stable photoluminescence and better surface grafting, making them promising for fabricating various novel devices. In the present work, an asymmetric micro-supercapacitor, using GQDs as negative active material and polyaniline (PANI) nanofibers as positive active material, is built for the first time by a simple and controllable two-step electro-deposition on interdigital finger gold electrodes. Electrochemical measurements reveal that the as-made GQDs//PANI asymmetric micro-supercapacitor has a more excellent rate capability (up to 1000 V s-1) than previously reported electrode materials, as well as faster power response capability (with a very short relaxation time constant of 115.9 μs) and better cycling stability after 1500 cycles in aqueous electrolyte. On this basis, an all-solid-state GQDs//PANI asymmetric micro-supercapacitor is fabricated using H3PO4-polyvinyl alcohol gel as electrolyte, which also exhibits desirable electrochemical capacitive performances. These encouraging results presented here may open up new insight into GQDs with highly promising applications in high-performance energy-storage devices, and further expand the potential applications of GQDs beyond the energy-oriented application of GQDs discussed above. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
