Supercapacitors proved to be significant power storage devices. Their high storage density, long shelf-life and reduced wear/cycle ratio promise efficient battery technologies soon. Recent advances in material science demonstrate that carbon-based composites enable enhanced performance of supercapacitors. The abundant availability of carbon composites has led a spike in the interest of researchers to take a deep look at their underlying properties that help bring up commercially viable supercapacitor technologies. In addition, the exceptional charge retention capacity and conductivity of the carbon based materials (CNTs and grapheme) trigged the researchers to use these materials in supercapacitors fabrication. In this detailed review, synthesis of carbon-based anode materials and their performance have been considered and relative examination is done. Various carbon-based composites have been analyzed based on existing research for understanding supercapacitors performance in terms of cyclic stability, shelf-life energy storage capacity and applicable to various applications. This detailed review also acknowledges the challenges and constraints in material synthesis and device fabrication.
