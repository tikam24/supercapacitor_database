As more and more lithium ion batteries are scrap to recycle in recent years, developing high-efficient recycling method is crucial and urgent. In this paper, LiCoO2 wastes are employed and the cobalt source is recycled as an active material for supercapacitor, while the lithium source can be recycled as Li2CO3. The recycled CoS exhibits a 3D flower-like morphology and superb electrochemical capacity can be obtained due to the unique structure. This method can provide a new thinking to battery recycling, which can be also applied to other battery wastes.
