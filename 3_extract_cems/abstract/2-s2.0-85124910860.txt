Electric vehicles based on fuel cells as a primary energy source (FCEV-Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle) need one or several secondary energy sources to supply energy to the electrical motor that propels the vehicle. This is due to the reduced dynamic response and limitations in the energy flow direction of the fuel cells. Therefore, to optimize the whole system control, it is mandatory to study different control architectures to reduce fuel consumption and improving system performance. In this paper, different state-of-the-art control architectures are studied, and several new ones are proposed. Through simulation, all architectures are compared to find variations in the behavior, advantages, and disadvantages, and thus, distinguish which control architecture responds optimally for this type of system.
