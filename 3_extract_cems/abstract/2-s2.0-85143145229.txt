Graphene is a new 2D material which can be applied in supercapacitors and metal-ion batteries. However, the restacking of graphene, which is inevitable due to the Van der Wales forces between layers, severely deteriorates the properties of graphene. Fortunately, the graphene-based composites with elaborate structural construction can exert superior synergistic effects. This short review introduces the preparation methods of the assembly of graphene with 0D nanodots, 1D nanotubes, 2D nanosheets and 3D bulk particulates and their electrochemical properties for supercapacitors and metal-ion batteries. The typical examples include TiO2 nanodots/graphene for lithium-ion batteries, 1D activated carbon arrays/graphene, 2D MXene/graphene for supercapacitors and 3D soft carbon/graphene for Li-ion supercapatteries. This review also estimates the prospective and development trend of these graphene-based composites with diverse structures.
