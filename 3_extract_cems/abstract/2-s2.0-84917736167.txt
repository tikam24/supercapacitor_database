Highly uniform NiCl2 nanorods were synthesized successfully via recrystallization and employed as electrode materials for super capacitors applications. The water-soluble Ni/NiCl2 electrode proves to show typical pseudocapacitive characteristics and delivers a very high specific capacitance of 1182.7 F g-1 at 2 A g-1. The charge storage and conversion process initiates from the chemically combination of Ni2+ and OH-, and maintains a reversible redox reaction of Ni(II) è™  Ni(III) on the electrode. It opens a new insight into the fabrication of multifarious water-soluble inorganic salts for super capacitors applications using the ionic electro negativity parameter as the theoretical guideline.
