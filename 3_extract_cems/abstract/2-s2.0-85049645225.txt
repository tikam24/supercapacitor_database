Inspired by people to make flour food, a one-pot, low-cost, green and environmental friendly gas foaming strategy is adopted here to prepare the three-dimensional hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) by introducing NaHCO3 as foaming and activation agent. During the pyrolysis process, the CO2 gas produced during the transforms from NaHCO3 into Na2CO3 will resulted in the producers of the macro-pores and meso-pores, meanwhile, the as-produced Na2CO3 further reactor with the carbon intermediate at a high temperature, and finally result in forming a micro-pores porous structure. Such intimate structural interconnectivities provide three-dimensional continuous pathway for electron rapid transfer and the interconnected pores allow for the ion to penetrate and evenly contact the electrode material quickly. The electrochemical performance of HPC exhibits a high specific capacitance of 350 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and outstanding electrochemical stability with capacitance retention up to 97% after 10,000 cycles. Moreover, the as-assembled symmetric supercapacitor exhibits an ultrahigh energy density of 27.4 Wh kg−1, much higher than most of carbon-based supercapacitors. These results demonstrate a straightforward environment friendly method to mass-produce economical, robust carbon materials as promising candidates for supercapacitor application.
