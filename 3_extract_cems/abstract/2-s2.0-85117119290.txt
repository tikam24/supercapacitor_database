Energy Internet is the backbone to develop the future power grid by integrating the smart grid with the Internet while embracing the transportation network and profit-oriented economics. Here, we propose a concept of wireless energy trading through traffic energy router(s). Critical road junctions and roadways will be electrified to become wireless energy routers for relaying, uploading, or downloading the wireless energy packages, in response to the energy equilibrium, surplus, or shortage. Traffic networks can upgrade into a flexible energy Internet involving no physical cables. Apart from serving as green transportation, mobile electric vehicles trade energy packages among themselves or with wireless energy routers so as to get arbitrage from the energy market, distribute power in the traffic energy Internet, and deliver power from renewable energy plants. Besides immediate payments, the membership system with private accounts allows users to deposit or withdraw energy at the traffic routers while earning interest. We also implement a 1.1-kW prototype and verify various economic scenarios of online wireless energy trading.
