In order to improve the charging speed, the Supercapacitor is used as the energy storage device in wireless power transfer (WPT) systems applied to electic vehicles. The analysis of WPT with Supercapacitor as load was carried out and charging strategy of Supercapacitor was studied on in this paper. In order to improve the transmission efficiency of the system , the reference value of the primary coil current and the Supercapacitor charging current are proposed considering the factors such as the phase-shift angle, the duty cycle, the system efficiency and so on. At the same time, based on the studies of primary and secondary circuit, design controllers in primary and secondary sides, and verify the control strategy by using PSIM simulation software and the 1kW experimental platform.
