Large-area α-MnO2 nanoflower arrays are synthesized by using a facile and template-free electrochemical deposition on flexible graphite paper. These nanoflower arrays exhibit a high specific capacitance of 314Fg-1 at a current density of 1Ag-1 with remarkable rate capability (61.1% retention at 40Ag-1) and excellent cycle stability. Furthermore, the fabricated flexible symmetric supercapacitor also displays good performance and flexibility. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH
