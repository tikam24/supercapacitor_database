In recent year, flexible energy storage materials have attracted extensive attention in portable and wearable devices. Supercapacitors are considered as promising devices for flexible energy storage equipments, owning to their advantages of high power density, good cycle stability and safe operation. Electrode materials play a key role in the performance of supercapacitors. As a two-dimensional transition metal carbide, MXene is widely used in flexible supercapacitor electrodes because of its excellent energy storage performance and flexibility. In this paper, MXene nanosheets were adsorbed on the surface of acidified carbon fibers by freeze-drying. By controlling the acidification time, the number of immersion times and the concentration of MXene suspension solution, the changes in the microscopic physical and chemical structure of carbon fibers under different treatment conditions were compared via SEM, FT-IR, XRD and other methods. At the same time, the energy storage performance of carbon fiber composite electrode under different treatment conditions was compared and analyzed by electrochemical test. The results show that MXene nanosheets can be firmly and effectively attached to the surface of carbon fibers by properly controlling the acidification time, soaking times and suspension concentration, thus effectively improving the electrochemical energy storage effect of the composite electrode. Under suitable treatment conditions, the specific capacitance of carbon fiber composite electrode can reach 70.9 F/g, and the specific capacitance of symmetrical supercapacitor assembled is 12.8 F/g, which is 6 times that of ablated CF supercapacitor.
