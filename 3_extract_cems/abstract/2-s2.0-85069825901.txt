In this paper, Copper Phthalocyanine (CuPc) nanostructures are the focus of an electrochemical investigation. This Phthalocyanine is nitrogen enriched having metal redox centers that facilitate the redox reaction. CuPc nanowires are synthesized by a simple room temperature process from bulk CuPc powder and their electrochemical properties are explored for the first time. The as prepared samples are characterized by X-ray Diffraction, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, etc. They are then tested electrochemically in a three electrode system. Cyclic voltammogram (CV) and charge discharge (CD) profiles have been recorded. The CuPc nanowire electrode exhibits 406 F/g capacitance at 5 mVSâˆ’1 scan rate and 260 F/g at 0.3 A/g current density. Long cycling stability up to 3000 cycles at 6 A/g has been carried out. The results show that this material can be used as the potential candidate for positive electrode in supercapacitor applications.
