MXene is a neoteric type of bidimensional (2D) transition metal carbide/nitride with broad application prospects, in particular with electrochemical energy storage. The electrochemical performance of MXene is unsatisfactory because it is easy to stack resulting in the difficulty of electrolyte penetration and ion transport. In this study, the cobaltous sulfide-modified 3D MXene/N-doped carbon foam (CoS@MXene/CF) hybrid aerogel is projected and manufactured via simple in situ growth and thermal annealing strategies. The capacitance of the as-fabricated 300-CMC-31:1 electrode material reaches 250 F g-1 (1 A g-1), which is obviously higher than those of MXene, CoS@CF, 400-CMC-31:1, 300-CMC-10:1, 300-CMC-50:1, CF, and MXene/CF electrode materials. Moreover, it can hold 97.5% of the original capacitance after 10,000 cycles and the internal resistance (Rs) is only 0.50 Ï‰. A green bulb can be lit by two all-solid asymmetric supercapacitors installed in series. The prepared CoS@MXene/CF hybrid aerogel exhibits promising potential for practical application in energy storage areas.
