In today's nanoscale regime, new electronics technology such as smartphones, sensors, and personal healthcare devices has been increased and thus requires emerging developments in terms of flexible and sustainable energy storage devices as power sources. Indeed, the power and the energy densities should be safe, reliable, low-cost, and eco-friendly within the highly integrated systems in the human body. Therefore, the use of biomass wastes to ensure the ecological and cost-effective aspect presents an alternative strategy in the field of electrochemical energy storage. In this context, activated carbon derived from coffee wastes, was used as an active material for the elaboration of high performances textile-based Electric Double Layer Capacitors (EDLC). A quasi-solid-state electrolyte has been integrated to guarantee the flexibility and light weight criteria, as well as high operating potential (2V) which allows reaching high energy densities. The textile-based device was characterized and modeled using equivalent electrical circuits. The as prepared supercapacitor exhibits a specific capacitance of 80 mF/g, an energy and power densities of 5.36 mWh/Kg and 4.87 W/Kg respectively. This process followed the choice of cost-effective materials such as activated carbon from biomass precursor and polyvinyl alcohol would make it particularly viable for such daily and industrial applications in large-scale production to store clean, reliable, and modern energies at an affordable cost.
