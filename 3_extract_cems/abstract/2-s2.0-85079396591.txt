Four new coordination polymers based on heterocyclic nitrogen and aromatic carboxylic acids, namely [Co(L1)(2,5-TDC)(H2O)]n (1), [Co(L1)(1,3-BDC)]n (2), [Cu(L2)(1,4-NDC)]n (3), and [Mn(L2)2(2-AIOC)(H2O)]n (4) [L1 = 3,6-bis(1H-imidazol-1-yl)pyridazine, L2 = 3,6-bis(1H-benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl) pyridazine, 1,2-H2TDC = 2,5-thiophenedicarboxylic acid, 1,3-H2BDC = benzenedicarboxylic acid, 1,4-H2NDC = 1,4-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, 2-H2AIOC = 2-aminoterephthalic acid] have been hydro-/solvothermally prepared and further characterized. 1 and 2 show 2D plane structure which belong to typical sql and sp topological net, respectively. 3 is a six-connected 3D framework with a pcu topological net and 4 belongs to a 3D supramolecular structure constructed via hydrogen bonds. Magnetic tests revealed that 1–3 presence the antiferromagnetic behavior, while 4 displays a ferrimagnetic behavior. The electrochemical measurements explained that 3 possesses excellent cycling stability that it can retain about 91.1% of original capacitance after cycling 10,000 times at 3 A g−1 in 2 mol L−1 KOH aqueous electrolyte.
