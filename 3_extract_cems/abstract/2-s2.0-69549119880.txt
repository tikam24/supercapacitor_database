We engineered the number of stacking layers of multilayer graphene sheets by selective post-treatments. The most probable number of layers of graphene was determined according to specific surface area. The interfacial capacitance of multilayer graphene sheets relates to the number of layers. This result is attributed to the dependence of space charge layer capacitance on the number of layers. Â© 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
