This paper describes the developed complex of vacuum thin-film technologies for creating electrode materials of energy storage devices for an intelligent source of accumulation, storage and transportation of electricity. Thin-film technologies, in contrast to thick-film technologies, allow more efficient use of surface properties, using nanostructured materials and structures. The developed complex allows us to implement a promising technology for creating a new generation of electrode materials based on a flexible carbon matrix with a highly developed surface. On the basis of the developed electrode material, hybrid capacitors were manufactured and studied, the specific energy of which is currently ∼ 20 W•h/kg, which is a higher indicator than the currently available indicators in the literature. The article also discusses ways to increase the energy intensity to ∼ 50 W•h/kg.
