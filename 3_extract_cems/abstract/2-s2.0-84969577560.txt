High-performance reduced graphene oxide/nickel foam (rGO/NF) composite electrodes for high-performance supercapacitors were prepared by flame-induced reduction of dry graphene oxide (GO) coated on nickel foam. Flame reduction of GO is a facile, feasible and cost-effective reduction technique, which is conducted without the need of any reductant. Most importantly, the rGO obtained by flame reduction showed a typical disordered cross-linking network and randomly distributed pores, which provide accessible routes for fast transportation of ions. It was demonstrated that the rGO/NF electrode with embedded current collector (NF) exhibited better electrochemical performance than conventional rGO film counterparts, including a high gravimetric specific capacitance of 228.6 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1, excellent rate capability (over 81% retention at 32 A g-1) and high cycling stability with only 5.3% capacitance decay over 10,000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry at a ultrahigh scan rate of 1000 mV s-1. This facile method for the fabrication of rGO/NF electrodes could envision enormous potential for high performance energy storage devices.
