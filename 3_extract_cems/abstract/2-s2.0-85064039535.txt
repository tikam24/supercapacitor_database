Two types of ultrathin-flaky δ-MnO2 electrode materials (denoted as δ-MnO2-A and δ-MnO2-B) were synthesized through the reduction of potassium permanganate with manganese acetate and ethanol separately.The crystalline structure, chemical component, microstructure and pore size distribution of these nano-materials were determined by XRD, XPS, SEM/TEM and BET analysis.The electrochemical test demonstrates two δ-MnO2 electrode materials own similar specific capacitance and rate capability.Comparing to δ-MnO2-A, however, electrode material δ-MnO2-B contains a higher potassium and manganese vacancy content, and the lamellar structure of δ-MnO2-B is more legible and stable, therefore it displays a much more superior cycling stability.In 0.5mol/L Na2SO4 electrolyte, the specific capacitance of δ-MnO2 reaches 227F•g-1(1mV•s-1) and the capacitance retention rate is achieved 87.6% after 5000 cycles at 100mV•s-1.
