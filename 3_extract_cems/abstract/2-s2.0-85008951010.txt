Nanosized MnO2 for supercapacitor electrode materials was synthesized by hydrothermal method using KMnO4 and MnSO4 as raw materials. Microstructure and supercapacitor properties of the MnO2 samples were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, N2 physical adsorption, cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance. The results show that α-MnO2 nanowires with diameters of 10-90 nm and lengths of 1-3 cm are synthesized by hydrothermally treating at different temperatures. The hydrothermal temperature has a great effect on the grain size and morphology of the MnO2 nanowires, but little effect on crystal type of MnO2.With the hydrothermal temperature increasing, the grain size of MnO2 nanowires can grow up and the nanowires become longer and thicker, which result in the decline of specific surface areas gradually. The specific capacitance of the MnO2 sample shows a trend of increase first and then decreases. When the hydrothermal temperature is 140℃, the specific capacitance of the MnO2 sample can reach to the maximum, which is 227 F/g, and show good rate performance.
