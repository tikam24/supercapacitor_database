A tremella-like NiCo 2 O 4 @graphene quantum dots (GQDs) composite is prepared where the tremella-like NiCo 2 O 4 is homogeneously encapsulated by GQDs. Herein, the GQDs based on π-conjugated core with abundant edge sites, make NiCo 2 O 4 favorable for advanced electric energy storage (EES). In terms of the synergistic effect between the conductive GQDs and tremella-like NiCo 2 O 4 , the as prepared NiCo 2 O 4 @GQDs composite exhibits an excellent specific capacitance of 1242 F g −1 at 30 A g −1 in 2.0 M KOH electrolytes, much higher than that of pristine NiCo 2 O 4 (790 F g −1 at 30 A g −1 ). Also, it manifests outstanding cycle stability (99% capacitance retention after 4000 cycles). Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is assembled by pairing NiCo 2 O 4 @GQDs composite as positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as negative electrode (NiCo 2 O 4 @GQDs//AC), and its specific energy density is as high as 38 W h kg −1 at a power density of 800 W kg −1 .
