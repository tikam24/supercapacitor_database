Rapid growths of miniaturized electronic flexible device–based supercapacitors attract tremendous attention because of its excellent foldable or bendable and stretchable physical properties. The driving force for the flexible and wearable supercapacitors (FWSCs) is to hold high power density, good cyclic stability, high efficiency, and ease in fabrication process. Furthermore, the essential requirement for FWSCs is to retain the electrochemical properties and lightweight power sources during the states of bending or stretching. Owing to the unique features such as good electrical and mechanical properties, long theoretical specific surface area of over 2600m2 g−1, and excellent electrochemical stability, graphene has been used as electrode material in the field of FWSCs. The flexible two-dimensional structure of graphene nanosheets allows constructing thin films and fiber-like nanostructures with good mechanical stability. Herein, the recent advancements resulting in various graphene composite–based electrode materials in the domain of FWSC devices are briefly discussed in this chapter.
