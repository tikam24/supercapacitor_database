The highly uniform Co3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized by a low temperature solution process at 70 Â°C and utilized for pseudo-supercapacitors. The synthesized Co3O4 NPs possessed well-crystalline semispherical morphology and were extensively characterized in terms of structural, crystalline and electrochemical properties. The synthesized Co3O4 NPs based electrode exhibited a reasonable specific capacitance of ~304 F/g in 1 M KOH aqueous solution. The capacitance was drastically increased to ~480 F/g when the electrode was prepared by mixing Co3O4 NPs and super-P carbon. Co3O4 NPs based electrodes attained the excellent cycling stability with the retention ratio of ~88.6% after 1000 cycles.
