The widespread demand in satisfying human desires entails huge energy consumption. In response, potential impact toward the energy storage tool plays an essential role in constant energy supply. In this work, bimetallic ZnSe–CoSe2 electrode material was designed owing to its low pollution, high chemical stability, and theoretical capacity for supercapacitor applications. The basic characterization confirmed the formation of structural, morphological, and phase purity of the as prepared composite. The prologue of agglomerated CoSe2 microcubes into ZnSe pyramidal structure and synergetic effect of the individual component comprises multifunctionalities during redox progression attributable to greater structural potency. The rigid contact stuck between pyramidal structured ZnSe and CoSe2 agglomerated microcubes favors the regular contact with the electrolyte for prompt ion diffusion. These fine advantageous properties notably endows with greater charge storage progression demonstrating the active construction of ZnSe–CoSe2 heterostructures. The prepared product delivered 645 Fg−1specific capacitance at 1Ag−1 in half cell configuration and exhibited the capacity retention of 99.6% at 10Ag−1, retained over 5000 cycles. In addition, the assembled full cell showed 57 Whkg−1energy density at 743 Wkg−1power density and opens up a new way to access the progress of high performance supercapacitor with specific capacitance of 184 Fg−1 and retaining long life span of 93.3% at 10 Ag−1 after 5000 cycles. Finally, two cells in series owns a high working potential of 1.92 V and effectively burn up light emitting diode (LED) indicating their potential function in energy storage device.
