Uniform discrete cage-like nitrogen-doped hollow porous carbon spheres (CN-HPCS) with tunable direct large mesoporous (18–30 nm) have been successfully synthesized for the first time by using the carboxylated polystyrene spheres and silica particles as a dual-template and dopamine as the carbon and nitrogen sources. When they are used as the electrode for supercapacitors, these CN-HPCS exhibit a high specific capacitance of 257 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 and 194 F g −1 at 10 A g −1 with excellent rate capability and cycling stability.
