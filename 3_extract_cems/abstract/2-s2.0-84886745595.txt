Herein, we report on electrochemical doping of a conducting polymer (CP) with anionically modified graphene nanosheets. The architecture built from reduced graphene oxide (rGO) skeleton skinned by polypyrrole (pPy) enhanced supercapacitor performances especially at high discharge rates superior to those of the same CP with a conventional dopant: e.g., from 141 to 280Fg-1 at 1000C equivalent to ~50Ag-1. At relatively low rates, the graphene-doped pPy reached the theoretical capacitance of pPy, indicating efficient use of whole electroactive mass. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
