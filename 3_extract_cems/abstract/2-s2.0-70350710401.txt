This paper proposes an equivalent circuit which characterizes the dynamic supercapacitor behavior over a wide charge and discharge frequency range (0-1 kHz). The model takes into account the actual frequency response of the device. In addition, a new simple procedure, based on a constant current charge, to identify the circuit parameters is presented. Simulation results for power applications are presented and analyzed, with particular attention paid to efficiency and the amount of energy available from supercapacitors under different operating conditions.
