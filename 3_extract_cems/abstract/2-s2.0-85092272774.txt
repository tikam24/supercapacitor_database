Abstract: The effect of modification of a porous carbon material used to manufacture supercapacitors with a polymeric cobalt complex with a Salen-type Schiff base on the capacity of the material has been studied. Conjunction of multielectron redox processes in the polymer with the proposed effective modification technology makes it possible to increase the electrode capacity by 2.4 times in comparison with unmodified carbon electrodes. The specific capacity of the polymer poly-[Co(CH3OSaltmen)] at a polymer deposition density of 1.3 mg cm–2 was 170 mA h g–1.
