The purpose of the presented work is the development of relaxation-based supercapacitor charge control method and system architecture. The methods of supercapacitor equivalent capacitance calculation are investigated. The convolution-based method is selected in accordance with the results of relaxation characteristics analysis. The digital twin of supercapacitor is used for prediction of the complicated dynamics of supercapacitor relaxation processes. The proposed digital twin architecture includes fractional-order model which allows accurate prediction of supercapacitor relaxation dynamics without significant computational costs. The proposed charge control method and system architecture provide increase of the energy stored in supercapacitor regarding to the relaxation process prediction which can reduce the errors of DC-DC converter switching duty cycle.
