Composites of graphene and SnO2 were successfully prepared by a single step simultaneous synthesis of SnO2 and reduction of graphene oxide (GO). Three different compositions of precursor solution resulted in different composite materials containing graphene and SnO2. The reaction was realized by microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) gave insight into the morphology and composition of the obtained materials. Good capacitive//pseudocapacitive properties of the obtained material suitable for supercapacitor application were registered by cyclic voltammetry, from where specific capacitance values up to 93 F g-1 were determined.
