Towards the introduction of fast faradaic pseudocapacitive behavior and the increase of the specific capacitance of carbon-based electrodes. Herein, ternary composites GO@NiMn-LDO@MnO2 are fabricated via two-step hydrothermal method. In addition, the hydrothermal reaction time is also investigated during the process of loading the MnO2. Finally, a series of electrochemical tests show that the electrochemical performance has been improved after the introduction of manganese dioxide. Furthermore, the complex with a hydrothermal reaction for 9 h reduces the degree of agglomeration, and its specific capacitance reached 689F g−1 at the current density of 0.5 A g−1. After 5000 cycles, the capacitance retention is 73%, indicative of its good cycling stability.
