Flower-like WO3·H2O/reduced graphene oxide composites have been successfully synthesized through a mild hydrothermal approach. The as-prepared samples are well characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It is revealed that WO3·H2O in composite is of orthorhombic phase and possesses a flower-like hierarchical architecture which is assembled by numerous nanosheets as building blocks. Moreover, the WO3·H2O microflowers with uniform sizes and morphologies are evenly distributed and anchored on the large and flexible reduced graphene oxide sheets. When evaluated as electrode materials for supercapacitor, the composites exhibit superior electrochemical performance with high specific capacitance, good cycling stability and excellent rate capability. It is believed that the unique hierarchical WO3·H2O microstructures and the synergistic effect originated from the intimate combination of WO3·H2O with reduced graphene oxide are responsible for the enhanced electrochemical properties.
