There are many studies about integrating supercapacitors to meet actual application needs, but challenges remain in assembling the device without a current collector and other additions. In this investigation, an all-in-one supercapacitor that integrates the electrodes, solid-electrolyte and current collectors was developed using a facile strategy. The method requires only some cheap and easily available experimental products including poly(vinyl alcohol) and polyaniline, and does not use advanced equipment. The all-in-one supercapacitor has good properties including being freestanding, self-healable and high stretchable. Specially, the tensile strength of supercapacitor electrode is close to 6 MPa and the elongation at break as high as around 700%. This work offers a versatile strategy to produce all-in-one energy-storage devices which are multifunctional and have potential applications for the future such as in wearable electronics.
