ABO3 perovskites show unusual property modifications by proper substitution at the A and B sites. Polycrystalline perovskite BaSnO3 samples doped with different concentrations of manganese (BaSn1−xMnxO3) were synthesized by solid-state reaction method. Rietveld refinement of XRD analysis confirmed the structure and phase purity of the synthesized compound. Diamagnetic-to-paramagnetic transition and optical bandgap tuning indicate the substitutional effect of Mn in the host BaSnO3 lattice. The strong reverse saturable absorption of the synthesized samples makes them ideal candidate for optical limiting applications. The frequency and composition-dependent dielectric studies reveal that Mn-doped BaSn1−xMnxO3 can be used for high-frequency device applications. The cycling retention in the specific capacitance of 96.2% at a current density of 25 mA/g even after 2500 cycles in Mn-doped BaSnO3 electrode can be used in energy storage devices for supercapacitor applications.
