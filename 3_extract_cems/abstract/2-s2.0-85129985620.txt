Facile and cost-effective soft chemical route was employed to deposit yttrium sulfide (Y2S3) thin films. These films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), wettability test, ultra violet-visible spectroscopy (UV–vis) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) techniques. The characterizations yielded cubic structured Y2S3 films with nanogranule-like porous morphology. The Y2S3 films exhibited hydrophilic surface nature with a contact angle of 52.6°, optical band gap of 3.80 eV and surface area of 3.40 m2 g−1. The film exhibited electrochemical specific capacitance of 260 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1.
