Graphene-containing ordered mesoporous carbons (GOMCs) with low inner resistance, well-defined mesoporous, and high specific surface area was prepared via a one-pot aqueous route, followed by carbonization in nitrogen atmosphere. A sandwich-like microstructure was built by a cooperative self-assembly reaction among graphene oxide (GO) sheets, resorcinol–hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) aqueous solution and amphiphilic triblock copolymer. By adjusting the ratio of GO and the soft template F127 in the precursor mixture, carbons with a controllable pore structure and a maximum surface area of 1,195 m2/g has been prepared. The supercapacitor based on GOMC-2.0-F1.5 shows a high electric conductivity (no obvious IR drop was found during charge/discharge process), high specific capacitance (209 F/g), and excellent cycling stability (no capacitance loss was found after 5,000 cycles).
