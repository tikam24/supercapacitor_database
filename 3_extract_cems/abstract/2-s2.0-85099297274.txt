A GO/Ni(HCO3)2 composite was synthesized by the self-assembly of layer Ni(HCO3)2 and GO in a mixed suspension under sonication, followed by heat treatment to obtain rGO/NiO for use as the electrode material of supercapacitors. The structural change from the GO/Ni(HCO3)2 to the rGO/NiO was investigated by XRD, SEM, and nitrogen adsorption. Results indicate that the rGO/NiO has a specific surface area of 121.3 m2 g-1 and pore volume of 0.26 cm3 g-1 and a hierarchical porous structure with a pore size range of 2-100 nm. The high specific surface area and the hierarchical porous structure give the rGO/NiO composite a high specific capacitance of 919 F g-1 (0.5 A g-1) and an excellent rate capability with a capacitance retention rate of 71% when the current density increases from 0.5 to 5 A g-1. The specific capacitance retains 91% of its original value after cycling at a current density of 2 A g-1 for 3 000 cycles, indicating good stability.
