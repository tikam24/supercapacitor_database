The principle of feasibility of a hybrid super-capacitor, based on graphene and the electrochemical deposition and dissolution of "MnO 2", is demonstrated. For this system, a composite graphene electrode is used as the capacitive electrode. Graphene is also used in the battery type electrode, where it serves as substrate for the in-situ electrochemical deposition and dissolution of "MnO 2". The electrochemical deposition and dissolution reaction provides the bulk of the charge storable in the battery type electrode. The characteristics of the two electrodes are discussed showing that their respective potential windows of stabilities are compatible with the aqueous the electrolyte. Subsequently, two hybrid systems are assembled and subjected to long charge/discharge cycles. One assembly displays an energy density of 34 and 25 Wh.kg -1 after the first and 5000 th cycle, respectively. Â©The Electrochemical Society.
