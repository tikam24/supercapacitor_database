With the technology advancement in energy storage devices, electric transportation is gaining importance. Power electronics play a vital role in decreasing the losses and enabling safety. A comprehensive review on battery modeling, ultracapacitors, and the fuel cell is provided. A 5-RC battery model was the best battery model for pulse charging applications. In addition, a detailed review of the frontend converters (rectifiers) for electric vehicles (EV), hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), and plug-in HEV (PHEV) is presented. Rectifiers are integrated with DC–DC converters to achieve unity power factor correction (UPFC) incorporating average current control. Amongst the various rectifiers reviewed, the bridgeless interleaved boost converter showed the highest efficiency. Charging techniques like constant current (CC)–constant voltage (CV) and constant temperature (CT)–CV were reviewed. CT–CV showed 20% faster charging and 20% lesser temperature rise than CC–CV for a lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) 18650 cell.
