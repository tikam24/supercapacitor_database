The reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/activated carbon (AC) composites are coated on the aluminum substrate using spray coating technique to fabricate nanocarbon-based supercapacitor. Polymer-based solid-state xanthan-gum/Na2SO4 electrolyte is also introduced to increase stability of the supercapacitor. The electrochemical properties of the supercapacitor are evaluated using cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests. The highest capacitance value of the rGO/AC composite-based supercapacitor is 120 F/g. The rGO/AC composite-based supercapacitor has also retained ~ 85% of its initial capacitance value after 3000 galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles.
