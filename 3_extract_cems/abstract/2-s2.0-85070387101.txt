Two corncob-derived carbon electrode materials mainly composed of micropores (activated carbon, AC) and mesopores/macropores (corncob carbon, CC) were prepared and studied after the anodic electrodeposition of MnO2. The capacity of the MnO2/activated carbon composite (MnO2@AC) electrode did not noticeably increase after MnO2 electrodeposition, while that of the MnO2/corncob carbon composite (MnO2@CC) electrode increased up to 9 times reaching 4475 mF cm-2. An asymmetric all-solid-state supercapacitor (ASC) was fabricated using AC as the anode, MnO2@CC as the cathode, and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/LiCl gel as the electrolyte. An ultrahigh specific capacitance of 3455.6 mF cm-2 at 1 mA cm-2, a maximum energy density of 1.56 mW h cm-2, and a long lifetime of 10,000 cycles can be achieved. This work provides insights in understanding the function of MnO2 in biomass-derived electrode materials, and a green path to prepare an ASC from waste biomass with excellent electrochemical performance.
