Spinel oxide nanoparticles are considered one of the best candidates for manufacturing pseudocapacitor electrodes. In this regard, MnCo2O4 is synthesized and subsequently hybridized with reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The structure and morphology of the as-prepared materials are confirmed by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and microscopy techniques. The electrochemical analysis is performed by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and galvanostatic chargeâ€“discharge techniques. The results show that the addition of rGO to the MnCo2O4 has a good effect on specific capacitance, stability, and increasing the discharge time of the prepared electrode. MnCo2O4/rGO hybrid indicates a specific capacity of 702 F/g and significant stability of 94% during 5000 cycles. Thus, this material can be considered a very promising candidate for usage in the superconducting electrodes.
