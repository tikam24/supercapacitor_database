Supercapacitors based on flexible fabrics are considered promising wearable energy storage devices due to their skin adaptability and high mechanical properties. However, enhancing the electrical conductivity of flexible fabric substrates and optimizing the loading of active materials remains a challenge. Here, we propose a concept of functionalized ink interlayer to improve the performance of fabric-based supercapacitors. The functionalized ink interlayer not only has good electrical conductivity but also guides the loading of polyaniline (PANI) and facilitates charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface, generating a synergistic effect with the active material. The areal capacitance (323.3 mF cm−2) of cotton fabric/conductive carbon oil/ink@PANI supercapacitor is greater than the sum (210.2 mF cm−2) of cotton fabric/conductive carbon oil/ink supercapacitor and cotton fabric/conductive carbon oil@PANI supercapacitor. Additionally, the maximum energy density of supercapacitor with ink interlayer is 28.5 μWh cm−2 and the maximum power density is 2057 μW cm−2. The electrode with ink interlayer can maintain a fast electrodynamic process and the cycling stability is also improved. Finally, interdigital and tree-like clothing appliques were prepared and sewn onto clothing to realize wearable energy storage function using ink@PANI-based electrodes. This work provides important references for the development of fabric-based supercapacitors.
