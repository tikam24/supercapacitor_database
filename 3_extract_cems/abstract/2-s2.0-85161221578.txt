Aiming at the problems of short driving range and insufficient power of electric vehicles, this paper proposes an energy management strategy of hybrid energy storage system based on multi-objective model predictive control. Firstly, on the basis of the semi-active hybrid energy storage system topology, a Lithium-ion battery model and a DC-DC converter efficiency model are established. Then, aiming at reducing the power loss of the energy storage system and stabilizing the bus voltage, a multi-objective evaluation function is constructed, and the constraints of the control variables are considered as the constraints, and the particle swarm optimization method is utilized to obtain the optimal solution. Finally, experiments are carried out under HWFET driving cycle. The experimental results show that the proposed strategy can achieve optimal power distribution while maintaining the stability of the bus voltage, and make the system efficiency reach 91.79%. It effectively avoids the impact of large current on the life degradation of Lithium-ion battery, and reduces the power loss of the hybrid energy storage system.
