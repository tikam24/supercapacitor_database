The boost-inverter-based battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs) are a popular choice for the battery lifetime extension and system power enhancement. Various sliding mode (SM) controllers have been used to control the boost inverter topology in the literature. However, the traditional SM controllers for the boost inverter topology operate with a high and variable switching frequency which increases the power losses and system components design complexity. This can be alleviated by a pulse width modulation (PWM)-based fixed-frequency SM controller proposed in this paper. The SM controller is implemented using variable amplitude PWM carrier signals generated using the output capacitor voltage and inductor current measurements, thus eliminating the requirement of the output capacitor currents measurement. The battery-connected inductor reference currents for the SM controller are generated by a supercapacitor energy controller which is responsible for the HESS power allocation. First, the theoretical aspects of the SM controller, the operation and parameter selection of the supercapacitor energy controller, and the supercapacitor sizing for the HESS are discussed in the paper. Then, the proposed control system is experimentally verified, and it is shown that the HESS is able to satisfy the HESS output power requirements, while allocating the ripple current and the fast power fluctuations to the supercapacitor while maintaining operation of the supercapacitor within predefined voltage limits. The main advantage of the proposed SM controller, as compared with the traditional double-loop control method, is in eliminating possible DC current injection into the grid when the equivalent series resistance values of the boost inductors become unequal due to the tolerances and temperature variations.
