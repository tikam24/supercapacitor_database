The method for generating a supercapacitor based on nanostructured gold is proposed; the special features of this supercapacitor are described. The process of electrochemical deposition of gold is elaborated. By using a scanning electron microscope, the morphology of the obtained deposits is studied. The optimal conditions for enlarging the capacitance are defined. It is shown that with the use of a nanostructured layer of gold the capacitance of relatively planar electrodes can be enlarged by a factor of 106.
