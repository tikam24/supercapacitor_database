Molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2), an in-organic analog of graphene, is considered a rising star in the family of transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) because of its stable covalent Mo-Se bond, good catalytic properties, huge specific surface area, higher electrical, multivalent oxidation states of transition metal ions, and its ability to be intercalated with suitably-sized metal atoms or organic molecules to modify their physical properties with a distinguishing layered structure. It is being projected as the next-generation 2D layered nano-material for many energy storage-conversion applications. This review covers the properties, functionalization of MoSe2, and their applications in supercapacitors, discussing the current developments of MoSe2 and its nano-composites-based supercapacitors, providing emphasis to the capacitive performances which comprise of specific capacitance/ capacity, cyclic lifespan, energy density, power density, rate capability, and their practicality in the real environments. Fundamental charge-storage mechanisms are also discussed to provide better insight into how MoSe2 is ascribed to each supercapacitor. Wherever applicable, limitations of the existing approaches and future outlook are also described.
