A nickel hydroxide flexible membrane electrode (Ni(OH) 2 -FME) is prepared by coagulation bath (water) directly induced phase inversion (WIPS-FME), and water-vapor-induced phase inversion (VIPS-FME) methods, separately. Interestingly, a symmetrical structure of section morphology, surface porosity, and electrolyte-affinity characteristics of the flexible membrane are obtained by VIPS technology. The effects of relative humidity, exposure time, and temperatures of the phase inversion environment on the electrochemical performance and structure of VIPS are investigated. The specific capacitance of VIPS-FME reaches 2154.29 F g -1 at a current density of 1 A g -1 , which is better than WIPS-FME (1801.14 F g -1 ). Furthermore, a hybrid supercapacitor made by employing the VIPS-FME as the positive electrode and the active carbon flexible membrane (AC-FME) as the negative electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 96.03 F g -1 at 1 A g -1 , a maximum energy density of 30.01 W h kg -1 , and maximum power density of 3750.95 W kg -1 with the energy density of 16.4 W h kg -1 .
