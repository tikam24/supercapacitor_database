A cost-effective and uniform crystal with different structures was fabricated using a facile chemical bath deposition technique for electrochemical supercapacitor (SC) applications. In this study, CuS, PbS, and CuS@PbS composite electrodes were fabricated for SCs. The morphology and structure of the electrodes were analyzed by field emission-scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The CuS@PbS composite electrode delivered outstanding electrochemical performance in SCs with a high specific capacitance of 1004.42 F g-1 at a current density of 2.85 A g-1, good cycling stability (only 2.9% loss after 3000 cycles at 2.85 A g-1), higher energy density of 33.89 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 714.28W kg-1, and an excellent rate capability compared to other electrodes. These results show that the CuS@PbS composite can be used to improve the surface morphology and is a promising positive electrode material for SC applications.
