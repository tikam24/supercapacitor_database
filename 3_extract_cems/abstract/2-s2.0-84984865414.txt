Ag/α-Ag3VO4 stacked nanosheets were prepared through a low-temperature hydrothermal route. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide has been used as a surfactant in the preparation of Ag/α-Ag3VO4 stacked nanosheets. X-ray diffraction revealed mixed metallic silver with Ag/α-Ag3VO4 nanosheets, which was further confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). FESEM and HRTEM images clearly showed that the silver anchored with silver vanadium oxide stacked nanosheets. The electrochemical performance of the Ag/α-Ag3VO4 stacked nanosheets was examined by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge techniques. Both studies indicated that Ag/α-Ag3VO4 is a suitable negative electrode material for supercapacitors and delivers a maximum specific capacitance of 461 F g-1 at a specific current of 2 A g-1. The asymmetric supercapacitor device yielded a specific cell capacitance of 97 F g-1 at a specific current of 1 A g-1. The device delivers a high specific energy and specific power of 43.65 W h kg-1 and 892.8 W kg-1, respectively.
