This paper proposes a power control strategy for wind and solar power generation systems based on hybrid energy storage. In order to improve energy utilization, reduce the number of charge and discharge of the energy storage device, and give full play to the advantages of the energy storage device. The hydrogen generating device is set to run at constant power, and the supercapacitor(SC) and energy storage battery(Bat) compensate for the lack of power and complement the energy storage. Each system unit coordinates work through control strategies to balance power fluctuations on the bus. Studies have shown that under the conditions of energy shock and load fluctuations, the DC voltage can be kept stable, effectively solving the problem of abandoning wind and light, and improving energy utilization.
