Chalcostibite copper antimony sulfide (CuSbS2) micro- and nanoparticles with a different shape and size have been prepared by a new approach to hot injection route. In this method, sulfur in oleylamine (OLA) is employed as a sulfonating agent providing a simple route to control the shape and size of the particles, which enables the optimization of CuSbS2 for a variety of applications. The sulfur to metallic precursor ratio appears to be one of the most effective parameters along with the temperature and time for controlling the size and morphology of the particles. The growth mechanism study shows in addition to the CuSbS2 phase the presence of not previously observed intermediate phases (stibnite (Sb2S3) and famatinite (Cu3SbS4)) at the initial stage of the reaction. By increasing the ratio of sulfur to copper and antimony, wider and thinner CuSbS2 particles are obtained. The particles have nanoplate and nanosheet morphology with a good shape and size uniformity. Coalescence of very thin nanosheets occurs with increasing reaction time eventually leading to formation of thicker particles which can be called nanobricks. Band gap determinations demonstrate that the obtained CuSbS2 particles have both direct (1.51–1.57 eV) and indirect (1.44–1.51 eV) bandgaps. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) studies revealed that the preferred growth directions are along the basis axes of the unit cell ([100] and [010]). Optical and structural properties of the obtained CuSbS2 particles are indicative for their great potential in different generations of solar cells and supercapacitor applications.
