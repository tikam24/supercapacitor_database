This paper focuses on energy management in an ultra-energy efficient vehicle powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. The vehicle is especially developed for the student competition Shell Eco-marathon in the Urban Concept category. The power propulsion system consists of a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), super-capacitors, DC/DC converters, motor controllers, motors and transmission. In order to study the energy management a simulation model of the vehicle was developed. The main power source is a PEMFC with a rated power of 1kW. The output fuel cell parameters were experimentally determined. The super-capacitors were used as an energy storage which aims at keeping the fuel cell operating point within the high efficiency range. A constant efficiency model of DC/DC converters, motor controllers and transmission, was used. The motor efficiency was estimated as a function of the operating point. A dynamic model of the vehicle was developed in order to determine the resistance forces. The energy consumption was estimated on a previously determined cycle of operation that is related to the competition rules. As a result, the optimal driving strategy was determined as well as the hybrid scheme was evaluated by means of the experimental test.
