This paper studies the optimum (most economical) scaling of a battery and supercapacitor hybrid storage for 1 MW photovoltaic (PV) arrays for a one hour dispatching period for an entire day. The optimization is based on the time constant of a low pass filter (LPF) that is used to allocate the power between a battery and a supercapacitor (SC). This paper also presents the price comparison between lead-acid and li-ion battery frameworks. Extensive simulations were conducted for thorough analysis of various hybrid energy storage system (HESS) combinations. According to the results, HESS outperforms battery or SC-only operation.
