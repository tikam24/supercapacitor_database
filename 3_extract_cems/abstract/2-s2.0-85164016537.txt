As a supercapacitor material, Co3O4 has attracted much attention due to its advantages of high theoretical specific capacity, low price and cost, non-toxic environmental protection and abundant reserves. However, it is still a huge challenge to prepare Co3O4 supercapacitor material with excellent electrochemical performance. The electrochemical performance of Co3O4 supercapacitor material was improved by compounding with carbon material with outstanding electrical conductivity. In this paper, the synthesis methods of Co3O4/C composite supercapacitor materials are reviewed, the advantages and disadvantages of each method are summarized, and the factors affecting the electrochemical performance of Co3O4/C composite supercapacitor materials are analyzed. Finally, the problems and development prospects of Co3O4/C composite supercapacitor materials are pointed out.
