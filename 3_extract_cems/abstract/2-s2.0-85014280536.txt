Electrical storage facilities are becoming an inherent element of the present and future renewable power plants. Among different storage technologies stand out double-layer ultracapacitors (UC) with high power density during charge/discharge processes and extremely prolonged service life. Between these appliances Li-ion hybrid UCs could be noted as having twofold higher energy density and service life compared to that of conventional double-layer devices. Internal resistance and capacitance of these devices aren't yet quite examined in the wide range of parameters: voltage, current and temperature since it is relatively new technology (5-6 years from the first manufacturing only). Given article represents investigation of the internal resistance and capacitance of CPQ2300S ultracapacitors (2300F, 2.2-3.8V, manufacturer JSR Co.) in wide range of their currents and voltages in temperature limits from -40°C to +30°C. Results of this work could be important and useful for the storage facilities development based on the ultracapacitors application.
