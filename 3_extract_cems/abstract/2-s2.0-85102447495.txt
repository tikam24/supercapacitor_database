This paper presents a hybrid Fuel Cell-based Power System (FCPS) consisting of fuel cell and hybrid Energy Storage Systems (ESSs), including a battery with high energy density and supercapacitor with high power density to overcome the sudden load demand change and improving the reliability of the delivered power. Any hybrid power system needs Energy Management Strategies (EMS) to balance the power between the different energy sources. In this paper, a comparative analysis of three energy management strategies, including the state machine control method, the classical PI control method and equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) is performed. The paper's main objective is enhancing the DC-bus voltage profile of a hybrid fuel cell/battery/supercapacitor power system equipped with the developed under-mentioned EMS by using a hybrid modified optimization technique that combines Harris Hawks optimization (HHO) and Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA). The new hybrid HHO-SCA is employed to determine the optimal control parameters of the DC-bus voltage controller, which significantly assists in enhancing the DC-bus voltage profile as well as the performance of the applicable ESS in terms of improving efficiency and SoC. The effectiveness of the suggested control schemes is simulated using MATLAB/SIMULINK software. The simulation results confirmed that the proposed HHO-SCA is superior and efficient in improving the DC-bus voltage.
