Core-shell layered double hydroxide microspheres with tunable interior architecture have been synthesized by a facile and cost-effective in situ growth method. The SEM and TEM images revealed that the obtained microspheres display a three-dimensional architecture with core-shell, yolk-shell, and hollow interior structure respectively, with continuous changes in specific surface area and pore-size distribution. Moreover, the hollow NiAl-LDH microspheres exhibit excellent pseudocapacitance performance, including high specific capacitance and rate capability, good charge/discharge stability and long-term cycling life, owing to the greatly improved faradaic redox reaction and mass transfer. Therefore, this work provides a promising approach for the design and synthesis of structure tunable materials with largely enhanced supercapacitor behavior, which can be potentially applied in energy storage/conversion devices.
