The paper presents a laboratory prototype of the three-phase transformerless voltage outages compensator with an energy storage based on high voltage supercapacitors. The system described is able to protect an isolated grid e.g. in industry against short voltage interruptions, dips and sags. An idea of a control method as well as a digital controller has been presented, too.
