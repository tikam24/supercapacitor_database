Hierarchical nanostructured graphene-manganese dioxide nanowire (G-MnO2-NW) composites have been prepared by hydrothermal synthesis route using water/1-decanol as the medium. Synthesized materials were analyzed using various characterization tools to corroborate their chemical compositions, structure/morphology and surface area. Electrochemical measurements of the synthesized G-MnO2-NW electrode materials delivered the highest specific capacity (255 Fg-1), high rate capability and improved cycling stability at 0.5 Ag-1 in 1M sodium sulfate solution and this fact may be attributed to its high surface area and porosity. Moreover, synthesized G-MnO2-NW electrodes displayed better energy and power density, when compared to the MnO2-NW based electrodes.
