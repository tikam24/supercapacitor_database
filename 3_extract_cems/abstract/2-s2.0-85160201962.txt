Supercapacitors have been established as promising renewable energy devices in energy storage due to their high power and favorable energy density. In this study, the design of hybrid nanocomposites (copper-1,3,5 benzenetricarboxylic acid-MOF (Cu-BTC MOF)) as active electrode materials and N-doped graphene nanoribbons (N-doped GNR) with unique properties has been analyzed. The results obtained show a relatively high specific capacitance of 2911.11 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1. In addition, the stability of the electrode after 10,000 cycles was obtained by comparing the initial and final capacity, and the results showed that 93.96% of the initial capacity was retained. In an asymmetric supercapacitor, the Cu-BTC MOF/N–doped GNR was the positive electrode, and activated carbon was the negative electrode (ASC). The assembled ASC device afforded an outstanding specific capacitance of 570 F g−1 at the practical current density of 1 A g−1 and the energy density of 79.16 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 527.77 Wkg−1.
