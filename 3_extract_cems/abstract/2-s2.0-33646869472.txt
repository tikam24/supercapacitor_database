A carbon aerogel supercapacitor has been fabricated with an alkaline polymer gel electrolyte. The electrolyte, which also acts as a separator, has a thickness of 3 mm and a conductivity of around 10-2 S cm-1 at room temperature. The capacitor is characterized by means of cyclic voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy, and galvanostatic cycling. A specific capacitance of 9 F g-1 is shown by cyclic voltammetry.
