A Novel Sulphur and Nitrogen-codoped carbon (SNC-800) material was prepared by pyrolysis of functionalized Polyethersulfone (PES) under 800â„ƒ, which was synthesized by one-pot polymerization. The SNC-800 was served as electrode material and showed a high specific capacitance (240 F/g). The capacitance retention of SNC-800 is as high as 91.6% after 10,000 cycles. The device base on delivered a high energy density (23.5 Wh/kg) with power density (800 W/kg). These results suggest that SNC-800 is a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.
