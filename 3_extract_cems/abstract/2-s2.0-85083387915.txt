The effect of 8.0 MeV carbon ions (C++) radiations on features and performances of MnO2–NiO–ZnO@GO electrodes (thin films). MnO2–NiO–ZnO@GO thin films were produced using the hydrothermal technique. 8.0 MeV carbon ions (C++) with doses of 2.25 × 1015, 5.0 × 1015, 7.5 × 1015 and 1.0 × 1016 ions/cm2 were irradiated on MnO2–NiO–ZnO@GO thin films. The XRD spectra indicate crystalline nature of the films while SEM images show rod-like structures. The XRD calculated crystallite sizes varied from 1.24 to 5.58 nm. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Proton induced X-ray emission (PIXE) and Rutherford back scattering (RBS) analysis are used to evaluate the elemental compositions of samples. Optical studies show reduced bandgap energies of various oxides due to the addition of graphene oxide. The electrochemical studies obtained a specific capacitance of 1627 and 1960 F/g for electrodes illuminated with radiation doses of 5.0 × 1015 and 7.5 × 1015 ions/cm2, respectively. Results indicate that carbon ion irradiation with low doses improved the performances of the nanostructured thin films while radiation with high doses induces adverse disorder and flaw to the MnO2–NiO–ZnO@GO thin film properties. These results show that ion beam irradiation is a useful tool to enhance or damage the properties of nanostructured materials depending on the dosages radiation beamed on the material.
