Electrochemical capacitors with fast charging-discharging rates are very promising for hybrid electric vehicle industries including portable electronics. Complicated pore structures have been implemented in active materials to increase energy storage capacity, which often leads to degrade dynamic response of ions. In order to understand this trade-off phenomenon, we report a theoretical model based on transmission line model which is further combined with pore size distribution function. The model successfully explained how pores length, and pore radius of active materials and electrolyte conductivity can affect capacitance and dynamic performance of different capacitors. The powerfulness of the model was confirmed by comparing with experimental results of a micro-supercapacitor consisted of vertically aligned multiwalled carbon nanotubes (v-MWCNTs), which revealed a linear current increase up to 600â€...Vs -1 scan rate demonstrating an ultrafast dynamic behavior, superior to randomly entangled singlewalled carbon nanotube device, which is clearly explained by the theoretical model.
