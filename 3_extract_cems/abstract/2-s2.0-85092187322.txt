The development of electrode materials with hierarchical nanostructures has great significance in the field of supercapacitors. In the present research, an effective hydrothermal approach is proposed to construct hierarchical NiCoSe2@NiMn-LDH (NCSe@NMLDH) core-shell structures on nickel foam as an interesting positive electrode material for hybrid supercapacitors. The intimate contact between NiCoSe2and NiMn-LDH nanostructures together with the hierarchically porous structure enables the NCSe@NMLDH electrode to exhibit an excellent capacity of ≈401.7 mA h g−1, a considerable durability of 96.8%, and a notable rate performance of 83.6%. Most significantly, the as-assembled NCSe@NMLDH//AC (activated carbon) device exhibits a desired energy density of 47 W h kg−1at 810.34 W kg−1and an excellent power density of 25 690.9 W kg−1at 28.26 W h kg−1. Therefore, the present research offers an efficient approach to engineer advanced materials for various applications.
