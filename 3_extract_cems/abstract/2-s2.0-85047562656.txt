High-performance yet flexible micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) hold great promise as miniaturized power sources for increasing demand of integrated electronic devices. Herein, this study demonstrates a scalable fabrication of multilayered graphene-based MSCs (MG-MSCs), by direct laser writing (DLW) of stacked graphene films made from industry-scale chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Combining the dry transfer of multilayered CVD graphene films, DLW allows a highly efficient fabrication of large-areal MSCs with exceptional flexibility, diverse planar geometry, and capability of customer-designed integration. The MG-MSCs exhibit simultaneously ultrahigh energy density of 23 mWh cm−3 and power density of 1860 W cm−3 in an ionogel electrolyte. Notably, such MG-MSCs demonstrate an outstanding flexible alternating current line-filtering performance in poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/H2SO4 hydrogel electrolyte, indicated by a phase angle of −76.2° at 120 Hz and a resistance–capacitance constant of 0.54 ms, due to the efficient ion transport coupled with the excellent electric conductance of the planar MG microelectrodes. MG–polyaniline (MG-PANI) hybrid MSCs fabricated by DLW of MG-PANI hybrid films show an optimized capacitance of 3.8 mF cm−2 in PVA/H2SO4 hydrogel electrolyte; an integrated device comprising MG-MSCs line filtering, MG-PANI MSCs, and pressure/gas sensors is demonstrated.
