In this paper, we present a novel compressible solid-state supercapacitor with PVA/H3PO4 solid-state electrolyte and folded carbon-nanotube (CNT)/paper electrode. In this structure, both of the compression tolerance of folding structure and the strain capability of CNT film contribute to achieve high compression-tolerant abilities of the electrode, which can be widely used in various environments. This solid-state supercapacitor has achieved the specific capacitance to 11.07 mF/cm2, and capacitance retention retains more than 90% after 100 cycling tests. In addition, the performance of this supercapacitor is very stable even when it is compressed under 50% strain, which enlightens a broad field of compressible energy storage devices to be compatible with high compression-tolerant electronics and flexible self-powered systems.
