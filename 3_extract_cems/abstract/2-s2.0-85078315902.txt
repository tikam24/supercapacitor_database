The obstacles, faced by flexible lithium-ion batteries (LIB) for its unambiguous synthesis procedure and low power densities for practical applications escalate the position of flexible supercapacitors (SCs) as a new standalone performer in modern energy storage devices. Additionally, some admirable features like supremacy over energy density, cyclic stability and fast response make SCs a vital aspirant among the energy storage devices. Eying on those advantages of SCs, in this work layered oxide V2O5 3D array has been grown on carbon fabric. The prepared electrode exhibits a specific capacitance of 1098 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV/s in 0.5 M K2SO4 electrolyte at three electrode configurations. Further, a flexible solid-state symmetric supercapacitor (SSSc) has been assembled taking LiCl/PVA gel electrolyte. The fabricated SSSc manifests a maximum energy density of 48.32 Wh/kg at a power density of 0.49 kW/kg. Moreover, the device exhibits 92% capacitance retention at a current density of 15 A/g after 10,000 cyclic performance. Interconnected network morphology with a large number of cavities/pores actually provides swift access of the electrolyte ions which utterly improves the performance of the electrode when it has been used for energy storage purposes.
