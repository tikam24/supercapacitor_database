Metal oxide and carbon nanotube-based materials are widely preferred in supercapacitor and electrochemical sensor applications due to their interesting physicochemical structure. In this paper, we report the synthesis, characterization, and utilization of NiCeO2@f-MWCNT/EDA nanoparticles as electrode materials for supercapacitor applications. The characterization studies of NiCeO2@f-MWCNT/EDA nanomaterials were performed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Transmission electron microscope (TEM), and Raman spectroscopy apparatus. The characterization methods revealed a good distribution of NiCeO2 on f-MWCNT/EDA and formed a new structure of NiCeO2@f-MWCNT/EDA nanoparticles. Electrochemical studies of NiCeO2@f-MWCNT/EDA nanoparticles showed a significant specific capacitance of between 2385 and 603 Fgâˆ’1 with good cyclic stability of 1000 cycles with capacity retention between 42% and 1.4% at 10 mV/s scan rate. The obtained results reveal that the prepared NiCeO2@f-MWCNT/EDA nanoparticles are promising electrode materials for supercapacitor devices.
