A novel porous 3D-structured carbon composite material with a unique architecture by combining graphene and carbonized metal-organic framework (C-MOF) (HKUST-1) microrods for high performing supercapacitors has been synthesised and characterised. The HKUST-1 microrods were prepared by a new method, converting their diamond-like shape into microrods via mechanical shear mixing in an aqueous solution. Grinding of HKUST-1 and graphene oxide (GO) resulted in the formation of a 3D GO-MOF composite with intercalated HKUST-1 microrods between GO sheets. The composite film was treated by a laser scribing method and created a highly porous, a high surface area (>600 m2/g) and conductive 3D nanostructured composite film (L-rGO-C-MOF) used as electrodes for supercapacitor applications. The prepared film showed a high capacitance of 390 F/g at 5 mV/s, and a cyclic stability of 97.8% at 10 A/g after 5000 cycles. The symmetrical supercapacitor delivered an excellent power density of 8037.5 W/kg with an outstanding energy density of 22.3 Wh/kg confirming a new pathway to design new 3D porous graphene-MOF composites for high-performance energy storage devices.
