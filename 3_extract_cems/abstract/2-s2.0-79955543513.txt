A unique hierarchical architecture is successfully constructed in a wormhole-like mesopore structure via a multiple nanocasting route. This novel type of hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) consists of three-dimensional ordered macropores (ca. 150 nm) with interconnecting pore windows, and the walls of these macropores are rich in wormhole-like mesopores (ca. 2.7 nm) and large spherical mesopores (ca. 10 nm), as well as a significant microporosity, presenting a macro-meso-microporous structure with a three-dimensional interconnectivity. Such a hierarchically porous structure may provide fine diffusion pathways for reaction species, which is demonstrated by the experimental result of an enhanced performance in a supercapacitor. For example, with the introduction of a hierarchical porous structure for fast transport and effective access of ions, the as-prepared HPC exhibits a specific capacitance as high as 247 F g-1, whereas traditional wormhole-like mesoporous carbon has only a specific capacitance of 176 F g-1.
