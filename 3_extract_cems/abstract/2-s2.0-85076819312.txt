The energy storage system (ESS) is the main issue in traction applications, such as battery electric vehicles (BEVs). To alleviate the shortage of power density in BEVs, a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) can be used as an alternative ESS. HESS has the dynamic features of the battery and a supercapacitor (SC), and it requires an intelligent energy management system (EMS) to operate it effectively. In this study, a real-time EMS is proposed, which is comprised of a fuzzy logic controller-based low-pass filter and an adaptive proportional integrator-based charge controller. The proposed EMS intelligently distributes the required power from the battery and SC during acceleration. It allocates the braking energy to the SC on the basis of the state of charge. A simulation study was conducted for three standard drive cycles (New York City cycle, Artemis urban cycle, and New York composite cycle) using MATLAB Simulink. Comparative analysis of conventional and proposed EMSs was carried out. The results reveal that the proposed EMS reduced the stress, temperature, and power losses of the battery. The steady-state charging performance of the SC was 98%, 95%, and 96% for the mentioned drive cycles.
