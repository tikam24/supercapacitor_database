Supercapacitor assisted low dropout regulator (SCALDO) technique is a relatively new approach to design high-efficiency DC-DC converters, where a supercapacitor acts as a lossless voltage dropper in series with a linear low dropout regulator. This extra low frequency, radio frequency interference-free converter, with efficiencies similar to high-frequency switch-modes, could be extended to different applications, including dual rail power supplies. Leading data centre operators such as Google announced their intention to move toward 48 V server rack architecture to minimise power loss in distribution lines and to improve the overall operating efficiency. This paper shares our success in scaling SCALDO technique to develop power supply suitable for Google server rack powered by 380 V DC-microgrid.
