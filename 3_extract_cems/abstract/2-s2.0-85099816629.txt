The nanohybrids of pompon-like molybdenum disulfide (p-MoS2) and N/S dual-doped graphene (NSG) have been successfully synthesized through an in situ self-assembly by a hydrothermal method. The morphology, structure, and composition of the as-prepared products were analyzed by SEM, TEM, XPS, Raman, and XRD. The effect of p-MoS2 content on the properties of nanohybrids was studied and compared with that of ordinary molybdenum disulfide (o-MoS2). When the p-MoS2 mass ratio is 40%, the nanohybrids of p-MoS2 and NSG (p-MoS2/NSG40) formed a uniform and stable composite structure. The p-MoS2/NSG40 exhibits not only high specific capacitance (549.4 F g-1 at 10 mV s-1) but also an excellent capacitance retained ratio of 93.2% after 10â»000 constant current charge/discharge loops (at 20 A g-1), which is significantly higher than that of o-MoS2/NSG40 (488.6 F g-1, 87.5%). An asymmetric supercapacitor assembled by using p-MoS2/NSG40 and NSG as the anode and cathode electrodes possesses a large voltage window (1.8 V vs SCE), high energy densities at all charge/discharge conditions (65.2 Wh kg-1 at the power density of 900 W kg-1), and an excellent cycling stability (91.7% after 10â»000 loops).
