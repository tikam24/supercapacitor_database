Herein, a binder-free graphene nanostructure anode formulated by drawing on Cu current collector with a commercial 10B pencil is reported. The prepared pencil-trace electrode (10B pencil graphite, 10B PG) shows an excellent cycling profile with ≈87% capacity retention characteristics after 1000 cycles. Further, a dual-carbon lithium-ion capacitor (LIC) is fabricated using the pencil-trace electrode as battery-type electrode and commercial activated carbon (AC) as capacitor electrode in aprotic organic solutions. The 10B PG is pre-lithiated prior to LIC fabrication to ensure an ample supply of Li-ions during cycling. The developed LIC, 10B PG/AC assembly, displays a remarkable energy density of 109.9 Wh kg−1 irrespective of the applied current density, that is, power.
