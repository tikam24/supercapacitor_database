High-performance supercapacitor nonwoven separators based on polyvinyl butyral (PVB) with uniformly distributed Al2O3 nanowires (NW) fillers (up to 40 wt %) have been developed using a low-cost casting (stir-pour-dry) technique utilized under ambient conditions for the first time. These novel nonwoven separators with highly porous network demonstrated tensile strength of >30 MPa, extremely high electrolyte absorption (>200 wt. %), low-to-no swelling behavior and stable electrochemical performance, substantially exceeding that of analogous cells with commercial separators. Thermal properties of the produced separators were also exceptional with >15 MPa of ultimate strength, high flexibility and minimal thermal shrinkage maintained at temperatures as high as 200 Â°C. The one-dimensional (1D) ceramic nanofillers improved PVB's mechanical and thermal properties and enabled formation of highly porous membranes with self-organized nanopores and high ionic conductivity of up to 13.5 mS/cm in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. This simple and innovative method and separator design is attractive for manufacturing of high-strength, low-cost and flexible separators and suitable for various polymers-ceramic nonwoven compositions for fast charging, high-power and safe electrochemical capacitors, hybrid devices and batteries.
