Hybrid and electric vehicle batteries deteriorate from use due to irreversible internal chemical and mechanical changes, resulting in decreased capacity and efficiency of the energy storage system. This article investigates the modeling and control of a lithium-ion battery and ultracapacitor hybrid energy storage system for an electric vehicle for improved battery lifespan and energy consumption. By developing a control-oriented aging model for the energy storage components and integrating the aging models into an energy management system, the trade-off between battery degradation and energy consumption can be minimized. This article produces an optimal aging-aware energy management strategy that controls both battery and ultracapacitor aging and compares these results to strategies that control only battery aging, strategies that control battery aging factors but not aging itself, and non-optimal benchmark strategies. A case study on an electric bus with variously-sized hybrid energy storage systems shows that a strategy designed to control battery aging, ultracapacitor aging, and energy losses simultaneously can achieve a 28.2% increase to battery lifespan while requiring only a 7.0% decrease in fuel economy.
