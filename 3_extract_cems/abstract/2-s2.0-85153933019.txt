Sensor nodes are critical components of the Internet of Things (IoT). Traditional IoT sensor nodes are typically powered by disposable batteries, making it difficult to meet the requirements for long lifetime, miniaturization, and zero maintenance. Hybrid energy systems that integrate energy harvesting, storage, and management are expected to provide a new power source for IoT sensor nodes. This research describes an integrated cube-shaped photovoltaic (PV) and thermal hybrid energy-harvesting system that can be utilized to power IoT sensor nodes with active RFID tags. The indoor light energy was harvested using 5-sided PV cells, which could generate 3 times more energy than most current studies using single-sided PV cells. In addition, two vertically stacked thermoelectrical generators (TEG) with a heat sink were utilized to harvest thermal energy. Compared to one TEG, the harvested power was improved by more than 219.48%. In addition, an energy management module with a semi-active configuration was designed to manage the energy stored by the Li-ion battery and supercapacitor (SC). Finally, the system was integrated into a 44 mm × 44 mm × 40 mm cube. The experimental results showed that the system was able to generate a power output of 192.48 µW using indoor ambient light and the heat from a computer adapter. Furthermore, the system was capable of providing stable and continuous power for an IoT sensor node used for monitoring indoor temperature over a prolonged period.
