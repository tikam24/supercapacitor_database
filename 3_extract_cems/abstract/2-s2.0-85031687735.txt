Flexible supercapacitors with high electrochemical performance and stability along with mechanical robustness have gained immense attraction due to the substantial advancements and rampant requirements of storage devices. To meet the exponentially growing demand of microsized energy storage device, a cost-effective and durable supercapacitor is mandatory to realize their practical applications. Here, in this work, the fabrication route of novel electrode materials with high flexibility and charge-storage capability is reported using the hybrid structure of 1D zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorods and conductive polyvinylidene fluoride-tetrafluoroethylene (P(VDF-TrFE)) electrospun nanofibers. The ZnO nanorods are conformably grown on conductive P(VDF-TrFE) nanofibers to fabricate the light-weighted porous electrodes for supercapacitors. The conductive nanofibers acts as a high surface area scaffold with significant electrochemical performance, while the addition of ZnO nanorods further enhances the specific capacitance by 59%. The symmetric cell with the fabricated electrodes presents high areal capacitance of 1.22 mF cm−2 at a current density of 0.1 mA cm−2 with a power density of more than 1600 W kg−1. Furthermore, these electrodes show outstanding flexibility and high stability with 96% and 78% retention in specific capacitance after 1000 and 5000 cycles, respectively. The notable mechanical durability and robustness of the cell acquire both good flexibility and high performance.
