This paper presents a bi-directional quasi-Z-source inverter (qZSI) based DC/DC converter for supercapacitor (SC) interfacing in high power applications. In the SC charging mode the proposed converter acts as a conventional VSI based step-down converter, but in the energy recovery mode it acts as a qZSI-based step-up DC/DC converter. The paper analyzes and discusses the operation of the converter in the SC charging mode. The analysis of the static model of the converter as well as the Bode diagram are presented. Theoretical results are verified by experimental results on a 500 W prototype converter. Â© 2012 IEEE.
