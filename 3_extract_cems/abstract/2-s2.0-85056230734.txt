In order to solve the lack of energy sources, researchers devote themselves to the study of green renewable and economical supercapacitors. We demonstrate herein that the α-Ni(OH)2 nanoplates/graphene composites are fabricated as active electrodes in supercapacitors with excellent cycling stability, high energy density, and power density. The advantages of graphene can complement the shortcomings of α-Ni(OH)2 nanoplates to compose a novel composite. The α-Ni(OH)2 nanoplates/graphene composite presents a high specific capacitance of 1954 F g-1 at 5 A g-1. The reason for the improving performance is attributed to graphene, which provides an improved conductivity and increased specific surface area by interweaving with α-Ni(OH)2 nanoplates. It is particularly worth mentioning that the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor cells yield a high specific capacitance of 309 F g-1 at 5 A g-1 and light a 2 V LED sustainable for about 7 min, which may bring great prospects for further fundamental research and potential applications in energy storage devices.
