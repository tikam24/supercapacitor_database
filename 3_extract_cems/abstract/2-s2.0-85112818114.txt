Designing energy storage devices assembled with precious metal-free active materials is the key to developing a low-carbon economy and sustainable energy supply. Therefore, we take Se as the guest and porous nitrogen-modified flower-shaped hollow carbon spheres (NFHC) as the main body to form Se-NFHC. The performance as an active material in supercapacitors is explored. The results show that the specific capacitance of the material reaches 774 F g−1, and after 6000 constant current charge–discharge tests, it can still maintain 95.4% specific capacitance, which provides selectivity for materials in the field of energy storage.
