A few-layer graphene nano-flake thin film was prepared by an affordable vacuum kinetic spray method at room temperature and modest low vacuum conditions. In this economical approach, graphite microparticles, a few layers thick, are deposited on a stainless-steel substrate to form few-layer graphene nano-flakes using a nanoparticle deposition system (NPDS). The NPDS allows for a large area deposition at a low cost and can deposit various metal oxides at room temperature and low vacuum conditions. The morphology and structure of the deposited thin films are alterable by changing the scan speed of the deposition. These changes were verified by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy. The electrochemical performances of the supercapacitors, fabricated using the deposited films and H3PO4-PVA gel electrolytes with different concentrations, were measured using a 2-electrode cell. The electrochemical performance was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic Charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The proposed affordable fabricated supercapacitors show a high areal capacitance and a small equivalent series resistance.
