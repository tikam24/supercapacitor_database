Chemical activation of nanoporous carbon material with nitric acid, followed by activation in a stream of argon at different temperatures, initiates formation on the surface of the material of amide, pyrrole and pyridine nitrogen compounds that improves the hydrophilic properties and increases its electrical conductivity. Value of the specific capacity of N-enriched carbon material in KOH aqueous solution increases by 30 % and an additional heat treatment in the temperature range of 440-460°C increases it by 10 %. © 2013.
