To improve the minimum fuel consumption of the vehicle as a control target, the energy management strategy of a series hybrid bulldozer was studied. First, according to the structure of two independent motors of a series hybrid bulldozer, the mathematical models of the engine, generator, motor and its controller, ultra-capacitor, and dynamic of bulldozer were established. Next, the combination method of thermostat and the power following energy management strategy were proposed, based on optimal fuel consumption power curve of the engine. Finally, the series hybrid bulldozer and its control strategy were simulated by MATLAB/Simulink software by modeling method of combining the theory and experiment. The energy distribution of power source and the economy of comprehensive working conditions were simulated by using the typical working conditions of the 130 s bulldozer. The results show that this strategy can reasonably distribute the engine output power and the charging and discharging power of the supercapacitor to meet the power demand of the vehicle. Consequently, the charging and discharging times of the supercapacitor are reduced. The SOC value is in its best working range. The fluctuation of engine load is also significantly reduced. The fuel consumption of the original engine is 1 512 g and that of the hybrid engine is 1 358 g. The fuel consumption is reduced by 10.2%. Therefore, the proposed method is effective for energy management. 14 figs, 23 refs.
