Vibration harvesting has been intensively developed recently and systems have been simulated and realized, but real-life situations (including aircraft Structure Health Monitoring (SHM) involve uneven, low amplitude, low frequency vibrations. In such an unfavorable case, it is very likely that no power can be harvested for a long time. To overcome this, multi-source harvesting is a relevant solution, and in our application both solar and thermal gradient sources are available. We propose in this paper a complete Microsystem including a piezoelectric vibration harvesting module, thermoelectric conversion module, signal processing electronics and supercapacitor. A model is proposed for these elements and a VHDL-AMS simulation of the whole system is presented, showing that the vibration harvesting device alone cannot supply properly a SHM wireless node. Its role is nevertheless important since it is a more reliable source than thermoelectric generators (which depends on climatic conditions). Moreover, synergies between vibration harvesting and thermoelectric scavenging circuits are presented. Â© 2008 SPIE.
