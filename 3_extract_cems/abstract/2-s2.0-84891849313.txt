Supercapacitor electrode material MnO2 was prepared by liquid co-precipitation with different concentration of anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). As evidenced by X-ray diffraction, the obtained MnO 2 are all typical amorphous α-MnO2 with poor crystallinity. Scanning electron microscopy reveals that the dispersity of MnO2 initially get better and then worse with the increase of SDS, and the particle sizes first become smaller then larger as well. It is worthwhile noting that the morphology of MnO2 tested by transmission electron microscopy undergoes a changeable process: fibrous, pine needle like, cotton like, round bubble like, flocculent, and nervous tissue like as SDS increases. Through cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests, SDS addition amount 0.2 g (0.017 mol L-1) is found to be the optimal effect value, and the as-prepared Mn-0.2 obtains the highest specific capacitance (C sp) of 154.5 F g-1 at a current density of 500 mA g-1. Compared with the sample Mn-0 synthesized without SDS, the C sp increases by about 50 % (±5 %), which can be attributed to its largest Brunauer-Emmett-Teller-specific surface area of 255.9 m2 g-1, best particle dispersity, and smallest particle size of approximately 50-80 nm. Meanwhile, the rate capability and cycle stability of Mn-0.2 also improves obviously, and the equivalent series resistance decreases a lot, only 0.120 Ω. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
