Abstract: NiWO4 has been regarded as a promising electrode material for supercapacitors because of the various oxidation states of W. In this work, we reported a facile one-step hydrothermal method to prepare nanosized NiWO4 nanoporous composites without any surfactants using different nickel compounds reacting with sodium tungstate. It was found that the particle size of the NiWO4 could be adjusted by selecting suitable nickel sources. The smallest size of the NiWO4 can be controlled to be 3.3 nm, and the surface area was measured to be 139 m2 g–1. Investigated for supercapacitors, the smallest size of NiWO4 nanoparticles exhibited excellent electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance of 750 F g–1 at a current density of 1 A g–1. The fabricated all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor NiWO4//C demonstrated outstanding cycling stability with 93.2% capacitance retention after 6000 cycles. Our results show that the nanosized NiWO4 nanoparticles are promising electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors.
