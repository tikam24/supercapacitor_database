Hierarchical porous carbon is prepared from sucrose by the nano-CaCO3 template method followed by NaOH activation for supercapacitors. As evidenced by SEM, TEM, nitrogen sorption and Hg porosimetry analysis, the carbon possesses a highly developed hierarchical porous texture containing interconnected micro-, meso-, and macropores. The surface area and pore volume of the carbon reach up to 2032 m2 g-1 and 2.602 cm3 g-1, respectively. Galvanostatic charge-discharge and cyclic voltammetry measurements indicate that the carbon shows high capacitance and excellent rate capability in both aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes, which are attributed to its unique hierarchical porosity. In the 6 mol L-1 KOH aqueous electrolyte, it can afford a capacitance of 245 F g-1 at 0.05 A g-1, which remains at 188 F g-1 as the current density increases up to 50 A g-1, while the value reaches 144 F g-1 at 0.05 A g-1 and remains at 103 F g-1 at 10 A g-1 in the 1 mol L-1 Et4NBF4/PC non-aqueous electrolyte.
