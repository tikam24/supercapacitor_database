This paper describes a hybrid grid-connected microgrid system comprising of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and a supercapacitor (SC). The SOFC possesses many advantages over other fuel cells in having high dynamic performance, high combined heat, long-term stability, fuel flexibility, low emissions and relatively low cost. Nevertheless, the most significant disadvantage of SOFC is that it alone fails to compensate the system because of its high operating temperature which makes the system response sluggish in nature. To eradicate this problem, a SC-based energy storage system (ESS) is coordinated with SOFC to enhance the transient response of the system. SC has advantages over other ESSs with its high capacitor capacity and faster charging and discharging capability. A hybrid system is considered to be more efficient as it emits zero amount of carbon pollutants, thereby making the system environment-friendly. The conventional PID controller fails to respond to nonlinearities in the system. So for dynamic operation of the PID controller, a novel collective decision optimization algorithm (CDOA) is proposed in this paper. The hybrid system is designed in MATLAB/Simulink architecture, and to verify the efficacy of the proposed controller, the system is led to a disturbance. A detailed comparative analysis of SOFC with PID, hybrid system with PID and hybrid system with CDOA-tuned PID has been done. In addition to this, harmonics study of each case has been carried out. The proposed hybrid system with the CDOA technique outperforms others in satisfying well the IEEE constraints.
