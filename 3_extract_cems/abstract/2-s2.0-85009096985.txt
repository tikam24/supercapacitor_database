Designing and optimizing the electrode materials and studying the electrochemical performance or cycle life of the supercapacitor under different working conditions are crucial to its practical application. Herein, we proposed a rational design of 3D-graphene/CoMoO4 nanoplates by a facile two-step hydrothermal method. Owing to the high electron transfer rate of graphene and the high activity of the CoMoO4 nanoplates, the three-dimensional electrode architectures achieved remarkable electrochemical performances with high areal specific capacitance (1255.24 F/g at 1 A/g) and superior cycling stability (91.3% of the original specific capacitance after 3000 cycles at 1 A/g). The all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor composed of 3D-graphene/CoMoO4 and activated carbon (AC) exhibited a specific capacitance of 109 F/g at 0.2 A/g and an excellent cycling stability with only 12.1% of the initial specific capacitance off after 3000 cycles at 2 A/g. The effects of temperature and charge-discharge current densities on the charge storage capacity of the supercapacitor were also investigated in detail for practical applications.
