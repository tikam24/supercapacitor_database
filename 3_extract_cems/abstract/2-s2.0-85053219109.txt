This paper gives a detailed overview of the first swing frequency and parameters that are impacting it. With increasing renewables connected to system via converters, inertia in the system as well as inertial response of the system has been decreasing. Therefore, the first swing frequency will have higher nadir/zenith in future. The parameters which describe typical first swing frequency and allow easier benchmarking of different cases are introduced. The paper deals further with sensitivity analysis where impact of different generation mix on the first swing frequency is analyzed i.e. purely hydro, gas or nuclear/coal as well as their mixture systems is investigated. Furthermore, the impact of governor control parameters, disturbance size and different penetration levels of renewables connected via power electronics will be analyzed. In the second part of paper, some of the mitigation solutions will be presented and analyzed. As one of innovative solutions, the SVC PLUS FS will be shortly described. At the end, impact on the first swing frequency of synchronous condensers and SVC PLUS FS on a real case of UK on 27.04.2014 will be presented, showing that SVC PLUS FS has significantly better impact on first swing frequency and is very grid supportive in fast frequency response.
