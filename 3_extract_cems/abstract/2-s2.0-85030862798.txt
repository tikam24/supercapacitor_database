For the fabrication of aqueous Li-ion hybrid supercapacitor, carbon coated LiCo1/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O2 (or LiCo1/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O2@C composite) is synthesized by polymeric precursor method with subsequent thermal decomposition procedures for carbon coating. Graphene like porous carbon is obtained by chemical activation from the biomass of Agave Americana. The XRD analysis reveals that LiCo1/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O2 is having a hexagonal layered structure and activated carbon exists in both amorphous and graphitic nature. The TEM image infers that LiCo1/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O2 particles having the non-uniform shape with sub-micron size and the LiCo1/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O2 particles are embedded into amorphous carbon cloud in the composite. The activated carbon shows the specific surface area of 1219 m2 g−1. Finally, the fabricated aqueous LiCo1/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O2@C‖AC hybrid supercapacitor delivers the specific capacitance of 56 F g−1 with good capacity retention even after 5000 cycles.
