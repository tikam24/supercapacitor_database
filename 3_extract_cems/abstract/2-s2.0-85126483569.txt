Fiber-shaped supercapacitors (FSSCs) are the most state-of-the-art power supplies suitable for wearable devices, but the intrinsically limited cylindrical space of fibers restricts their high electrochemical performance, which must be overcome with a delicate and systematic architectural process. Here, a simple but effective 3D architectural strategy for fabricating FSSCs with high performance and flexibility is proposed. Highly conductive liquid crystal spun carbon nanotube fiber (CNTF) is an excellent 1D core fiber for the electrophoretic deposition of graphene oxide (GO). The deposited GO forms a vertical 3D structure on the CNTF (VG@CNTF), which can be successfully preserved by a consecutive coating of pseudocapacitive active materials onto the surface of VG. Notably, a solid-state asymmetric FSSC shows an outstanding performance of 65 Wh kg−1 at 100 kW kg−1 and exceptional stability and flexibility (capacitance retention of 98.60% at bending angles of 90° and 93.1% after 5000 bending cycles). This work can provide new insight into the development of high-performance FSSCs for practical wearable applications.
