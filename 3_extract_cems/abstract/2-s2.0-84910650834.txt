The conventional automobile system makes use of a battery and alternator system to power up the vehicle and run the peripherals like the head-lamp, horn, indicators etc. Slow charge-discharge rates, repetitive inspection and replenishment of the acid-condition, short-life are some of the various limitations associated with batteries, besides being hazardous ecologically. Batteries have been popular despite their inefficient power-storage capabilities due to the absence of a universally acknowledged energy source with the same hassle-free operation. The supercapacitor is a new device which can eliminate the usage of the conventional lead-acid battery. This paper presents an implementation of an automated control scheme for a supercapacitor bank to power the automobile-eventually reducing the system mass due to the high-density energy-storage capacity of the supercapacitors, and employing a VRLA battery as back-up that is less than half the conventional battery rating and size. Photovoltaic system, regenerative braking can be added in this control scheme in the future.
