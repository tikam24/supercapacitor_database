The development of hybrid capacitors (HCs) has become essential for meeting the rising demand for devices that simultaneously deliver high energy with high power. Although the challenge to develop high-performance HCs remains great, it is also simultaneously essential to develop an eco-friendly and cleaner energy storage system for sustainable future use. To date, hybrid capacitors utilize heavily toxic inorganic insertion electrodes and hazardous coke-derived porous carbon adsorption electrodes to host ions. Herein, we present a conceptually novel all-organic sodium hybrid capacitor (OHC), rationally designed by replacing the conventional electrodes with clean, green, and metal free organic molecules, to host ions. A high energy density of â5 Wh kg-1 and an ultrahigh power density of 7 kW kg-1 (based on active mass in both electrodes) are achieved with a low energy loss of â0.22% per 100 cycles (â89% retention after 5000 cycles), outperforming conventional HCs. The outstanding energy-power behavior of OHC bridges the performance gap between batteries and capacitors. This research holds great promise for the development of next-generation eco-friendly, clean, green, and safer high-energy, high-power devices.
