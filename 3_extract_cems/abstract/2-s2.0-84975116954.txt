Porous carbon spheres for supercapacitor electrodes employing beet molasses which was a new raw material instead of conventional carbonaceous materials as precursor were produced in different ways. Porous carbons were prepared at various condition variables. The morphology, physical structure and electrochemical properties of the materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy(SEM), nitrogen physisorption and electrochemical method. The materials had surface area of 2547 m2/g and specific capacitance of 170.5 F/g, which showed large surface area and well electrical double-layer capacitor. In a word, the problem of the use of molasses on a large scale in sugar industry may be solved. Moreover, a new way of producing porous carbons will be provided.
