In this work, the Pd@ Cd(2-methylimidazole)2 (Pd@CdIF-8) was synthesized by two facile methods, in which the original cubic Pd nanoparticles anchored on the surface/interface of CdIF-8 and supported on the acidified activated carbon (AAC). Interestingly, CdIF-8 exhibited sphericity under hydrothermal condition and presented hexahedron under mild liquid. A(B)-PdxCdyIF-8@AAC hybrids are researched by FESEM, TEM, contact angle measurement, XPS, XRD and BET analytical techniques. A(B)-PdxCdyIF-8@AAC hybrids are employed as nonenzymatic sensors for electrochemical detection of H2O2, and both exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity, especially for A(B)–Pd0.2Cd1.5IF-8@AAC/GCE sensors. A(B)–Pd0.2Cd1.5IF-8@AAC/GCE sensors demonstrated a linear response to H2O2 in the range of from 10 μM to 10.2 mM and 2 μM to 17.5 mM, the sensitivity of 0.195 μAμM−1 and 0.266 μAμM−1, respectively. In addition, asymmetric supercapacitors have been fabricated using A(B)-PdxCdyIF-8@AAC hybrids as positive electrode and exhibited exceptional electrochemical properties with high specific capacitance (452 F g−1 at 0.05 A g−1 and 372 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 of A-Pd0.2Cd1.5IF-8@AAC, and 502 F g−1 at 0.05 A g−1 and 395 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 of B–Pd0.2Cd1.5IF-8@AAC), excellent stability (83.579% maintenance of specific capacitance at 5 A g−1 of A-Pd0.2Cd1.5IF-8@AAC and 78.313% maintenance of B–Pd0.2Cd1.5IF-8@AAC), respectively.
