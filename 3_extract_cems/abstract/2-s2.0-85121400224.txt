Vanadium trioxide materials have attracted great interest owing to their low cost and high theoretical lithium storage capacity. In this work, porous V2O3@C composites were prepared via a NaCl template-assisted freeze-drying strategy. Benefiting from the unique three-dimensional porous carbon-based structure, the V2O3@C composite anode exhibits a high-rate pseudocapacitive behavior. A lithium-ion capacitor (LIC) based on this V2O3@C composite anode and a commercial AC cathode was constructed. Results show that the as-constructed device exhibits high energy density, high power density as well as long cycling stability, indicating the great promise of our porous V2O3@C composites for the high-performance LICs.
