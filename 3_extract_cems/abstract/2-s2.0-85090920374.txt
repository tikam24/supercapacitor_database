Power management of a one-converter parallel structure with battery and supercapacitor is addressed in this paper. The controller is implemented on a DSP from a Microchip and uses a Controller Area Network (CAN) bus communication for data exchange. However, the low data transmission rate of the CAN bus data impacts the performances of regular power management strategies. This paper details an initial strategy with a charge sustaining mode for an application coupling a battery with supercapacitors, in which low performances have been witnessed due to the high sampling time of the CAN bus data. Therefore, a new strategy is proposed to tackle the sample time issue based on a depleting mode. Simulation and experimental results with a dsPIC33EP512MU810 DSP based on a 10 kW hybrid system proves the feasibility of the proposed approach.
