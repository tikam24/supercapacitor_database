Nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NPC@ZIF-11) and boron-NPC (BNPC@ZIF-11) materials were synthesized by pyrolysis methods, and structural characterization of the compounds was carried out by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Brunauer–Elmet–Teller technique, Raman spectroscopy, and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry techniques. The ZIF-11 was converted to the NPC@ZIF11 by pyrolysis. BNPC@ZIF-11 was fabricated from NPC@ZIF-11 by pyrolysis in the presence of phenylboronic acid. The fabric supercapacitor, sandwich-type supercapacitor, and Li-ion battery performances of NPC@ZIF-11 and BNPC@ZIF-11 were investigated. The capacity of the Li-ion cell was found as 720 mAh g−1 for the first cycle, and it was decreased to 250 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles. The capacitance values of the cylindrical devices were 92 F g−1 and 115.6 F g−1, for C1 and C4000 in KOH electrolytes. The BNPC@ZIF-11 was used as an electrode material on cotton fabric, and the highest obtained capacitance was 72.8 mF for 0.1 mA, which is a promising result for wearable energy storage materials.
