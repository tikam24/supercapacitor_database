A supercapacitor with mechanical flexibility has been fabricated, by means of simple printing technique, using carbon nanotube heterogeneous sprayed film. Our study found that the specific capacitance can reach 11 F/g by galvanostatic measurements. 600 cycles of galvanostatic measurement were performed to study stability of the flexible printed supercapacitor. Results showed a good retention of charge capacity. In addition, to reach out to a more general group of end-users, conventional DC charging and discharging tests and leakage voltage measurements were conducted to evaluate device performance. This study sheds new light on using a new class of light weight and conformable charge storage device for future printed electronics. Â©2009 IEEE.
