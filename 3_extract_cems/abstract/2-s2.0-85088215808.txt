Structural design is often investigated to decrease the electron transfer depletion in/on the pseudocapacitive electrode for excellent capacitance performance. However, a simple way to improve the internal and external electron transfer efficiency is still challenging. In this work, we prepared a novel structure composed of cobalt (Co) nanoparticles (NPs) embedded MnO nanowires (NWs) with an N-doped carbon (NC) coating on carbon cloth (CC) by in situ thermal treatment of polydopamine (PDA) coated MnCo2O4.5 NWs in an inert atmosphere. The PDA coating was carbonized into the NC shell and simultaneously reduced the MnCo2O4.5 to Co NPs and MnO NWs, which greatly improve the surface and internal electron transfer ability on/in MnO boding well supercapacitive properties. The hybrid electrode shows a high specific capacitance of 747 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and good cycling stability with 93% capacitance retention after 5,000 cycles at 10 A g-1. By coupling with vanadium nitride with an N-doped carbon coating (VN@NC) negative electrode, the asymmetric supercapacitor delivers a high energy density of 48.15 Wh kg-1 for a power density of 0.96 kW kg-1 as well as outstanding cycling performance with 82% retention after 2000 cycles at 10 A g-1. The electrode design and synthesis suggests large potential in the production of high-performance energy storage devices.
