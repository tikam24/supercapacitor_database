Flexible power devices play an increasingly crucial role in emerging flexible electronics. To improve the electrochemical performance of flexible power devices, novel electrode structures and new energy-storage systems should be designed. Herein, a novel flexible Li-ion hybrid capacitor (LIC) is designed based on an anode comprising Li4Ti5O12 nanoplate arrays coated on carbon textile (LTO/CT) and a cathode comprising a flexible N-doped graphene/carbon-nanotube composite (NGC) film. The LTO/CT anode is fabricated by directly growing Li4Ti5O12 nanoplates on CT with robust adhesion using a simple one-pot hydrothermal reaction. Considering the volume of a real-device flexible LIC, the NGC//LTO/CT configuration delivers high volumetric energy and power densities of 2 mWh·cm−3 and 185 mW·cm−3, respectively. Furthermore, the flexible LIC shows excellent flexibility and electrochemical stability, with extremely small capacity fluctuation under different bending states. This work demonstrates a scalable route to assemble flexible LICs as high-performance power devices. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
