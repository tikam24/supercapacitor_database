Because there exist manufacture errors inevitably and the line connection of the circuit can not be guaranteed to be completely symmetrical, the output currents of the parallel charging system for energy storage type light rail vehicles with super-capacitors as its power-supply are not balanced. In this paper, the current-sharing problem of parallel charging systems is abstracted into the output synchronization problem of one class nonlinear coupled inter-connected dynamical systems. The out synchronization controller is designed based on the nearest neighborhood rule by adopting a saturation function, considering the passivity for such systems. The closed-loop system stability is rigorously proved with the aid of Lyapunov function based on storage functions of sub-systems integrating with Barbalat lemmas, which is assumed that the system passivity condition and the communication topology details balanced condition are both satisfied. The passivity-based distributed cooperative control is applied in the parallel charging systems with super-capacitor loads. The effectiveness and applicability of the proposed methods is verified by simulations.
