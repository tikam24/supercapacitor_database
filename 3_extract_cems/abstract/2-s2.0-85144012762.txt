Considering the vessel environmental constraints and the requirements of pulsed load, it is necessary to rationally select and configure the ESD( energy storage device) to improve the performance of the vessel integrated power system. For this reason, based on the weighted minimal module ideal point method and analytic hierarchy process, a performance evaluation function of ESD was proposed, and the optimal configuration was carried out with this function. The proposed function fully considers the system requirements and pulse load characteristics, and takes the ESD volume, weight, and economy as the main components of the evaluation function. At the same time, it takes power, energy, voltage, and state of charge as constrains to establish an optimal configuration model. The differential evolution algorithm was adopted to solve it. The proposed model was solved and calculated with the example of high performance lithium battery and supercapacitor. The results show that lithium battery has belter performance and are more suitable for integrated power system under the given weight. Besides, the guiding configuration scheme was given.
