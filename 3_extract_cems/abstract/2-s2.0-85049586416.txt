The one-pot synthesis of titania with diverse degrees of oxygen vacancies and nitrogen dopants through arc-discharge and nitridation process is first reported. The series of TiO2-x:N samples are prepared by tuning the ratio of CO2/H2 in the chamber. The chemical composition, microstructure, and valence state of TiO2-x:N are characterized by a variety of measurements. Specifically, the as-prepared samples achieve the highest specific capacitance (210 F g-1 at 2 mV s-1), which is much higher than that of TiO2-x and commercial P25. Moreover, it exhibits good cycling stability with 9% attenuation of capacitance after 10,000 cycles. The capacitive enhancement can be attributed to more active pseudocapacitive properties and improved electrical conductivity due to oxygen vacancies and nitrogen dopants. This work provides another feasible path to simplify the tunable synthesis of titania with different oxygen defects, and further optimize the degree of nitrogen dopants in order to realize better performance in the future.
