Electric double-layer capacitors (EDLC) or supercapacitors are facilitated by the high specific power, fast charging, discharging, and low ESR (effective series resistance), which more efficiently integrated with battery technology to employed in electric vehicles and other electronic gadgets. To enhance the supercapacitor applications and to develop a more capable energy storage device/technology, it has to need the accurate and exact characterization of the supercapacitor. In this paper, we review the electrode's material of supercapacitor. And some newly developed (hybrid) material that upgrades the behavior and performance of supercapacitors. Also, we bring together recent findings from a series of experiments and computational (simulation) studies to gives a new and smart charging method of the supercapacitor. We have found one cannot pump an infinite amount of current to charge (fast charging) a supercapacitor because the leakage-parallel resistant reduces with one supposed to pump a large amount of current. So, it is not possible to charge a supercapacitor up to a given certain voltage. Therefore, to efficiently charging a supercapacitor up to a specific voltage and to reduce the charging time, we also have proposed and developed a gamma function-based charging methodology.
