In this paper, we focus on a valuably consequential idea to design an energy storage system for electric locomotive which only know two requirements, required energy and required the minimum voltage. This paper is the design of batteries and supercapacitors that suitable for the system. First, select the type of batteries suitable for use and design for load requirement. Second calculating the value of capacitors suitable for start period and regenerative braking. After that simulation batteries and supercapacitor to see if the voltage and power enough for the system. Finally, the experiment shows the simulation results for both battery and supercapacitor in accordance with the condition designed according to the load requirement.
