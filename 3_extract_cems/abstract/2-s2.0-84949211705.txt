The applicability of hybrid capacitors as accumulators in standalone systems based on renewable energy sources, in particular in a standalone desalination system powered from solar panels was considered. An asymmetric lithiumâ€“carbon accumulator with positive and negative electrodes based on activated carbon and graphite, respectively, and a nonaqueous electrolyte based on lithium hexafluorophosphate in ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate with vinylene carbonate additive was proposed for this purpose. Cyclic and galvanostatic tests were performed, and their results were used to determine the principal electrochemical properties of experimental specimens.
