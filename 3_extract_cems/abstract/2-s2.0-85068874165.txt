Flexible electrodes for preparing core–shell structures are receiving increasing attention. A composite electrode material with NiCo2S4 as the core and Ni3S2 as the shell was successfully synthesized by hydrothermal synthesis and electrodeposition method. The prepared flexible NiCo2S4@Ni3S2 core/shell nanorod array has higher electrochemical performance, with specific capacitance of 5.714 F cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2 and excellent cycle stability. In addition, the prepared flexible hybrid supercapacitor has been assembled with NiCo2S4@Ni3S2 as the positive electrode and Fe2O3-rGO as the negative electrode, delivering an energy density of 5.9 mWh cm−3 at 171 mW cm−3. These results make the NiCo2S4@Ni3S2 a high-performance supercapacitor application candidate.
