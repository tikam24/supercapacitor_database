Polycyclic aromatics (PCAs) possess excellent photoelectric properties, but the construction of such compounds has been a quite challenging subject of study, mainly due to very low solubility. Herein we report a precursor synthesis strategy for polycyclic aromatic conjugated polymers. A soluble precursor polymer, that containing fusible “double U-shaped aromatic” (DUA) and perylenetetracarboxydiimide (PDI) units, was firstly synthesized by Suzuki coupling. The stereo aromatic units in polymer backbone were found to be converted into polycyclic aromatic units, i.e. hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene (HBC), by chemical or electrochemical oxidation, which resulted in a formation of insoluble polycyclic aromatic conjugated polymers. The electrochemical oxidations that occurred at the interface of electrode and solution exhibited higher cyclization reactivity and leads to the formation of high quality films on the electrode surface. Characterization by Raman and UV-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy validated the successful formation of this HBC structure. Some potential applications of such thin films are being explored, and here we focus on the characteristics of supercapacitors based on their excellent electrochemical properties.
