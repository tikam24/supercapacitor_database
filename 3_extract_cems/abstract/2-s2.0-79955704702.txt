This paper introduces the academic research of storage technology applied to micro grid. Firstly, it reviews the development of storage technology, expounds the research meanings and values, and analyzes the role of the energy storage in micro grid. Then the application research of the battery storage, flywheel storage, superconductive magnetic energy storage, supercapacitor storage, hybrid storage and other energy storage in micro grid are discussed. The advantages and disadvantages of various storage methods are introduced, and their performance indexes are compared. Finally, considering the characteristics and requirements of micro grid, both some existing problems and the future development trend of energy storage technology are presented.
