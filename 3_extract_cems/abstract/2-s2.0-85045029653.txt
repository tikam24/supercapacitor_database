Uniformly sized micropores of <1 nm size are generated in petcoke by activating it with an alkaline solution, KOH. The influence of nano-confinement effect of these micro pores on electrochemical performance of the Activated Carbon (mAC) is investigated in symmetric as well as hybrid capacitor configuration, employing different aqueous namely acidic (0.5 M H2SO4), alkaline (2 M KOH), neutral (1 M KCl) and non-aqueous electrolytes (1 M TEA-BF4 in 1:1 DC & EC). Despite of high ionic conductivity of these aqueous electrolytes, symmetric capacitors exhibit poor rate capability because of the restricted entry of solvent sheath into the micropores which strengthens the ionic interaction and slow down the diffusion of ions at high current rate. On the other hand, the overflowing electrolyte from the micropores of mAC appears to enhance the rate of diffusion of ions into nanostructured pseudocapacitive binary metal oxide, MnCo2O4 in the hybrid configuration and improves its power rate capability significantly. The superior capacitive performance of hybrid capacitor demonstrates that the possibility of solving the inherent limitation of micro porous electrodes by coupling it with nanostructured pseudocapacitive material. In the present work, high specific power, 6805 W kg−1 and high specific energy, 2.64 Wh kg−1 have been achieved with the hybrid capacitor of configuration mAC||KOH||MnCo2O4 at a high current rate, 30 A g−1.
