Electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) is one of the promising energy storage devices with high capacity, high durability and rapid charge-discharge capability. However, the improvement of energy density is a big challenge to work on. In this study, we prepared activated carbon by KOH activation for 0 to 0.5 h at 700 to 800°C in N2 flow with carburized furfural resin particles (1 or 10 μm in diameter), then carried out N2 adsorption to evaluate pore structure as well as surface chemical structures. Activated carbon (1 μm in diameter) treated by 750°C-0 h or 800°C-0 h had ca. 2.5 times larger mesopore volume and 1.9 times larger mesopore ratio than the one by 700°C-0.5 h. The relationship between the surface functional group and the pore size distribution, and the EDLC capacity was investigated while the specific surface area was nearly equal value as 1200±100 m2/g. Activated carbon treated by 750°C-0 h (227 F/g) and 800°C-0 h (225 F/g) were higher than 700°C-0.5 h (198 F/g), which shows mesopore ratio plays a crucial role in 6 M KOH electrolyte.
