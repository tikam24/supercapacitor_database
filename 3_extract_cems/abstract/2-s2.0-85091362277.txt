Lithium manganese phosphate nanoparticles (LiMnPO4; LMP) as well as the nickel-doped (LMNP) and graphenised derivatives (G-LMNP) were synthesized. Electrochemical characteristics of the materials were examined using cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic charge-discharge. Lithium ion capacitors (LIC) fabricated using LMP and composite materials as positive electrodes and activated carbon as the negative electrode, exhibited a specific capacitance of 60 F g−1 at a current load of 0.1 A g−1 for the AC//G-LMNP LIC. Capacitance retention of 83 % was obtained by the AC//G-LMNP LIC after 750 cycles, with a high specific power of 19 kW kg−1 at 0.5 A g−1.
