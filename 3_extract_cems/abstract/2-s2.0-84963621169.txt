Polyaniline (PANI) and its composite hydrogels have been considered as a unique supercapacitor electrode material due to their three dimensional (3D) porous structures, formed conducting networks, high specific surface areas and fast electron/ion transfer. Herein, dendritic and long fibrous PANI nanostructure hydrogels (PDH and PFH), dendritic PNAI nanofiber/graphene and long PANI nanofibers/Nitrogen-doped graphene composite hydrogels (PGH and PNGH) were prepared by integration polymerization of aniline and hydrothermal process. It was found that the addition of p-Phenylenediamine (PPD) not only controlled the morphologies of PANI from dendritic to long fibrous, but also facilitated the graphene oxide (GO) into nitrogen-doped graphene. Furthermore, after freeze-drying, PDH and PGH exhibited a max compressive strength of 9.5 and 9.6 KPa, respectively; while the max compressive strength of PFH and PNGH constructed with long PANI nanofiber is 79.9 and 75.8 KPa, respectively. Directly using these prepared hydrogels as electrodes for supercapacitors, it was found that PDH, PFH, PGH and PNGH exhibited high specific capacitances of 448.6, 470, 540.9 and 610 F g-1, respectively, at the current density of 1 A g-1. It is expected that the prepared PDH, PFH, PGH and PNGH can be directly applied in the field of high performance energy storage devices.
