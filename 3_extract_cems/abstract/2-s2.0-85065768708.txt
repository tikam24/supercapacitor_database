Energy conversion and energy storage are two crucial challenges in green chemistry that have attracted tremendous attention for the last several decades. In this work, we have addressed both issues by synthesizing nitrogen-rich, few-layer-thick holey graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets by a simple, novel, direct thermal polymerization method, which is found to be very good in photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction (energy-conversion) and charge-storage supercapacitor (energy-storage) applications. This as-synthesized conjugated polymer semiconductor (obtained stoichiometry C3N4.8) with unique structural and morphological advantages exhibits superior photocatalytic water splitting activity to H2 evolution (2620 Î¼mol h-1 g-1) without the help of any cocatalysts under visible light in the presence of 20% triethanolamine (TEOA). The calculated apparent quantum yield is 8.5% at 427 nm, and the rate of photocatalytic hydrogen generation remained constant for nine consecutive catalytic cycles (9 h photocatalysis). The present material also shows electrochemical double layer capacitor (EDLC) behavior in alkaline electrolyte, where a symmetric coin cell device consisting of this electrode material without any large area support or conductive filler delivers high specific capacitance (275 F g-1), energy density (30 Wh kg-1), and power density (6651 W kg-1), and the supercapacitor cell can retain >98% capacitance efficiency up to 10 000 measured cycles at various current densities.
