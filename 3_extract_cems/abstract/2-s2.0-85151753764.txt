MXene materials with high specific surface area and conductivity have received extensive attention in energy storage fields. In consideration of the self-stacking of MXene, NiAl-LDH/MXene (LBL-NM) was synthesized by layer-by-layer (LBL) coating method with the assistance of boehmite sol. NiAl-LDH nanosheets could uniformly grow on the both sides of MXene carriers. This established sandwich structure can effectively prevent the agglomeration and re-accumulation of NiAl-LDH and MXene nanosheets simultaneously. The electrochemical performance of LBL-NM increases markedly compared to the original NiAl-LDH due to the introduction of MXene. Moreover, the LBL-NM composite displays 1265 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g, which is superior to that of the NiAl-LDH/MXenes composites without the LBL coating method and taking aluminum salt as the aluminum source. Benefits from the growth process and sandwich structure, LBL-NM can maintain 70.3% cycle stability after 3000 cycles at 10 A/g.
