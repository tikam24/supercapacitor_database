In this work, we recovered aluminium oxide nanoparticles (Al2O3 NP's) from aluminium based wastes by adopting sonochemical assisted leaching technique. The structural/chemical composition of the as-recovered Al2O3 NP's was explored by various spectral and analytical tools, such as FT-IR, Raman, XRD, XPS, FE-SEM, TEM and BET analysis. The as-recovered Al2O3 NP's were employed as electrode material in supercapacitor, which further revealed an appreciable specific capacitance value (688 Fg-1) in 1 M KOH at 1 Ag-1 current density. Further, Al2O3 NP's conserved 86 % capacitance retention even after 3000 GCD cycles. Furthermore, the biocidal activity of the as-recovered Al2O3 was tested and it was found to be lesser toxic to the bacterial and yeast cells. Thus, the study revealed that Al2O3 NP's can be used to develop the ecofriendly superior electrode material for supercapacitor application.
