Plant biomass has gained much attention as raw materials for preparing porous carbon materials used in supercapacitors. In this paper, nori-based N, O, S, Cl co-doped carbon materials are prepared by a method of direct ZnCl2activation in high carbon yields over 30%. The prepared carbons are systematically characterized by N2adsorption/desorption, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The electrochemical capacitive performances are investigated in 6 M KOH electrolyte. Although the prepared carbons possess relative undeveloped porosity with low specific surface area and small pore volume, the nori-based carbons exhibit good capacitive performance due to the combined contributions of electrochemical double layer and pseudo-capacitance. The nori:ZnCl2-2:1 carbons show a high capacitive performance of 220 F g−1, good rate capability (61.5% in the range of 0.1–10 A g−1), and good long-term cycle stability (96.6% after 5000 cylces). More importantly, the Nori:ZnCl2-2:1-800 exhibits a very high specific volumetric capacitance of up to 307.7 F cm−3. This work shows that direct ZnCl2-activated seaweed carbon materials are promising electrode materials for supercapacitor applications.
