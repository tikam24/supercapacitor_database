Energy storage devices are the ultimate flexible solution to overcome energy deficiency. Thre is a need is to find innovative nanomaterials to overcome the delays in efficiency and sustainability. Herein, we report the synthesis of hierarchical MoS2/rGO nanohybrids as electrode material for supercapacitors. Pure phase and flower-shaped molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets have been synthesized using a meek hydrothermal method followed by the preparation of MoS2/rGO nanohybrids. The physicochemical aspects and electrochemical properties have been carefully analyzed using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge method in the 1 M KCL electrolyte. The capacitance of MoS2 and MoS2/rGO were found to be 297 F/g (66 mAh/g or 238 C/g) and 850 F/g (153.5 mAh/g or 552.5 C/g) at 1 A/g respectively, with 95.3% retention in capacitance after 10,000 cycles at 2 A/g. The improved electrochemical performance of the MoS2/rGO electrode could be ascribed to rapid diffusion pathways delivered by rGO and improved redox reactions of hierarchical MoS2 nanosheets owing to the high surface area (391 m2/g). This feature enables a decrease in the entire impedance of electrodes which agrees with the findings obtained from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.
