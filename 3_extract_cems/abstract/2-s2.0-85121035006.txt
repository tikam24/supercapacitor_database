A new generalized staircase model of the electrochemical impedance is presented for porous electrode materials in energy storage devices. A brief overview on existing models (if interfacial impedance and their limitations is given. The new model is based on the conventional staircase model of the impedance in cylindrical pores. However, the new model takes into account the complex porous structure of electrode materials. In particular, the impedance of hierarchical branching porous electrodes is described, i. e. the wide pores branching into the narrower pores. The new model allows to evaluate the impedance of the electrode/electrolyte interface in the presence of both non-faradaic and faradaic processes. The model is validated using the available ex-act solutions and experimental data for simple pore geometries. The influence of the parameters of structure of model porous electrodes on their performance in supercapacitors is studied. In particular, the influence of the diameter of the pores, width of pore openings, branching of pores is analyzed. The guideline for focused design of electrode materials of supercapacitors is outlined.
