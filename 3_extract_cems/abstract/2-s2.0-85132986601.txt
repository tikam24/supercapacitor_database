In this paper, an aramid chopped fiber, so-called (ACF)/polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) composite, containing multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), and in situ polymerized polypyrrole (PPy) was designed and fabricated, to be applied as a paper based electrode. The ACF/PPS/MWCNT-PPy electrode features highly porous paper-like structure with excellent electrochemical activity, rendering it a high areal capacitance of ~ 3205 mF cm−2 at a current density of 5 mA cm−2. After 5000 charge–discharge cycles, the areal capacitance still maintains 93% and 70% at high current densities of 20 and 80 mA cm−2, respectively. Moreover, the ACF/PPS/MWCNT-PPy electrode displays over 50% the areal capacitance and maintains it's mechanical stability after annealing at 300 °C. The UL-94 test reveals that the highest V-0 flame-retardant performance can be achieved. All these results suggest that the ACF/PPS/MWCNT-PPy composite is a promising material to be used as electrode for supercapacitor with high energy-storage capability and noninflammability.
