Constructing the intrinsically stretchable electrodes can fundamentally solve the problems of complex assembly process and insufficient structural stability of stretchable energy-storage devices. Further considering the practical needs, it is very necessary to realize the coordinated improvement of electrochemical performance, deformation performance and fire safety. Here, an intrinsically stretchable device with homogeneous configuration based on elastic flame-retardant matrix was proposed for the first time. In detail, a high-performance stretchable asymmetric supercapacitor was realized through using a conductive elastomer prepared by compounding poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) nanofibers into fluororubber (PEDOT NFs@FKM) as positive electrode, the Ag nanowires/fluororubber conductive elastic substrate coated with PDAA nanoparticles (PDAA@Ag NWs/FKM) as the negative electrode, and the fluororubber-based porously fibrous membrane prepared by electrospinning (pFKM) as the quasi-solid electrolyte substrate. Due to this fully integrated design, the newly developed supercapacitor is high stretchable and simultaneously deliver high energy density (11.8 mWh cm−3 when the power density is 0.0693 W cm−3). During 300 cycles of stretching at 50% stretch ratio, the device maintains good electrochemical performance. This fully integrated construction concept of this work is expected to be extended to stretchable lithium-ion battery, stretchable lithium sulfur batteries and other systems.
