A series of furan-EDOT copolymer films, namely, P(Fu-EDOT), P(Fu-EDOT-Fu) and P(EDOT-Fu-EDOT), were electrochemically synthesized from their corresponding monomers and evaluated as active electrode materials for supercapacitor applications by galvanostatic charge-discharge method. The specific capacitance of these copolymers was calculated to be 65, 46 and 75 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1, respectively. Besides, their energy density were also investigated. Among them, P(EDOT-Fu-EDOT) exhibited higher specific capacitance and energy density (15 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 0.6 KW kg-1) than P(EDOT-Fu) and P(Fu-EDOT-Fu), and also showed a large power range while maintaining a relatively high energy density. These favorable performances make P(EDOT-Fu-EDOT) a promising candidate as electrode material for supercapacitors compared with P(Fu-EDOT-Fu) and P(EDOT-Fu).
