Hierarchically porous PDAA@rGO/HrGO composite films were fabricated as self-supporting flexible film electrodes for high-performance symmetric solid-state supercapacitors, via facile vacuum filtration of the mixed dispersion containing the well-defined PDAA@rGO nanocomposite and HrGO nanosheets as building blocks. The electrochemical property of the proposed hierarchically porous PDAA@rGO/HrGO composite film electrodes was optimized in a two-electrode configuration, by adjusting the feeding ratios and the total solid content in the mixed dispersion. The optimized one, the PDAA@rGO/HrGO-4 composite film electrode, possessed a high gravimetric specific capacitance of 409 F/g and areal specific capacitance of 644 mF/cm 2 at 0.5 A/g, with a high capacitance retention of 98% after 10,000 cycles at 5 A/g. The symmetric solid-state supercapacitor fabricated with the PDAA@rGO/HrGO-4 composite film electrodes, three in series, could light a red LED.
