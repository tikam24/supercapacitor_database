In this study, MoO3 nanoparticles were covalently attached on the surface of a UV-assisted functionalized carbon nanotube (Mo/C), to fabricate supercapacitor electrodes. Then, the electrochemical properties of the fabricated electrodes were investigated for supercapacitor applications. MoO3/carbon nanotube hybrids were deposited on Ni foam (current collector) by sonication to fabricate the electrode (Mo/C/Ni). To improve the performance of electrodes, two types of natural polysaccharide binders, i.e., Xanthan gum (XG) and Arabia gum (AG), were used. The pseudo-capacitive properties of these electrodes were studied by cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry, and AC impedance spectroscopy. The specific capacitances of the Mo/C/Ni, Mo/C/Ni/XG, and Mo/C/Ni/AG electrodes in 2.0 M KOH electrolyte and 1 A g−1 current density were measured 575, 1735, and 2150 F g−1, respectively. The excellent electrochemical performance was attributed to the synergism between the properties of MoO3 nanoparticles, CNT, and Arabic gum binder, as well as their good charge mobility and flexibility of the Mo/C/Ni/AG nanocomposite. These superior electrochemical results show the potential of the synthesized electrodes to apply as the high-performance supercapacitors.
