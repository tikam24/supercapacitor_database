Hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) from bituminous coal was designed and synthesized through pyrolysis foaming and KOH activation. The obtained HPC (NCF-KOH) were characterized by a high specific surface area (SBET) of 3472.41 m2/g, appropriate mesopores with Vmes/Vtotal of 57%, and a proper amount of surface oxygen content (10.03%). This NCF-KOH exhibited a high specific capacitance of 487 F/g at 1.0 A/g and a rate capability of 400 F/g at 50 A/g based on the three-electrode configuration. As an electrode for a symmetric capacitor, a specific capacitance of 299 F/g at 0.5 A/g was exhibited, and the specific capacitance retained 96% of the initial capacity at 5 A/g after 10,000 cycles. Furthermore, under the power density of 249.6 W/kg in 6 mol/L KOH, a high energy density of 10.34 Wh/kg was obtained. The excellent charge storage capability benefited from its interconnected hierarchical pore structure with high accessible surface area and the suitable amount of oxygen-containing functional groups. Thus, an effective strategy to synthesize HPC for high-performance supercapacitors serves as a promising way of converting coal into advanced carbon materials.
