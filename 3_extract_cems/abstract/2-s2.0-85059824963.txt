Coordination polymers (CPs) and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely used in the preparation of hollow micro-/nanomaterials as templates and precursors. Herein, the mesoporous Ni 2 CoS 4 were prepared by means of a two-step hydrothermal strategy from new-type Ni/Co-nicotinate CPs-based bricks. The as-preparede Ni 2 CoS 4 electrode displays a high capacity (1466.8 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 ) and 70.1% capacity retention after 2000 cycles. The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device was assembled by using Ni 2 CoS 4 as positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as negative electrode, and the energy density of Ni 2 CoS 4 //AC ASC can reach 37.8 Wh kg −1 at the power density of 1066.8 W kg −1 . Meawhile, the Ni 2 CoS 4 //AC ASC also shows long-term stability up to 113.7% after 10,000 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performances indicate that as-obtained mesoporous Ni 2 CoS 4 can be a promising candidate as electrode material for supercapacitors.
