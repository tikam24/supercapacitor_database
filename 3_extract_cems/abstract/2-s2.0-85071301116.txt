This paper evaluates the cell balancing capabilities of several commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)supercapacitor chargers to facilitate the design and implementation of supercapacitor-based energy storage systems. Comprehensive simulations are performed using the device model provided by the manufacturer and an RC ladder circuit model capturing the porous electrode structure and charge redistribution process of supercapacitors. Simulation results show that the supercapacitor terminal voltage pattern is dependent on the supercapacitor initial condition characterized by the voltages across the RC branch capacitors. The supercapacitor equivalent series resistance (ESR)may significantly impact the terminal voltage fluctuation.
