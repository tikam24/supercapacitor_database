The Hybrid Electrical Energy Storage System (HESS) with supercapacitors in “GESITS” electric motorcycle offers greater power density and cycle life as well as a wider operating temperature range compared to batteries so as to maximize the existing regenerative braking features. In this study, the Four Switch Buck Boost Converter (FSBB) with Power Transfer is used as a current regulator to connect HESS. Fuzzy PID control is used to regulate the current that passes through the power transfer so that the braking force can be controlled based on the brake pull variable, vehicle speed and SOC supercapacitor. The results of the fuzzy control test with the MATLAB Fuzzy Designer obtained an average error of 1.44 %. While the results of the ITAE PID tuning method obtained a rise time of 3.33 seconds, a settling time of 3.11 seconds, an overshoot of 9.20 % and a steady state error of 2.20 %. From the results of the regenerative mode test, when given an input of 28-4 VDC, the average output voltage is 16.34 VDC with an average current of 8 A. While in the drive mode test with 28 VDC input, the average output voltage is 23.98 VDC and average current is 3.99 A with FSBB efficiency of 90.54 %.
