The problem of power management of a fuel cell system involving a hydrogen fuel cell with supercapacitors for applications with high instantaneous dynamic power is addressed in this paper. The design of the controller is based on the interconnection and damping assignment - passivity based control. This control strategy is well adapted but requires the load resistance value in real-time. As, in practical applications the load resistance is an unknown physical variable, a load resistance estimation is added in order to manage accurately the power flow and the fuel cell current dynamic. Experimental results are presented demonstrating that this alternative approach is viable.
