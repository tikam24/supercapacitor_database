Layered molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) owns graphene-like two-dimensional structure, and when used as the electrode material for energy storage devices, the intercalation of electrolyte ions is permitted. Herein, a simple dipping and drying method is employed to stack few-layered MoS2 nanosheets on a three-dimensional graphene network (3DGN). The structure measurement results indicate that the assembled hierarchical MoS2 nanosheets own expanded interlayer spacing (∼0.75 nm) and are stacked on the surface of 3DGN uncontinuously. The composite can achieve 110.57% capacitance retention after 4000 cycles of galvanostatic charge/discharge tests and 76.73% capacitance retention with increasing the current density from 1 A g−1 to 100 A g−1. Moreover, the asymmetric coin cell supercapacitor using MoS2@3DGN and active carbon as electrode materials is assembled. This device could achieve a working voltage window of 1.6 V along with the power and energy densities of 400.0–8001.6 W kg−1 and 36.43–1.12 Wh kg−1 respectively. The enhanced electrochemical performance can be attributed to: (1) the expanded interlayer spacing of hierarchical MoS2 nanosheets which can facilitate the fast intercalation/deintercalation of electrolyte cations, (2) the uncontinuous deposition of hierarchical MoS2 nanosheets which facilitates more contact between electrolyte and the section of MoS2 nanosheets to provide more gates for the intercalation/deintercalation.
