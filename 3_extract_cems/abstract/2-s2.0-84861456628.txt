In this paper, a study of the supercapacitors ageing process is presented. The originality of this paper is that the tests are made under conditions similar to those of an industrial application. A continuous cycling is applied in order to obtain these test conditions. The measurement is done, thanks to a test bench developed in our laboratory. More than 560,000 cycles have already been done, which corresponds to 325 cumulated days of continuous cycling. These tests allow to understand the ageing process of supercapacitors and to follow the evolution of theirs characteristics during their lifetime. The aim of this paper is to study the behavior of the cells, which compose the supercapacitors module (48V/112F). Â© 2012 IEEE.
