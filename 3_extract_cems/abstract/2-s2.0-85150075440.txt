The construction, energy storage capacity and characterization of a Graphene oxide/Copper iodide (GO/CuI) as electrode materials, which are perfect in transferring ions/electrons, are being studied within this work as high-efficiency supercapacitors (SCs). This electrode material is fabricated via two simple and facile Sonochemistry and Co-precipitation techniques. In order to investigate morphology, evaluating the specific surface area, phase and purification of synthesized nanocomposite, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), Raman spectroscopy, Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and identification techniques were exerted. Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Galvanostatic Charge-Discharge (GCD) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) were used in order to evaluate specific capacity, redox reaction, diffusion electron-ion and cyclic stability of nanocomposites. The capacitive performance of this electrode is observed in both acidic and neutral aqueous electrolytes. The GO/CuI electrode shows a highly specific capacity 115C g−1 (413 F g−1) and 95C g−1 (283 F g−1) for H2SO4 and Na2SO4, respectively at a current density of 1.5 A g−1. We are hereby hoping to present a novel and noble work, which is unprecedented in its approach, in introducing a new electrode in two different electrolytes as applied supercapacitors.
