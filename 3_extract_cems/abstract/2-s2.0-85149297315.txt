The development of industries has caused severe impacts on the environment and increased the demand of using energy. In this work, reduced graphene oxide-doped water hyacinth carbon aerogels (rGO/WHCA) were synthesized by cross-linking cellulose with poly(vinyl alcohol) as a binder and addition of graphene oxide (GO) as rGO precursors, followed by freeze-drying and pyrolysis techniques. The obtained materials were studied for adsorption of methylene blue (MB) in water and applied as electrodes for the supercapacitor. The impact of GO content on the characteristics, adsorption performance, and electrochemical properties of the rGO/WHCA were investigated. Besides, the concurrent effects of the adsorption time, and MB concentration on the adsorption capacity were evaluated via the response surface methodology according to the Boxâ€“Behnken model. The obtained rGO/WHCA materials exhibited ultralow density, high porosity, and an abundance of meso- and micropores structures. Especially, rGO/WHCA materials showed a great ability for removing MB in water with the highest adsorption capacity up to 95.03 mg/g after 420 min with the initial MB concentration of 150 ppm at pH 9 and performed the electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) in a three-electrode system with an outstanding specific capacitance of 272.08 F/g at current density of 0.5 A/g. The obtained results open a potential pathway of using biomass sources, like water hyacinth, for solving environmental issues and the demand for energy storage.
