Biomass-derived porous carbon materials were selectively and controllably prepared by carbonization of hay slag (HS) and activation with ZnCl2 combined with Mg(NO3)2 6H2O. The prepared porous carbon materials had an apparent multi-pore structure and a large specific surface area. In a 6mol/L KOH with a current density of 0.25A/g, the specific capacitance of the prepared sample was 220F/g. Further study showed that the optimal pore size range of porous carbon materials for electrode preparation was 0.8-1.2nm. At the same time, the porous carbon material had a good adsorption capacity for CO2, and the adsorbent performance was 3.09mmol/g at 0Â°C and 1 bar. Adsorbents with the pore size range of 0.5-0.8nm had the best CO2 adsorption performance. This integrated strategy study expanded biomass-derived porous carbon materials with controllable pore structures to match different application strategies.
