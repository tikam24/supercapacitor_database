In this paper, poly3-acrylamidophenylboronic acid crosslinked acrylamide hydrogel (P(AAPBA-co-AM) gel) with super tensile characteristics was prepared by acrylamide polymerization using 3-aminophenylboric acid as the raw material, which was used in flexible all-solid-state supercapacitors. By altering the crosslinking density, the gel’s tensile strength was optimized. It can be used as an ideal safe and non-toxic solid-state electrolyte for supercapacitors due to its ability to absorb aqueous electrolytes. The specific capacitance of the flexible supercapacitor is 116 F g−1 and the energy density is 16.11 Wh kg−1. Additionally, the gel created with a solvent content of 65% may withstand a 5000% strain under 170 kPa stress while retaining electrochemical characteristics at various bending angles. This gel has exceptional tensile deformability, making it suitable for supercapacitors with varying needs. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
