The concern for climate change and energy consumption has increased the demand for renewable energy production considerably. Marine energy sources attract attention because of their high energy density. Wave energy is an attractive renewable energy source with large potential. Due to the nature of the ocean waves, a linear wave energy converter generates intermittent power. It is therefore crucial to regularize the power before connecting to the grid. Energy storage systems present effective ways to minimize the power fluctuations and deliver a steady power to the grid. In this paper, we present an energy management control system with a dynamic rate limiter. The method is applied to control a hybrid energy storage system, combining battery and supercapacitor, with a fully active topology controlled by the power converters. The results show that the method is able to control the charging and discharging states of the battery and the supercapacitor, and minimize the power fluctuation to the grid. The algorithm ensures low losses by shifting the required power and the stored power smoothly over the energy storage system.
