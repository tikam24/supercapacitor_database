Mn2O3 nanomaterials have been recently composing a variety of electrochemical systems like fuel cells, supercapacitors, etc., due to their high specific capacitance, low cost, abundance and environmentally benign nature. In this work, mesoporous Mn2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized by manganese acetate, citric acid and sodium hydroxide through a hydrothermal process at 150 °C for 3 h. The synthesized mesoporous Mn2O3 NPs were thoroughly characterized in terms of their morphology, surfaces, as well as their crystalline, electrochemical and electrochemical properties. For supercapacitor applications, the synthesized mesoporous Mn2O3 NP-based electrode accomplished an excellent specific capacitance (Csp) of 460 F·g-1 at 10 mV·s-1 with a good electrocatalytic activity by observing good electrochemical properties in a 6 M KOH electrolyte. The excellent Csp might be explained by the improvement of the surface area, porous surface and uniformity, which might favor the generation of large active sites and a fast ionic transport over the good electrocatalytic surface of the Mn2O3 electrode. The fabricated supercapacitors exhibited a good cycling stability after 5000 cycles by maintaining ~83% of Csp.
