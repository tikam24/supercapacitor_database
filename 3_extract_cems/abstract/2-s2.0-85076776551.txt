The unceasing oscillations of ocean waves have potential energy, which can be converted to useful electrical energy with the help of linear generators. But these oscillating waves have intermittent power, which pose a major challenge for a grid connection. As a solution to this problem, a supercapacitor is proposed for short-term energy storage for smoothing out the fluctuation. A complete grid tied wave-to-wire system is modelled in the MATLAB/Simulink environment, which comprises an Archimedes wave swing wave energy converter, a permanent magnet linear generator, voltage source converters, and a supercapacitor. Converters are controlled to absorb the maximum power from the waves and to minimize the generator losses by controlling the d- and q-axis currents. An improved control strategy is proposed to keep the dc-link and the point of common coupling voltages at a fixed level.
