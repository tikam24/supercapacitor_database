Vertical-standing arrays have aroused great enthusiasm as electrode materials for supercapacitors in recent years owing to their structural and compositional characteristics. Although significant efforts have been made in the construction of vertical-standing arrays with tailored compositions and architectures, an in-depth understanding of the relevant structureâ€“activity relationships has not yet been reviewed in detail. Herein, recent important progress in controllably synthesizing vertical-standing arrays as well as their application as supercapacitors is reviewed. Afterward, promising strategies to improve the electrochemical performance of vertical-standing arrays are discussed. Finally, the challenges and possible directions for developing vertical-standing arrays with outstanding performance are outlined. This review provides important guidelines for designing and regulating vertical-standing arrays and constructing desirable electrode materials for future electrochemical energy storage.
