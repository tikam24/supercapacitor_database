Figure 1c is drawn incorrectly in the original publication, because it does not represent the full number of solvent molecules that solvate cations and anions in traditional salt/solvent electrolyte systems. The corrected figure is shown below. Since Figure 1c describes the behavior in conventional solvents, which is not the main focus of the article, it has no influence on the remaining discussion, which is focused purely on ionic liquids.
