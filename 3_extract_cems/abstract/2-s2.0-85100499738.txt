Effective hybridization of Mn oxide with polyaniline (PANI) have exhibited promising potential in improving the electrochemical performances of supercapacitors. Herein, MnOx/PANI hybrid electrode is fabricated by in situ polymerization of aniline on the oxidative MnOx particles via a facile immersion process. The hybrid electrode delivers a high specific capacitance of 647 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, which is higher than that of MnOx electrode (56.0 F g−1 at 1 A g−1). Moreover, the hybrid electrode shows high rate capability and long-term cycling stability. Such excellent energy storage characteristics are attributed to the unique electrode structure, in which the porous network integrated by short PANI nanorod arrays facilitates the electrolyte access, and in situ polymerization enhances effectively the interaction between MnOx and PANI. A flexible all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor based on the hybrid electrode was then assembled, which delivered a specific energy of 37 Wh kg−1 at a specific power of 800 W kg−1, and excellent cycling ability. This work provides an effective approach for building a high-performance flexible supercapacitor electrode.
