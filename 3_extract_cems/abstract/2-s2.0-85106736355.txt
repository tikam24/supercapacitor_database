In this study, mesoporous nickel cobaltate (NiCo2O4) nanomaterials were loaded onto nickel foam through a simple and environment-friendly reagent assisted hydrothermal method. The impacts of reagents on the micro-morphology and electrochemical capacitive properties were studied. The NiCo2O4 nanoneedle arrays prepared with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as the auxiliary reagent exhibited a relatively higher specific surface area, convenient charge transport channel, excellent specific capacitance (1153.2 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1), remarkable rate performance (10 A g-1, 812 F g-1) and good cycling stability (75% of the initial value is retained at 10 A g-1 after 1000 cycles). The asymmetric supercapacitor assembled by the optimized NiCo2O4 nanomaterial as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode provides an energy density of 22.5 W h kg-1 at 800 W kg-1, and displays an excellent cycle performance of 97.1% after 1000 cycles at 1 A g-1. It is suggested that the CTAB-assisted nanoneedle array-structured NiCo2O4 electrode material could be a potential candidate for supercapacitors.
