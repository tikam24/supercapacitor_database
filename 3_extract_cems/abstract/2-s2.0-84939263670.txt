Two metal nitrides, TiN porous layers and Fe<inf>2</inf>N nanoparticles, are grown uniformly with the assistance of atomic layer deposition on vertically aligned graphene nanosheets and used as the cathode and anode for solid-state supercapacitors, respectively. Full cells are constructed and show good flexibility, high-rate capability, and 98% capacitance retention after 20 000 cycles.
