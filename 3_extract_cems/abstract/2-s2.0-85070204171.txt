In the present research work, we reported the nanocomposite having flower shaped morphology as electrode by the combination of metal (Cu) nanoparticles, metal oxide (ZnO nanorods) with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) for electrochemical super capacitor applications by using one pot synthesis method. The nanocomposite was characterized by XRD, Infrared, Raman spectroscopies and morphological studies were done using SEM and TEM. The electrochemical properties of nanocomposites were studied by measuring the specific capacitance using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge techniques in different electrolyte solutions, among them 3.0 M KOH solution showed high capacitance. The experimental results, indicated that the homogeneous distribution of ZnO nanorods and Cu nanoparticles in rGO, which provides the short path for electrons transport and ions diffusion. The specific capacitance value achieved for nanocomposite is 365.5 F/g. From the studies, it can be concluded that the nanocomposite is a promising electrode material for electrochemical super capacitor applications.
