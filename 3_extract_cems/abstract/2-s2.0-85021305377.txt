Prussian blue, which typically has a three-dimensional network of zeolitic feature, draw much attention in recent years. Besides their applications in electrochemical sensors and electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and electrochromism, Prussian blue and its derivatives are receiving increasing research interest in the field of electrochemical energy storage due to their simple synthetic procedure, high theoretical specific capacity, non-toxic nature as well as low price. In this review, we give a general summary and evaluation of the recent advances in the study of Prussian blue and its derivatives for batteries and supercapacitors, including synthesis, micro/nano-structures and electrochemical properties.
