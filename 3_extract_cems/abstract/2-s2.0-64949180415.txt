The activated carbon wound supercapacitors with TEABF4/propylene carbonate (PC) and TEABF4/acetonitrile (AN) electrolytes were prepared. The effects of the electrolyte and temperature on the capacitance behavior were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and constant current charge-discharge. Compared with the PC-based supercapacitor, the AN-based supercapacitor has higher capacitance and lower equivalent serial resistance (R ES) at discharge currents ranging from 5 to 1 000 mA and 25 °C. Moreover, temperature effects are more prominent for PC-based supercapacitor than for AN-based supercapacitor. When the measurement temperature ranges from 60 °C to -40 °C the capacitance changes from 5.1 to 2.5 F and R ES changes from 135 to 876 mΩ for the PC-based supercapacior, while the AN-based supercapacitor shows less change in capacitance and R ES. Thus AN-based supercapacitor exhibits excellent power characteristics and temperature property. © 2009 Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.
