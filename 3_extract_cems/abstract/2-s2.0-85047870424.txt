A supercapacitor storage system (SCSS) is used for improving the dynamic performances of a microgrid (MG) fed by a self-excited induction generator (SEIG), in the case of the direct start-up of an induction motor (IM) of comparable power. The primary control system contains a voltage source inverter (VSI) with a dump load (DL), to which the SCSS is added. The control strategy for the SCSS consists of injecting power into the VSI DC-link when, because of the overload created by the IM, the DC voltage decreases under the acceptable limit. Thus, the overall performance of the SEIGsupplied MG is significantly improved. Simulations and experimental results accomplished on a laboratory-scale MG validate the effectiveness of the proposed control structure.
