Graphene oxide (GO) has been used as an effective dye effluent adsorbent and it is used for an effective application as a supercapacitor electrode material. The conventional dye effluent treatment utilizes a series of complex processes with results in a huge deposition of sludge. The adsorbent based dye effluent treatment is an option to treat dye effluent due to the highly turbid nature of dye effluent. Instead of using a series of chemicals to treat dye effluent, the GO can be a sensible entrant owing to its exceptional surface area and its scalable retreatment approach, whereas the former chemicals leave undesirable sludge.
