Herein, Ni-Co selenides (Ni-Co-Se) with both hollow nanospheres and nanoparticles surrounded by thin nanosheets are fabricated. The obtained selenides are investigated as electrode materials of supercapacitor and show enhanced performance. Under optimized conditions, the specific capacitance can reach 1494.9/1192.4 F g−1 at 1/20 A g−1, which shows a desirable rate performance with retention up to 79.8%. In addition, the initial capacitance can remain about 81.5% over 10000 cycles, demonstrating stable cycling performance. For Ni-Co-Se, co-existence of the hollow nanospheres and the nanoparticles surrounded by thin nanosheets can facilitate the exposure of the active site and the transportation of electrolyte and electrons. The hollow nanospheres may not only participate in the reaction together with the nanoparticles but also play the role of reservoir to compensate the capacitance decay timely. Therefore, the desirable electrochemical performance is ascribed to the unique structure and the resulting high conductivity. The above attractive results ensure that the Ni-Co selenides are the hopeful candidates for sustainable energy storage.
