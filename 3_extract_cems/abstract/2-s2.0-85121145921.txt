Spinel nickel-cobalt sulfide (NiCo2S4) supported on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was fabricated through a facile one-step hydrothermal method for energy storage applications. The distribution of the NiCo2S4 nanoparticles on the rGO surface was found to improve the supercapacitive performance of the assembled device. The NiCo2S4/rGO nanocomposite exhibits outstanding electrochemical behavior with a capacity (C)/specific capacitance (Cs) of 536 C g−1/1072 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. To further investigate the electrochemical behavior of the NiCo2S4/rGO nanocomposite, a hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) was constructed utilizing a NiCo2S4/rGO positive electrode and an activated carbon (AC) negative electrode. The assembled NiCo2S4/rGO//AC HSC results in outstanding specific energy (Es) of 41.52 Wh kg−1 at a specific power (Ps) of 1067 W kg−1 relative to previously reported NiCo2S4-based supercapacitors (SCs). The HSC had an Es of 36.51 Wh kg−1 at a Ps of 2065 W kg−1. Additionally, excellent cycling stability of 82% capacitance retention after 3000 repeated charge/discharge cycles was accomplished. These realized results confirm that the NiCo2S4/rGO nanocomposite is a suitable electrode material for SCs.
