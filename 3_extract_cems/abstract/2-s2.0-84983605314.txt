In this study, we report a facile fabrication of ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) nanosheet hybrid composite, α-Fe 2 O 3 nanosheet@Ni(OH) 2 nanosheet, by a two-step hydrothermal method to achieve high specific capacitance and good stability performance at high charging/discharging rates when serving as electrode material of supercapacitors. The α-Fe 2 O 3 @Ni(OH) 2 hybrid electrode not only has a smooth decrease of the specific capacitance with increasing current density, compared with the sharp decline of single component of Ni(OH) 2 electrode, but also presents excellent rate capability with a specific capacitance of 356 F/g at a current density of 16 A/g and excellent cycling stability (a capacity retention of 93.3% after 500 cycles), which are superior to the performances of Ni(OH) 2 with a lower specific capacitance of 132 F/g and a lower capacity retention of 81.8% at 16 A/g. The results indicate such hybrid structure would be promising as excellent electrode material for good performances at high current densities in the future.
