In this paper, we reported a synthesis of cobalt metal-organic framework spheres (Co-MOF) and Co-MOF/titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx) directly on Ni foam, which could be utilized as a novel binder-free electrode material for supercapacitors. The influence of intercalation pseudocapacitance between Ti3C2Tx and Co-MOF on Ni foam was evaluated by various electrochemical techniques. The as-prepared mesoporous electrodes exhibited outstanding electrochemical performance in 3 M KOH electrolyte. A maximum gravimetric capacitance of 2872.5 F g−1 and 3741 F g−1 were obtained for Co-MOF@Ni and Co-MOF/Ti3C2Tx@Ni, respectively. The voids in the Co-MOF and the good conductivity of layered Ti3C2Tx enhanced the active sites and afforded fast ion transport. This work provides a new direction to promote the Ti3C2Tx based materials for high-performance binder-free supercapacitor electrodes.
