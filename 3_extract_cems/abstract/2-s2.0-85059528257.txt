The rise of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) that are distinctive class of porous materials has attained enormous consideration during the last decades owing to their controllable structures, high surface areas and tunable pore sizes. The applications of MOFs range from the traditional gas separation and storage, drug delivery, sensors and catalysis to the emerging field of energy storage devices, such as high energy density rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors. Metal-organic frameworks are excellent candidates for electrode materials in electrochemical energy storage devices due to their irreplaceable morphology, appropriate functional linkers, high specific surface area and metal sites. Herein, a brief review is carried out on recent development in the utilization of metal-organic framework based materials for rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors, which would be the prevailing guidance to the materials design and optimization for battery community and electrochemical energy storage applications.
