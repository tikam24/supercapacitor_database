In films of conducting polymers, the electrochemical reaction(s) drive the simultaneous variation of different material properties (reaction multifunctionality). Here, we present a parallel study of actuation-sensing-energy storage triple functionality of polypyrrole (PPy) blends with dodecylbenzenesulfonate (DBS-), PPy/DBS, without and with inclusion of polyethyleneoxide, PPy-PEO/DBS. The characterization of the response of both materials in aqueous solutions of four different salts indicated that all of the actuating, sensing and charge storage responses were, independent of the electrolyte, present for both materials, but stronger for the PPy-PEO/DBS films: 1.4× higher strains, 1.3× higher specific charge densities, 2.5× higher specific capacitances and increased ion-sensitivity towards the studied counterions. For both materials, the reaction energy, the material potential and the strain variations adapt to and sense the electrical and chemical (exchanged cation) conditions. The driving and the response of actuation, sensing and charge can be controlled/read, simultaneously, via just two connecting wires. Only the cooperative actuation of chemical macromolecular motors from functional cells has such chemical multifunctionality.
