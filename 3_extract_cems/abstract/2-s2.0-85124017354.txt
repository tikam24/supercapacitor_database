Therein we reported a novel nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dotâ€“modified polyaniline (NGQD/PANI) as supercapacitor electrodes through in situ polymerization. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy were used to characterize morphology and microstructure of the samples, and the electrochemical properties of NGQDs/PANI were evaluated as electrode. The NGQDs/PANI exhibits a high specific capacitance up to 506 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g, and high cycling stability that 80.2% of its initial capacitance over 5000 cycles maintains at a current density of 5 A/g. The obtained NGQDs/PANI materials are valuable for promising energy storage device utilization in future supercapacitor fields.
