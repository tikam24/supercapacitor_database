Micro and flexible supercapacitors are promising energy storage devices that were prerequisite in smart-garment system. However, the electrochemical performance of micro-supercapacitor is lower than that of batteries. Herein, RGO/MWCNT/CF micro-supercapacitor was prepared via laser-machining of graphene oxide(GO) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes(MWCNT) on the cotton fabric(CF). The GO was reduced and MWCNT was fixed on the graphene layer when the laser sculptured the in-plane pattern on the cotton fabric. This nanomaterial shows high electrical conductivity(7.19×104 S/m), attributed to the combined nanomaterials increasing the integrality of the conducting network. The best monolithic supercapacitor exhibited an area capacitance of 24 mF/cm2 in PVA-LiCl electrolyte(PVA=polyvinyl alcohol). The energy density attained 1.22 mW•h/kg and the power density reached 61 mW•h/kg. Micro-supercapacitors exhibited remarkably high mechanical fiexibility and showed a good cycling stability, with 92% retention of the specific capacity after 1000 cycles.
