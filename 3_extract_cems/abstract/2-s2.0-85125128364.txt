Pyrite iron sulfide (FeS2) is a fascinating electrode material for energy reserve devices because of its high theoretical capacity, non-polluting nature and abundant resources. However, the practical application has been extremely inhibited owing to its poor rate capacity and short cyclability caused by volume change during charge/discharge processes. In this article, a novel nanocomposite that is hollow FeS2 nanospheres encapsulated in N/S co-doped carbon nanofibers (FeS2CNFs) was synthesized through electrostatic spinning. The FeS2CNFs nanocomposite demonstrates a terrific specific capacity of 511 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 for all-solid-state supercapacitors. The FeS2CNFs as electrode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIB) displays a specific capacity of 827.7 mAh g−1 and possesses a capacity of 490.6 mAh g−1 at 0.05 A g−1 after 200 cycles. The results indicate that this encapsulated structure can guarantee the integrity of electrode materials. And the abundant defects in carbon nanofibers caused by N/S co-doping may increase electrochemical reaction sites to facilitate charge transfer. The N/S co-doped FeS2CNFs nanocomposite exhibits a great potential for applying in SIB and supercapacitors.
