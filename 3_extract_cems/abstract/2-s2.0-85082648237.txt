Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have great potential in supercapacitors (SCs). Herein, we reported for first synthesis of Mn doped Co(OH)2 nanosheets via a hydrothermal decomposition of a mixed aqueous solution of MnCl2·6H2O, CoCl2·6H2O and CO(NH2)2 at 200 °C for 6 h without using any template or surfactant. The synergetic effect of unique 2D structure and Mn doping is favorable for electron transportation and ion penetration. The Mn doped Co(OH)2 nanosheets-based electrode displayed a high specific capacitance of 1915.88 F·g−1 at 1.0 A·g−1 and superior cycle performance of 93.5% capacitance retention over 5,000 charge–discharge cycles at 10.0 A·g−1. The present synthetic route provides a simple and facile method for large-scale production of Mn doped Co(OH)2 nanosheets for electrochemical energy storage.
