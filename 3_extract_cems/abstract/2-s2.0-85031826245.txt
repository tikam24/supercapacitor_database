Fuel cells, Li-ion batteries, and supercapacitors are attracting extensive attention, and it is highly desired to integrate the advantages of these devices into one system. Herein, a multifunction Li-carbon system was designed by using an aqueous-nonaqueous dual electrolyte to combine a nitrogen-doped ordered mesoporous carbon cathode with a metallic lithium anode. It is demonstrated that the nitrogen-doped ordered mesoporous carbon exhibits high performance in various applications of O2 reduction reaction, supercapacitors, and H2 evolution reaction, which makes the Li-carbon system exhibit multifunctionality. When operated in the ambient with O2, the system can work as a Li-air fuel cell or/and rechargeable battery with high energy density. When operated in an environment without O2, the battery can be used as a Li-ion supercapacitor which exhibits long-term cycling stability and improved energy performance. Finally, this cell can also be applied as a Li-water fuel cell for H2 evolution.
