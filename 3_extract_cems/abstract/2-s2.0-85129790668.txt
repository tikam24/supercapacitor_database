Flexible supercapacitors have attracted more and more attention and research because they can be used as energy storage devices for future flexible electronic devices. In the existing research, graphene has been used to make supercapacitor electrodes, but usually these electrodes have very low specific capacitance or flexibility. Here, a three-dimensional graphene hydrogel for the fabrication of flexible supercapacitors was presented, and the preparation of flexible supercapacitors based on three-dimensional graphene hydrogels was given. Through the research, we find that the prepared flexible supercapacitor has excellent capacitance characteristics, such as high specific capacitance of 168F/g and excellent mechanical flexibility. This study shows that the three-dimensional graphene macro structure has great potential in the preparation of high-performance flexible energy storage devices.
