One of the most widely used and studied hybrid electrical energy storage system (HESS) configurations has been the combination of batteries and supercapacitors (SCs). Advantages expected from the combination of batteries and SCs include the extension of battery life, rapid energy storage, suitability as a HESS for intermittent energy sources, and reduced environmental impact. Various topologies are used to connect the batteries and SCs. These can be classified as passive, active, and semi-active. In passive topology the storage elements are interconnected directly while in an active topology, the storage elements are connected via DC-DC converters. In a semi-active topology, a single DC-DC converter is used to connect the pre-connected storage elements to the load. In this paper, four different HESS models have been compared and analysed for the Electric Vehicle (EV) application with respect to the DC-DC converter arrangements and various scenarios of placement of battery pack and SC modules. However, the viability of HESS implementation depends on several technical and economic factors discussed here.
