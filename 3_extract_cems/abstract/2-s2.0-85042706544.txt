The porous carbon, prepared from tetramethylol acetylenediurea by activation of KOH, were applied in electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC). The carbonization and activated temperature had a significant influence both on porosity structure and electrochemical performances. Results showed that the micropores enriched on the surface of TA-850-650.The specific capacitance of TA-850-650 could reach 527 F/g at 0.2 A/g.
