This paper reports the first wood derived nitrogen-doped porous carbon-polyaniline (NKWC-PANI) composites, prepared with low-cost, environmentally friendly, and renewable wood wastes as raw materials, for supercapacitor electrode materials. Benefiting from high electrochemical activity of wood derived nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NKWC) and the synergetic effect between NKWC and polyaniline (PANI) particles, the electrode with the as-obtained NKWC-PANI composite as active material exhibits significantly higher specific capacitance than the electrodes based on pure NKWC and PANI. Moreover, this novel NKWC-PANI composite also shows comparable maximum specific capacitance (347 F g<sup>-1</sup> at 2 A g<sup>-1</sup>) and energy density (44.4 W h kg<sup>-1</sup> at 922 W kg<sup>-1</sup>) to some similar carbon-PANI composites. This work offers a promising method to produce carbon based composite electrode materials with high performance and low cost.
