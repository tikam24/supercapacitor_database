Voltages of electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC) modules vary rather wider than traditional secondary batteries. Although EDLCs should desirably be cycled in a voltage range as wide as possible to achieve a high energy utilization ratio, the wide voltage variation of EDLC modules impairs the performance of DCâ€“DC converters. To address such issues, previous works reported series-parallel reconfiguration techniques, which are roughly divided into balance- and unbalance-shift circuits. However, conventional balance-shift circuits are not applicable to modules comprising odd number cells, impairing modularity. Unbalance-shift circuits, on the other hand, unavoidably cause cell voltage imbalance that reduces energy utilization ratio. This paper proposes a novel series-parallel reconfigurable EDLC module with cell voltage equalization capability. The proposed reconfigurable EDLC module is applicable to any number of cells, realizing good modularity. Furthermore, all cells in the proposed module can be charged and discharged uniformly without generating cell voltage imbalance, achieving an improved energy utilization ratio compared with conventional techniques. A five-cell module prototype was built for experimental verification. While the module voltage varied between 1.04 and 2.83 V, all cells discharged from 2.5 to 0.3 V. The result is equivalent to a 98.6% energy utilization ratio.
