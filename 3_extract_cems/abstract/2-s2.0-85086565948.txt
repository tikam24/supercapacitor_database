High-performance electrode materials are required to fulfill the escalating urge of energy storage and the realization of supercapacitors as cutting-edge energy storage devices. This research work presents a facile synthesis of a ternary hybrid material PANI/GNP/MnO2 using graphene nanoplatelets (GNP), MnO2 nanowires, and aniline monomer through polymerization for its utility in supercapacitor application. XRD analysis confirms the presence of the individual crystal structures and phases of the constituents and their mutual contribution in a ternary hybrid material. FE-SEM results reveal that PANI nanofibers and MnO2 nanowires are decorated on the dispersed GNP. N2 sorption analysis manifests the mesoporous nature of the prepared hybrid. PANI/GNP/MnO2-based electrode owns 992.6 F/g specific capacitance and 34.5 Wh/kg energy density as well as 51.16% coulombic efficiency and 124.8 W/kg power density at 0.5 A/g. It also exhibits 88.86% coulombic efficiency and 1251 W/kg power density at 5 A/g. The obtained high capacitance, coulombic efficiency, reversibility, and large energy, and power densities make PANI/GNP/MnO2 ternary hybrid electrode as a promising supercapacitor electrode material.
