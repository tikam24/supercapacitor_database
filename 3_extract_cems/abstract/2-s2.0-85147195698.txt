Environmental concerns such as global warming and air pollution have increased mainly due to the high energy consumption all over the world. In order to reduce the greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions from transportation sector, fuel cell vehicles offer a clean and highly energy-efficient alternative. In fuel cell vehicles, an energy storage unit such as a battery and/or a supercapacitor (SC) is required in high power demands such as accelerating,uphill and start-up conditions. In this study, a mathematical model a fuel cell vehicle including both a supercapacitor and a battery was developed and its drive cycle simulation was conducted to determine the vehicle performance. As a result of the drive cycle simulation, FCEVs equipped with battery and supercapacitor as storage units, energy efficiency has increased according to the developed simulation algorithm.
