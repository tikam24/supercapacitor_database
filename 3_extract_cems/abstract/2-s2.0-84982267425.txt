A novel approach was developed to prepare hollow polypyrrole (PPy) nanospheres and nitrogen-doped graphene/hollow PPy nanospheres (NG/H-PPy) composites. In this process, uniform poly (methyl methacrylate-butyl methacrylate-methacrylic acid) (PMMA-PBMA-PMAA) latex microspheres as sacrificial templates were synthesized by using an emulsion polymerization method. Then, hollow PPy nanospheres were obtained on the surface of PMMA-PBMA-PMAA microspheres by in situ chemical oxidative polymerization. Finally, H-PPy was embedded in NG layers successfully through a simple approach. The nanobeads have been characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectra, and Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR). Different electrochemical methods including cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) have been applied to study the electrochemical properties. The specific capacitance of NG/H-PPy composites based on the three-electrode system is as high as 575 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and enhanced stability about 90.1 % after 500 cycles, indicating that the composite has an impressive capacitance and excellent cycling performance.
