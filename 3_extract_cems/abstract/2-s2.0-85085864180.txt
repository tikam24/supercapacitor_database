The article reviews the recent progress of electrochemical techniques on synthesizing nano-/microstructures as supercapacitor electrodes. With a history of more than a century, electrochemical techniques have evolved from metal plating since their inception to versatile synthesis tools for electrochemically active materials of diverse morphologies, compositions, and functions. The review begins with tutorials on the operating mechanisms of five commonly used electrochemical techniques, including cyclic voltammetry, potentiostatic deposition, galvanostatic deposition, pulse deposition, and electrophoretic deposition, followed by thorough surveys of the nano-/microstructured materials synthesized electrochemically. Specifically, representative synthesis mechanisms and the state-of-the-art electrochemical performances of exfoliated graphene, conducting polymers, metal oxides, metal sulfides, and their composites are surveyed. The article concludes with summaries of the unique merits, potential challenges, and associated opportunities of electrochemical synthesis techniques for electrode materials in supercapacitors.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]
