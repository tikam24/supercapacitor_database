In this study, manganese-containing porous carbon was synthesized from jujube shells by two-step carbonization and activation and was then covered with Ti3C2Tx to obtain double-doped biomass composites. In order to improve the interfacial properties (surface tension and wettability) between Ti3C2Tx and porous carbon, the effects of two media (deionized water and acetone solution) on the electrochemical properties of the composites were compared. The acetone solution changed the surface rheology of Ti3C2Tx and porous carbon, and the decreased surface tension and the increased wettability contributed to the ordered growth of 2D-Ti3C2Tx on the surface of the porous carbon. Raman analysis shows the relatively higher graphitization degree of JSPC&Ti3C2Tx (acetone). Compared with JSPC&Ti3C2Tx, JSPC&Ti3C2Tx (acetone) can maintain better rectangle-like properties even at a higher scanning rate. Under the effect of the acetone solution, the pseudocapacitive ratio of JSPC&Ti3C2Tx (acetone) increased from 10.1% to 30.7%. At the current density of 0.5 A/g, the specific capacitance of JSPC&Ti3C2Tx (acetone) achieved 96.83 F/g, and the specific capacitance of 58.17 F/g was maintained even at the high current density (10 A/g), which shows excellent magnification. Under the condition of the current density of 10 A/g, JSPC&Ti3C2Tx (acetone) can obtain a power density of 52,000 W/kg while maintaining an energy density of 8.74 Wh/kg. After 2000 cycles, the symmetrical button battery assembled with this material can still have a capacitance retention rate of more than 90%. This method realized the deep utilization of green and low-cost raw materials by using biomass as the precursor of composite materials and promoted the further development of carbon-based supercapacitor electrode materials.
