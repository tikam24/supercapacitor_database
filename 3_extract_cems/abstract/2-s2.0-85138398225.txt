A variety of mixed metal sulfides of MnxSn1-xS2 nanoflowers were synthesized by a facile one-step template-free solvothermal method and their ability of capacitive energy storage were evaluated as potential supercapacitor electrode materials. Substitutional solid solutions of MnxSn1-xS2 with various chemical compositions can easily be produced by varying the Mn/Sn molar ratio in the reactants. Among these sulfides, Mn0.33Sn0.67S2 exhibits the highest electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance of 1118.92 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, great rate capacity and superb cycling stability. Because of its increased electrochemical active sites, altered microstructure, and improved electrical conductivity brought on by lattice distortion and the synergistic effect of elemental substitution, Mn0.33Sn0.67S2 exhibits good performance. What's more, an asymmetric supercapacitor of Mn0.33Sn0.67S2//AC (activated carbon) possesses a high energy density (15.68 Wh kg−1 at 150.1 W kg−1). Thus, Mn doped tin sulfides highlight widely applicable to advance high-performance energy storage technology.
