With advancement in technology and rising population, the demand for energy is increasing day by day. Renewable energy is solution as of now. To use renewable energy on a commercial scale, energy storage is important. The latest device for energy storage which can be used is supercapacitors and it is required to be used along with a fuel cell or battery. Electrode electrolyte research is common for supercapacitor but very less research was found pertaining to separator. This paper presents the study related to layered separators consisting of polyethylene and seven different separators, viz gauntlet, base paper, PVC, paper, fiber glass absorbent glass mat, soft fiber glass absorbent glass mat and auto fiber glass. Focus was on layered separators which have hardly being studied. Some good combinations of layered separators are suggested based on 'Separator index' a new term suggested in this paper for selection of separators.
