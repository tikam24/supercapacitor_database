This paper presents scaling laws for the integral capacitance of electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs)supported by rigorous analysis and experimental data for porous carbon-based electrodes. First,dimensionless similarity parameters were identified based on dimensional analysis of the modifiedPoisson-Boltzmann model for binary and symmetric electrolytes. Then, a correlation for the equilibriumpotential at the Stern/diffuse layer interface near planar electrodes and near cylindrical and sphericalpores was obtained as a function of previously identified dimensionless numbers for a wide range ofparameters. Similarly, an analytical expression was proposed for the dimensionless double layer inte-gral capacitance of planar electrodes. Finally, scaling analysis was applied to experimentally measuredintegral capacitance of mesoporous carbon electrodes with a wide range of morphology and differentelectrolytes. To maximize the integral areal capacitance, the electrolyte should have small ion effectivediameter and large dielectric constant. The electrode pore diameter should be tailored to match the iondiameter. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
