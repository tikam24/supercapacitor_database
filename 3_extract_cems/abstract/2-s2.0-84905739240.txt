We report on a one-step method for preparing nitrogen doped (N-doped) meso-/microporous hybrid carbon material (NCF) via the heat treatment of used cigarette filters under a nitrogen-containing atmosphere. The used cigarette filter, which is mostly composed of cellulose acetate fibers, can be transformed into a porous carbon material that contains both the mesopores and micropores spontaneously. The unique self-developed pore structure allowed a favorable pathway for electrolyte permeation and contact probability, resulting in the extended rate capability for the supercapacitor. The NCF exhibited a better rate capability and higher specific capacitance (153.8 F g-1) compared to that of conventional activated carbon (125.0 F g-1) at 1 A g -1. These findings indicate that the synergistic combination of well-developed meso-/micropores, an enlarged surface area and pseudocapacitive behavior leads to the desired supercapacitive performance. The prepared carbon material is capable of reproducing its electrochemical performance during the 6000 cycles required for charge and discharge measurements. Â© 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.
