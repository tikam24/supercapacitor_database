It is well-known that the excellent cycling stability and high energy density of electrode materials is very important for supercapacitors. However, their actual performance falls far behind and does not satisfy the practical demand. In this study, we synthesized NiCo2S4nanowire bundles on a nickel foamviafacile hydrothermal routes. The as-obtained product as an electrode material possesses excellent specific surface area, which suggests that numerous active sites on the electrode surface can shorten the diffusion channel of ions. The assembled asymmetric supercapacitor delivers an energy density of 57.36 W h kg−1at 1412.92 W kg−1. Also, it exhibits excellent mechanical stability even at different bending angles.
