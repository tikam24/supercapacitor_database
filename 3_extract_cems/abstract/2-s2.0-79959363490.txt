Electrodeposited thin films of manganese dioxide, prepared using chronoamperometry on a platinum substrate in an electrolyte of MnSO4 in H2SO4, possess a significantly higher capacitance compared to the literature materials (>2000 F g-1 which is at least a 250% increase in performance) when cycled over a 0.8 V potential window in an aqueous electrolyte of 0.5 M Na2SO4. This excellent performance is discussed in terms of the manganese dioxide electrodeposition mechanism, in particular the growth mechanism under the preferred slow mass transport of electro-active species, and its effects on morphology. Furthermore, the origin of the enhanced capacitance is discussed, in which case we have proposed arises from contributions made by hydroxyl groups on the manganese dioxide nano-particulate surface, in addition to the fast redox reactions that are necessary for pseudo-capacitance.
