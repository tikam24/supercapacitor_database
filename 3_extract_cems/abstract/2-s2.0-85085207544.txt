Nanocomposites of heteroatom doped graphene with metal or metal oxides have been enormously explored due to their promising usage in the field of supercapacitors. Metal oxides, due to their huge availability, high conductivity and excellent pseudocapacitive properties are found to be most suitable for such energy storage applications. Also, doping graphene with nitrogen is an effective way to tailor its properties, thus making it potential candidate for energy storing devices. Herein, we have focussed on recent advancements made on various metal oxides like monometal oxides of manganese, nickel, iron, cobalt, and their binary, ternary oxides with nitrogen-doped graphene, as composite electrode materials for supercapacitors. This paper also reviews a brief history of supercapacitor's background.
