In this paper, an energy management system is developed for fuel cell/supercapacitor hybrid locomotive, and an energy management strategy based on high hydrogen efficiency mode is proposed to satisfy the demand of dynamic performance of hybrid locomotive. Moreover, the energy management system is designed and is verified by reduced-scale experiments. The results demonstrate that the proposed energy management strategy is able to improve the fuel utilization rate, maintain the state of charge (SOC) within a certain range, and extend the lifetime of supercapacitor.
