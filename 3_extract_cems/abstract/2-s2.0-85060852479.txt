Here, we report a very simple, cost effective and simultaneous method to prepare wrinkled graphene-carbon particles composite for electrode materials in supercapacitor application. At first, graphene - carbon particles composite (G-C) was prepared by rapid and scalable flame induced reduction of graphene oxide using a wax candle. After that wrinkled graphene-carbon particles composites (wrinkled G-C) were formed by rapid freezing of aqueous solution of this composite using liquid N2. The morphology of G-C and wrinkled G-C were studied using transmission electron microscope (TEM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The complete reduction of GO was confirmed using Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffractometer (XRD). The electrochemical performances were studied by two electrode system using 6M KOH as electrolyte. The obtained specific capacitance values for wrinkled G-C and G-C composites are 290 and 212 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g. These excellent electrochemical performances endow the graphene material as a promising electrode for high rate supercapacitors.
