A chemical vapor-phase polymerization (VPP) method was employed to prepare poly-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene/nano silver nanocomposites. The electrical and electrochemical performance of the nanocomposites was investigated. The conductive results show that PEDOT/nano silver exhibits conductivity ca. 54.8 S/cm, which is higher than pure PEDOT films (17.3 S/cm). This PEDOT/nano silver composites exhibits higher specific capacitance (ca. 174.5 F/g) than pure PEDOT due to the high specific surface area of nano silver. The cycle performance reveals that the nanocomposites keep 81.6% initial capacitance after 1000 cycles, indicating excellent cycling stability. This VPP PEDOT nanocomposites show promising application in supercapacitor and conducting materials.
