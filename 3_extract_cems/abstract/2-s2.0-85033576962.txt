Graphene oxide/poly(2,2'-dithiodianiline-co-aniline) nanocomposite is prepared via in-situ copolymerization of 2,2'-dithiodianiline and aniline on functionalized graphene oxide nanosheets. To obtain a higher specific capacity and a better cycling performance, 2,2'-dithiodianiline monomers with disulfide bonds are introduced into polyaniline. Microphotography shows that graphene oxide nanosheets are covered by poly(2,2'-dithiodianiline-co-aniline) nanoparticles. Some polymer chains are chemically bonded to graphene oxide. Electrochemical measurement shows that both polyaniline and disulfide bonds contribute to the charge storage. The nanocomposite containing 5 wt % of graphene oxide has high specific capacity. Its capacity retention is 82% after 1000 charge-discharge cycles, far more stable than polyaniline. Such prepared nanocomposite is a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.
