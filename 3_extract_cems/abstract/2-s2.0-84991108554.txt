We report two types of spinel Li4Ti5O12 synthesized from the mixtures of two different nano-sized Ti precursors (TiO(OH)2 and TiO2) using microwave heating. The mixed precursors were heated at various temperatures ranging from 450 to 750°C using microwave heating processing. Spinel Li4Ti5O12 prepared from TiO(OH)2 as a Ti precursor exhibits lower synthesis temperature of 550°C than Li4Ti5O12 prepared from TiO2. Two types of spinel Li4Ti5O12 obtained from TiO(OH)2 and TiO2 were characterized using X-ray diffraction, particle size distribution, and scanning electron microscopy. Hybrid capacitors to evaluate the electrochemical performance of spinel Li4Ti5O12 were fabricated using activated carbon as a cathode material. TiO(OH)2 has the advantage of low-temperature synthesis in comparison with rutile or anatase phase TiO2, because TiO(OH)2 possesses a high concentration of defects in the structure. As a result, the rate capability of the hybrid capacitor improved with the decreasing particle size of the Li4Ti5O12 prepared from TiO(OH)2 owing to the increasing contact area between electrode and electrolyte, as well as reduced diffusion path of lithium ions. In this study, we demonstrated that the high-rate performance and long-term cycle stability of Li4Ti5O12 obtained from TiO(OH)2 for hybrid capacitors. The presented hybrid capacitor could be a competitive candidate for use in promising energy storage devices.
