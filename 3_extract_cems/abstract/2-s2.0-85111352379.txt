Nanofibrous CoMn2O4 materials are prepared by a simple and most adoptable sol-gel process. To create the nanofabric morphology, small pieces of tissue paper are utilized as a template form. The prepared CoMn2O4 material was characterized by X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy techniques. Supercapacitive performance of the CoMn2O4 nanofibers was observed in an aqueous potassium hydroxide electrolyte, and a specific capacity of 134 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 was obtained. On the basis of the high energy storage performance of this material, an aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was assembled. The high power and energy density values of 0.725 kW kg−1 and 30 W h kg−1, respectively at 1 A g−1 were achieved. The ASCs can light up eleven light-emitting diodes. Furthermore, a kitchen timer and a toy motor were also powered by the fabricated ASCs.
