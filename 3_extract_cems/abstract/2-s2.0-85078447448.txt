Most published articles reported characterization of a supercapacitor utilizing a coin cell or a Swagelok cell design, while the higher capacity format such as a pouch or cylindrical cell is needed to predict the performance of a supercapacitor for a practical application. In this work, the guideline to produce a pouch cell supercapacitor is given. The three-component electrode is based on a commercially available activated carbon, carbon black, and a polyvinylidene fluoride binder, which is formed a layer on a conductive-carbon coated aluminum foil current collector. The roles and optimization of a calendering process and selection of a separator-solvent combination are highlighted. The symmetric electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC) pouch cell using organic salt electrolyte is rated at 2.5 Volt. The pouch cell has the maximum capacitance of 32.6 F with a specific capacitance of 25.6-29.4 F/g.
