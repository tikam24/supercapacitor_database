Carbon onions consist of spherical closed carbon shells and owe their name to the concentric layered structure resembling that of an onion. The transition of nanodiamond to a carbon onion can be seen in a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Arc discharge between two graphite electrodes in water represents another synthesis technique, generating OLC of slightly different structure than from annealing of nanodiamond. The carbon vapor rapidly condenses into highly spherical OLC particles and will float on the water surface, waiting to be collected for analysis. Hollow carbon onions have been produced with the aid of metal nanoparticles. Recently, OLC and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were used to store energy from -50 to 100Â°C, a wider temperature range than any porous activated carbons can deliver with organic or aqueous electrolytes. Carbon onions debuted as a material for Electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) in 2006-2007 in both aqueous and organic electrolytes. Since then, there has been an immense amount of attention given to OLC for both batteries and supercapacitors.
