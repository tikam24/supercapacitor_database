In this paper, we introduce a new hybrid energy storage system (HESS) design for wind power generation application and corresponding calculation of the proper size of the battery and supercapacitor. The design has an objective to increase the battery life time. The boundary levels of the state of charge of the battery and that of the supercapacitor are used in the control strategy. In the controller, some logic gates are also used to control the operating time durations of the battery. The sizing method is based on the average fluctuation of wind profiles of a specific wind station which consequently provides some fluctuations in the generated wind power. The calculated battery size is dependent on the size of the supercapacitor, state of charge of the supercapacitor and battery wear. To verify the presented method, two different cases are studied in PSCAD and corresponding results are provided. Â© 2012 IEEE.
