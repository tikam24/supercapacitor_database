In this paper, we present a scalable and general fabrication for micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) among various flexible substrates assisted by the stamp, which combines the conductive polymer composites with gravure printing process. Compared with the traditional transferring techniques, this method greatly simplifies the process and mitigates the mechanical damage during the preparation. Profiting from the composites of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as the printing inks, the MSCs exhibit elegant areal capacitance (10.491\ \mu \mathrm{F}/\text{cm}^{2}) on the paper substrate. Meanwhile, optimizing the ratio of matrix and curing agent of PDMS, the interaction between ink and substrate is effectively enhanced. Therefore, such novel fabrication technology significantly improves the production efficiency as well as broadens the applications.
