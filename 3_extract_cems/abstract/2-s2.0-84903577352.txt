The polyaniline (PANI)-based pseudo-supercapacitor has been extensively studied due to its good conductivity, ease of synthesis, low-cost monomer, tunable properties and remarkable specific capacitance. In this work, a three-dimensional cross-linked carbon network (3D-CCN) was used as a contact-resistance-free substrate for PANI-based pseudo-supercapacitors. The ordered PANI nanowires (PaNWs) were grown on the 3D-CCN to form PaNWs/3D-CCN composites by in-situ polymerization. The PaNWs/3D-CCN composites exhibited a specific capacitance (Cs) of 1191.8 F g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1 and a superior rate capability with 66.4% capacitance retention at 100.0 A g-1. The high specific capacitance is attributed to the thin PaNW coating and the spaced PANI nanowire array, which ensure a higher utilization of PANI due to the ease of diffusion of protons through/on the PANI nanowires. In addition, the unique 3D-CCN was used as a high-conductivity platform (or skeleton) with no contact resistance for fast electron transfer and facile charge transport within the composites. Therefore, the binder-free composites can process rapid gains or losses of electrons and ions, even at a high current density. As a result, the specific capacitance and rate capability of our composites are remarkably higher than those of other PANI composites. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
