Hybrid Energy Storage Systems (HESS) can supply power more flexibility and balancing to the grid, providing a backup to intermittent renewable energy. Locally, it can improve the management of distribution networks, reducing costs and improving efficiency. In this way, it can ease the market introduction of renewables, accelerate the decarbonization of the electricity grid, improve the security and efficiency of electricity transmission and distribution, stabilize market prices for electricity, while also ensuring a higher security of energy supply. This paper will provide an overview of an hybrid energy storage solution which achieve a cost-effective integration of renewable energies, significant decreases in fuel consumptions, grid stabilization and optimized dimensioning of energy storage systems through the integration of ultracapacitors with batteries under a unique bus.
