Binary mixtures of ionic liquids are interesting alternatives to tailor ionic liquids properties. Some of them have been proposed as electrolytes for supercapacitors. Herein, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of planar and porous electrodes with binary mixtures of ionic liquids comprising the 1-ethyl–3-methyl–imidazoliumbis(trifluoromethane–sulfonyl)imide ([EMIM][NTf2]) and 1-ethyl–3-methyl–imidazoliumtetrafluoroborate ([EMIM][BF4]), increasing the mole fraction of the latter (xBF4) from 0 to 1. The energy densities calculated from the simulations increase monotonically with xBF4, accordingly with available experimental results [Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2015, 54, 1 – 5]. Considering that the electrode simulations were dealt with the constant potential model, the characteristic charging times were calculated for planar and porous electrodes. The devices containing only [EMIM][NTf2] charge slower than electrolytes with xBF4 > 0.0, and the fastest charging happens in xBF4 = 1.0 V. These features are related to the higher [NTf2]-electrode interaction and also to the smaller size of [BF4]−. For porous electrode, the calculated Ragone plot indicates that [EMIM][BF4] outperforms all the other electrolytes with a voltage of 3.0 V in terms of energy and power densities. In the system of best performance, there are considerable contributions of co-ion desorption and counter-ion adsorption mechanisms in the negative and positive electrodes, respectively.
