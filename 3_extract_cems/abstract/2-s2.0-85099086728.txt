In our work, NiCo2O4@Ni(OH)2 electrode materials are prepared by a two-step hydrothermal method. The synthesized product can be directly used as electrode material of a supercapacitor, and its specific capacity is 687 C g−1 at 1 A g−1. The composite electrode is used as the positive electrode and a hybrid capacitor is assembled. The ASCs (asymmetric supercapacitors) possess an energy density of 71.38 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 2750 W kg−1 and capacity retention of 92% after 10,000 cycles.
