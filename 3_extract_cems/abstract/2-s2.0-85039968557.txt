This paper discusses direct growth of graphene on the interdigital electrodes for MEMS supercapacitor application. In addition, a high quality graphene was grown by using radio frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (RF-PECVD) at temperature of 1000Â°C at various deposition time from 2-10 minutes at fixed power of 40 Watt. The graphene growth structure on the interdigital electrodes was characterized by Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Raman spectra indicate that the intensity ratio of the 2D band and G band (I2d/Ig) is 1.00 and the value of FWHM is 54.26 cm-1 which produced a good quality bilayer graphene. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) result shows the surface roughness of the structure is 68.56nm.
