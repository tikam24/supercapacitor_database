Two-dimensional materials have been an ideal material platform for constructing flexible ultrathin-film supercapacitors, offering great advantages of flexibility, ultra-thinness and even transparency. Exploring new two-dimensional pseudocapacitive materials with high electrochemical activity is needed to achieve flexible ultrathin-film supercapacitors with higher energy densities. Here we report an inorganic graphene analogue, α 1 -vanadyl phosphate ultrathin nanosheets with less than six atomic layers, as a promising material to construct a flexible ultrathin-film pseudocapacitor in all-solid-state. The material exhibits a high potential plateau of ∼ 1.0 V in aqueous solutions, approaching the electrochemical potential window of water (1.23 V). The as-established flexible supercapacitor achieves a high redox potential (1.0 V) and a high areal capacitance of 8,360.5 μF cm-2, leading to a high energy density of 1.7 mWh cm-2 and a power density of 5.2 mW cm-2. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.
