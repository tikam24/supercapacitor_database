One of the main drawbacks of conventional energy storage systems is the possibility of electrolyte leakage due to faulty encapsulation or accidental overcharge. In this work, novel environmentally benign all-biopolymer-based hydrogels have been designed to be used as electrolytes in aqueous electrochemical capacitors. A primary component of gels, i.e. microcrystalline cellulose dissolved in NaOH/urea mixture and cross-linked with epichlorohydrin, was used in combination with agarose, or subsequently introduced agarose and poly(norepinephrine) to form the three-dimensional interpenetrated polymer network of enhanced mechanical stability. The effect of introduced components has been studied independently and investigated in terms of morphology, conductivity, swelling degree, and mechanical/structural properties. The electrochemical diagnostic tests of electrochemical capacitors utilizing acidic (H2SO4, H4SiW12O40) and neutral (Na2SO4) electrolyte-saturated hydrogels of the best overall characteristics have revealed the performance approaching the one characteristic of the liquid electrolyte-based counterparts but with lower self-discharge. The systems were characterized by the capacitance of 97-127 F g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 with retention of 33-89% at 20 A g-1, and cycling life of 10 000 cycles with a maximum of 10% of capacitance loss. The effect of intentionally improved hydrophilic properties of activated carbon electrodes, on the interfacial compatibility between electrode/hydrogel electrolyte is discussed as well. The results are in line with the global trend of green and sustainable energy storage designed for specific applications, i.e. in-vivo systems and wearable electronics.
