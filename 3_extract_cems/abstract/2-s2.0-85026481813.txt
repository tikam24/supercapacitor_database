The fabrication of high capacitance binder-free electrode materials with the advantages of having low costs and low toxicity has been attracting great attention for supercapacitors. In this study, we report the synthesis of hierarchical birnessite-type 3D Cu0.45Mn0.55O2 (CMO) nanosheets (NS) directly grown on flexible carbon textile (CT) without any surfactant via a simple hydrothermal method. The CMO-NS supported on carbon textile were directly used as an integrated electrode for electrochemical measurments. The binder-free electrodes yielded high specific capacitance of 983 F g−1 in 1.0 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte at a constant current density of 1.0 mAcm−2. In addition, the CMO-NS electrode displayed outstanding cyclic stability by retaining 90% capacitance after 3000 cycles. Thus, the Cu0.45Mn0.55O2 nanosheets combined with carbon textile form a promising electrode material for high-performance pseudocapacitors that have light weight and low cost.
