In this study, we report Ag-incorporated CeO2 nano cauliflowers prepared by a simple hydrothermal method. The excellent combination of Ag with CeO2 has been exploited for supercapacitor applications owing to high conductive property of Ag and efficient redox activity of CeO2. The significant advantage of this nanostructure is to enhance the surface area (50.2 m2 g-1) and conductivity that leads to the enrichment of electrochemical behaviour. Moreover, addition of Ag results in improved specific capacitance (47% improvement over the pristine), excellent rate capacity (1012 F g-1 at 10 A g-1) and good capacitance retention (100% over 1500 cycles) for Ag-incorporated CeO2. The good supercapacitive feature has a great potential for use in asymmetric supercapacitors. The asymmetric device could provide excellent specific capacitance (287 F g-1 at 2 mV s-1), outstanding rate capacity (140 F g-1 at 10 mV s-1) and enhanced cyclic stability (100% over 1000 cycles). It delivers a maximum energy density of 70 W h kg-1 and a power density of 750 W kg-1. This study clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating Ag into the CeO2 nanostructure with significantly improved electrochemical features.
