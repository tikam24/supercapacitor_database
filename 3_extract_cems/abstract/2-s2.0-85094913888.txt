A Smart Energy Management System (SEMS) for a Highly-Integrated Battery-Ultracapacitor system (HIBUC) is presented in this paper. The proposed SEMS consists of driving the Battery Pack (BP) in order to fulfill the base part of the overall HIBUC power profile, while the Ultracapacitor Module (UM) shaves the residual power peaks to the maximum extent. In addition, BP has the task of driving the UM energy content properly in the medium/long-term, which may deviate in the short-term due to unexpected power fluctuations and/or unmodelled system losses. As a result, UM prevents BP from frequent and sudden power variations, while BP ensures its continuous operation. The effectiveness of the proposed SEMS has been preliminary verified through numerical simulations, which refers to the case of an experimental HIBUC prototype.
