In the present paper, we report the influence of phase segregation (hexagonal and monoclinic phase) of facile microwave-assisted BPO (BiPO4) nanostructures on optical and electrochemical properties for supercapacitor applications. The XRD patterns reveal pure phase formation of both the samples of BiPO4 synthesized at 300 °C and 600 °C (JCPDS #15-0766 and JCPDS #43-0637). Phase transition of BiPO4 from hexagonal to monoclinic phase obtained by sintering the sample (BP600) at 600 °C. The FWHM values of the X-ray diffraction peaks observed to decrease with an increase in sintering temperature, which can be ascribed to the enhancement of the crystallite size. The synthesized samples of BiPO4 are in the nanometer dimension, which also revealed through FESEM examination. FTIR, Raman, and PL spectroscopy also revealed the crystal structure symmetry distinction among the hexagonal and monoclinic BiPO4 phase. Specific capacity calculated from GCD (galvanostatic charge and discharge) analysis for BP300 and BP600 samples is 1074 Cg−1 and 451 Cg−1, correspondingly, at the current density of 1 Ag−1. The investigation divulges that the phase segregation plays a considerable utility in tuning the electrochemical performance of BiPO4 nanostructures as active electrode material for next-generation electrochemical capacitors application.
