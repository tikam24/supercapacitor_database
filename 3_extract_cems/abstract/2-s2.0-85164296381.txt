Three dimensional-metal organic frameworks have drawn a lot of interest for high-performance supercapacitors, particularly those that contain carbon components, due to their enhanced stability, substantial specific surface area, electrical conductivity, and nanocubic topologies. Metal organic frameworks and its analogues are two types of efficient materials that are being developed for energy storage and conversion. Their multifunctional properties, more porosity, variable chemical compositions, and various morphologies open up a world of promise in the quest for suitable electrode materials for batteries. Manganese-cobalt-Prussian blue analogues/Nickel foam and Manganese-cobalt-Prussian blue analogues-polydopamine/Nickel foam nanocubes are synthesized as supercapacitor electrode materials using a co-precipitation process at room temperature. Manganese-cobalt-Prussian blue analogues-polydopamine/Nickel foam illustration brilliant electrochemical performance with a more specific capacitance of 458 F/g at 1 A/g and specific capacitance retention of 98.4 % after 10,000 cycles thanks to its distinctive nanocube-like structure, which offers more electro-active sites and a shorter route for electrolyte diffusion and electron transfer. The findings show that a technique for creating tri-metallic three dimensional-metal organic frameworks nanocubes is a good electrode for extremely effective energy storage application.
