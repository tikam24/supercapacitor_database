In this work, Ag NPs anchored ZnSb2O6 nanostructured electrode materials have been prepared by facile ultrasonication assisted chemical reduction approach. While evaluating as a supercapacitor electrode material, it exhibits pseudocapacitance behavior with fast faradaic reactions with the maximum specific capacitance of 119.71 F/g at a charge/discharge current density of 1.0 A/g with 98% initial capacitance retained after 2000 cycles. The superior pseudocapacitive properties of Ag anchored ZnSb2O6 nanostructures are attributed to its unique structure, large surface area to volume for easy access of electrolyte ions and the Ag anchored on ZnSb2O6 nanorods has improved the electrical conductivity of the whole nanostructured electrode and also provided rapid electron transfer kinetics for better electrochemical reactions. The results confirmed that the Ag/ZnSb2O6 hybrid nanostructure can be a potential and active electrochemical energy storage material in supercapacitors.
