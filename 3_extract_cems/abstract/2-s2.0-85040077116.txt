To enhance the energy density of solid-state supercapacitors, a novel solid-state cell, made of redox-active poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel electrolytes and functionalized carbon nanotube-coated cellulose paper electrodes, was investigated in this work. Briefly, acidic PVA-[BMIM]Cl-lactic acid-LiBr and neutral PVA-[BMIM]Cl-sodium acetate-LiBr hydrogel polymer electrolytes are used as catholyte and anolyte, respectively. The acidic condition of the catholyte contributes to suppression of the undesired irreversible reaction of Br- and extension of the oxygen evolution reaction potential to a higher value than that of the redox potential of Br-/Br3- reaction. The observed Br-/Br3- redox activity at the cathode contributes to enhance the cathode capacitance. The neutral condition of the anolyte helps extend the operating voltage window of the supercapacitor by introducing hydrogen evolution reaction overpotential to the anode. The electrosorption of nascent H on the negative electrode also increases the anode capacitance. As a result, the prepared solid-state hybrid supercapacitor shows a broad voltage window of 1.6 V, with a high Coulombic efficiency of 97.6% and the highest energy density of 16.3 Wh/kg with power density of 932.6 W/kg at 2 A/g obtained. After 10 000 cycles of galvanostatic charge and discharge tests at the current density of 10 A/g, it exhibits great cyclic stability with 93.4% retention of the initial capacitance. In addition, a robust capacitive performance can also be observed from the solid-state supercapacitor at different bending angles, indicating its great potential as a flexible energy storage device.
