Single and mixed metal oxide/carbon composites like Fe2O3/carbon, Fe2O3-SnO2/carbon, Fe2O3-ZnO/carbon are synthesized by a simple self-propagating solution combustion method. Carbon is introduced in-situ during the preparation of metal oxides in the form of dextrose precursor which act as both fuel and carbon source. The composites are characterized by XRD, SEM-EDAX and elemental CHNS analysis. The carbon content in the composite oxides is found be 19.3%, 17.8%, and 13.1% respectively. Electrochemical characterization is done by cyclic voltammetry in acetonitrile with 0.1 M lithium perchlorate supporting electrolyte. The specific electrochemical double layer capacitances are: Fe2O3/carbon, 255 Fg-1; Fe2O3- SnO2/carbon, 78.6 Fg-1; Fe2O3-ZnO/carbon, 122 Fg-1 respectively. Â© 2009 by ESG.
