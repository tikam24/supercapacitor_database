Transition metal carbide or nitride (MXene) is regarded as next-generation two-dimensional (2D) materials for various applications, such as photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, supercapacitor, lithium-ion battery and biomedicine, because of its unique physicochemical properties. In photocatalysis, MXene could allow fast photogenerated charge carrier separation and provide abundant surface functional groups for light harvesting materials, rendering feasible the high photoconversion efficiency. Therefore, enormous theoretical and experimental studies have been recently made and shown the potential of MXene in various photocatalytic applications. Here, we provide a brief overview of the MXene-based materials, along with their functions in photocatalytic applications. Then, we summarize the recent advances and progresses of MXene-based photocatalysts, ranging from solar fuel production to pollutant degradation. Finally, we present concluding remarks and the outlooks for achieving highly efficient MXene-based photocatalysts.
