Supercapacitors have attracted tremendous research interest, since they are expected to achieve battery-level energy density, while having a long calendar life and short charging time. Herein, a novel asymmetric supercapacitor has been successfully assembled from NiCo2S4 nanosheets and spinous Fe2O3 nanowire modified hollow melamine foam decorated with polypyrrole as positive and negative electrodes, respectively. Owing to the well-designed nanostructure and suitable matching of electrode materials, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) exhibits an extended operation voltage window of 1.6 V with an energy density of 20.1 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 159.4 kW kg−1. Moreover, the ASC shows stable cycling stability, with 81.3 % retention after 4000 cycles and a low internal resistance of 1.03 Ω. Additionally, a 2.5 V light-emitting diode indicator can be lit up by three ASCs connected in series; this provides evidence of the practical application potential of the assembled energy-storage system. The excellent electrochemical performances should be credited to the significant enhancement of the specific surface area, charge transport, and mechanical stability resulting from the unique 3D morphology.
