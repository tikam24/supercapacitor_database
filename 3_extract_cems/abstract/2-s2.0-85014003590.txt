CuCo2O4maguey-like nanowires were obtained via a facile hydrothermal reaction and subsequent annealing at 300 °C for 3 h. The CuCo2O4nanowires interacting with each other to form CuCo2O4maguey-like nanowires structure offers the great specific surface area, excellent electron and ion transfer ability, easy approach for electrolyte transmitting to electrode surface. Our prepared CuCo2O4electrode materials showed a high areal capacitance of 3.27 F cm−2at 5 mA cm−2, an outstanding specific capacitance of 982 F g−1at 1.5 A g−1and an excellent capacitance retention of 100.94% after 3000 circles at 50 mV s−1. In addition, a symmetry supercapacitor was been assembled with a high energy density of 16.87 Wh kg−1, a high power density of 8.2 kW kg−1and outstanding cycle life, which demonstrates that our prepared material has great potential application for supercapacitors.
