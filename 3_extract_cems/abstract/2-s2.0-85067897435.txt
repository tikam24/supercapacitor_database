Significant electrochemical properties improvement of poly ortho aminophenol (POAP) as conductive polymer and simultaneously as active electrode of electrochemical supercapacitor through fabricated POAP composite film in the presence of biopolymer chitosan (CTS) with porous structure was obtained. Nanocomposite morphology and information about POAP-CTS interaction in the synthesized thin films were examined via scanning electron microscope. The surface area that depends on the porosity morphology was examined by Brunauere-Emmette-Teller (BET) analysis. Accordingly, the BET surface area, mean pore diameters, and single point total pore volume were measured as 39.044 m2 g−1, 19.68 nm, and 0.192 cm3 g−1, respectively. Electrochemical measurements like galvanostatic charge-discharge experiments, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were investigated to examine the performance of the electrosynthesized composite (POAP/CTS) film. And also, the specific charge obtained as 345 F/g for POAP/CTS. In this work, a new considerable efficient polymeric composite in electrochemical redox capacitors with considerable advantages including ease synthesis, high active surface area, and stability in an aqueous electrolyte was introduced. Analysis of the quantum theory of atoms-in-molecules results shows that the chitosan system can be categorized into n-type-like (electron density donor) and p-type-like (electron density acceptor) sections and thus the parallel (in xy/yx plan) and perpendicular (in xz/yz plan) intramolecular sections have different electronic behaviors/electro-chemical characterizations in molecule.
