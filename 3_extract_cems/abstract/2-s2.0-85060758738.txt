Tremelliform Co 3 O 4 /NiO/Mn 2 O 3 has been prepared by temperature-programmed calcination of the metal-organic framework (CoNiMn-MOF). The Co 3 O 4 /NiO/Mn 2 O 3 possesses a quite large available surface area (123.9 m 2 g −1 ) and riches of mesopores. It displays a superior specific capacitance of 3652 mF cm −2 in the concentrated potassium hydroxide solution when the current density is 1 mA cm −2 , and the rate property of the Co 3 O 4 /NiO/Mn 2 O 3 is much well than its counterparts (Co 3 O 4 /NiO and Co 3 O 4 /Mn 2 O 3 ). The energy density of the asymmetrical supercapacitor of rGO//Co 3 O 4 /NiO/Mn 2 O 3 reaches to 65.7 Wh kg −1 within 1.7 V potential window. Co 3 O 4 /NiO/Mn 2 O 3 is a promising hybrid electrode materials for excellent performance supercapacitor as well as it provides a simple and economic way to fabricate supercapacitor composite materials.
