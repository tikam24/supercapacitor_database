The composite energy storage system composed of battery, super capacitor and bi-directional DC-DC converter was studied to solve the problem of insufficient mileage and short battery life in electric vehicles. In order to realize rational power allocation of battery and super capacitor, the logic threshold and fuzzy control strategy were established respectively. The vehicle model was constructed based on the electric vehicle simulation software. Through simulation study, the characteristic curves of the current and SOC of battery and the current curves of super capacitor were got, and the results were compared with the single battery power supply. For verifying the feasibility and effectiveness of the control strategy, the experimental platform was built to study electric vehicles during driving and braking. Simulation and the experimental results show the composite energy storage system and its control strategies successfully reduce the charge and discharge current of battery, regenerate the braking energy and improve the mileage of electric vehicles.
