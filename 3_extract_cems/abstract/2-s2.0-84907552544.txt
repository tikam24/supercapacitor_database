The deposition of MnO2 spheres on a TiO2 nanotube arrays substrate are achieved via a sequential chemical bath deposition (SCBD) method for an application of anode materials in supercapacitors. The electrochemical performance of the MnO2-TiO2 composite electrode is observed to show a strong dependence on the MnO2 loading mass, which could be adjusted by repeating the SCBD treatment for several cycles. The optimized doses of MnO2 loaded MnO2-TiO2 and MnO2-Ti samples are compared in terms of their areal capacitance studies and the former is of 175 and 101 mF cm-2 at a scan rate of 10 and 100 mV s-1, respectively, which are 1.52-fold and 1.51-fold of that of the latter sample at corresponding scan rates. The enhancement in areal capacitance has been accounted to the progressive effect of the TiO2 tubular substrate on the capacitive behavior of the loaded MnO2 rather than the different MnO2 loading mass on these two substrates. Impedance analysis reveals this enhanced electrochemical activity is owing to the tubular structure of the TiO2 substrate provides an increased reaction area and facilitates the contact of electrolyte with the active MnO2 material. This work justified the suitability of using the TiO2 nanotube arrays for constructing high-performance supercapacitors.
