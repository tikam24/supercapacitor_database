This paper develops a battery/supercapacitor powered switched-reluctance motor (SRM) drive for electric vehicle (EV) propulsion. Its on-board integrated charger is formed using the embedded motor drive components. The boosted motor drive DC-link voltage is established by an interleaved DC/DC boost converter from the battery. The super-capacitor (SC) is interfaced to the DC-link via a DC/DC buck converter. And it is connected to the battery bank by a diode to assist the battery in acceleration and deceleration. Good driving and regenerative braking performances are achieved by proper control. In idle condition, the grid-to-vehicle (G2V) battery charging can be conducted by the formed on-board integrated charger with good line drawn power quality. The established charger consists of a full-bridge boost switch-mode rectifier (SMR) and a buck DC/DC converter based charger.
