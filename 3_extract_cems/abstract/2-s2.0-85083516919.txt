A simple and environmentally friendly route is developed to produce flower-like MnO2/graphene hydrogel (MnO2/GH) composites with mesoporous structure. The results show that flower-like MnO2 is firmly adhered to the surface and interior of GH. Compared with pure MnO2 and GH, the electrode of MnO2/GH composites exhibits high specific capacitance of 293.7 F/g at 0.5 A/g, and over 87.3% of capacitance has maintained after cycling 2000 times. The excellent electrical conductivity is basically attributed to the large specific surface, the stability microstructure and good conditions for ion-diffusion and ion-transport by MnO2/GH composites.
