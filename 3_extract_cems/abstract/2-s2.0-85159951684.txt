Borophene research in solid state physics, material science, chemistry and nanotechnology has blossomed after the first 2-D boron sheet (borophene) was fabricated on silver surfaces in 2015. Owing to its distinct physical and chemical characteristics, borophene has a large variety of potential applications. The work on borophene is described in this article, with an emphasis on recent advancements in biomedical applications. Synthesis and mathematical, theoretical predictions are used to introduce the phases of borophene. The physicochemical features, which include thermal, electrical, optical, mechanical, and superconducting capabilities, and all this will then be abridged. This article explains how to employ borophene in hydrogen storage, supercapacitor, sensor, alkali metal ion batteries, and catalytics for the evolution of hydrogen, Li-S batteries, oxygen reduction,evolution of oxygen, and CO2 electroreduction in detail. Furthermore, some barriers and chances in this potential area are emphasized depending on its present developing stage. Finally, we look at how borophenes are being used as biosensors and medicines. The present and forthcoming commercial prospects of 2D nanomaterials for the tumor therapies were assessed by in depth analysis. The utilization of borophene is also examined in terms of current obstacles and future prospects.
