Effectively composited materials with optimized structures have exhibited promising potential in improving the electrochemical performances of supercapacitors in the past few years. Herein, we proposed a rational design to fabricate two-dimensional (2D) Co3O4@NiCo2O4 architectures composed of nanowires on a Ni foam substrate via two steps of hydrothermal processing. Owing to the high activity of the Co3O4 scaffolds and the well-defined NiCo2O4 nanowires, the hierarchical electrodes achieved remarkable electrochemical performances with a high areal specific capacitance of 9.12 F cm-2 at the current density of 2 mA cm-2. Both all-solid-state symmetrical supercapacitor based Co3O4@NiCo2O4//Co3O4@NiCo2O4 and asymmetric supercapacitor based Co3O4@NiCo2O4//activated carbon are fabricated with excellent electrochemical performances. The all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor with a maximum voltage of 1.6 V delivered a high areal specific capacitance of 1343.7 mF cm-2 at 2 mA cm-2, excellent cycling stability with no obvious capacitance attenuation after 5000 cycles at a current density of 10 mA cm-2, and a high energy density of 75.6 Wh kg-1 with a power density of 1053 W kg-1. After rapid charging (2 s), both supercapacitors in series could light a red LED for a long time and drive a mini intelligent electronic device effectively, demonstrating advances in energy storage, scalable integrated applications and a promising commercial potential.
