This paper aims to optimize the expenditure of a hybrid energy storage system that includes a battery and supercapacitor (SC) for economical dispatching wind power at one-hour increments for an entire day for a megawatt-scale grid-connected wind turbine system. The frequency management technique is employed to exploit the technical merits of the two-energy storage apparatus and to optimally allocate the power flow between two storages to dispatch a committed pre-determined constant power into the grid. The cost optimization of the HESS is computed based on the time constant of the low pass filter (LPF) through extensive simulations in a MATLAB/SIMULINK environment, and a Contemporary Particle Swarm Optimization (CPSO) approach is implemented to seek the optimum value of the LPF time constant. Moreover, a state of charge (SOC) control algorithm based on a fuzzy inference system considering both battery and SC SOC is proposed in this study to accurately estimate the grid reference power for each one-hour dispatching period. This research also demonstrates an economic comparison to investigate the impact of utilizing different kinds of energy storage for hourly dispatching wind power. The simulation results exhibit that the presented HESS is superior to a battery or SC-only operation.
