The amorphous MnO2 thin films were prepared by simple and inexpensive successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. The prepared thin films were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical study was carried out by cyclic voltammetry in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The films showed the maximum specific capacitance of 243 F.g-1 at the scan rate of 10 mV.s-1. It is observed that two distinct peaks occurs in cyclic voltammogram during charging and discharging which correspond to the electrochemical oxidation and reduction reaction and different oxidation states of the Mn as Mn2+ and Mn3+. Further, the increase in specific capacitance is observed with the increase in the precursor concentration. Â© 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.
