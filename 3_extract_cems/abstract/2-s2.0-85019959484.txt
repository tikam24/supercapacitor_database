The application of conventional metalâ€“organic frameworks (MOFs) as electrode materials in supercapacitors is largely hindered by their conventionally poor electrical conductivity. This study reports the fabrication of conductive MOF nanowire arrays (NWAs) and the application of them as the sole electrode material for solid-state supercapacitors. By taking advantage of the nanostructure and making full use of the high porosity and excellent conductivity, the MOF NWAs in solid-state supercapacitor show the highest areal capacitance and best rate performance of all reported MOF materials for supercapacitors, which is even comparable to most carbon materials.
