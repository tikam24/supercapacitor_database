Recently, transition metal chalcogenides, particularly molybdenum chalcogenides, have triggered intensive interest due to their intriguing physicochemical properties. Owing to its high anisotropy and distinct crystal structure, numerous reports have demonstrated that nanostructured MoS2, with the merits of low cost and prominent properties, is an excellent substitute for environmentally benign energy conversion and for use in storage devices. Its different compounds, such as MoS2/carbon, MoS2/polymer, and MoS2/metal oxides, have also been applied in the field of energy storage, including supercapacitors and batteries. In this review, we summarize the most recent advances made in the last 5 years in the development of MoS2 and MoS2-based composites in various electrochemical domains. In the discussion, emphasis is given to applications in supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries, and sodium-ion batteries. Finally, some further prospects and promising developments of the materials in the energy storage field are proposed.
