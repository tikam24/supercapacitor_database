In this work, hierarchical nanosheet-based NiSe microspheres were successfully fabricated using a facile one-step solvothermal method, in which ethylenediamine and N,N-dimethylformamide were used as the mixed solvent. The evolution of this morphology and the effects of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide were also explored. The as-synthesized NiSe microspheres exhibited the ideal performance when employed as electrode materials of supercapacitors.
