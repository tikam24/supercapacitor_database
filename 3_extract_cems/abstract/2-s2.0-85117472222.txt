In order to improve the efficiency and extend the service life of supercapacitors, this paper proposes a supercapacitor energy management method based on phase-shifted full-bridge converter. The method uses the supercapacitor state of charge (SOC) as a reference and combines the DC bus voltage fluctuation to quickly control the energy bidirectional flow. The simulation is carried out in Matlab/Simulink. The simulation results show that the proposed method combines SOC estimation and energy conversion, which can realize the optimal management of super capacitor and has fast dynamic response capability.
