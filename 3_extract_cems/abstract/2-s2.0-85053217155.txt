In this paper, reduced graphene was decorated with thionine to synthesize Th/rGO nanocomposite via diazonium reaction. The nanocomposite was identified using several techniques including SEM, EDX, XRD, XPS, and IR techniques. The behavior of the nanocomposite, as a supercapacitor electrode, was examined using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results obtained demonstrated that the nanocomposite has an excellent specific capacitance of 1255 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g. Furthermore, the stability of the electrode was examined after 5000 cycles. The results showed that 93% of the initial capacity appears after 5000 cycles.
