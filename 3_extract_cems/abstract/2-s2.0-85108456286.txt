In the present work, carbon quantum dots/CoS2 nanocomposite (CQDs/CoS2) was prepared through a solvent-free ball milling route followed by solvothermal treatment. The CQDs were prepared first by a green catalyst-free microwave-assisted procedure from glycerol, as a single precursor, with a quantum yield of âˆ¼16%. Then, a ball mill-hydrothermal combination method was used to synthesize CQDs/CoS2 with edged bricklike morphology. Benefiting from advantageous features of large specific surface area (427.2 m2 g-1), unique nanostructure with high mesoporosity, and greater electronic conductivity, the as-synthesized CQDs/CoS2 nanocomposite electrode material displays a rather high specific pseudocapacitance, about 808 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 current density, a high rate capability with 83.9% capacity retention rate at 20 A g-1, and good cycling stability of 98.75% over 10 000 charge/discharge cycles at 1 A g-1. The attained results support the suitability of CQDs/CoS2 nanocomposite as a desired material for future high-performance electrochemical energy storage devices.
