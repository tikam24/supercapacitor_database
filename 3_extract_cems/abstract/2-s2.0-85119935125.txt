Electrochemical system centered on hierarchically carbon-based metal sulphide assemblies are of great fame for competent supercapacitors. Herein, the synthesis of a hierarchical CNT anchored MoS2–Bi2S3 nanocomposite is reported. Attractively, a vertically grown Bi2S3 nanorods supported on MoS2 nanosheets with carbon framework acts as a highly effective electrode in alkaline electrolyte. More interestingly, this hierarchical structure and synergetic upshot of CNT and composites provide excess coverage of active sites with improved conductivity and stability. Advancing from the physical and compositional properties of nanocomposites, the specific capacitance of MoS2–Bi2S3@CNT composites is measured to be 1338 F/g at 10 mV/s, columbic efficiency of 99.5% over 10000 cycles and long-term stability (60% retention at 0.5 A g−1 over 2000 cycles and 34.6% up to 10000 cycles). The success of this MoS2–Bi2S3@CNT composite may be attributed to the structural advantages, admirable cyclic stability, and better capacitance retention for supercapacitor applications.
