Nanoporous carbon, including redox-active functional groups, can be a promising active electrode material (AEM) as a positive electrode for lithium-ion batteries owing to its high electrochemical performance originating from the host-free surface-driven charge storage process. This study examined the effects of the nanopore size on the pseudocapacitance of the nanoporous carbon materials using nanopore-engineered carbon-based AEMs (NE-C-AEMs). The pseudocapacitance of NE-C-AEMs was intensified, when the pore diameter was ≥2 nm in a voltage range of 1.0~4.8 V vs Li+/Li under the conventional carbonate-based electrolyte system, showing a high specific capacity of ~485 mA·h·g-1. In addition, the NE-C-AEMs exhibited high rate capabilities at current ranges from 0.2 to 4.0 A·g-1 as well as stable cycling behavior for more than 300 cycles. The high electrochemical performance of NE-C-AEMs was demonstrated by full-cell tests with a graphite nanosheet anode, where a high specific energy and power of ~345 Wh·kg-1 and ~6100W·Kg-1, respectively, were achieved.
