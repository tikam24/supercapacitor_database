The ever-increasing energy demand has led to the need of new smart materials to overcome the present crises in energy generation and storage. Amongst various cross-functional platforms, metal–organic framework (MOF) has turned up as an efficient class of porous organic–inorganic ordered structure due to their flexibility, tunable structures, and composition, which allow them to play an important role in building blocks for synthesizing highly efficient energy materials for advanced applications. Recent progress in metal–organic framework based derived materials have revealed impressive efficiency in energy conversion and storage by overcoming many of the challenges which are generally faced by the individual materials and/or compounds utilized in fabrication of supercapacitor electrodes. In this review, we discuss the performances of different types of nano/micro hybrid structures derived from the metal–organic framework as electrode materials for supercapacitor applications. For the detailed understanding, a special section is devoted to MOF precursors-based electrodes as advanced energy materials. In each section, the emerging feasibility of large-scale production, challenges and future perspectives is systematically discussed. Further open strategies for the MOF-based supercapacitors that could accomplish high energy densities with better electrical conductivity, including an increase in the power density in comparison to conventional electrode materials, are carefully overviewed as major milestones for future progress in energy technologies.
