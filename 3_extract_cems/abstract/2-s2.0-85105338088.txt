Metalâ€“organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising precursors to prepare heteroatom-doped porous carbon for high-performance supercapacitor. N-self-doped graphitic carbon aerogels (NGCA) with hierarchically porous tunnels, high graphitization degree, high N content and 3D conductive network structure are successfully prepared by dry-freezing and successive high temperature treatment of ZIF-8/carboxymethylcellulose (CMC)/potassium ferrate (K2FeO4) composites, using CMC as continuous carbon agent for MOFs-derived carbon and K2FeO4 as both activation agent and catalyst. When applied in a supercapacitor, the obtained NGCA exhibit excellent capacitive performance and remarkable energy-power characteristics. The specific capacitance of NGCA electrode is 244 F/g at 1 A/g in three-electrode system. NGCA based symmetric supercapacitor shows a high energy density of 17.08 Wh/kg at a power density of 500 W/kg. These results confirm NGCA as electrode material can be applied for high-performance supercapacitor.
