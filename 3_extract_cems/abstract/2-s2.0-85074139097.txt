A hybrid nanostructure of hydrous RuO2 nanoparticles deposited on the surface of SWCNT/graphene (S/G) composite has been prepared through a sol-gel process and low-temperature annealing. Benefiting from the combined advantages of graphene, SWCNTs and hydrous RuO2, the hybrid electrode material (RuO2@S/G-60 of 58.53% RuO2 loading) has a high specific capacitance of 988 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g and excellent rate performance. The results show that S/G is very suitable as a carbon skeleton of hydrous RuO2.
