A comparison of strategies for energy management in electrical vehicles with hybrid energy storage systems is presented. The storage system considered is composed by a bank of lead-acid batteries that provide high energy density and an ultracapacitor, a high power. One of the control strategies was already proposed in a previous work, a cascade topology that uses monitors of state (ME, in Spanish) and the other strategy, extracted from the literature, is based on the use of voltage feedback (LT in Spanish) for the energy management. This comparison shows that the ME strategy has advantages over the LT strategy due to its extra degrees of freedom which permit a better tuning. Among other advantages of ME, it is possible to specify the immediate recovery of the ultracapacitor, which is not a remarkable characteristic of LT. Simulation results are included, which show illustrative results, and some conclusions are presented.
