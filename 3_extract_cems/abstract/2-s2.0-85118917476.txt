The aim of the study is to increase the resource of chemical energy storage in off-grid solar power plants with impulse load and reduce the cost of storage in such systems. The objective of the study is to find the optimal values of the elements that make up a hybrid storage device consisting of a chemical battery, a supercapacitor and inductive elements. The research method is measuring the currents and voltages of the elements of the hybrid energy storage. The use of inductive elements in a hybrid energy storage circuit, consisting of a lead-acid battery and a supercapacitor, reduces the maximum current from the battery by 37% during a short-term impulse load. It is assumed that the life of a chemical battery may increase by 37%.
