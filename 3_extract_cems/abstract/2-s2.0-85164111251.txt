On-chip micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) are important Si-compatible power-source backups for miniaturized electronics. Despite their tremendous advantages, current on-chip MSCs require harsh processing conditions and typically perform like resistors when filtering ripples from alternating current (AC). A facile layer-by-layer method was reported to fabricate on-chip MSCs based on an azulene-bridged coordination polymer framework (PiCBA) by Prof. Zhuang and Prof. Feng at the Meso-Entropy Lab, Shanghai Jiao Tong University and their coworkers. Such MCSs exhibited AC line-filtering performance (phase angle −73° at 120 Hz) with a short resistance-capacitance constant of 0.83 ms. Furthermore, owing to the good carrier mobility (5×10−3 cm2/(V·s)) of PiCBA, the permanent dipole moment of azulene skeleton, and ultralow bandgap of PiCBA, the as-fabricated MSCs delivered high specific capacitance of up to 34.1 F/cm3 at 50 mV/s and high volumetric power density of 1 323 W/cm3
