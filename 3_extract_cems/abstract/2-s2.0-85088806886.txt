The authors regret that the printed version of the above article contained a number of errors. The correct and final version follows. The authors would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused. Although it does not affect the result and contribution of this paper, the authors hope these errors can be corrected from a strictly scientific standpoint. For Equation (2), there are different calculation method for energy density at present. Equation (2) in this paper is based on equation 1, which means the energy density calculated is based on single electrode. However, in some research, the energy density is based on a device. After serious discussion by the authors, to make the contrast in Fig. 4(b) more persuasive, we would like to convert it as a device parameter. [Formula presented] After doing the conversion, the device performance is still better than the references of N-doped samples involved in Fig. 4(b), but the curve in Fig. 4(b) and the corresponding discussion about the calculation method and results need to be further modified. [Figure presented] For Fig. 3(a), the GCD curve of S-SD1:5 at the current density of 1 A gâˆ’1 was mistaken, and the revised version is followed. [Figure presented]
