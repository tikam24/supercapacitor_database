Various types of supercapacitor electrodes have been reported, which include carbon materials, metal oxides, and conducting polymers. They have been subjected to electrochemical analyses using three- or two-electrode systems. The closest system to a real commercial application is the two-electrode system. Herein, we report the fabrication of a solid-state supercapacitor with nickel cobaltite reinforced carbon microfibre electrodes using two electrode system. This supercapacitor, called the NICAF, was compared to a commercial supercapacitor (KEMEX). The specific capacitances of NICAF and KEMEX were 124.21 F/g and 44.49 F/g at 1 A/g, respectively. The capacitance retention of NICAF was 93% after 900 galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles, whereas KEMEX was able to retain 99% after the same number of cycles. The energy and power densities of NICAF were 8.32 Wh/kg and 489.25 W/kg, respectively, while those of KEMEX were 2.07 Wh/kg and 409.45 W/kg, respectively. The life cycles of NICAF and KEMEX were verified and compared at three temperature ranges: 0, 30, and 60 째C. KEMEX exhibited superior cycle stability, with a capacitance retention of up to 99% in all temperature ranges, whereas NICAF performed optimally by recording up to 97% retention at 0 째C. However, the increase in temperature up to 30 째C reduced the stability to 93% and a further increase to 60 째C disrupted the stability test. Nevertheless, these extensive electrochemical analyses showed that the overall performance of NICAF was comparable to that of the commercially available KEMEX supercapacitor.
