As a generalized synthetic protocol, porous carbons have been for the first time prepared by a direct carbonization of polyacrylate-metal complexes. The case of magnesium polyacrylate was emphatically studied. It reveals that the carbonization temperature can play a crucial role in the determination of surface areas, pore structures, surface functionalities of porous carbons as well as the correlative capacitive performances. The carbon-Mg-900 sample exhibits a high surface area of 942 m2 g-1 and a large total pore volume of 1.90 cm3 g-1, with a high specific capacitance of 262.4 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 in 6.0 mol L -1 aqueous KOH electrolyte. Moreover, it displays high capacitance retention even of 33.5% at 100 A g-1, and long-term cycling ability (∼91.3% retention after 5000 cycles). More importantly, the present synthetic strategy can be extended to prepare other polyacrylate-metal complexes, such as calcium polyacrylate and aluminum polyacrylate. The carbon-Al-900 sample can exhibit a high surface area of 1556 m2 g-1 and a large total pore volume of 0.97 cm3 g -1. To sum up, the carbon samples derived from magnesium polyacrylate possess the highest capacitive performances as supercapacitor electrode materials. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
