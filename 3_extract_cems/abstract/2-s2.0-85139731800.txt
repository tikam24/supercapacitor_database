With the rapid growth of the flexible and wearable electronics market, there have been big advances in flexible electrochemical energy storage technologies. Developing flexible electrodes with a low cost, superior safety, and high performance remains a great challenge. In recent years, potassium-based electrochemical energy storage devices have received much attention by virtue of their cost competitiveness and the availability of potassium resources. Carbon materials have been widely used as electrode materials or substrates for flexible energy storage devices due to their excellent properties, such as low weight, non-toxicity and abundance. Here, we summarize the recent advances in carbon materials (e.g. carbon nanofibers, carbon nanotubes, and graphene) for use in flexible electrochemical potassium storage devices, including potassium-ion batteries, potassium-ion hybrid capacitors, and K-S/Se batteries. Strategies for the synthesis of carbon-based flexible electrodes and their reported electrochemical performance are outlined. Finally, the challenges of future developments in this field are discussed.
