In this work, Ni 3 S 2 /Ni foam was successfully synthesized using a facile gas-phase method of annealing Ni foam in H 2 S atmosphere. It was used as a binder free electrode for high-performance supercapacitors. The areal capacitance increases rapidly in the initial charge-discharge cycling and then reaches a stable stage. An ultrahigh areal capacitance of 9.88 F cm −2 at the current density of 10 mA cm −2 is achieved in the stable charge-discharge stage, which is around 88 times of initial capacitance (112.5 mF cm −2 ). Further studies reveal that surface Ni 3 S 2 transforms into porous Ni(OH) 2 during charge-discharge process, and surface area increases more than 100 times. The soaring specific surface area is the dominant factor contributing to the increased areal capacitance. More importantly, this self-formed porous structure exhibits ultra-stable long-time cycling ability, as no capacity fading is observed even after 60000 cycles of charge-discharge at high current density (150 mA cm −2 ). These results indicate that self-formed porous Ni(OH) 2 structure during electrochemical cycling maybe a promising electrode for high performance supercapacitor applications.
