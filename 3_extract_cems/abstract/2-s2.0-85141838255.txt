This study deals with fault ride-through (FRT) capability and output power fluctuation suppression of wind turbine systems (WTS) having PMSG (permanent-magnet synchronous generator) for mitigating grid frequency variation and voltage flicker in the distribution system. The coordinated control of a cost-effective scheme based on energy storage supercapacitors (ESSs) and braking resistors (BR) is introduced to perform the multiple tasks of the WTS. In this hybrid scheme, the ESSs are initially used to absorb the fluctuated power component with the constraints of their ratings during the grid faults and wind speed variation conditions prior to the activation of the BRs when the ESSs cannot fully consume the mismatched power between the PMSG and grid during severe grid faults. With the additional BRs, the capacity of the costly ESSs is remarkably reduced, while the performance of the fault ride-through capability and power smoothening for the WTS are still kept satisfactory and in compliance with the requirements of advanced grid codes. Detailed experimental implementation and its results for a down-scaled prototype in a laboratory are shown to verify the effectiveness of the introduced scheme along with the simulation results with the high-power rating WTS.
