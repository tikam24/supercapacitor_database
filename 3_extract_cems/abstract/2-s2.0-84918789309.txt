A method of pulse electrodeposition was proposed to synthesize polyaniline (PANI)/MnO2 composite in aniline, H2SO4, and MnSO4 aqueous solution. The PANI/MnO2 composite has rod-like structure and MnO2 particles are distributed on PANI uniformly. To evaluate the performance of the as-prepared materials as supercapacitor electrodes, cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were performed. The PANI/MnO2 composite shows a higher specific capacitance (810 F g21) than pure PANI (662 F g21) at a current density of 0.5 A g21. The cycle life of the composite was also excellent. After 1,000 cycles, it maintained 86.3% of its initial capacitance.
