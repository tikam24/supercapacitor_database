A layered triazinyl-COF(COF-TP) linked by − NH − bond was synthesized by condensation of 2,4,6 − trichloro − 1,3,5 − triazine and p − phenylenediamine. The BET specific surface area of COF-TP was 43.65 m2·g− 1 and the pore size was about 13.658 Å. A N-doped porous carbon material(COF−TP − C) was prepared by heating the COF-TP at 700 °C under nitrogen protection. The BET specific surface area of COF−TP − C was 398.15 m2·g− 1 and the pore size was about 10 Å. COF−TP exhibited a significant pseudocapacitance characteristic in 6 M K(OH)2 electrolyte with the highest specific capacitance of 283 F·g− 1 at 1 A·g− 1 current density in three electrode configuration. The specific capacitance retention was about 88 % after 20,000 cycles. COF−TP − C showed the maximum specific capacitance of 449.5 F·g− 1 at the current density 1 A·g− 1 and a good cyclic performance of 77 % after 3000 GCD cycles(93 % after 1000 cycles) at the current density of 5 A·g− 1, and retained 99.2 % after 5000 cycles at the current density of 1 A·g− 1. Both COF−TP and COF−TP − C showed good capacitance performance and potential application in supercapacitors.
