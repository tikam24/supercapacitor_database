Micro grids is a small scale power grids that can operate in conjunction with the area's main electrical grid or independently This paper produces a control strategy that performs operation mode transfer between standby mode and grid connected mode in micro grid. Micro grid control strategy of islanding, connecting to utility grid and the seamless transfer strategy are the three types of grid control scenarios studied in this paper. To control the voltage and frequency output of DG V/f control is developed in standalone mode. For grid connected mode, PQ control is developed to control active and reactive power output of DGs and droop control is developed to control storage technologies in the micro grid i.e. battery, super capacitor.
