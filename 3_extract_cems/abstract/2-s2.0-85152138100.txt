Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are one class of the most significant energy storage devices used nowadays. However, a huge number of spent batteries bring harmful resource waste and environmental hazards as LIBs are mainly composed of heavy metals and organic electrolytes. Consequently, recycling spent LIBs has become a hot topic lately, where researchers are actively working to develop a plethora of methods to extract valuable metals and components. In this study, mesoporous Li–Ni–Mn–Co oxide nanoparticles have been successfully extracted from spent Li-ion batteries using a simple microwave/precipitation method. The as-extracted Li–Ni–Mn–Co oxides were used to construct functional supercapacitor devices. However, the as-extracted oxides showed poor stability and low conductivity. To enhance their cycling stability and conductivity, fullerene (C76) is used as a carbon additive to form Li–Ni–Mn–Co oxide/C76 nanocomposite materials. The morphological, structural, and compositional analyses of those composites were performed using FESEM, HRTEM, XRD, and XPS techniques. The Li–Ni–Mn–Co oxide/C76 nanocomposites exhibit higher conductivity and wettability with an enhanced gravimetric capacitance of ∼357 Fg-1 at 1.0 Ag-1. The asymmetric supercapacitor devices deliver specific energy as high as ∼10 Wh/kg at a specific power of ∼800 W/kg with a superior retention rate of ∼115% after 20,000 cycles with ∼100% Coulombic efficiency.
