CuMn2O4 nanoparticles were successfully synthesized by adopting solvothermal method with optimum hydrothermal processing temperature maintained at 160 °C for 12 h. The synthesized CuMn2O4 nanoparticles structure, morphology, optical and electrochemical properties were analyzed with respect to varying the hydrothermal temperature. The product dominant XRD peak observed at 35.8° matches well with corresponding planes of standard data. The IR vibrational modes of Mn-O and Cu-O band were authenticated by the peak appearance at 526 and 630 cm−1. The rice-like morphology formation of CuMn2O4 nanoparticles prepared at 160 °C hydrothermal processing temperature revealed the superior behavior of electrochemical properties. The electrochemical studies carried out to estimate the specific capacitance of CuMn2O4 nanoparticles (MX3) at low scan rate 10 mV/s showed an excellent specific capacitance value of 520.4 F/g. The GCD studies of synthesized rice-like morphology CuMn2O4 nanoparticles (MX3) revealed superior specific capacitance of 577.9 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and retain its 98% capacitance as 571.6 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 current density.
