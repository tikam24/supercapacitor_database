Herein, we propose a solvent-assisted approach for preparing Ni-MOF microflowers with high specific capacitance and excellent rate capability as an electrode material for supercapacitors. The high electrochemical performance of this Ni-MOF is attributed to the fast ion transport and low electrical resistance resulting from its hierarchical flower-like structure, and the capacitance contribution from nickel hydroxide species.
