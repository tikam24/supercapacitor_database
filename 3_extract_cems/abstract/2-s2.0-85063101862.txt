We describe the in situ synthesis of branched carbon nanotubes/carbon nanofibers (BCNT/CNF) nanocomposite by a simple chemical vapor deposition method. Electrochemical characterization indicated that the BCNT/CNF based supercapacitors carried a high value of specific capacitance up to 207 F g −1 at a charge/discharge rate of 1 A g −1 , which is much higher than branched carbon nanotubes (BCNT) in H 2 SO 4 electrolyte. The supercapacitor showed a very good cycling stability of 95.6% after 5000 charge/discharge cycles at a very high current density of 20 A g −1 , and high energy density of 63.7 Wh kg −1 in EMIBF 4 organic electrolyte.
