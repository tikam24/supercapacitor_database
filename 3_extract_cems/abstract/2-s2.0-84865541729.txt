Composites of polyaniline and multiwalled carbon nanotube were prepared by in- situ chemical oxidative polymerization of the aniline monomer in 1M HCl and 1M HCl with 20% ethanol as solvent. The PANI-CNT composites were characterized by FTIR and XRD method. The surface morphology characterization of the composites was done by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Electrochemical behavior of prepared PANI-CNT composites was investigated by means of cyclic voltammetry. Specific capacitance of PANI-CNT composite using 0.02M aniline in 1M HCl (20% ethanol) and 1M HCl was 597.82 and 484.49 F/g respectively at scan rate of 2mV/s in 1M H2SO4. Copyright.
