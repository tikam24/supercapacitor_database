Hybrid Electrical System (HES), combined various promising devices like a Fuel Cell, a battery and a supercapacitor, is an attractive issue. This system was qualified by its high efficiency for electrical vehicle applications. For that, this article aims to analyze and to evaluate the system performance. A Multi-Input-Multi-Output state space model for PEMFC, Supercapacitor and battery have been established and detailed. To control the load demand and to investigate sources of supply, a precise power management unit (PMU) was discussed and evaluated for the hydrogen fuel consumption and the Battery / Super-capacitor state fluctuations. The simulation results can greatly confirm the system performance using Matlab/Simulink environment.
