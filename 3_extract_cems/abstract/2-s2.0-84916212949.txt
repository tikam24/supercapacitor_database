For a hybrid energy storage system consisting of several types of energy storage devices such as super-capacitor and secondary batteries, a strategy of power sharing among them based on the state of charge is proposed in this paper. It is adaptable to different power requirements and can be easily designed no matter how many types of storage devices are adopted. The power sharing result will match device's power performance, capacity and initial condition automatically while the state of charge of each device is always under control. Simulation and experimental results are presented to verify this strategy.
