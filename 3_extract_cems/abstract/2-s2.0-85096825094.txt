In this work, the design and synthesis of ZnS/MoS2 hybrid nanoparticle film directly grown on Mo foil is reported by a one-step hydrothermal reaction. The as-prepared hybrid composite film exhibits a specific capacitance of 956.3 F g−1 at 10 mA cm−2 which is about 6.4 times of the pristine MoS2 film (150 F g−1 at 10 mA cm−2), and excellent cycling stability (85.7% capacity retention after 2000 cycles). Generally, the greatly enhanced electrochemical performance is attributed to the robust nanoparticle structure on Mo foil, providing large surface, close contact between the substrate and active materials, and low inner resistance. In addition, these two kinds of active materials provide a synergistic effect for the improved capacitive property.
