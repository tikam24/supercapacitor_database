This proceeding provides readers with an overview of our multidisciplinary approach to technical textile research through reviewing recent preliminary results of an example project aiming at developing supercapacitor fabric structures. The fundamental idea of the project is based on, production of graphene nano-sheets and their application onto textile fabric, growing the oxides of manganese on graphene coating and utilization of the final fabric within a suitable electrolyte as electrode material. Graphene nano-sheet production and characterization methods, application to textile fabric and surface resistance measurements as well as construction of super-capacitor architecture and characterization of the final device capacitance via electrochemistry are presented.
