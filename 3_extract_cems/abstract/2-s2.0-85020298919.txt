A unique multilayered three-dimensional (3D) simonkolleite with good monodispersity was successfully synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method. Against the preference for being two-dimensional (2D) nanoplate morphologies, the 3D structure growth was attributed to a novel molecule structure upon ionization of a soluble long-chain quaternary ammonium carboxylic acid. Ion-adjusted experiments were designed and carried out to make deep insight into the morphology revolution versus ionic environment, indicating that the ionized acid not only provided an essential prerequisite for forming simonkolleite but also acted as a morphological directing agent to assist the formation of the final 3D morphology. We further demonstrated the utility of the multilayered 3D simonkolleite as an electrode material for a supercapacitor which provided improved electrochemical performance compared with 2D simonkolleite.
