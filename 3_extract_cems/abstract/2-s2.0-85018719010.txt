Kombucha, a renewable biomass, has been successfully utilized as an accessible carbon source to fabricate kombucha-derived hierarchical porous carbon (KHPC) by KOH direct treatment and in situ activation. The prepared KHPC shows an interconnected hierarchical porous structure, a pore volume of 0.41 cm3 g−1, and a specific surface area of 917 m2 g−1. Due to the multiple synergistic effects of these advantages, the KHPC-3 exhibits a high specific capacitance of 326 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 in 6 M KOH, good rate capability of 82% retention from 1 to 20 A g−1, and cycling performance with 91.3% retention over 5000 cycles. Moreover, the KHPC-3 symmetric supercapacitor reveals a good energy density of 20.97 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 871.2 W kg−1 and retains 8.08 Wh kg−1 at 6330 W kg−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Therefore, the KHPC obtained via the simple synthesis process shows great promise as an electrode material in energy storage devices.
