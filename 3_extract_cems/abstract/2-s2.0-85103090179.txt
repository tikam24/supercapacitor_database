This paper deals with the dynamic simulation of a developed equivalent circuit model of supercapacitors, taking into account the self-discharge phenomenon. The self-discharge is modeled with a time-varying resistance in the equivalent circuit. Using the acquired experimental data of the self-discharge experiments, an optimal number of exponential functions are fitted on the data employing the weighted least-square technique. The optimal number of the functions is determined considering a trade-off between the accuracy and complexity of the model. The results confirm a desirable performance of the model compared with the other similar models.
