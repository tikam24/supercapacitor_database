There has been a vast interest in recent years in developing convenient, cost-effective, and greener ways to use abundant natural resources with renewable qualities to alleviate problems associated with energy storage and polluted water sources. Biomass carbon materials have attracted much attention because of the advantages such as abundant resources, relatively low cost, developed pore structure, etc. Present work demonstrates the versatility, effectiveness, and potential of a biomass-derived electrode and adsorbent from bamboo parenchyma cells activated at relatively low temperature (650 °C). The multi-layer microcapsule shape of bamboo parenchyma cells and abundant pit structure enable this biomass material to have an ultrahigh surface area (3973 m2 g−1) and pore volume (2.076 cm3 g−1) after activation. The supercapacitor made of biomass carbon has the high specific capacitance of 276 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, exhibiting good capacity retention (89.48%) after 15000 cycles at 10 A g−1. Moreover, the biomass carbon has a maximum adsorption capacity of 1750 mg g−1 in methylene blue dye and demonstrates excellent continuous adsorption performance of continuous flow method. These results confirm that the biomass carbon from bamboo parenchyma cells has great potential for energy storage and cationic dyes removal.
