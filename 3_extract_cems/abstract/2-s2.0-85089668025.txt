A special gas-phase diffusion precipitation method with ammonia as the gas-phase diffusion precipitant was adopted. After fully reacting with different cobalt sources in a sealed space, the liquid funnel was separated and dried, and calcined at different temperatures for 2 h. The prepared Co3O4 powder was used as a supercapacitor (SCs) electrode to measure the electrochemical properties of the prepared material. The influences of different cobalt sources and sodium phosphate monobasic dehydrate on the preparation of Co3O4 SCs electrodes were investigated. The optimal performance of Co3O4 was 640 F·g−1 before modification, and this reached 1140 F·g−1 after modification, which was an improvement of 78.1%.
