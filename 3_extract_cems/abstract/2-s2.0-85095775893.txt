A nanotechnology is a robust tool for the solar system, which gives assistance to efficient, sustainable energy conversion, storage and conservation, in terms of adapting the interaction of light with materials and sanctioning the processing of low-cost semiconductors into devices such as photovoltaic devices. Passive solar systems, Supercapacitor, Solar collector, fuel cell, photo catalysis and solar photovoltaic and dye-sensitized solar cells are of major parts of solar systems, which used the nanomaterials in their systems. Nanomaterials are used as electrodes and electrolytes in various energy storage devices and they are becoming progressively important in areas such as electrochemical sensing, energy harvesting and storage. Nanomaterials have large surface-area-to-volume ratio compared to other bulk materials. Nanotechnology is an emerging technology that provides an increasing resource to resolve the problems related to energy because of their smaller than 100 nm which provides the way to detect, store and exchange energy. The different types of modern solar collecting technologies that use the nano- materials effectively and successfully have been discussed. We have concentrated on the applications of nanotechnology for different solar energy storage systems. Then we insisted on how nanotechnology substantially contributes to improve the performance of solar cell technologies. Finally, this review focus on how nanotechnology has played a wide role in bringing in sustainable energy from solar radiation.
