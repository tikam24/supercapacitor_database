Two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal chalcogenides exhibit excellent electrochemical properties in the energy storage field. We prepared molybdenum−tungsten chalcogenide/carbon (MWCC) hybrid nanosheets on nickel foams by using an one-pot solvothermal synthesis. The unique 2D structure of the MWCC electrode is beneficial to ion and electron transportation. Furthermore, the MWCC electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance in terms of the electrical double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance (1325.2 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1). Experimental tests showed that the structure, morphology, and electrochemical properties of the MWCC electrode are favorable for high-performance asymmetric supercapacitors with an active carbon (AC) negative electrode. The MWCC//AC device not only has a high specific capacitance (114.7 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), but also exhibit a high energy density of 40.8 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 799.1 W kg−1. Meanwhile, the MWCC//AC device maintains a capacitance retention of 89 % after 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1.
