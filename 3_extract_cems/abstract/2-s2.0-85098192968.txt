Plant-Microbial Fuel Cell (P-MFC) is a renewable power source which generates bioelectricity through the plant-microbe interrelationship at the rhizosphere region of a plant. As a step toward sustainable wireless sensing, PMFC can harness the metabolism of microorganism as a catalyst and use organic matter to generate electrical energy. However, these energy sources tend to produce low power outputs (mW), and the P-MFC energy capacity can be affected by perturbations. The P-MFC needs to be analyzed for an accurate integration in harvester circuits and wireless technologies, such as LPWAN, to develop sustainable wireless communication applications. In this study, a P-MFC array is implemented as a promising self-sustainable green energy communication technology for Internet of Things (IoT)-based wireless sensor network (WSN). The serial-parallel configuration of the Dypsis lutescens plant type is characterized and adapted with an energy harvester (EH) circuit which manages the energy from P-MFC. An energy capacity model is proposed to analyze the supercapacitor's charge response and the recovery effect after each Long-Range (LoRa) transmission of the sensor node. The integration of a power management strategy is used to improve the sustainable operation in each sensor node. Experimental results show an open circuit voltage of 1.75 V, and a short current circuit of 5.6 mA for the serial-parallel configuration of the P-MFC array. The test-scenarios demonstrate sustainable operation of the LoRa-WSNs after one month with a daily generation capacity of 80 J, which is sufficient for the WSN's node operation.
