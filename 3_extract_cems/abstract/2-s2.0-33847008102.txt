This paper presents the design, realization and power management of an Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) dedicated to hybrid vehicle applications. The proposed APU is based on a parallel arrangement of a Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell (PEFC) and a supercapacitor bank. The PEFC provides the mean power to the 42V DC bus, whereas the supercapacitors bank is sized to respond to the electrical power requirements during transients.
