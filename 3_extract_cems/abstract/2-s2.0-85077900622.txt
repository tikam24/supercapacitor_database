In this research, texture tailorable 3-dimension (3D) interconnected hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) monoliths were prepared by a simple method. By regulation of the polymerization rate of furfural alcohol in solvent, 3D HPC monoliths with various textures are obtained. The optimum HPC monolith shows high specific surface area of ∼580 m2 g-1 and desired morphology, texture and pore structure. The HPC monolith with ∼15 mg cm-2 mass loading delivers a high capacitance of 129.1 F g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and shows high rate capability of 76.9% capacitance retention when the current density increased 50-fold to 5 A g-1. The assembled supercapacitor can drive a toy fan for more than 30 min.
