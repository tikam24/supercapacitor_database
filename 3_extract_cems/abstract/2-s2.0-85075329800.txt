Materials with high surface area, tailored pore size and good electrical conductivity are needed for improved supercapacitors (SCs). Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have high surface areas and tailored pore sizes. Here, the MOF (1) of [Ni3(μ3OH)(pba)3(bpdc)1.5]·11.5DMA· 0.5CH3OH·7H2O is good enough to result in electrode materials with nearly ideal supercapacitive behavior at the rate up to 50 mV·s-1 in a KOH electrolyte. The super capacitive performance of MOF (1) was measured using cyclic voltammogram, galvanostatic discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. This MOF (1) as electrode exhibits the highest super capacitive properties with 417 F·g-1, the maximum storage energy and power density are 9.27 and 2.38 kW·kg-1. The long term stability of MOF (1) as SCs is checked that the capacitance is decreased by 17% after 1000 cycles.
