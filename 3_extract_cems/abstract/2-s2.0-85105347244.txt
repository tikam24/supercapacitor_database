In this paper, the hierarchical porous carbon coated nickel cobalt sulphide (NiCo2S4@HPC) nanowire composites in situ grown on Ni foam have been fabricated by a facile two-step hydrothermal method. The HPC with three-dimensional interconnected macroporous framework not only improves the structural stability subject to repeated charge-discharge cycles, but also enhances the conductivity and facilitates the rapid charge storage of NiCo2S4. When evaluated as an electrode material for supercapacitor, the NiCo2S4@HPC composite electrode exhibits a superior specific capacitance (1682.5 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g) and high cycling stability of 93.7 % capacitance retention after 2000 cycles at 1 A/g, which are superior to most reported NiCo2S4-based electrode materials, confirming the outstanding electrochemical performance of the NiCo2S4@HPC composite electrode. The present work not only proves the NiCo2S4@HPC nanowire composite to be an excellent electrode material for supercapacitors, but also promotes the practical applications of NiCo2S4-based composite materials in high-performance energy storage devices.
