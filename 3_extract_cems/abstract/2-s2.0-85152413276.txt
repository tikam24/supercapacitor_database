Polymer-based separators for energy storage applications are being developed to ensure the high safety, high performance, light weight, and low cost of the device. In this regard, poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) PVDF-HFP which is a co-polymer of PVDF is an excellent host polymer for energy storage applications as it possess both the crystalline PVDF and the amorphous HFP groups leading to both mechanical stability and ionic conductivity. Though the lithium-ion-conducting PVDF-HFP membranes are successfully utilized as the polymer electrolyte for lithium ion batteries, the enhanced ionic conductivity by usage of plasticizers often degrade their mechanical and thermal stability. Where else, when incorporated with graphene oxide (GO) as the filler, the membrane electrolytes show good ionic conducting nature, with no compromise on thermal stability and mechanical stability. Incorporation of GO results in porous nature and helps in the high electrolyte retention and electrochemical stability even at high potential window. In this review article, the influence of GO with respect to structural changes, thermal stability, and electrical properties is discussed in detail, which will pave way for further new aspects in membrane modification.
