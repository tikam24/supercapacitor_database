A reasonable electrode structure is important to improve the performance of supercapacitors. In this work, Leaf-like CuCo2O4@CuCo2O4 nanowires grown erectly on Ni foam substrate were prepared by two-step hydrothermal method to form a mutually perpendicular core–shell nanostructure. The binder-free CuCo2O4@CuCo2O4 nanowires were more likely to benefit from multidimensional synergistic effect and better conductivity, revealing a high specific capacitance of 5.86 F cm−2 at 5 mA cm−2 and good cycle stability (90.2 % after 8000 cycles). In addition, the SC based on CuCo2O4@CuCo2O4 battery-type electrodes exhibited good flexible properties. The environment friendly and low cost CuCo2O4@CuCo2O4//AC flexible SCs perform a high energy density of 0.35 mWh cm−2 at a power density of 8 mW cm−2. The results indicated that CuCo2O4@CuCo2O4 core-shell materials have high application value, thus providing a new type of advanced electrode for flexible SCs.
