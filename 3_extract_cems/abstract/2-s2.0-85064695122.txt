A stable MnO x @C@MnO x core–shell heterostructure consisting of vertical MnO x nanosheets grown evenly on the surface of the MnO x @carbon nanowires are obtained by simple liquid phase method combined with thermal treatment. The hierarchical MnO x @C@MnO x heterostructure electrode possesses a high specific capacitance of 350 F g −1 and an excellent cycle performance owing to the existence of the pore structure among the ultrasmall MnO x nanoparticles and the rapid transmission of electrons between the active material and carbon coating layer. Particularly, according to the in situ Raman spectra analysis, no characteristic peaks corresponding to MnOOH are found during charging/discharging, indicating that pseudocapacitive behavior of the MnO x electrode have no relevance to the intercalation/deintercalation of protons (H + ) in the electrolyte. Further combining in situ X-ray powder diffraction analysis, the diffraction peak of α-MnO 2 can be detected in the process of charging, while Mn 3 O 4 phase is found in discharge products. Therefore, these results demonstrate that the MnO x undergoes a reversible phase transformation reaction of Mn 3 O 4 ↔α-MnO 2 . Moreover, the assembled all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor with a MnO x @C@MnO x electrode delivers a high energy density of 23 Wh kg −1 , an acceptable power density of 2500 W kg −1 , and an excellent cyclic stability performance of 94% after 2000 cycles, showing the potential for practical application.
