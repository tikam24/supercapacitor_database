Ultra-fast microwave irradiation is used to synthesize 3D flower-like Co9S8 hierarchical architectures. Based on time-dependent SEM observations, a multistep splitting-growth mechanism is proposed to understand the formation of the observed structures. Moreover, the materials were used as electrodes to fabricate supercapacitors with high specific capacitances of 522, 499, 441, 436, and 397 Fg-1 at current densities of 0.5, 0.8,1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 Ag-1, respectively. The devices also show high charge-discharge reversibility, with an efficiency of 97.7% after cycling 1000 times at a current density of 1.0 Ag-1.
