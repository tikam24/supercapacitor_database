A free-standing binder-free 3D Ni@NiO nanowire membrane is fabricated by a simple filtration method followed by thermal annealing. With an appropriate annealing temperature, the functional nanowires can keep their rough and echinate surface, and the conductive network composed of welded nickel nanowire cores is well-preserved without isolation (0.53 ω/sq). The unique 3D multigrade mesporous structure not only accelerates the intercalation and deintercalation velocity of electrolyte ions but also provides numerous electroactive sites for the Faraday reaction. As a result, the supercapacitor electrode can preserve a capacitance retention of 96.1% (36.9 F/cm3) with a high discharge current density, indicating its wonderful rate capability. The fabricated membrane electrode exhibits high volumetric capacitance, stable cycling life, and remarkable retention of the capacitance at high rate, energy, and power density, making it a promising candidate for application in portable electronic products. © 2014 American Chemical Society.
