We report conceptual design and analysis of a supercapacitor-based voltage support system for a 13.8KV AC power system. The power source has been designed to ride through a 2s voltage sag caused either by high load demand or remote system fault. The simulation model currently supports study of both power injection and power absorption. Response of the SC storage to a line fault has also been studied and compared with the response due to high load demand. Simulation results verified the effectiveness of the integrated system and forms the basis for further development of a more robust system in terms of power management. Â©2010 IEEE.
