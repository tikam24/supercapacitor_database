The supercapacitor technology is maturing to play an important role in the todayâ€™s hybrid electrical energy storage systems. Supercapacitors are dominated by unique properties that can accompany other energy storage strategies due to its functional characteristics-such as quick charge and discharge ability, high power density, very long cycle life. It results in to improved system efficiency of hybrid electric energy systems with reduced environmental pollution levels. In this paper, efforts are made to construct a low-cost model of supercapacitor using synthesised carbon material obtained from the pyrolyzed scrap tyre by using both aqueous and Aloe vera gel as semi-aqueous or semi-organic electrolyte. The test results are obtained in the specially developed laboratory to investigate the characteristics of fabricated supercapacitor in terms of capacitance, internal resistance and peak current. The obtained results are superior as compare to Vulcan XC-72R with tradeoff between peak discharge current and other parameters. New carbon material obtained from scrap tyres is cost effective when used along with Aloe vera gel as an electrolyte. Use of scrap tyre carbon as electrode material and Aloe vera gel as naturally available material for electrolyte is an innovation of the presented work.
