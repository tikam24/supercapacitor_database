Composite structural supercapacitors (CSSs), that provide both mechanical and electrochemical properties, have great potential for applications in electric vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles and portable electronic devices with reduced overall system weight and volume. In this paper, a novel composite structural supercapacitor device is designed and fabricated, mainly consisting of energy storage units (flexible devices) and a structural unit (carbon fiber reinforced polymer, CFRP). KOH activated carbon cloth (ACC) and PVA-KOH gel electrolyte are selected as the electrode and electrolyte of the energy storage units, respectively. The specific capacitance, energy density and power density of 1:1 ACC-CSS reach 88 mF⋅g−1, 9.9 mWh⋅kg−1 and 445.5 mW⋅kg−1, respectively. Meanwhile, the flexural strength, flexural modulus and shear strength of 1:1 ACC-CSS achieve 230 MPa, 21 GPa and 8.75 MPa, respectively. In addition, the excellent stability of electrochemical performance of 1:1 ACC-CSS under various external loads is verified by electrochemical three-point bending, electrochemical tensile and electrochemical tensile fatigue tests as well. Experimental results show that even after mechanical failure, 1:1 ACC-CSS can still maintain its electrochemical performance. The combination of good electrochemical and mechanical properties of 1:1 ACC-CSS makes it a promising and competitive candidate for the development of composite structural energy storage devices.
