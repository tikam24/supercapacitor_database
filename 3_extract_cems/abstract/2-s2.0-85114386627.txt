Energy storage characteristics of organic molecules continue to attract attention for supercapacitor applications, as they offer simple processing and can be employed for flexible devices. The current study utilized the ultrasonically driven exfoliation to obtain poly diketo pyrrolopyrrole-thieno thiophene (PDPT) and multiwalled carbon nanotube (CNT) composite, subsequently fabricated a PDPT donor–π–acceptor heterojunction with CNT and investigated energy storage applications. The composite was characterized using series of standard analytical techniques. Morphology indicated well alighted CNT tubes on PDPT polymer nanosheets with an effective interface, providing efficient electrochemical regions, enabling fast charge transfer between PDPT and CNT. We also investigated the PDPT-CNT composite electrochemical behavior, achieving 319.2 and 105.7F.g−1 capacitances for PDPT-CNT and PDPT at 0.5 A.g−1 current density for three electrode configurations; and 126 and 42F.g−1 for symmetric structures, respectively. Experimental results confirmed that PDPT-CNT composite electrodes achieved two fold the capacitance compared with PDPT alone. The hypothesis and synthetic approach provide an excellent candidate for conjugated polymers with carbon nanotubes and energy related devices.
