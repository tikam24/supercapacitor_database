Engineering novel nano/microarchitectures has attracted great attention because they can provide conductive, morphological, and remarkable electrochemical properties in energy storage and energy conversion fields. Herein, the Co2Mo3O8/Co3O4 (CMO/CO) micro-flower-like architectures were prepared via a simple one-step hydrothermal technique. The CMO/CO-based electrode samples were investigated at different reaction temperatures of 120, 150, and 180 °C. The prepared CMO/CO-150 material revealed a large specific surface area (108.57 m2 g−1). The excellent specific capacity value of 301 mAh g−1 (2142 F g−1) at 1 A g−1 of current density was obtained by the optimized CMO/CO-150 sample. Moreover, after successfully performing 5000 cycles at 20 mA cm−2, the CMO/CO electrode represented a capacity retention of 92% with 99% coulombic efficiency. Additionally, the designed pouch-like asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) with the optimized CMO/CO-150 material and activated carbon material delivered high energy and power density values of 34.38 Wh kg−1 and 2987.07 W kg−1, respectively. For testing practical applications, the fabricated ASC device was also employed to power portable electronic devices. Consequently, the achieved outstanding electrochemical results suggest that CMO/CO electrodes are favorable material for energy storage applications.
