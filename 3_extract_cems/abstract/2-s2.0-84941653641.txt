Hybrid Light Rail Vehicle (HLRV) with on-board energy storage systems has good characteristic in technical and economical. The control strategy for a voltage-regulated dc hybrid power source employing Lithium Battery (LB) as the main power source and Supercapacitor (SCAP) as the auxiliary power source is proposed. To ensure energy-efficient operation of the system and reduce the current ripple, the use of paralleling Bidirectional Dc-dc Converter (BDC) with interleaved technique is applied. As a high dynamic and high-power density device, SCAP functions to supply energy to regulate the DC bus energy. LB, as a slower dynamic source in the system, functions by supplying energy to keep SCAP charged or discharged with limited current. Simulation results obtained from the control strategy are presented and analyzed.
