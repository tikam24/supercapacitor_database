We report on the impact of laser processing on material and device performance characteristics for integrated energy applications. A femtosecond laser was used for development of flexible and transparent supercapacitors, while a nanosecond laser was successfully exploited for high-performance Al–air battery development. A laser direct-write process enabled integration of a three-dimensional-structured micro-supercapacitor on flexible polymer substrate, exhibiting peak specific capacitance of 42.6 mF/cm2 at current density of 0.1 mA/cm2. Femtosecond laser processing was also exploited for development of a novel transparent supercapacitor on silk substrate. The MnO2-coated transparent supercapacitors exhibited high transmittance exceeding 59%. Laser processing in combination with printing technique was used for development of a novel Al–air battery. The nanosecond laser process was effective in sintering the anode printed using Al nanoparticle ink. The efficiency of the laser sintering process was reflected in good battery discharge performance.
