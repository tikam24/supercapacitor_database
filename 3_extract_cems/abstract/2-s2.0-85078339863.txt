Mixed metal sulfides with high specific capacitances and superior rate capabilities can meet the need of new materials for technological advancement of energy storage systems. We demonstrate in this study a facile fabrication of microspheres-like NixMny sulfides with different molar ratios of metallic salts through a one-step solvothermal route. The hierarchical NixMny sulfides-based compounds feature spherical architectures with relatively rough surfaces and assembled from ultrasmall and self-aggregated nanoprimary crystals. Especially, the NixMny sulfide (x/y = 1:1) presents an excellent battery-like performance with a high specific capacitance (219.4 mAh g−1 at current density of 1 A g−1) and a good rate capability (123 mAh g−1 at 50 A g−1), benefiting from the greatly improved faradaic redox processes boosted by the synergistic effect of Ni and Mn electroactive components and as well as fast mass transfer. Furthermore, the as-fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor based on NixMny sulfide (x/y = 1:1) presents a maximum energy density of 34 W h kg−1 at a power density of 868.1 W kg−1 with both superior rate and long-term cycling stabilities. In view of low cost and improved electrochemical performance, such integrated compound proposes a new and feasible pathway as a potential electrode configuration for energy storage devices.
