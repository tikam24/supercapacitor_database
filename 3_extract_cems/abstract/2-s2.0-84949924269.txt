This paper presents a control principle for a hybrid wind turbine-Fuel cell and supercapacitor system. Several techniques of control necessitate a linear mathematical model in order to get an inverse dynamic solution. However, in more complex systems the linearization is not sufficient to solve the problem. Therefore, a flatness control has been used in this study, which permits the entire description of the state's trajectories, and so to improve the dynamic response of those systems. A design for a renewable-energy hybrid power plant that is fed by a wind turbine and fuel cell with a supercapacitor as auxiliary power source has been presented in this study. The system is suitable for stand-alone generation applications or grid connected. Also this paper introduces the results of the energy management simulation using the technique of planning.
