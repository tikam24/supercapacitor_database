As an energy storage device with high energy density and power density simultaneously, hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) have attracted more and more attention. The electrochemical performance of electrode material has a decisive effect on hybrid devices. To develop excellent faradaic electrode material for aqueous hybrid Li-ion HSCs, the silver ion pre-embedded manganese oxide materials (marked as AMO) are successfully synthesized by a high-temperature solid-phase method. In comparison to MnO2, the specific capacitance of AMO-400 is greatly improved from 246.0 to 326.1 F g-1at 0.5 mV s-1. When matched with activated carbon to assemble the Li-ion HSCs with the widened voltage window of 0-2.1 V, the highest power density of 3211.0 W kg-1and energy density of 111.0 Wh kg-1are obtained.
