Potassium ion hybrid capacitors have the advantages of high energy density, high power density, and low cost, and are expected to replace expensive lithium ion storage devices in large-scale applications. Here, an innovative nitrogen-rich biomass carbon (N-CHC) is prepared using urea as the etchant and hemp core as the raw material, which has a high specific surface area of 1185.3 m2 g−1 and nitrogen content of 8.56%. In addition, it shows a capacity of 442.4 mAh g−1 as a potassium ion half-cell anode at 30 mA g−1. Even under the high current test of 2000 mA g−1, N-CHC also shows excellent performance (175.0 mAh g−1). Further, the good rate performance is attributed to the large-scale capacitance control by analyzing reaction process kinetics. And the constant current intermittent titration technique (GITT) results show that N-CHC has a larger K+ diffusion coefficient than unetched biomass carbon. The maximum energy density of the full carbon-based hybrid capacitor composed of N-CHC anode and activated carbon cathode is 127.36 Wh kg−1, and the maximum power density is 2371 W kg−1.
