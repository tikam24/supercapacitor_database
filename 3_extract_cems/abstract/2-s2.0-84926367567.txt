This paper demonstrates our progress on the development of dual function energy storage and structural materials. Such materials require a mechanically robust interface that exists between a conventional bulk material and a nano- or microstructured material that serve to both reinforce a polymer composite and store charge. Our work demonstrates that porous silicon materials, which are etched directly on-wafer, are promising candidates to explore the proof-of-concept of this unique multifunctional device platform. We demonstrate a testing approach that combines an assessment of mechanical properties and electrochemical supercapacitor charge transport properties in real-time, enabling understanding of the mechanical-electrochemical coupling in energy storage structural materials. Our work gives promise to the development of a broad range of energy storage materials that can be dually utilized for load-bearing structural composites in many technological platforms.
