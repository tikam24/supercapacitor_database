Nanocomposites (NC-X) of Ni/Co-MOFs with varying weight% of functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (F-MWCNTs) were synthesized by solvothermal method. Physicochemical properties of NC-X were analyzed by different analytical techniques. Further, electrochemical studies were made to comprehend the effect of weight% of F-MWCNTs in the nanocomposites for high-performance supercapacitors. 20 wt% of F-MWCNTs in the nanocomposite exhibited higher supercapacitance performance (890 F/g at 2.5 A/g) than other nanocomposites. The fabricated asymmetric coin cell (ASC) offered high energy and power densities of 56.25 Wh/kg and 11.9 kW/kg, respectively, with 20,000 cycle stability at 25 A/g (1 M KOH). The ASC also retained 72% capacitance with 100% coulombic efficiency at 20,000th cycle. Six ASC of each cell with operating potential window of 1.8 V were utilized in powering three red light emitting diodes (LEDs-12 V) connected in series. Thus, demonstrating the practical application of ASCs to power LEDs for 3 min.
