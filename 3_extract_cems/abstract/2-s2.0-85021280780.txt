Incessant streak of unsuccessful attempts to synthesize low cost graphene with larger flake size and purity is frequently reported. Any reported methods that result in few layers of graphene with minimal contamination are definitive to exist. In this work, graphene was prepared economically from source of "paper" and detailed investigation was done on the effect of synthesizing parameters like paper source, temperature and amount of urea in the formation of graphene. This is a cost effective method, in which the paper that we use in our daily life was carbonized with the help of urea at a temperature of 850 C under N2 atmosphere. The paper source was varied, shape of the paper was altered and the graphene paper with large surface area was synthesized without smudging and the prepared graphene paper was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) for its structural, morphological investigation. To test the supercapacitance performance, electrochemical behavior was investigated in 6M KOH electrolyte. The specific capacitance of 1122F/g was obtained at 5mV/s scan rate. Chronopotentiometry curves showed an excellent cyclic stability with higher charge/discharge duration and hence could be used for electrochemical supercapacitor applications.
