Ever-increasing energy needs advancement of alternative energy solutions for storage and conversion together with less environmental damage. In this concern, supercapacitors gained much attention due to the outstanding electrochemical performance. The electrochemical performance of the supercapacitor depends on the electrode materials. However, owing to limitation of single active materials, recent attention has been focused on the designing of the heterostructure electrode materials which shows the superior electrochemical performance due to synergistic effect between the two components. This chapter mainly focused on recently developed hetero-structured electrode materials such as 2D, 3D, metal oxide based and metal hydroxide based heterostructures along with their electrochemical performance. In addition, the advantages of the heterostructures over mono structures have also been discussed.
