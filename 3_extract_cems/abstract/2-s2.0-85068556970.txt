Supercapacitors, as an emerging energy storage device, have many advantages like fast charging, high power density, long service life, wide working temperature range, environment friendly, etc., and surpass the traditional chemical battery such as Li-ion battery and some other ordinary capacitor in terms of manufacture and use. This work aims to prepare a high performance supercapacitor electrode material from pomelo peel, a kind of natural biomass. Firstly, conducted the high-temperature carbonization of pomelo peel under N2 protection to acquire the activated carbon, and then gained the activated carbon/polyaniline nanocomposite by adopting the optimized mass ratio of 1: 1, through an in-situ polymerization. Subsequently this nanocomposite material experienced a high-temperature recarbonization process, and transformed into the desired activated carbon product. Supercapacitor electrode based on the product was fabricated and its electrochemical properties was determined. The results showed that, the activated carbon material acquired by recarbonizing the pomelo peel carbon/polyaniline composite exhibits a specific capacitance of 358 F/g, and a capacitance retention of 95% after 2 000 charge-discharge cycles, indicating a satisfactory cycle stability.
