Benefitting from the large interlayer spacing, ultrahigh conductivity and abundant surface chemistry, Ti3C2Tx has been a promising electrode material for supercapacitors (SCs). CoS has attracted much attention due to its low cost, weak Co-S bond and relatively high theoretical capacity. Herein, CoS nanowires were grown on few-layered Ti3C2Tx by one-step solvothermal method as a SC electrode. Within the composite, Ti3C2Tx could function as conductive network and buffer matrix to provide ultra-fast electronic transport and relieve volume expansion of CoS nanowires. Simultaneously, the active CoS nanowires with high capacitance act as interlayer spacer to restrain the restacking of Ti3C2Tx nanosheets. As a result, CoS/Ti3C2Tx-5 electrode exhibits a remarkable improvement specific capacitance of 528 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and ultrahigh capacitance retention of 99.3% after 20 000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g−1. The attempts and efforts made in this work provide a prototype for achieving excellent electrochemical properties.
