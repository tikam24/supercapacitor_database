A hybrid ternary nanocomposite of NiO nanospheres, CuO rods and reduced graphene oxide was synthesized by adopting a facile hydrothermal process. The structural, morphology and electrochemical behaviour of the as-synthesized compound is studied. On the grown graphene sheets, copper oxide with the morphology of nanorods and NiO with the morphology of sphere was visible in this electrode from the TEM images. The electrode exhibits a high-specific capacity due to its novel three-dimensional structure, better conductivity, increased electrolyte contact area, and synergistic effects between the electrode materials. A specific capacitance of 531.56 F/g was obtained with the highest energy and power density of 170.09 Wh/kg and 2.5 kW/kg, respectively, under 1 M Na2CO3 electrolyte. Cycling stability of 88.3% was achieved for 5000 cycles making it a promising candidate for supercapacitor electrodes.
