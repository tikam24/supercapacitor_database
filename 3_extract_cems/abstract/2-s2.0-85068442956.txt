1D α-MoO3 nanobelts were prepared using ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate [(NH4)6Mo7O244H2O] as raw material by one-step hydrothermal method without template or guide agent at 180°C. The layered α-MoO3 nanobelt electrode has favorable electrochemical performance, and displays a fairly high specific capacitance, which can be up to 445F/g at a current density of 0.5A/g.
