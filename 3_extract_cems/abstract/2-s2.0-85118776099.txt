Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely employed as a sacrificial template for the construction of nanostructured materials for a range of applications including energy storage. Herein, we report a facile mixed-ligand strategy for the synthesis of a Cu-MOF, [Cu3(Azopy)3(BTTC)3(H2O)3·2H2O]n (where BTTC = 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylic acid and Azopy = 4,4′-Azopyridine), via a slow-diffusion method at room temperature. X-ray analysis authenticates the two-dimensional (2D)-layered framework of Cu-MOF. Topologically, this 2D-layered structure is assigned as a 4-connected unimodal net with sql topology. Further, nanostructured CuO is obtained via a simple precipitation method by employing Cu-MOF as a precursor. After analysis of their physicochemical properties through various techniques, both materials are used as surface modifiers of glassy carbon electrodes for a comparative electrochemical study. The results reveal a superior charge storage performance of CuO (244.2 F g-1 at a current density of 0.8 A g-1) with a high rate capability compared to Cu-MOF. This observation paves the pathway for the strategic design of high-performing supercapacitor electrode materials.
