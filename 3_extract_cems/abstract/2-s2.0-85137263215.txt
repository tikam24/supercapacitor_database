A Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS), consists of two or more types of energy storage technologies, mostly includingbatteries, flywheels, super-capacitors, and fuel cells. The complementary features of HESS make it outperform any single energy storage device depending on the application energy requirements in different scenarios/conditions. To overcome the opposing limitations of battery and supercapacitor, the battery has relatively high energy density but low power density as compared to the supercapacitor, an active battery/supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system (HESS) with dc/dc converter is proposed. However, the main issue with an active battery/supercapacitor HESS is current flow control to accomplish two goals: minimizing the magnitude fluctuation of current flowing in/out of the battery and minimizing energy loss experienced by the supercapacitor/s. The purpose of this article is to perform optimization of an active battery/supercapacitor HESS for a Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV). The HESS topology used for the optimization consists of a parallel connected battery and supercapacitor/s to drive the load through the respective dc/dc converters. In this article, an efficient multiplicative-increase-additive-decrease concept-based algorithm is used to ensure an optimal solution. MATLAB simulations are used to demonstrate that the proposed scheme can optimally minimize the magnitude fluctuation of the battery current and the SC energy loss.
