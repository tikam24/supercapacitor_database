Petroleum products such as petrol and diesel are being depleted day by day. This is forcing the world to shift toward electric vehicles (EVs). However, the EV market is not yet growing at the expected rate due to the lack of charging stations, small time support, and short battery life. Hence, the main motive of this paper is to design a control module using a Li-ion battery, a supercapacitor, and a DC-DC converter that controls the power flow in hybrid electric vehicles. A battery with high energy density will provide sufficient power to EVs on a plane road. However, the battery fails to provide the required power to accelerate EVs in hilly regions and uneven roads. This problem will be overcome by the use of supercapacitors. This will also increase the travel time of EVs. Further, the hybrid use of a supercapacitor with a battery will increase the power density and simultaneously reduce stress on the battery. This will also increase the life of the battery. The efficiency of the designed model is validated using the simulation results and the characteristics of torque speed are evaluated. The state of charge of the battery and supercapacitor is also tested.
