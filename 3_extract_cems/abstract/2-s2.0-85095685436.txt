The electrochemical behaviour of steel, copper, and titanium current collectors was studied in aqueous solutions of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) at various concentrations, from 0.5 up to 20 m. As the concentration of the electrolyte increases, the electrochemical window of water stability widens according to the “water-in-salt” concept. The metal grids have been studied electrochemically, both under anodic and cathodic conditions, by means of cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. Subsequently, a microscopic analysis with SEM and compositional analysis with XPS was carried out to evaluate the surface modifications following electrochemical stress. We found that copper is not very suitable for this kind of application, while titanium and steel showed interesting behaviour and large electrochemical window.
