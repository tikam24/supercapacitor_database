The rapid development of miniaturized electronic devices has greatly stimulated the endless pursuit of high-performance on-chip micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) delivering both high energy and power densities. To this end, an advanced three-dimensional (3D) microelectrode architecture design offers enormous opportunities due to high mass loading of active materials, large specific surface areas, fast ion diffusion kinetics, and short electron transport pathways. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in the rational design of 3D architectured microelectrodes including 3D dense microelectrodes, 3D nanoporous microelectrodes, and 3D macroporous microelectrodes. Furthermore, the emergent microfabrication strategies are discussed in detail in terms of charge storage mechanisms and structure-performance correlation for on-chip MSCs. Finally, we conclude with a perspective on future opportunities and challenges in this thriving field.
