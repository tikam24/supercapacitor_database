Herein, a kind of carbon/carbon composite electrode is prepared using polyimide (PI)/3D sphere-like polyimide composite films as precursors, followed by carbonization. 2,2-bis(3-amino-4-hydroxyphenyl)hexafluoropropane and 4,4’-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)diphthalic anhydride are polymerized and thermally imidized to form the matrix, and 3D sphere-like PI particles synthesized by the solvothermal process are introduced via the in situ polymerization method. The electrochemical behaviors of C/C composites are examined in relation to the loading of the 3D sphere-like PI crystals and carbonization temperatures. The C/C composite PI/5%3D-PI-800 demonstrates a specific capacitance maximum of 322.7 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 due to synergistic effects between different types of PIs. The specific capacitance decreases to 214 F g−1 with a retention rate of 66.3% as the current density increases to 10 A g−1. Moreover, the symmetrical supercapacitor (SC) assembled by PI/5%3D-PI-800 shows a specific capacitance of 244.4 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, with a high energy density of 33.94 Wh kg−1 and a power density of 500 W kg−1. In addition, after 6 months of storage, the button SC is retested and still shows fantastic capacitance retention rate of above 99.5%. Thus, this work proposes a facile method to fabricate the C/C composite electrodes with outstanding electrochemical properties.
