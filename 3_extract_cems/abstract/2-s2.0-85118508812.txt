The hausmannite phase manganese oxide nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by a simple chemical reflux method. Powder X-ray diffraction shows the well-crystalline structure of Mn3O4 spinel. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy study exhibited the Mn-O functional group vibrations in the hausmannite NPs. UV-visible spectroscopy study reveals that the optical bandgap energy of the manganese oxide nanoparticles is about 3.1eV. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis shows that the surface morphologies of the manganese oxide nanoparticles are wrinkle structures. Cyclic voltammetry studies were carried out to the electrode of Mn3O4 NPs in KOH and Na2SO4. The charge-discharge analysis and impedance spectroscopy method analysis were made on Mn3O4 NPs to understand the electrochemical performance. The ability of synthesized Mn3O4 NPs electrodes was analyzed and compared with the existing materials for the supercapacitor applications.
