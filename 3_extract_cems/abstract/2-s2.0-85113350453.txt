The world today depends on an uninterrupted flow of cost-effective and clean electricity. The rapid urbanization of the major population is placing more burden on the existing infrastructure-especially on the local power grids. The concept of microgrid reduces this burden to a greater extent but the voltage and transient stability of the system should always be maintained as this rising demand of uninterrupted electricity comes with more dynamic load fluctuations. The energy storage system of the microgrid can deal with this and could keep the bus voltage and transient stability under control. In this paper, battery and super-capacitor is used as energy storing devices and a fuzzy logic controller is proposed to determine the super-capacitor reference current to keep the DC bus voltage and transient within stability limits. It reveals that the results obtained by the proposed controller are comparable with that of the High Pass Filter.
