Molybdenum sulfide (MoS 2 ) is regarded as a promising material for supercapacitor applications but the intrinsically low electrical conductivity greatly limits its high specific capacitances. Herein, we introduce sulfur vacancy on MoS 2 nanolayer (MoS 2−x ) by a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) process. By further using the highly conductive carbon nanotube (CNT) networks as the current collector, the as-fabricated defect-rich MoS 2 @CNTs/Ni core/shell-structured electrode delivers an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 512F g −1 at 1 A g −1 , excellent rate performance (342F g −1 at 30 A g −1 ) and long cycle life (no decay after 2000 cycles) in 1 M Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte, which are among the best reported values for MoS 2 -based supercapacitors. Along with the experiment results, our DFT calculations further demonstrate that the S vacancy can create deep acceptor levels in the MoS 2 monolayer, which can trap electrons and improve the electrons mobility. For practical application, we build an asymmetrical supercapacitor (ASC) with MoS 2−x @CNTs/Ni as the positive electrode and CNT networks as the negative electrode, which exhibits a large energy density of 63 Wh kg −1 at 850 W kg −1 and an impressive power density of 25.5 kW kg −1 at 44.2 Wh kg −1 . These results indicate that PLD is a very powerful technique to construct the binder-free film electrodes for energy storage applications.
