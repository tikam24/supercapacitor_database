Abstract: The development of novel electrochemical energy storage (EES) technologies to enhance the performance of EES devices in terms of energy capacity, power capability and cycling life is urgently needed. To address this need, supercapatteries are being developed as innovative hybrid EES devices that can combine the merits of rechargeable batteries with the merits of supercapacitors into one device. Based on these developments, this review will present various aspects of supercapatteries ranging from charge storage mechanisms to material selection including electrode and electrolyte materials. In addition, strategies to pair different types of electrode materials will be discussed and proposed, including the bipolar stacking of multiple supercapattery cells internally connected in series to enhance the energy density of stacks by reducing the number of bipolar plates. Furthermore, challenges for this stack design will also be discussed together with recent progress on bipolar plates.
