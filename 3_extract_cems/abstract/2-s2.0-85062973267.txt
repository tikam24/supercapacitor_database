Polyaniline (PANI) has been used as a popular pseudo-capacitive material for supercapacitors due to its higher capacitance compared to carbon-based electric double-layer capacitors. However, PAN I exhibits relatively low conductivity, poor cycle stability, and hence limited usage in high power capability due to its large volumetric change. The integration of PANI with carbonaceous nanomaterials has been highly efficient in improving the above disadvantages. This chapter reports recent developments of carbon-based PANI composites for supercapacitors. Various methods, including chemical oxidative polymerization, electrochemical polymerization, interfacial polymerization, Pickering emulsion polymerization, electrodeposition, electrospinning, solution mixing, self-assembly, and chemical grafting are demonstrated, respectively. The relationship between the device performance and nanostructures of PANI and its composites is then discussed. General guidelines for rational design and optimal fabrication of carbon-based PANI composites for supercapacitors are further provided. Critical challenges and potential perspectives regarding the composites for supercapacitors are finally presented.
