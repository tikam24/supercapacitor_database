An electrolyte, N, N′ -1,4-diethyl, triethylene, and diamine tetrafluoroborate dissolved in glutaronitrile, was developed and investigated in a symmetrical supercapacitor using activated carbon as electrodes (active carbon∫active carbon). The electrochemical performance of the simulated supercapacitor was examined using ac impedance, cyclic voltammetry, and constant current charging/discharging tests. According to the results, the electrochemical window of the supercapacitor could reach 4.2 V, and its single-anode specific capacitance could reach 245.3 F g-1. The supercapacitor also has better capacitance characteristics, reversibility, and cyclic characteristics. © 2010 The Electrochemical Society.
