To increase the active material loading coupled with the improvement of electrical conductivity and ionic transport in the TiO2 based negative electrode for 2.4 V aqueous asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs), a highly ordered binder-free multi-layered hydrogenated TiO2-II phase nanowire array (ML-HTO) electrode is synthesized via a multi-step method. Due to the highly ordered scaffold-like multi-layered structure, a hydrogenated TiO2-II phase, small TiO2 grains (4.4 nm), high oxygen vacancy (Ti3+) concentration and functionalized hydrophilic surfaces, endowing the electrode with high electrical conductivity (low band gap of 2.39 eV), more positive flat-band potential (-0.35 V) and a high Na+ diffusion coefficient (3.08 Ã— 10-8 cm2 s-1), the as-prepared ML-HTO electrode with high active material loading (3.0 mg cm-2) exhibits a high areal specific capacitance (710.7 mF cm-2), which is much higher than that of a pristine TiO2 nanowire array (TO) electrode (28.3 mF cm-2) and the single layered hydrogenated TiO2 nanowire array (HTO) electrode (258.7 mF cm-2). Consequently, a 2.4 V aqueous ASC was firstly assembled with the ML-HTO electrode as the negative electrode, presenting a high energy density of 90.3 W h kg-1 at 349.0 W kg-1, as well as a high volumetric energy density of 9.6 mW h cm-3 at 61.0 mW cm-3, which is much higher than most of previously reported aqueous ASCs. The capacitance retention of the as-prepared MnO2//ML-HTO ASC is 65.7% after 10000 cycles, demonstrating its long cycle life.
