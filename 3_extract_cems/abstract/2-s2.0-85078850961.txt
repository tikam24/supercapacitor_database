This work reports the fabrication of carbon nanotube (CNT) decorated NiSe2 nanosheets (NiSe2@CNT) by a rapid microwave process in 2 min. Interestingly, NiSe2@CNT has a lamellar and tubular interwoven morphology. The specific capacitance of the prepared electrodes with different microwave conditions for supercapacitors were studied. Meanwhile, we compared the electrochemical performances of NiSe2@CNT with the presence of different amount of CNT. The optimal NiSe2@CNT electrode can demonstrate a high specific capacitance of 980.5 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and good cycling stability of 82% retention after 9000 cycles at 5 A g−1. In addition, an asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled by NiSe2@CNT as positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as negative electrode, which successfully light four white light emitting diodes (LEDs) for 6 min with an energy density of 25.61 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 810 W kg−1.
