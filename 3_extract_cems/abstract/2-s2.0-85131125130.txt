This paper introduced four common methods to improve the voltage balance of supercapacitor. Because of the advantages of high efficiency and high speed, the flyover capacitor method is selected to solve the problem of different charging and discharging speed of supercapacitor caused by different parameters of supercapacitor. In order to further improve the efficiency of the supercapacitor charging and discharging control system, a fuzzy control algorithm is designed based on the balance strategy of the flyover capacitor to further improve the efficiency of the supercapacitor charging and discharging control system. Finally, the validity of the design is verified by PSIM simulation software.
