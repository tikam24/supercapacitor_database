Turbinaria turbinata brown seaweeds were tested as carbon electrode material in symmetric, electrochemical supercapacitors. The electrochemical properties of the carbon materials were characterised for their application as supercapacitors using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge method and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic analyses. Our initial results showed that the optimal behaviour was obtained for the sample prepared by pyrolysis at 800 °C. The average surface area of the carbon was 812 m2/g. Electrochemical tests with an organic electrolyte gave the following interesting results: a capacitance of 74.5 F/g, a specific series resistance of 0.5 Ω cm2 and an ionic resistivity of 1.3 Ω cm2. These results show the promising capacitive properties of carbon derived from seaweeds and their application in electrochemical supercapacitors. © 2012 Académie des sciences.
