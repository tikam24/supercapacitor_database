This paper presents a novel cooperative control strategy of the hybrid energy recuperation system (HERS) for regenerative braking energy recovery in metro trains. HERS consists of a wayside supercapacitor (SC) energy storage system and a voltage source converter (VSC). The regenerative energy is preferentially stored in SC during train electrical braking through large current charging to limit the contact line peak current. The excess energy is fed back to the auxiliary equipment in metro stations through VSC when SCs are fully charged. VSC is also working as STATCOM to achieve the reactive-power compensation for the metro traction substation. A scale-down simulation model of HERS is developed to verify the cooperative control strategy. The simulation results show that the voltage drop and surge during acceleration and braking are limited and the regenerative energy usage rate is improved. Furthermore, the power factor of the auxiliary power supply system is increased.
