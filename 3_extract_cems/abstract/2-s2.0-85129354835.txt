While supercapacitors have been widely studied as the next generation of energy storage devices, to develop active electrode materials for enhancing device performance is still challenging. Herein, we fabricated asymmetric supercapacitors based on NiZn-Layered double hydroxide (LDH) @NiCoSe2 hierarchical nanostructures as electrode materials. The NiZn-LDH@NiCoSe2 composites are deposited on Ni foam by a two-step strategy, in which NiZn-LDH nanosheets were firstly grown on Ni foam by hydrothermal method, and then NiCoSe2 particles were prepared by electrodeposition. Due to the synergistic effect between NiZn-LDH and NiCoSe2, excellent device performance was achieved. In a three-electrode system, the NiZn-LDH@NiCoSe2 exhibits a specific capacitance of 2980 F g-1 at 1 A g-1. Furthermore, the asymmetric supercapacitor of NiZn-LDH@NiCoSe2//activated carbon (AC) device was assembled, which exhibits the energy density of 49.2 Wh kg-1 at the power density of 160 W kg-1, with the capacity retention rate is 91% after 8000 cycles. The results indicates that NiZn-LDH@NiCoSe2 is a promising candidate as electrode materials for efficient energy storage devices.
