This paper presents a flatness control algorithm for a DC hybrid power sources used in Electric Vehicle (EV). The studied hybrid sources is composed by both electric sources, the first one is PEM fuel cell as the main sources, and the second one is supercapacitors pack considered as the auxiliary source. The load is connected directly in the DC link. The control algorithm is based on the flatness properties of the system. The advantage of this control algorithm is that the state variable and control system are downright estimated by the trajectories of the flat output derived from these outputs without the need to integrate any different equation. The results obtained by the new proposed control of hybrid source under Matlab/Simulink software tool are given. Â© 2013 IEEE.
