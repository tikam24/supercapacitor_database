Abstract: Currently, there is a growing demand for miniaturized power supplies, including planar supercapacitors, whose principle of operation is based on fast redox reactions. This circumstance stimulates investigations of composite structures made of high-surface-area carbon-based materials and transition-metal compounds. In this paper, we report the results of studying coatings based on few-layer graphite nanoflakes FLGN/Ni(OH)2 and their oxidized form OFLGN/Ni(OH)2, obtained by repeated electrophoretic deposition. These coatings are used in prototype parallel-plate (3D) and planar supercapacitors. A processing route using a 450-nm laser for pattern scribing is developed for the latter. It is shown that, by regulating the nickel-ion-source proportion in the suspension from 0.04 to 0.64 g/L, one can control the physical properties of the composite at the deposition stage. The compositeâ€™s physical properties are studied by cyclic voltammetry, scanning microscopy, and elemental analysis. The peak capacity values are obtained for samples with the minimum concentration (0.04 g/L); they turn out to be 1.51 and 1.31 F/g for the FLGN-containing samples and 1.86 and 1.29 F/g for the OFLGN-containing samples of bulk and planar supercapacitors, respectively.
