Rational design of advanced electrode materials is highly desirable and technically important for developing high-performance electrochemical supercapacitors. In this work, we have successfully synthesized MgCo2O4 nanosheet, nanobelt, and nanowire arrays on graphene-coated nickel foam by a facile three-step synthesis method. The morphologies of MgCo2O4 arrays can be readily tuned by changing the volume ratio of DEG and deionized water. Moreover, when explored as supercapacitor electrode, the MgCo2O4 nanowire arrays electrode exhibits superior high-rate electrochemical performance, which delivers an optimal specific capacitance of 500 F g-1 at a high current density of 50 A g-1 and exhibits good cycling performance. This work provides alternative strategies for constructing advanced supercapacitor electrode with superior high-rate performance.
