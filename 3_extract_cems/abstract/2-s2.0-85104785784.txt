In terms of the short group on board energy storage low floor tramcars which were suitable for the small and medium-sized cities, since only charging stations were required for the entire line, no contact system was required in the main line sections, and barely any impacts on the urban landscapes and height limit, thus they were received a rapid development in recent years. However, due to the restrictions from both of the relatively short length of the tramcars and a limited roof installation space, the capacity of their on board energy storage devices were very limited, which resulted in high costs with a large number of charging stations along the lines. In order to increase the capacity of the on board energy storage devices for tramcars, the lithium titanate batteries were adopted to replace the supercapacitors commonly used in tramcars for this research, and the simulations analysis were carried out on Baoshan Tramcar T1 line under the real line conditions. The simulation results show that with the use of lithium titanate batteries instead of supercapacitors, under the same volume, the capacity of the on board energy storage devices may be increased by nearly one time, and the number of inter-section charging may be reduced by nearly half, which reduces the costs of project implementation and later maintenance costs of charging stations.
