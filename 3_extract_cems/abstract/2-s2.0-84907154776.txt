ZnCo2O4nanowire cluster arrays (NWCAs) were directly grown on Ni foam via a facile hydrothermal method. The resulting products were analyzed by using X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The ZnCo2O4NWCAs on Ni foam were directly used as integrated electrodes for supercapacitors and exhibited a high specific capacitance of 4.05 F cm-2at 20 mA cm-2(1620 F g-1at 8 A g-1) in 3 M KOH aqueous solution, and an excellent cycling ability at various current densities up to 100 mA cm-2(40 A g-1); 90% of the initial capacitance remained after 6000 cycles. Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitor had a high energy density of 41.00 W h kg-1at a power density of 384 W kg-1and 16.63 W h kg-1at a high power density of 2561 W kg-1. Such excellent rate properties and superior cycling life suggest that ZnCo2O4NWCAs can not only be applied in high energy density fields, but also used in high power density applications.
