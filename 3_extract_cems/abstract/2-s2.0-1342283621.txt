In this paper, RuO2/TiO2 nanotubes composites were synthesized by loading various amounts of RuO2 on TiO2 nanotubes. The symmetric supercapacitors based on these nanocomposites were fabricated by using gel polymer PVA-H3PO4-H2O as electrolyte. The electrochemical capacitance performance of the nanocomposites in these supercapacitors was investigated by current-potential responses, galvanostatic charge-discharge tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results show that the three dimensional nanotube network of TiO2 offers a solid support structure for active materials RuO 2, allows the active material to be readily accessible (available) for electrochemical reactions, and improves the efficiency of the active materials. A maximum specific capacitance of 1263F/g was obtained for the RuO2 which was loading on TiO2 nanotubes. Â© 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
