Porous carbon-metal oxide hybrid materials are advanced functional composites with great potential for use in high energy density supercapacitors. Here we describe a hybrid structure composed of two-dimensional (2D) NiCo2O4 nanosheets synthesized on polyhedral-shaped nanoporous carbon (NC) particles. The NC particles were derived from the carbonization of zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIF-8). Supercapacitor devices assembled using NiCo2O4-NC nanoparticles had excellent capacitive properties with energy densities up to 28 W h kg-1 and power densities up to 8.5 kW kg-1.
