AmbiMax is an energy harvesting circuit and a supercapacitor based energy storage system for wireless sensor nodes (WSN). Previous WSNs attempt to harvest energy from various sources, and some also use supercapacitors instead of batteries to address the battery aging problem. However, they either waste much available energy due to impedance mismatch, or they require active digital control that incurs overhead, or they work with only one specific type of source. AmbiMax addresses these problems by first performing maximum power point tracking (MPPT) autonomously, and then charges supercapacitors at maximum efficiency. Furthermore, AmbiMax is modular and enables composition of multiple energy harvesting sources including solar, wind, thermal, and vibration, each with a different optimal size. Experimental results on a real WSN platform, Eco, show that AmbiMax successfully manages multiple power sources simultaneously and autonomously at several times the efficiency of the current state-of-the-art for WSNs.
