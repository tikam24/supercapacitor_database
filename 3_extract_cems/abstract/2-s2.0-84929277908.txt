A novel and simple approach for preparing nanoporous binder free Sn:Pb composite metal foam has been demonstrated. The anodized metallic composite block was functionalized and also found a nanoporous structure. A scanning electron microscopy (SEM) result shows that the nanoflake-like arrangement has synthesized. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results confirm the nanoporous structure of the Sn/Pb foam after etching with 6 M NaOH. The prepared Sn:Pb metal foam is able to be used as a super capacitors electrode to offer large areal capacitance with regards to the synergic integration of Sn and Pb metals and the unique nanoporous structure.
