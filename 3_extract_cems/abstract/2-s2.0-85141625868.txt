By only changing the ratio of Mo to S source, a distinctive single phase MoO2 or MoS2 and MoO2/MoS2 nanocomposites (NCs) are obtained through a simple one-step hydrothermal method based on CH4N2S as a sulfur source and (NH4)6Mo7O24Â·4H2O as a source of Mo in oxalic acid. The effect of ratio of Mo to S source on the composition, structure, and electrochemical performance are systematically researched. Due to its unique design, abundant macropores active sites in MoO2/MoS2 NCs induce superior rate property (55.30% capacitance retention to 20 from 1 A g-1) and larger specific capacitance (1667.3 F g-1 at 1 A g-1) and longer cycle life (94.75% after 5000 cycles) as used directly as an electrode. Furthermore, at a power density of 225 W kg-1, a maximal energy density of 21.85 Wh kg-1 is provided by the asymmetric supercapacitor (MoO2/MoS2//AC). The capacitance of asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is remarkably enhanced by 129.02% under 5000 cycles at a current density of 1.5 A g-1, demonstrating outstanding cycle property. These results imply the prepared MoO2/MoS2 NCs have promising applications in advanced energy storages. It is important and should be noted that NCs of oxide and sulfide are prepared with only a simple one-step process.
