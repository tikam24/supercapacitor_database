We synthesized the sandwich-type of MnMoO4@NiMoO4@Mn2O3 core-shell nanosheet arrays (MMNM) that were grown on nickel foams (NFs) via a two-step controllable hydrothermal reaction. Compared with the previously reported core-shell materials, the structure of MMNM series materials was more unique and abundant, and its application prospect was extremely broad. The electrochemical properties of the prepared electrodes were tested in a three-electrode system, among which the MMNM-2 electrode exhibited the best electrochemical performance. The battery-supercapacitor hybrid device (MMNM-2 //AC BSH device) fabricated with MMNM-2 and activated carbon (AC) as the positive electrode and the negative electrode, respectively, achieved a high energy density of 49.99 W h kg−1 at a power density of 877.87 W kg−1. Moreover, the MMNM-2//AC BSH device exhibited better cycling stability than most previously reported BSH devices, with a high capacity retention of 96.03% after 20,000 cycles at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. The excellent electrochemical performance indicated the potential application of MMNM-2 in new energy storage devices.
