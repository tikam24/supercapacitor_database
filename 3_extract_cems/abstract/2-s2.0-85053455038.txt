A double-layer MnCo2S4@Ni-Co-S (MCS@NCS) core/shell nanocomposite is successfully deposited on nickel foam using a facile and simple method which includes a hydrothermal treatment and an electrochemical deposition and exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. With the introduction of sulfur via a sulfurization process, the MnCo2S4 nanorods have larger specific surface area compared to the MnCo2O4 nanorods and can serve as porous scaffolds for loading a large amount of additional active materials, facilitating electron transport and ion diffusion. The deposited Ni-Co-S nanosheet on MnCo2S4 can further increase the electro-active surface area and electrical conductivity as well as reinforce the mechanical stability of the whole electrode. Combining both structural and electrochemical advantages, the electrode with MCS@NCS heterostructures has high areal capacitance (10.14 F cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2). An asymmetric supercapacitor with Ni foam-activated carbon as the negative electrode and Ni foam-MCS@NCS as the positive electrode is fabricated and shows remarkable high areal capacitance (1.92 F cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2) and good cycling stability (72% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles), demonstrating its great potential as an efficient energy storage device for electronic systems.
