Cerium oxide (CeO2)/Activated carbon (AC) based composite were prepared by simple mechanical mixing method with high degree of scalability. The samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and Transmission electron microscope (TEM). The composite mixture with 10 wt% (weight %) CeO2 exhibits a specific capacitance of 162 F g-1 in two electrode configuration. The test cell retains 86% specific capacitance even at high current density with excellent cycle stability. The composite electrode exhibits a power density of 3500 W kg-1 at a high current density, suggesting a good electrode material for supercapacitor. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
