The rational use of regenerative braking energy for urban rail transit trains directly affects the voltage safety of the traction power supply system and the electric braking function of the train. It is also of great significance for the implementation of train traction energy saving. This paper proposes a scheme of train regenerative braking ground absorbing device based on super-capacitor energy storage. It adopts multiple modular Buck/Boost DC conversion topology to realize bidirectional control of electric energy and stabilize the secondary utilization of traction network voltage and regenerative electric energy. According to the scheme of this paper, the energy storage device was developed and verified in the engineering of the Guangzhou Line 6 main line traction substation. The test indicators have met the design expectations.
