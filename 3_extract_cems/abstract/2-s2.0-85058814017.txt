NiS/Ni3S2 hybrid nanosheets with good crystallinity as binder-free cathodes for asymmetric supercapacitors were fabricated via a low-cost single step solvothermal method. Physical characteristics of the obtained NiS/Ni3S2 hybrids reveal open and sponge-like structure consisting of interconnected thin sheets. During electrochemical study in a three-electrode cell NiS/Ni3S2 exhibited a high capacity of 315 μAh cm−2 at a current density of 1 mA cm−2 and retained 87.6% of the capacity when the current density increased 10 folds. A two electrode asymmetric supercapacitor containing NiS/Ni3S2 as a cathode and activated carbon as an anode demonstrated a high energy density of 0.289 m Wh cm−2 at a power density of 1.794 mW cm−2, which remained at 0.242 mWh cm−2 when the power density increased to 12.825 mW cm−2. New electrode material developed in this study has good potential for practical applications in asymmetric supercapacitors.
