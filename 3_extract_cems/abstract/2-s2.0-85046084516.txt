Cactus-like ZnS/Ni3S2 (NZS) hybrid consisting of interconnected nanosheets with nanoparticles as a supercapacitor material has been designed and fabricated on 3D porous Ni foam through a facile two-step hydrothermal method. Benefiting from the combination of ZnS/Ni3S2 nanosheets with nanoparticles, the developed electrode exhibits an outstanding specific capacitance (2093 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), superior rate capability with 72% (10 A g−1). Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device applying the NZS as positive electrode material and activated carbon (AC) as negative electrode material has a voltage up to 1.7 V and thus delivers considerably higher energy density of 51.2 Wh kg−1 (at 849.4 W kg−1) than previous reports. The high energy storage characteristics of pseudo-capacitive are sufficiently attributed to the interconnected 3D network architecture of the NZS electrode along with nanoparticles, which provides the enlarged surface area with the high conductivity, facile and multi-access ion paths and increased electroactive sites in redox reaction.
