Supercapacitors that exhibit long cycle lives and fast charge/discharge rates are a promising energy-storage technology for next-generation mobile or wearable electronic systems. A great challenge facing the fabrication of ultrathin supercapacitor components, specifically their porous electrodes, is whether such components can be integrated with the fabrication of electronic devices, i.e., semiconductor fabrication processes. Here, we introduce the lithographic fabrication of micrometre-thick, submicrometre-pore-patterned carbon for supercapacitor electrodes. The pore patterns designed by multi-beam interference lithography and direct carbonisation of the photoresist pattern produced pore-patterned carbon films. A facile doping process was subsequently employed to introduce nitrogen atoms into the carbon, which was intended to further enhance the carbon's capacitive properties. Specifically, during these fabrication steps, we developed an approach that uses a supporting shell on the surface of the pore patterns to maintain their structural integrity. The nitrogen-doped, pore-patterned carbon electrodes exhibited an areal specific capacitance of 32.7 mF/cm2 at 0.5 mA/cm2 when used as supercapacitor electrodes, which is approximately 20 times greater than that of commercially available MWCNT films measured under the same conditions.
