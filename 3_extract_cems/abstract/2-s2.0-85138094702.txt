Layered Co(OH)2 nanoflakes are regarded as a promising supercapacitor electrode material owing to its high theoretical speicific capacitance, but the application is limited by low electrical conductivity and weak mechanical strength. In this work, we synthesize a three-dimensional (3D) Co(OH)2 network structure supported by Ag dendrites on Ni foam by one-step electrodeposition. This 3D structure delivers an excellent supercapacitive performance with a specific capacitance of 2074 F·g−1 at 1 A g−1, and an 80.8% capacitance retention after 60,000 charge/discharge cycles at 5 A·g−1. The test results indicate that introduction of Ag dendrites can provide ideal conductivity and make the 3D structure more durable. Results of this paper provide a feasible method for the practical application of Co(OH)2 in supercapacitors.
