Co3O4 polyhedrons with porous structure have been synthesized simply by annealing Prussian blue analogue (PBA) Co3[Co(CN)6]2 polyhedrons at 400 Â°C in air. The product was characterized by a series of techniques, such as X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), High-resolution TEM (HRTEM), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) gas adsorption. Interestingly, when evaluated as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the Co3O4 porous polyhedrons manifested high reversible capacity (about 1200 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1) and excellent cycling performance. Moreover, they also exhibited a high specific capacitance of 110 Fg-1 when used as an electrode in the supercapacitor. It is suggested that the special morphology and porous nanostructure lead to the promising electrochemical properties.
