Metalâ€“organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials in diverse fields because of their constructive traits of varied structural topologies, high porosity, and high surface area. MOFs are also an ideal precursor/template to derive porous and functional morphologies. Herein, Co3V2O8 nanohexagonal prisms are grafted on CuV2O6 nanorod arrays (CuV-CoV)-grown copper foam (CF) using solution-processing methods, followed by thermal treatment. Direct preparation of active material on CF can potentially eliminate electrochemically inactive and non-conductive binders, leading to improved charge-transfer rate. Furthermore, solution-processing methods are simple and cost-effective. Owing to versatile valence states and good redox activity, the vanadium-incorporated mixed metal oxides (CuV-CoV) exhibited superior electrochemical performance in lithium (Li)-ion battery and supercapacitor (SC) studies. Furthermore, hollow carbon particles (HCPs) derived from MOF particles (MOF-HCPs) are used as the anode material in SCs. A hybrid SC (HSC) fabricated with CuV-CoV and MOF-HCP materials exhibited noteworthy electrochemical properties. Moreover, a solid-state HSC (SSHSC) is constructed and its real-time feasibility is investigated by harvesting the dynamic energy of a bicycle with the help of a direct current generator. The charged SSHSCs potentially powered various electronic components.
