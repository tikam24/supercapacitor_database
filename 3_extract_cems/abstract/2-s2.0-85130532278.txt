This work is conducted with the aim to see the effect of Polyaniline morphologies on the specific capacitance of the electrode material. The paper presents a low-temperature synthesis and electrochemical analysis of PANI morphologies (granular, pebbles, spheres, tubes, flakes and fibers). The supercapacitive behavior of all fabricated electrodes was tested via a two-electrode setup in 0.1M H2SO4 electrolyte. The electrochemical analysis showed that amongst all the PANI morphologies, nanofibers had the highest specific capacitance (752.27 Fg-1), a good energy density (66.86 Whkg-1) and a good retention rate (40%). The reason maybe attributed to a larger π-π stacking interaction with maximum d-spacing (3.52 Aº) that gives a desirable contact surface area for the electrolyte ions to transport efficiently across the electrolyte. Also, it has a low value of Rb (4.67 Ω), Rct (0.56 Ω), a good ƒ0 (251 Hz), a very less relaxation time τ0 (0.0039s) and a high knee frequency value (825.2 Hz). PANI fibers can prove to be an effective electrode material that could enhance the specific capacity of the electrode at the same time is economical and environmentally friendly.
