The proceedings contain 6 papers. The topics discussed include: electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of a porous graphite electrode used for Li-ion batteries with EC/PC based electrolytes; characterization of pretreated Co(OH)2-coated Ni(OH)2 positive electrode for Ni-MH batteries; CF/PAni/MWNT composites material, a novel electrode to supercapacitor; NO2 gas sensing using a CF/PAni composite as electrode; electrochemically fabricated nickel-tungsten nanowires; and a study of methanol oxidation by dynamic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.
