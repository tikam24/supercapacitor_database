The upcoming 5G era will powerfully promote the development of intelligent society in the future, but it will also bring serious electromagnetic pollution. Thus, the development of efficient, lightweight and multifunctional electromagnetic shielding materials and devices is an important research hotspot around the world. Herein, a novel needlelike Co3O4/C array architecture is constructed from MOF precursor via a simple pyrolysis process, and its microstructure is controllably tailored by changing the pyrolysis temperature. The unique 3D hierarchical structure and multiphase components enable the architecture to provide high-efficiency electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, along with good thermal insulation. More importantly, the architecture possesses fast ion transport channels, which can be used to construct supercapacitors with high specific capacitance and excellent cycle stability. Obviously, this work offers a new inspiration for the design and construction of multifunctional electromagnetic materials and devices.
