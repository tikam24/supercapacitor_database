the room temperature electrochemically fabricated POAP/[Cu2(2-mpinh)2Cl2(H2O)]n electrode was introduced as a highly effective candidate for supercapacitor application. Not only surface analyses but also electrochemical techniques, including cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic chargedischarge experiments along with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, were conducted to characterize the prepared [Cu2(2-mpinh)2Cl2(H2O)]n composite films and examine the performance of the system, respectively. Novel nanocomposite materials were presented for electrochemical redox capacitors possessing the merits of high active surface area and high stability in an aqueous electrolyte, as well as ease of fabrication.
