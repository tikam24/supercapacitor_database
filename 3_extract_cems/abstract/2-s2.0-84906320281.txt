Two few-layer graphene materials, strongly distinguished in structure, were compared as electrode materials for supercapacitor. The stacks of flat sheets with basal size of a few microns have been obtained as the result of ultrasonication of bromine intercalated graphite dispersion. The highly crumpled large-size layers have been produced by rapid heating of bromine intercalated graphite fluoride. The average number of layers and in-plane crystalline size in the materials were evaluated from Raman spectroscopy. The functional composition was studied using X-ray photoelectron and Infrared spectroscopy. Electrochemical testing of the graphene materials detected re-stacking of thin crumpled layers during the electrode preparation. Furthermore, graphene material produced from the fluorinated graphite showed poor wettability. The mild oxidation of the material in a mixture of sulfuric and nitric acids allowed increasing the capacitance in several times. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
