Hexagonal CuS nanoparticles supported on rGO sheets were magnificently produced through a simple in-situ wet reduction process for high-performance supercapacitors. The as-obtained composites were analyzed using numerous techniques. The results revealed that 7% rGO anchored CuS nanospheres (NS) was the lowest sp2 domain crystallite size, maximum surface area (34.4 m2.g-1), and most expansive pore volume (0.0595 cm3.g-1). Furthermore, HR-TEM showed regular and uniform dissemination of CuS NS over rGO sheets. The CuS/7%rGO exhibits the highest specific capacity of 235 C g-1 at 1 A g-1 and can maintain 95% of its particular original capacity after 2000 cycles at a great current density of 10 A g-1. Besides, the CuS/7%rGO/AC hybrid SC device displayed the highest energy density of 43 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 1426 W kg−1 and a current density of 1 A g-1.
