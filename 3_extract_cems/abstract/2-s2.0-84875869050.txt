We successfully developed a graphene oxide-assisted electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method to prepare the porous hybrid graphene-carbon nanotube (G-CNT) layer on the carbon fiber surface of carbon cloth (CC). The as-fabricated flexible supercapacitor based on the G-CNT/CC electrodes shows significantly enhanced supercapacitor performance. Â© 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
