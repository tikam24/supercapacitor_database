In recent years, the development of energy storage devices has received much attention due to the increasing demand for renewable energy. Supercapacitors (SCs) have attracted considerable attention among various energy storage devices due to their high specific capacity, high power density, long cycle life, economic efficiency, environmental friendliness, high safety, and fast charge/discharge rates. SCs are devices that can store large amounts of electrical energy and release it quickly, making them ideal for use in a wide range of applications. They are often used in conjunction with batteries to provide a power boost when needed and can also be used as a standalone power source. They can be used in various potential applications, such as portable equipment, smart electronic systems, electric vehicles, and grid energy storage systems. There are a variety of materials that have been studied for use as SC electrodes, each with its advantages and limitations. The electrode material must have a high surface area to volume ratio to enable high energy storage densities. Additionally, the electrode material must be highly conductive to enable efficient charge transfer. Over the past several years, several novel materials have been developed which can be used to improve the capacitance of the SCs. This article reviews three types of SCs: electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), pseudocapacitors, and hybrid supercapacitors, their respective development, energy storage mechanisms, and the latest research progress in material preparation and modification. In addition, it proposes potentially feasible solutions to the problems encountered during the development of supercapacitors and looks forward to the future development direction of SCs.
