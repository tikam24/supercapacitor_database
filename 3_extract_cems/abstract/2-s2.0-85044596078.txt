Hierarchical porous carbon materials belong to the potential candidate materials for advanced supercapacitors (SCs). The macro-meso-microporous structure of carbon materials is effective for improving electrochemical performance. We demonstrate a sustainable biomass conversion process and non-templated strategy to fabricate the macro-meso-microporous carbon aerogel (CA) through carbonization of the renewable natural alginate. The gelation process of the alginate hydrogel can offer a new strategy to create macro-mesoporous structures. After carbonizing at 800 Â°C, the as-prepared porous CA exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance in SCs.
