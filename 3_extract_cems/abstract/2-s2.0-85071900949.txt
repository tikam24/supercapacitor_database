MXene-based electrode materials exhibit favorable supercapacitor performance in sulfuric acid due to praised pseudocapacitance charge storage mechanism. However, self-stacking of conventional MXene electrodes severely restricts their electrochemical performance, especially at high loading. Herein, a flexible cross-linked porous Ti3C2Tx-MXene-reduced graphene oxide (Ti3C2Tx-RGO) film is skillfully designed and synthesized by microscopic explosion of graphene oxide (GO) at sudden high temperature. The generated chamber structure between layers could hold a few of electrolyte, leading to a close-fitting reaction at interlayer and avoiding complex ions transmission paths. The Ti3C2Tx-RGO film displayed a preferable rate performance than that of pure Ti3C2Tx film and a high capacitance of 505 F/g at 2 mV/s. Furthermore, the uniform intralayer structure and unique energy storage process lead to thickness-independenct electrochemical performances. This work provides a simple and feasible improvement approach for the design of MXene-based electrodes, which can be spread other electrochemical systems limited by ions transport, such as metal ions batteries and catalysis.
