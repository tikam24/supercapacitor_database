The new biomass carbonaceous materials were obtained from macadamia nut shells (MNS) by immersion method and high-temperature activation (MNSCA) for high-performance supercapacitors. The morphologies and microstructures are investigated by X-ray diffractometer, Raman spectrometer, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The experimental results show that the obtained activated carbon (MNSCA) exhibits perfect porous structure filled with more micropores and mesopores. MNSCA displays high specific surface area of 1057 m2g-1. The porous carbon delivers an impressive specific capacitance of 325.7 F g - 1 and has no capacitance loss at the current density of 2 A g - 1 after 10,000 cycles, which demonstrates the excellent cycle stability and high specific capacitance. The biomass carbonaceous materials derived from MNS can be expected for the widespread application of supercapacitors.
