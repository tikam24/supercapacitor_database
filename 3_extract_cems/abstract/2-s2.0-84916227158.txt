This paper, led in by one of the earlier inventions of the author, presents further in-depth analysis and understanding towards characterizing a regenerative braking system, in aid of an innovative custom-built test rig. Various problems occurred in the past are now able to be resolved under the help of such test arrangement, which leads to effectively evaluating the central control circuits behaviors under load change and variation of other parameters. More insights for a complex system can be gained with somewhat surprising findings explained in this paper.
