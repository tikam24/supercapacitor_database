The lithium-ion battery (LIB) has become the most widely used electrochemical energy storage device due to the advantage of high energy density. However, because of the low rate of Faradaic process to transfer lithium ions (Li+), the LIB has the defects of poor power performance and cycle performance, which can be improved by adding capacitor material to the cathode, and the resulting hybrid device is also known as a lithium-ion battery capacitor (LIBC). This review introduces the typical structure and working principle of an LIBC, and it summarizes the recent research developments in advanced LIBCs. An overview of non-lithiated and pre-lithiated anode materials for LIBCs applications is given, and the commonly used pre-lithiation methods for the anodes of LIBCs are present. Capacitor materials added to the cathodes, and suitable separator materials of LIBCs are also reviewed. In addition, the polarization phenomenon, pulsed performance and safety issues of LIBCs and electrode engineering for improving electrochemical performance are systematically analyzed. Finally, the future research and development direction of advanced LIBCs is prospected through the discussion of the existing problems of an LIBC in which the battery material in the composite cathode is LiNixCoyMn1−x−yO2 (NCM).
