Composite anode materials with a unique architecture of carbon nanotubes (CNTs)-chained spinel lithium titanate (Li4Ti5O12, LTO) nanoparticles are prepared for lithium ion capacitors (LICs). The CNTs networks derived from commercial conductive slurry not only bring out a steric hindrance effect to restrict the growth of Li4Ti5O12 particles but greatly enhance the electronic conductivity of the CNTs/LTO composites, both have contributed to the excellent rate capability and cycle stability. The capacity retention at 30 C (1 C = 175 mA g−1) is as high as 89.7% of that at 0.2 C with a CNTs content of 11 wt%. Meanwhile, there is not any capacity degradation after 500 cycles at 5 C. The LIC assembled with activated carbon (AC) cathode and such a CNTs/LTO composite anode displays excellent energy storage properties, including a high energy density of 35 Wh kg−1 at 7434 W kg−1, and a high capacity retention of 87.8% after 2200 cycles at 1 A g−1. These electrochemical performances outperform the reported data achieved on other LTO anode-based LICs. Considering the facile and scalable preparation process proposed herein, the CNTs/LTO composites can be very potential anode materials for hybrid capacitors towards high power-energy outputs.
