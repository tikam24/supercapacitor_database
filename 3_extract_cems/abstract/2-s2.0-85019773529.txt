We investigated graphene like material named reduced graphene oxide (RGO) as an electrode material by employed graphene oxide (GO). Thin film of GO was prepared on the indium thin oxide (ITO) substrate by spin-coating method using varied concentration of GO that dispersed in water. In order to remove its oxygen contained, GO film was thermally reduced at 200 Â°C for 1 hour. We used cyclic voltammetry to measure its CV characteristic and estimated its specific capacitance. We obtained the highest specific capacitance of 6.53 mF g-1 that measured from 4 mg ml-1 RGO thin film at scan rate 25 mVs-1.
