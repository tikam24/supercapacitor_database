In this study, heterostructures based on Fe3O4 and Bi2O3 nanostructures were synthesized as energy storage devices for battery-type supercapacitors. The efficiency of the synthesized structures as supercapacitor electrodes was evaluated. The Fe3O4–Bi2O3 heterostructure exhibited a high specific capacitance of 1200 Fg−1 at an current density of 0.5 Ag−1, which was 2.46 and 3.29 times higher than those of pure Fe3O4 (487 Fg−1) and Bi2O3 (364 Fg−1) samples, respectively. The performance of the electrodes proved that the Fe3O4 and Bi2O3 nanostructures exhibited a synergistic effect and, thus, may serve as excellent materials for energy storage applications.
