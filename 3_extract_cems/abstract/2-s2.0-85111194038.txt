Developing new uses of CO2 and renewable energy technology is crucial for CO2 mitigation, which can be realized simultaneously through the synthesis of advanced functional carbon materials using CO2 as a carbon source. Herein, an oxygenated alkynyl carbon material (OACM) was synthesized via the solvent-free mechanochemical reaction of CaC2 and CO2 under mild conditions, and its electrochemical performance as a supercapacitor electrode was investigated. The gas-solid reaction here is efficient and cost effective owing to the mechanical activation of CaC2. The resultant nanosized OACM features a 3D structure with alkynyl-linked oxygenated carbon chains, hierarchical porosity, numerous defects, high oxygen content, and polycrystalline state. The OACM exhibits high electrochemical performance, including a high specific capacitance (121.8 F g-1 under 0.15 A g-1), superior electrical conductivity (1522 S m-1), and excellent cycling stability (above 96.6% in 5000 cycles) due to its unique structure. This work provides a new CO2 use and an innovative synthesis approach for high-performance alkynyl carbon materials.
