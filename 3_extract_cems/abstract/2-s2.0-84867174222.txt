Lead-Carbon hybrid ultracapacitors (Pb-C HUCs) with flooded, absorbent-glass-mat (AGM) and silica-gel sulphuric acid electrolyte configurations are developed and performance tested. Pb-C HUCs comprise substrate-integrated PbO2 (SI-PbO2) as positive electrodes and high surface-area carbon with graphite-sheet substrate as negative electrodes. The electrode and silica-gel electrolyte materials are characterized by XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM, Rheometry, BET surface area, and FTIR spectroscopy in conjunction with electrochemistry. Electrochemical performance of SI-PbO 2 and carbon electrodes is studied using cyclic voltammetry with constant-current charge and discharge techniques by assembling symmetric electrical-double-layer capacitors and hybrid Pb-C HUCs with a dynamic Pb(porous)/PbSO4 reference electrode. The specific capacitance values for 2 V Pb-C HUCs are found to be 166 F/g, 102 F/g and 152 F/g with a faradaic efficiency of 98%, 92% and 88% for flooded, AGM and gel configurations, respectively.
