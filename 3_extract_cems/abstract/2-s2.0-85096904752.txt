This work compares the supercapacitive properties of pristine molybdenum disulfide (MoS2-AS) and its counterpart annealed at 450 Â°C (MoS2-450) in 1 M Na2SO4 solution. The MoS2-450 powder delivers an increased specific capacitance and low charge-tansfer resistance compared to the MoS2-AS powder, interpreted as the consequence of high pore size and annealing-induced active edge sites on the MoS2-450 for facile charge transport. Symmetric cells of the MoS2-450 electrodes, connected in series, delivered a voltage of 3.5 V, high enough to light a 1.6 V LED. The high performance of the MoS2-450 means that it can be optimized for potential application.
