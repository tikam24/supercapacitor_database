We have prepared composites of CuCo2S4/GO/Fe2O3(Fe3O4) and applied them as an electrode for supercapacitor and as a magnetically recoverable Fenton catalyst towards dye degradation. The nanoplate structured CuCo2S4 was obtained by a simple hydrothermal approach, on which the electron transfer property was tuned by the addition of graphene oxide, and magnetic recoverability was induced by the loading of iron oxides (Fe2O3, Fe3O4) to form a ternary composite. On evaluating the behavior of the composites as a supercapacitor electrode material, the CuCo2S4/GO/Fe2O3 composite showed a good specific capacitance value of about 595 Fg− 1 at the current density of 1 Ag− 1 than the pure CuCo2S4 nanoplates along with good cyclic stability which showed 52% capacity retention even after 4000 cyclic experiments at 20Ag− 1. The composites were further utilized as a Fenton type catalyst towards the degradation of cationic dye rhodamine B (RhB). The CuCo2S4/GO composite showed the remarkable removal efficiency of about 99.34% within 20 min of reaction time. The obtained results show us that the ternary CuCo2S4/GO/Fe2O3 (Fe3O4) composites would serve as an ideal material for energy and environmental applications.
