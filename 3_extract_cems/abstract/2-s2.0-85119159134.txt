The Co(OH)2, Fe2O3 and Mn3O4 nanomaterials layered over the surface of carbon spheres (CSs) were synthesized through the hydrothermal route. The prepared Fe, Mn oxide and Co hydroxide nanomaterials covered the surface of CSs were characterized for structural confirmation by X-ray diffraction analysis. Elemental vibrations are confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic study. Shape and size of all metal oxides covered carbon spheres were observed by using scanning electron microscopy analysis and found to be spherical in shape. The electrochemical capacitive nature of the fabricated modified Co, Fe, Mn nanoparticles covered CSs working electrodes was examined by cyclic voltammetry and charge–discharge studies using 1 M KOH electrolyte solution. The comparison of electrochemical performances of prepared three metal oxides were done and it was found that Co(OH)2 layered carbon sphere exhibited higher specific capacitance value about 193.3 Fg−1 at a current density of 1 Ag−1.
