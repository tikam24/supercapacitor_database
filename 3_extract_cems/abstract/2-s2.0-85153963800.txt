Bimetallic spinel and perovskite metal oxide materials are advanced electrode materials for supercapacitor (SC) applications because of their low-cost, distinct crystal structures, eco-friendly nature, and high conductivity. However, they suffer from the disadvantages of poor ion-diffusion kinetics and pulverization issues during cyclability tests. Along with a deeper understanding of redox chemistry, the role of oxygen vacancies (OVs) in electrode materials to support the reaction kinetics for excellence in SCs must be clarified. In this review, we highlight for the first time the importance of OVs and summarize various design strategies for the preparation of advanced bimetallic spinel oxides and perovskites with improved electrochemical performances for SC applications. With new insights, we envision that the SC research community would endeavor to utilize the benefits of OVs effectively for the development of high-performance SCs.
