In this work, we propose a one-step process to realize the in situ evolution of molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) nanoflakes into ordered mesoporous carbon with few-layered graphene walls (OMG) by chloridization and self-organization, and simultaneously the Cl-doping of OMG (OMG-Cl) by modulating chloridization and annealing processes is fulfilled. Benefiting from the improvement of electroconductivity induced by Cl-doping, together with large specific surface area (1882 cm2 g-1) and homogeneous pore structures, as anode of lithium ion batteries, OMG-Cl shows remarkable charge capacity of 1305 mA h g-1 at current rate of 50 mA g-1 and fast charge-discharge rate within dozens of seconds (a charge time of 46 s), as well as retains a charge capacity of 733 mA h g-1 at a current rate of 0.5 mA g-1 after 100 cycles. Furthermore, as a promising electrode material for supercapacitors, OMG-Cl holds the specific capacitances of 250 F g-1 in 1 M H2SO4 solution and 220 F g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1 in 6 M KOH solution, which are âˆ¼40% and 20% higher than those of undoped OMG electrode, respectively. The high capacitive performance of OMG-Cl material can be due to the additional fast Faradaic reactions induced from Cl-doping species.
