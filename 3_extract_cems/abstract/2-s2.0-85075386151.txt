The recent development of wearable and portable microelectronic devices requires energy storage devices to be miniaturized; micro-supercapacitors (MSCs), as one of the most outstanding candidates, have great potential in future electronic devices. However, in the miniaturization of MSCs, the maintenance of electrochemical performance remains a key challenge. Herein, this study proposes a simple, one-step, mask-free and high-resolution fabrication method for high-performance 1T MoS2 MSCs in atmosphere. The method involves the direct writing of restacked 1T MoS2 films by a temporally shaped femtosecond laser. Specifically, femtosecond laser pulses are temporally shaped to control the transient electron temperature and material absorption for achieving high-resolution fabrication. Excellent electrode material properties and ultrashort ion transfer distance enable the MSCs to exhibit optimal performances with an ultrahigh power density (14 kW cm−3), ultrahigh energy density (15.6 mWh cm−3) and large areal capacitance (36 mF cm−2). Notably, such miniaturized MSCs in a 100 × 100 μm2 area own superior frequency responses (1221 Hz) and time constant (0.82 ms), which are suitable for AC line filters and other high-power demanded electronic devices. This method successfully solves the problem of maintaining performance in the miniaturization of MSCs, allowing next-generation microelectronic devices to be developed.
