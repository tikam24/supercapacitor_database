A facile simple hydrothermal method combined with a post-solution reaction is developed to grow interconnected three dimensional (3D) hierarchical Co-Al layered double hydroxides (LDHs) on reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The obtained 3D hierarchical rGO-LDHs are characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy. As LDHs nanosheets directly grow on the surface of rGO via chemical covalent bonding, the rGO could provide facile electron transport paths in the electrode for the fast Faradaic reaction. Moreover, benefiting from the rational 3D hierarchical structural, the rGO-LDHs demonstrate excellent electrochemical properties with a combination of high charge storage capacitance, fast rate capability and stable cycling performance. Remarkably, the 3D hierarchical rGO-LDHs exhibit specific capacitance values of 599Fg-1 at a constant current density of 4Ag-1. The rGO-LDHs also show high charge-discharge reversibility with an efficiency of 92.4% after 5000 cycles. Â© 2014.
