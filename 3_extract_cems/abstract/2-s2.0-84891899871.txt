In the presence of sulfonated polystyrene (sPS) template, sPSatSnO2 core shell particles formed via the interaction between the functional group of -SO3H on the template surface and ions of Sn2+ from the precursor of SnSO4 which were in ethanol-aqueous medium. After high-temperature calcination treatment for removal of sPS, the sPSatSnO2 changed into SnO2 hollow spheres. With the further carbonization of the sPSatSnO2atglucose composite microspheres, SnO2atC composite hollow spheres were fabricated. Using SEM, TEM, and N2 adsorption - desorption technology, the structure, specific surface area, and the core-shell structure formation mechanism were determined. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) properties of SnO2 hollow spheres and SnO2atC composites were investigated, respectively, in the foam nickel electrode under alkaline condition. The specific capacitance of SnO2atC composite hollow spheres could reach 25.8Fg-1 in 1molL-1 KOH aqueous solution and showed excellent charge-discharge behavior. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.
