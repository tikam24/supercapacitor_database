Supercapacitors is considered as one of the potential candidates in the domain of energy storage devices for the forthcoming generations. These devices have earned their significance in numerous applications, such as power hybrid electric/electric vehicles and other power and electronic systems, which require electrical energy for their operation. Indeed, this section of encyclopedia of energy storage provides an in-depth overview of the latest advances of the inorganic nanomaterials and hybrid nanocomposites for the electrode choice in supercapacitor/capacitor devices. All the chapters discuss fundamental aspects, key factors, fabrications methods, development of nanostructures and nanocomposites, commercialization aspects and future perspectives for high performance supercapacitor/capacitor devices. It also presents up-to-date literature coverage with various recent reports and their research findings summary about the development of different type of supercapacitor devices. Therefore, the development of supercapacitors has huge market requirements, and long-term progress is needed for their successful advancement and commercialization. This section of encyclopedia of energy storage will appeal to researchers, scientists, graduate and postgraduate students from various disciplines, for example, material science, engineering, inorganic chemistry, nanoscience and nanotechnology as well as energy communities. Again, the coverage of this section is far from comprehensive but highlights the gap between the exploration works in the lab to viable energy storage device and system applications in recent years. This perspective will provide corresponding guidance and new directions for the development of supercapacitor/capacitor devices in near future.
