The performance of the electrode material for supercapacitor depends not only on its structure but also on the potential window. In this work, we have demonstrated a two-steps method to prepare the integrated electrode materials. Firstly, Ni@PES films are scribed at CO2 laser induction and Ni@PES-LIG is obtained. Secondly, the subsequent electrodeposition of FeOOH and MnO2 are carried out in three-electrode system. The MnO2/Ni@PES-LIG and FeOOH/Ni@PES-LIG electrodes exhibit high pseudocapacitances of 205 and 210 mF cm−2, respectively. By using The MnO2/Ni@PES-LIG and FeOOH/Ni@PES-LIG electrodes as the anode and cathode, respectively, we have successfully fabricated the free-standing asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device, which has wider potential range over 2.0 V. The Ni@ASC device delivers high areal capacitance (110 mF cm−2), high areal energy density (41.6 μWh cm−2), and high areal power density (136 mW cm−2). Additionally, the Ni@ASC assembling with the integrated electrodes reveals a much higher capacitance and wider potential window than other single symmetric and asymmetric supercapacitors due to its multiple energy stored mechanisms.
