Component-controllable (Ni, Co)Se2(1−x)S2x (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) acanthospheres on typical biomass carbon tube (CTs) are successfully fabricated through a simple chemical vapor deposition method. These composites, which are directly used as electrode materials for binder-free supercapacitors, exhibit excellent electrochemical properties and other different characteristics.
