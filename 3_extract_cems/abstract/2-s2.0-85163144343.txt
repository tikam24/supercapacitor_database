Substitution effects significantly impact the electropolymerization, morphology, properties and electrochemical performance of conducting polymers. In this work, the substitution effects of the electron-withdrawing cyano group on indole polymers are studied in detail. Polyindole (PIn) and its three cyano group substituted derivatives, i.e., poly(5-cyanoindole) (P5CIn), poly(6-cyanoindole) (P6CIn), and poly(7-cyanoindole) (P7CIn), are successfully electrosynthesized in 0.1 M LiClO4/acetonitrile, while it is difficult to electrodeposit 4-cyanoindole into polymer due to the steric effects. Scanning electron microscopic images reveal that P5CIn, P6CIn, and P7CIn have nanofiber structures, while PIn has a dense and cracked structure. Furthermore, P5CIn displays the best capacitance performance with a specific capacitance of 493 F g-1 at 2.5 A g-1, and 87.1% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles charge/discharge. A detailed study of cyano-substituted PIn is provided by this work and it also presents a kind of high-performance supercapacitor material.
