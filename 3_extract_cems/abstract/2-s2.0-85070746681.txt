Petal-like nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composites with different rGO-to-NiCo2O4 weight ratios were synthesized using a simple hydrothermal method and subsequent thermal treatment. In the NiCo2O4/rGO composite, the NiCo2O4 3-dimensional nanomaterials contributed to the improvement of electrochemical properties of the final composite material by preventing the restacking of the rGO sheet and securing ion movement passages. The composite structure was examined by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The FE-SEM and TEM images showed that petal-like NiCo2O4 was supported on the rGO surface. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used for the electrochemical analysis of composites. Among the prepared composites, 0.075 g rGO/NiCo2O4 composite showed the highest specific capacitance of 1,755 Fg-1 at a current density of 2 Ag-1. The cycle performance and rate capability of the composite material were higher than those of using the single NiCo2O4 material. These nano-structured composites could be regarded as valuable electrode materials for supercapacitors that require superior performance.
