Transient stability analysis become the main focus in this paper because of the importance of generator protection scheme. One of many methods to obtain CCT is critical trajectory method which can be used to determine rotor angle trajectory through a simulation before the generator loss of synchronism. Moreover, this method has a faster calculation due to the number of variables are equal with number of equation. In order to improve transient stability, Super Capacitor Energy Storage (SCES) is installed in the system. This unit stores energy in energy kinetic form that will injected in the system. IEEE 3-machine 9-bus system is used to tested this proposed method. From simulation result, the installment SCES can give higher CCT which leads to more robust systems operation in average range time 0.016 second faster. It can be concluded that the propose method can improve transient stability by installing SCES in the system.
