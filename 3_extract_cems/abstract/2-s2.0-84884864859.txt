Hierarchical porous materials with improved properties due to enhanced mass transport through the material and a high surface area and pore volume have been used in numerous applications such as catalysts or catalyst supports, energy storage and conversion, filtration, medical diagnostics, and medical therapies. This paper presents a review of recent progress in hierarchical porous materials for supercapacitor electrodes. Hierarchical porous materials comprise of hierarchical porous carbon, hierarchical porous metal oxides and hierarchical porous composites. An emphasis is placed on the performance of hierarchical porous materials for supercapacitor electrodes in terms of specific capacitance, power density, energy density, rate capability and cyclic stability.
