Boron-doped ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs) with tunable pore size were prepared using SBA-15 as hard template and boric acid as pore expanding agent. As demonstrated by N2 adsorption tests, the pore size increases from 3.3 to 8.1 nm with increasing in molar ratio of boric acid (0%âˆ¼75%), while the mesopore structure is retained. Electrochemical tests demonstrate that the Boron-doped OMCs present higher specific capacitance than the Boron-free OMC in KOH electrolyte. The capacitive performance is related to both pore regularity and pore size. The OMC prepared by doping 50% mole of boric acid shows the best capacitive performance.
