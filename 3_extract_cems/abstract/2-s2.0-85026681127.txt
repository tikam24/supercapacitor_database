In the elevator drives, there is a wastage of a huge amount of energy in a breaking resistor which need to be controlled. The extra energy being generated by different ways required to be stored for some duration to be used later for the efficient operation of an elevator. Aim of this paper is to present how the supercapacitor can be used for enhancing elevator efficiency by saving the energy. The dc-dc converter has been used to interface the voltage level of different sources. The regenerated energy which is normally wasted during braking is stored temporarily into supercapacitor energy storage device and reutilized it when the more energy is requested by an elevator motor. For elucidation of the operation of an overall system, the simulation results have been discussed. (Abstract)
