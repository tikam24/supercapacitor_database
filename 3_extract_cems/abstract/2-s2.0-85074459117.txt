Taking the Electric Vehicles (EV) as the study object, this paper conduct a survey on the brake energy recovery control of a hybrid energy system. The motor is driven by double closed-loop control based on the motoring condition and the brake feedback of the DC brushless motor. Here, the supercapacitor chargeâ€“discharge states are quantitatively analysed. The two-phase interlacing parallels bidirectional DC/DC converter will be controlled using a PI controller. DC brushless motor/controller and dual power supply modules are built-in advisors. Furthermore, a simulation test has been completed for the vehicle under the conditions of urban and suburban driving cycles. As an integral part for EV control, the brake energy recovery system has a certain application and promising R&D prospect.
