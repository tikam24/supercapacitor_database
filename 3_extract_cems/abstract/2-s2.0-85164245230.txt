Polymers obtained from biomass are a concerning alternative to petro-based polymers because of their low cost of manufacturing, biocompatibility, ecofriendly and biodegradability. Lignin as the second richest and the only polyaromatics bio-polymer in plant which has been most studied for the numerous applications in different fields. But, in the past decade, the exploitation of lignin for the preparation of new smart materials with improved properties has been broadly sought, because lignin valorization plays one of the primary challenging issues of the pulp and paper industry and lignocellulosic biorefinery. Although, well suited chemical structure of lignin comprises of many functional hydrophilic and active groups, such as phenolic hydroxyls, carboxyls and methoxyls, which provides a great potential to be applied in the preparation of biodegradable hydrogels. In this review, lignin hydrogel is covered with preparation strategies, properties and applications. This review reports some important properties, such as mechanical, adhesive, self-healing, conductive, antibacterial and antifreezing properties were then discussed. Furthermore, herein also reviewed the current applications of lignin hydrogel, including dye adsorption, smart materials for stimuli sensitive, wearable electronics for biomedical applications and flexible supercapacitors. Overall, this review covers recent progresses regarding lignin-based hydrogel and constitutes a timely review of this promising material.
