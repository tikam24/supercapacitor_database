This work developed a novel approach to control the nanostructure morphology of carbon-containing hexagonal CuS using a single-step solvothermal process. Herein, copper II hexafluoroacetylacetonate served as the copper source and played an efficient role as a detergent-free micelle-forming substance in the presence of two immiscible liquids (ethylene glycol and carbon disulfide). The latter form of which assisted spherical-like shell assembly of hexagonal carbon-containing CuS. Physical characterization indicated successful carbon and fluorine doping of the hexagonal CuS structures inside bundles of spheres. This innovative construction can efficiently boost the electrochemical properties of the as-prepared material for supercapacitor applications. The prepared electrode exhibited a superior specific capacitance/capacity of 1123 F g−1 (561.5 C g−1) at 1 A g−1 and outstanding cycling stability. The assembled hybrid device displayed remarkable specific energy of 40 W h kg−1 and a maximum specific power of 8.02 kW kg−1. These results indicate the potential of this material as a promising electrode for highly efficient supercapacitors.
