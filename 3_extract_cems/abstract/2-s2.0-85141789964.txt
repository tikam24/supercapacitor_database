As the industrial demand for micro energy storage devices increases, the efficient preparation of micro-supercapacitors has become a focus. Here we demonstrated a one-step, high-precision and high-efficiency processing method for the preparation of micro-supercapacitors. The graphene/RuO2 micro-supercapacitor was successfully fabricated by means of a spatially shaped femtosecond laser method, with a single spatially shaped laser pulse capable of processing an area hundreds of times larger than that of the initial Gaussian laser. The prepared single graphene/ RuO2 micro-supercapacitor exhibits excellent capacitance (66.4 mF/cm2 and 221.5 F/cm3). This method enables high precision and high efficiency processing of composite micro-supercapacitors, which has high potential for industrial.
