We reported the synthesis of γ-Fe2O3@SiO2-2-(2-benzothiazolyl azo)-4-methoxyaniline and CoFe2O4@SiO2-2-(2-benzothiazolyl azo)-4-methoxyaniline electrodes for effieicent and highly stable supercapacitor performance by using Stober method. The two electrodes illustrated high specific capacitance of 640 and 580F.g−1 and excellent stability up to 1000 cycles charge–discharge cycles. The results appeared that the capacitance value of CoFe2O4@SiO2-2-(2-benzothiazolyl azo)-4-methoxyaniline is higher than γ -Fe2O3@SiO2-2-(2-benzothiazolyl azo)-4-methoxyaniline, which revealed the extraordinary performance of CoFe2O4 electrode. The electrochemical activity of CoFe2O4 electrode is attributed to the synergistic effect of oxidation–reduction coupling between copper and ferric ions.
