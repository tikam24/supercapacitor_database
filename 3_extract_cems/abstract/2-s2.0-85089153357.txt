Halide perovskites, traditionally a solar-cell material that exhibits superior energy conversion properties, have recently been deployed in energy storage systems such as lithium-ion batteries and photorechargeable batteries. Here, recent progress in halide perovskite-based energy storage systems is presented, focusing on halide perovskite lithium-ion batteries and halide perovskite photorechargeable batteries. Halide-perovskite-based supercapacitors and photosupercapacitors are also discussed. The photorechargeable batteries and photorechargeable supercapacitors employ solar energy to photocharge the battery; this saves energy and improves device portability. These lightweight, integrated halide perovskite-based systems, which are pertinent to electric vehicles and portable electronic devices, are reviewed in detail. Suggestions on future research into the design of halide-perovskite-based energy storage materials are also given. This review provides a foundation for the development of integrated lightweight energy conversion and storage materials.
