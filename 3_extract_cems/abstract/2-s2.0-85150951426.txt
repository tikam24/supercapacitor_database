Spinel structured transition metals oxide GO/NiCo2O4 nanocomposites and nitrogen doped N-rGO/NiCo2O4 nanocomposites were developed. Powder X-ray diffraction investigations confirmed the structure. The bonding vibrations of the produced nanocomposites were confirmed using infrared and Raman spectroscopy. EDX analysis was used to determine the composition and element weights of the nanocomposites. The electrochemical properties of the nanomaterials were measured using 1 M KOH electrolyte. At 5mVs−1 scan rates, cyclic voltammetry revealed a specific capacitance (Csp) of 1078.2 Fg−1 for N-rGO/NiCo2O4. The bare and nanocomposites of NiCo2O4, GO/NiCo2O4, and N-rGO/NiCo2O4 specific capacitance, charge-discharge capability, and cyclic stability were investigated. Energy density and power density of the N-rGO/NiCo2O4 nanocomposite were estimated to be 20.4 Wh kg−1 and 1300 W kg−1, respectively. N-rGO//N-rGO/NiCo2O4 asymmetric supercapacitor device with Ed of 14.9 Wh kg−1 and Pd of 3500 W kg−1 was fabricated.
