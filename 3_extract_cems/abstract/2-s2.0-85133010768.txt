Multichannel-porous carbon derived from wood can serve as a conductive substrate for fast charge transfer and ion diffusion, supporting the high-theory capacitance of pseudocapacitive materials. Herein, NiCo2O4 nanosheets, which are hierarchically porous, anchored on the surface of carbonized wood via electrodeposition for free-binder high-performance supercapacitor electrode materials, were proposed. Benefiting from the effectively alleviated NiCo2O4 nanosheets accumulation and sufficient active surface area for redox reaction, a N-doped wood-derived porous carbon-NiCo2O4 nanosheet hybrid material (NCNS–NCW) electrode exhibited a specific electric capacity of 1730 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in 1 mol L−1 KOH and splendid electrochemical firmness with 80% capacitance retention after cycles. Furthermore, an all-wood-based asymmetric supercapacitor based on NCNS–NCW//NCW was assembled and a high energy density of 56.1 Wh kg−1 at a watt density of 349 W kg−1 was achieved. Due to the great electrochemical performance of NCNS–NCW, we expect it to be used as an electrode material with great promise for energy storage equipment.
