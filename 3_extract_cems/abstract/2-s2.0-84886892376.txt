In this paper, we focus on supercapacitors thermal cycling ageing at constant voltage. Obtained results are compared with those issued from calendar ageing at constant voltage and constant temperature. Experimental measurements from periodical characterization tests during calendar ageing up to 7500 h and results of characterization for thermal cycling test up to 2500 h are presented. A model for the supercapacitor performances prediction, in terms of capacitance and resistance evolution with ageing, is proposed and validated. Finally, the impact of the temperature cycling is highlighted and quantified. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
