Uniform MnO2 nanoflowers and a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) 3D nanostructure composite are synthesized on Ni foam using a two-step electrodeposition and hydrothermal method. The surface morphology and composition of the 3D nanostructure hybrid are intensively analyzed. MnO2/rGO/Ni is tested using a typical three-electrode system for potential use as a supercapacitor electrode. The hybrid electrode has a high areal specific capacitance. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device is assembled and characterized using MnO2/rGO/Ni as the positive electrode and rGO/Ni as the negative electrode to further evaluate the electrochemical capability of the hybrids. Electrochemical characterizations indicate that the ASC device can be cycled reversibly between 0 V and 2.0 V in 1 m Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. The maximum areal specific capacitance of 760.1 mF cm−2 (1266.83 F g−1) and the maximum ultrahigh energy density of 150.45 Wh kg−1 are obtained, demonstrating the potential for use as binder-free electrodes in pseudocapacitors.
