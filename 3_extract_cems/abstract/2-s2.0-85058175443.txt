The bismuth oxide/reduced graphene oxide (Bi2O3/rGO) composite was synthesized by solvothermal method at different calcination temperatures. The morphology and phase structure of the Bi2O3/rGO composite was characterized using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron microscopy (SEM), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET). Meanwhile, the electrochemical performance of the Bi2O3/rGO was obtained on the electrochemical workstation. The calcination temperature directly influenced the transformation of the precursor and the morphology and structure of the material obtained after calcination, which further affected the electrochemical properties of the material. At a calcination temperature of 350°C, Bi2O3/rGO composite has a good crystallinity, uniform dispersion and excellent electrochemical performance. The composite specific capacitance is 617.1 F·g-1 in 6 M KOH by chronopotentiometry at a specific current of 1 A·g-1, and the composite also displays a low resistance. These results indicate that Bi2O3/rGO composite has great prospects for supercapacitor electrode materials.
