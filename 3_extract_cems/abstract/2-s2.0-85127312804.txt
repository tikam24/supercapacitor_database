Energy depletion has led to the demand for new versatile materials with energy transmission and storage properties. Therefore, in this study, adhesive-free film structure of the NiSb alloy materials was obtained in one step through a simple and economic microwave synthesis technology using nickel foam as the source of nickel. X-ray analysis confirmed the successful preparation of NiSb nano-structures. In addition, electrochemical studies indicated that the adhesive-free film structure has a high capacity (4633 F g−1) and good cycle stability, and the capacitance value of this material was higher than that of previously reported alloy electrode materials such as MnCo and NiSn. In addition, we assembled an asymmetric supercapacitor with NiSb and activated carbon as the positive and negative electrode, respectively. The solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor had a working voltage of 1.7 V, and it exhibited a maximum energy density of 481.7 μWh cm−2 at 1630 μW cm−2, indicating the good energy transmission and storage properties of the NiSb nanomaterials.
