A Co9S8 film was in-situ deposited onto nickel foam substrate by a hydrothermal electrochemical deposition method. The morphology, composition and structure of the as-prepared film were characterized and the electrochemical performances were tested. The result show that the as-synthesized Co9S8 film displays a petal-like morphology and possesses excellent capacitive behavior with a specific capacitance of 2538.7 F/g at a discharge current density of 10 mA/cm2, which remains to be 1930.7 F/g even at a higher density of 50 mA/cm2. After 1000 cycles at 20 mA/cm2, a specific capacitance of 1825.2 F/g still remains, and the capacitance retention is calculated to be 72.8%. Even after 1500 cycles, a specific capacitance retention of 61.4% can be retained.
