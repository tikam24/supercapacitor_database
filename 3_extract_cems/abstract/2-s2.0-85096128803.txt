The development of portable, wearable, and miniaturized integrated electronics has significantly promoted the immense desire for planar micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) among the extremely competitive energy storage devices. However, their energy density is still insufficient owing to the low electrochemical performance of conventional electrode materials. Compared with their bulk counterparts, the large specific surface area and fast ion transport with efficient intercalation of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal compounds have spurred the research platforms for their exploitation in the creation of high-performance MSCs. This Outlook presents a systematic summary of cutting-edge research on atomically thin, layered structures of transition metal dichalcogenides, MXenes, and transition metal oxides/hydroxides. Special emphasis is given to the rapid and durable storage of ions, benefiting from the low ion diffusion barriers of host interlayer spaces. Moreover, various strategies have been described to circumvent the structural damage due to the volume change and simultaneously evincing remarkable electronic properties.
