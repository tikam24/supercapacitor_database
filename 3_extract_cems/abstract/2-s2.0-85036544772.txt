The paper discusses typical hybrid energy storage applications in power systems, such as frequency and voltage regulation, demand management, load shaving and energy arbitrage. The review has provided the state of the art in the field of battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage topologies for power systems application. A comparison of advantages and disadvantages of the passive, the semi-active and the active dc and ac schemes has been made. The parallel active hybridization scheme has been chosen as the most appropriate solution for power system application. The review has proven relevancy of the research in the field. The steps for the future research have been identified.
