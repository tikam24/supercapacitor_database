In this work, The NiCo2O4/NiO electrode materials are successfully synthesized via hydrothermal and following calcination approach. Due to the distinctive porous nanosheets assembled structure through controlling effectively the feeding amount of HMT, the NiCo2O4/NiO electrode possesses excellent specific surface area and reasonable pore size distribution, which hence minimizes the intrinsic electrode resistance and improves the morphology and structure stability. Therefore, the NiCo2O4/NiO electrode delivers a superior specific capacitance (Csp) (992.85 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1), good rate capability (79.14% Csp retention even at 10 A g−1) and considerable cycle life (79.82% Csp retention at 10 A g−1 after 5000 times). Furthermore, the asymmetric supercapacitor is successfully assembled by NCN-0.1 as positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as negative electrode. The NCN-0.1//AC device delivers a relatively excellent energy density of 47.43 kW kg−1 at a power density of 0.389 W h kg−1. Consequently, the outstanding performance and stability of the ASC device shows great potential for future energy storage application.
