Promoting the electronic conductivity and constructing regular porous structures are of high importance for increasing the electrochemical performance of oxides as supercapacitor electrodes. Herein, a simple biotemplating method is explored to synthesize NiO/Ni with regular pore-array structures. The specific capacitance of the biomorphic NiO/Ni (381.4 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) is higher than that of the nontemplated NiO sample (251.2 F g−1 at 1 A g−1). Moreover, good rate capability and cycling stability are also demonstrated. The enhanced electrochemical performance should be attributed to the improved electronic conductivity of hybridized NiO/Ni component and the efficient mass/charge transport in the biomorphic pore-array architecture.
