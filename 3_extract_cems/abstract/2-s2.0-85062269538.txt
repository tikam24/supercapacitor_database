Titanium (IV) sulphide (TiS2) is a layered transition metal dichalcogenide, which we exfoliate using liquid phase exfoliation. TiS2 is a candidate for being part of a range of future technologies. These applications are varied, and include supercapacitor and battery energy storage devices, catalytic substrates and the splitting of water. The driving force behind our interest was as a material for energy storage devices. Here we investigate a potential failure mechanism for such devices, namely oxidation and subsequent loss of sulphur. This degradation is important to understand, since these applications are highly property-dependent, and changes to the chemistry will result in changes in desired properties. Two approaches to study oxidisation were taken: ex situ oxidation by water and oxygen at room temperature and in situ oxidation by a 5% O2/Ar gas at elevated temperatures. Both sources of oxygen resulted in oxidation of the starting TiS2 flakes, with differing morphologies. Water produced amorphous oxide slowly growing in from the edge of the flakes. Oxygen gas at ≥375 °C produced crystalline oxide, with a range of structures due to oxidation initiating from various regions of the observed flakes.
