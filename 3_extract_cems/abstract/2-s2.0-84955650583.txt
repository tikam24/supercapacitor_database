The layered Co–Mn hydroxide nanoflakes grown on carbon cloth (CC) have been successfully fabricated via a facile solvothermal method in a mixed solvent of water and methanol. The structure and morphology of final products could be readily tuned in a wide range by tuning volume ratios of methanol and water. The electrochemical measurements revealed that layered Co–Mn hydroxide nanoflakes grown on CC, exhibit a high-specific capacitance and remarkable cycling stability, which is of great importance for their practical applications in high-performance supercapacitor. Moreover, the specific capacitances of layered hydroxides would be enhanced with the expansion of interlayer spacing.
