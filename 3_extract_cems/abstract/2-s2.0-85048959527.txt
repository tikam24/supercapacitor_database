In this study, a facile and reproducible method has been developed to synthesize a nano composite foam layer of CuO/ graphene oxide (GO) intended for supercapacitor applications. GO particles were deposited on elecroplated CuO foam layers through electrophoretic deposition (EPD). The results showed that by varying EPD time (1, 3, 7 min), the degree of coverage of the foam layer with GO changes. This makes it feasible to manipulate the specific capacity of (Csp) CuO foam layers (238.3 F.g−1). It was shown that the specific capacity of the foam layer has been improved by amounts of 72%, 49% and 40% for EPD time deposition of 1, 3 and 7 min of GO, respectively.The results suggest a new versatile design to enhance super capacity and energy storage properties in conventional transition metal oxides. Morphology, phase structure, porosity and surface area of synthesized structures were investigated by field emission secondary electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and BET (Brunauer– Emmett–Teller) approaches. Super capacity properties of the layers were from cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) tests.
