A mesoporous NiO@graphite paper with multilayered nanosheet wall structures (M- NiO@GP) was synthesized through a facile and low-cost hydrothermal reaction and thermal annealing process. The as-prepared M-NiO@GP electrode presents high specific capacitance (2.57 F cm-2), exhibits superior cyclic stability (92.3% capacitance retention after 10000 chargedischarge cycles) and brilliant rate capability (about 56.0% capacitance retention when the current density increased 20 times). Such high-performance capacitive behavior is attributed to the wall structure of NiO with the multilayer nanosheets, which could shorten the ion transfer distance. Meanwhile, the high specific surface area and mesoporous structure of the electrode could serve as an efficient path for OH- transfer and diffusion. The improved electrical conductivity of the electrode enabled stable and efficient electron transports and consequently improved the overall electrochemical performance of supercapacitors. Therefore, the demonstrated high conductive M-NiO@GP electrode is a promising candidate for practical supercapacitor applications.
