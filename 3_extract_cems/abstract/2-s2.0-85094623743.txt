In this study, CuWO4 nanoparticles (CuWs) were prepared via a weak ultrasonic irradiation method. Cu(CH3COO)2. H2O, Na2WO4·2H2O were used as reagents and calcination of the obtained precursor was done in the air at 500 °C through 1 h. CuWs were applied for preparing the nanocomposite of CuWO4 nanoparticles coated on nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (NRGO) using various proportions through the sonochemical approach. For comparing the NRGO value effect on the supercapacitive effects of the nanocomposite, specimens with varied CuW/NRGO weight ratios (1/1, 10/1, and 30/1 wt%) were obtained by the same process and defined as CuW/NRGO, CuW10/NRGO and CuW30/NRGO, respectively. Characterization of the precursor, as well as the prepared yields was done using Raman spectra, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The charge storage capacity, continues cyclic voltammetry (CCV) and ion transport related to the obtained CuWs and nanocomposites were assessed by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 3 M H2SO4. Electrochemical examinations were carried out in three electrode systems and their results showed the highest specific capacitance (SC) of 620.1 F g-1 at the scan rate of 2 mVs−1 for CuW/NRGO sample that indicated the high SC of it as well as its potential to use as an appropriate option for supercapacitor electrode. Following the 3000 cycles in the similar sample, about 97.1% of its primary capacitance is observable at the scan rate of 100 mVs−1. The current study was the first in this field.
