In the present work, binder-free MnCo 2 O 4 nanoflakes were prepared using a cost-effective potentiostatic mode of electrodeposition. Structural and microstructural features of the prepared MnCo 2 O 4 samples were examined by different characterization techniques including X-ray diffraction, Raman, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and supercapacitive testing. The morphological investigation revealed that a unique nanoflake-like structure with uniform morphology. The electrochemical properties of MnCo 2 O 4 nanoflakes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The maximum specific capacitance observed for the MnCo 2 O 4 thin films was 585 F g −1 for a current density of 0.2 mA cm −2 . Our results indicate that the MnCo 2 O 4 electrode has potential for application in supercapacitors.
