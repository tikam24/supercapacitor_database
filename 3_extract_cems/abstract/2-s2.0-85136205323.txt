A metal porous carbon (Ni@NC) supported nickel/cobalt layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) (Ni@NC@NiCo-LDH) with a cauliflower morphology was synthesized by a successive double template method. At first a nickel metal-organic framework (Ni-MOF) was prepared and used as a sacrifice template to produce metal porous carbon (Ni@NC). Then the prepared conductive porous carbon material was exploited as a substrate for in-situ growing of ZIF-67 on its surface. Lastly the obtained Ni@NC@ZIF-67 was further used as a sacrifice template to prepare the final electrode material Ni@NC@NiCo-LDH by Ni2+ etching and co-precipitation. The cooperation of Ni@NC with excellent conductivity and NiCo-LDH with superior pseudocapacitive property yielded a synergistic effect, which effectively improved the electrochemical performance of the resulted electrode material. And the special flower morphology exposed more redox active sites and provided proper charge transport path for enhanced electrochemical performance. The prepared Ni@NC@NiCo-LDH exhibited a high specific capacitance of 1761.8 F·g−1 at the current density of 1 A·g−1. The assembled Ni@NC@NiCo-LDH//AC asymmetric supercapacitor also displayed an acceptable energy density (39.27 Wh·kg−1 at the power density of 757.21 W·kg−1) and ultrahigh cycling stability (94.74% capacitance retention after 25000 cycles at 10 A g−1).
