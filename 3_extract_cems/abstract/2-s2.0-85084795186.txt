Energy management systems are developed to control, monitor and optimize the smart grid energy market. Energy balance has to be maintained and demands of electrical loads has to be met at all the times. This paper presents an efficient power management system that has the battery connected in parallel to the ultra-capacitors. Batteries have very good energy density, (total amount of energy a device can hold) whereas ultra-capacitors have very good power density (speed at which power can be discharged). Hence in this paper with the use of the time series forecasting algorithms such as ARIMA, the next load requirement hence the peak requirement of the load is predicted. Extracting the advantages of both the devices the demands of electrical load that is by using ultra-capacitors during peak power need and battery during regular power need the lifetime of the model also increases and needs are also satisfied hence in the name efficient. The analysis of battery and ultra-capacitors is done using Simulink, a MathWorks product and using python the algorithm of time series forecasting is implemented. In this paper the algorithm ARIMA is proved to be the best suitable for the suggested load pattern with the lowest root mean square error.
