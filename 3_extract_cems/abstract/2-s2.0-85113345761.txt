Transition metal orthovanadates are emerging 2D materials for promising electrochemical energy storage applications. Facile hydrothermal method for nanocrystalline indium vanadate (InVO4) semiconducting materials’ fabrication is economical because of its direct chemical synthesis. X-ray diffraction studies, field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) images, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and photoelectron X-ray spectrum are used to describe the semiconductor materials as synthesized. InVO4 microspheres have attracted a lot of attention in the energy and environmental sector. These microsphere-derived semiconductor materials are recognized to offer the advantages of their large surface area, tunable pore sizes, enhanced light absorption, efficient carrier (electron–hole) separation, superior electronic and optical behavior, and high durability. From the results of SEM and TEM, InVO4 shows a microsphere construction with a mixture of nanosized particles. Diffuse reflectance UV–visible measurements are used to determine the bandgap, and it is found to be 2.1 eV for InVO4. The electrochemical analysis reveals a superior performance of the pseudocapacitor with hydrothermally derived microspheres of InVO4. Alongside an improved pseudocapacity, developed after 4000 cycles, it has excellent cycling stability with a retention of ≈94% of its original specific capacitance efficiency.
