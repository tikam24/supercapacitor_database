Single phase double perovskite oxide (Pr2CrMnO6) based new electrode material was developed for supercapacitor applications. Structural studies reveal monoclinic structure with space group P21/n. The sample exhibit bond angle distortion in the form of octahedral tilt. A signature of distortion in Mn — O — Cr bond angles is visualized through delocalization of oxygen clouds around Cr and Mn atoms via electron density maps. Large octahedral tilt in vertical direction forms uniform chain of spherical particles of mean size ∼870 nm. Electrochemical studies were performed by a three-electrode set up in room temperature. Both the cyclic voltametric and galvanic charge-discharge studies reveal great retention with variation in scanning parameters as well as cycles. The chain-like spherical-shaped particles anticipate active sites for intercalation and deintercalation of electrolyte ions that contributed towards diffusion-controlled capacitance. A significant value of specific capacitance (177.4 F/g) was achieved at current density of 2 A/g and it is found to be better than Ni–Mn based double perovskite oxides.
