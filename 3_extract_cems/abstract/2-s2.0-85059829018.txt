We present an all-solid-state flexible and stretchable pseudocapacitor composed of dodecylbenzenesulfonate-doped polypyrrole (PPy(DBS))-coated vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (VACNTs) partially embedded in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate. VACNTs are grown via atmospheric-pressure chemical vapor deposition on a Si/SiO 2 substrate and transferred onto PDMS. Then, the PPy(DBS) film is coated with a surface charge of 300 mC cm -2 on individual carbon nanotubes (CNTs) via electropolymerization. The partial embedment of VACNTs in PDMS permits a rapid and facile integration of the PPy(DBS)/CNTs/PDMS structure to construct a flexible and stretchable supercapacitor electrode. The measured capacitance is 3.6 mF cm - 2 with a PVA-KOH gel electrolyte at a scan rate of 100 mV s -1 , which is maintained under stretching from 0% to 150% and bending/twisting angles from 0° to 180°. This all-solid-state stretchable supercapacitor shows a stable galvanostatic performance during 10 000 charge/discharge cycles with its capacitance retained at 109%.
