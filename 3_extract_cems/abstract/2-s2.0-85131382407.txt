This study investigated the specific capacitance, energy density and cyclic stability parameters of a WS2 coated vertically aligned BCN nanotubes (VA-BCN-NTs) composite electrode structure. The specific capacitance of VA-BCN-NTs was found to be 364 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. This electrode had 97% of their initial specific capacitance after 10,000 cycles at a current density of 20 A g−1, exhibiting excellent cyclic stability. In the three-electrode cell, the specific capacitance of the VA-BCN-NT@WS2 electrode at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 was calculated to be 690 F g−1. After 5000 cycles at a current density of 20 A g−1, the electrode structure had a capacitance value of 74%, showing good stability. In the two-electrode cell, the specific capacitance of the VA-BCN-NT@WS2 symmetrical supercapacitor at a current density of 1 A g−1 was found to be 170 F g−1. It was observed to have retained 85% of its capacitance after 10,000 cycles over a 1 V potential range. While the energy density of this structure was 23.6 Wh kg−1, the power density was 4250 W kg−1.
