Owing to the advantages of the conductive activated carbon (AC) and capacitive Zn2SnO4, a series of Zn2SnO4/AC composites are successfully prepared by a co-precipitation method. The textural structure of Zn2SnO4/AC composites illustrate that the Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles are anchored into the micropores of AC. The systematical electrochemical investigation demonstrates that the specific capacitance of the Z-150 sample (including 25% Zn2SnO4) is 322.6 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. The specific capacitance values are retained 96.5%, 91.1% and 81.6% at the current density of 1 A g−1, 8 A g−1 and 16 A g−1 after 3000 cycles, respectively. This confirms the excellent electrochemical performance and good long-term cycling stability of Zn2SnO4/AC composites as supercapacitor electrodes at high current densities.
