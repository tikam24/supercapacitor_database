A novel nanoplatelet-like structure of the composites of polypyrrole (PPy) and graphene (GR) is facilely synthesized by an electrochemical method and is further employed as a supercapacitor. The nanocomposite of PPy/GR shows a porous structure with a specific surface area of as high as 136.5 m 2 g -1. As a result, the composite material exhibits a high specific capacitance of 285 F g -1 at a discharge rate of 0.5 A g -1, and excellent cycling stability. Specifically, over 90% of its initial capacitance can be retained after 1000 charge/discharge cycles. With advantageous features, such as facile fabrication process, high specific capacitance and excellent cycle life, this electrochemically synthesized PPy/GR nanocomposite is quite promising for high-performance supercapacitor applications.
