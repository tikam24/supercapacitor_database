Electrochemical intercalation/conversion/alloying reactions, as one of the most important solid-state redox reactions, play essential roles in electrochemical energy storage systems. First-principles calculations hold great potential to fundamental understandings of reversible intercalation/conversion/alloying reactions, which may provide insights into designing high-performance electrode materials. Recently, electrode materials with both battery-type and capacitive charge storage are significantly promising in achieving high energy and high power densities, perfectly fulfilling the rigorous requirements of metal-ion batteries and electrochemical capacitors as the next generation of energy storage devices. Different from traditional electrode materials, the electrode materials with both battery-type and capacitive charge storage enable the charging and discharging processes within the order of minutes or even seconds because of the enhanced surface-controlled charge storage. By combining experimental characterizations and computational simulations, this review summaries the state-of-the-art of design strategies for electrode materials with both battery-type and capacitive charge storage. Moreover, the research opportunities and key technical challenges are suggested regarding further research in this thriving field.
