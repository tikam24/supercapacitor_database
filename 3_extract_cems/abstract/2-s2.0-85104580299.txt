Lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) are emerging as one of the most advanced energy storage devices by combining the virtues of both supercapacitors (SCs) and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, the kinetic and capacity mismatch between anode and cathode is the main obstacle to wide applications of LICs. Therefore, the effective strategy of constructing a high-performance LIC is to improve the rate and cycle performance of the anode and the specific capacity of the cathode. Herein, the nickel cobalt phosphate (NiCoP) microspheres anode is demonstrated with robust structural integrity, high electrical conductivity, and fast kinetic feature. Simultaneously, the watermelon-peel biomass-derived carbon (WPBC) cathode is demonstrated a sustainable synthesis strategy with high specific capacity. As expected, the NiCoP exhibits high specific capacities (567 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1), superior rate performance (300 mAh g−1 at 1A g−1), and excellent cycle stability (58 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1 after 15,000 cycles). The WPBC possesses a high specific surface area (SSA) of 3303.6 m2 g−1 and a high specific capacity of 226 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1. Encouragingly, the NiCoP//WPBC-6 LIC device can deliver high energy density (ED) of 127.4 ± 3.3 and 67 ± 3.8Wh kg−1 at power density (PD) of 190 and 18240 W kg−1 (76.4% capacity retention after 7000 cycles), respectively.
