The paper is concerned with the development of the propulsion system for two Light Electric Vehicles (LEVs), namely a city scooter and an electric bicycle. The propulsion system of the city scooter consists of a wheel motor for the traction and a lithium-ion battery for the energy storage. The propulsion system of the electric bicycle utilizes a fuel cell assisted by a supercapacitor bank for the energy supply. Â© 2010 IEEE.
