MXenes are the emerging class of 2D materials, widely explored as supercapacitor electrodes with their explicit properties. Using the pseudocapacitive nature of the widely reported MXene - Ti3C2Tx, an asymmetric cell is designed with Ti3C2Tx as the negative electrode and Vanadium nitride/Porous carbon as the positive electrode. The asymmetric cell provides a high cell voltage of 1.8 V with a specific capacitance of 105 F/g at 1 A/g in 6 M KOH. It also presents a capacitance retention of 73% even after 10,000 charge-discharge cycles. The asymmetric cell exhibits a high potential window, which is about 3 times higher when compared to symmetric supercapacitors. The asymmetric electrode system exhibits an energy density of 12.81 Wh/kg and a corresponding power density of 985.8 W/kg at 1 A/g. This value of energy density is greater when compared to various symmetric supercapacitors. Thus Ti3C2Tx MXene electrodes can effectively replace the conventional carbon electrodes used in asymmetric supercapacitors.
