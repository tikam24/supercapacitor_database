In this paper, cobalt alkoxide was synthesized by a one-step solvothermal method. The as-prepared cobalt alkoxide mainly consists of hexagonal platelets with thickness of dozens of nanometers, smooth surface and sharp corner. Experiment results show that the obtained cobalt alkoxide demonstrates battery-type electrochemical behavior and outstanding cycling stability.
