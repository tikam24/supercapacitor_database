The combination of graphene with transition metal oxides can result in very promising hybrid materials for use in energy storage applications thanks to its intriguing properties, i.e., highly tunable surface area, outstanding electrical conductivity, good chemical stability, and excellent mechanical behavior. In the present work, we evaluate the performance of graphene/metal oxide (WO3 and CeOx) layered structures as potential electrodes in supercapacitor applications. Graphene layers were grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on copper substrates. Single and layer-by-layer graphene stacks were fabricated combining graphene transfer techniques and metal oxides grown by magnetron sputtering. The electrochemical properties of the samples were analyzed and the results suggest an improvement in the performance of the device with the increase in the number of graphene layers. Furthermore, deposition of transition metal oxides within the stack of graphene layers further improves the areal capacitance of the device up to 4.55 mF/cm2, for the case of a three-layer stack. Such high values are interpreted as a result of the copper oxide grown between the copper substrate and the graphene layer. The electrodes present good stability for the first 850 cycles before degradation.
