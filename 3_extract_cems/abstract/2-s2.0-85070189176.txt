Polypyrrole/expanded graphite (PPy/EG) nanohybrids, with a hierarchical structure of a three dimensional EG framework with a thick PPy coating layer, have been synthesized via a vacuum-assisted intercalation in situ oxidation polymerization method. In the synthesis, pyrrole monomers were intercalated into the irregular pores of EG with the assistance of a vacuum pump. Subsequently, the intercalated pyrrole monomers assembled on both sides of the EG nanosheets and formed PPy by an in situ polymerization method. As electrode materials, the typical PPy/EG10 sample with an EG content of 10% had a high specific capacitance of 454.3 F g-1 and 442.7 F g-1 (1.0 A g-1), and specific capacitance retention rate of 75.9% and 73.3% (15.0 A g-1) in 1 M H2SO4 and 1 M KCl electrolytes, respectively. The two-electrode symmetric supercapacitor showed a high energy density of 47.5 W h kg-1 at a power density of 1 kW kg-1, and could retain superb stability after 2000 cycles. The unique self-supporting structure feature and homogeneous PPy nanosphere coating combined the contributions of electrochemical double layer capacitance and pseudo-capacitance, which made the nanohybrids an excellent electrode material for high performance energy storage devices.
