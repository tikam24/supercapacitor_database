We report on the influence of stirring of electrolyte (glycerol+ H 2 O + NaCl) on anodic growth of Ni-Ti-O nanopores (NPs) on nearly equiatomic NiTi alloy at different applied voltages. The results show that anodization is a diffusion-controlled process. The stirring has little influence on the NP diameter, but shortens its length. High stirring speed of electrolyte yields high Ni content in the NPs, which is promising in electrocatalysis, biosensor, supercapacitor, and other related fields.
