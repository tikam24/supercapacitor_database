We report the fabrication of hematite nanotubes/reduced graphene oxide (α-Fe2O3NTs/rGO) nanocomposites via a one-step hydrothermal process without using any template. The structure and morphology of the samples are confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Electrochemical performances of the samples are investigated employing cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The α-Fe2O3NTs/rGO demonstrated a maximum specific capacitance of 262.2 F g−1at 1 A g−1and good cyclic stability at 5 A g−1with 96% capacitance retention after 500 cycles. The integration of α-Fe2O3NTs with rGO sheets improved the electrochemical performances.
