In hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), the power management unit helps to control the distribution of power between various power sources with the aim of meeting a set of predefined objectives. Often, the minimization of difference between power demand and supplied power is a prime objective. However, further challenges need to be addressed are the selection of suitable set of rules and adapting them to the vehicle drive cycle. In this paper, a batteryâ€“supercapacitor hybrid vehicle control with two schemes, viz. fuzzy rule-based (FRB) and hybrid fuzzy-PID controllers are proposed. The MATLAB simulation results indicate that the application of hybrid fuzzy-PID control scheme results in meeting the power demand with slower rate of discharge. This ensures improved efficacy of the proposed scheme.
