In this article, we have synthesized flake-like MoS2 nanoarchitecture by urea assisted hydrothermal method. To improve the electrical and electrochemical properties of MoS2 nanoarchitecture, we formed its nanocomposite (MoS2/r-GO) with 10% r-GO. After the addition of 10% r-GO, the nanocomposite shows the electrical conductivity of 1.24 × 10−1 Sm−1 that is higher than the pure MoS2 (2.2 × 10−7 Sm−1). The prepared nanocomposite also showed higher specific capacitance (441 Fg-1 at 1 Ag-1) than the pure MoS2 nanoarchitecture (248 Fg-1 at 1 Ag-1). Moreover, nanocomposite lost just 15.8% of its initial capacitance after 1000 charge-discharge cycles. The enhanced electrochemical activity of the nanocomposite is due to its unique flake-like structure and its reduced charge transfer resistance (Rct ~ 23.5 Ω). The 2-D flake-like structure of the electrode increased its contact area with the r-GO matrix and electrolyte. The higher electrical conductivity and specific surface area of the nanocomposite facilitated the faradaic and non-faradic charge storage mechanism. The r-GO matrix not only acted as a capacitive supplement but also facilitated the redox reaction because of its superior electrical conductivity. As the nanocomposite showed CV and CCD profiles in the negative potential window (−1 V to −0.53 V), therefore it has the potential to be used as a negative electrode material for hybrid supercapacitors applications. The observed results revealed the potential of the (MoS2/r-GO) nanocomposite-based cathode for hybrid supercapacitor applications.
