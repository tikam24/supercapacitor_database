A procedure for the grafting of oxocarbon compounds is proposed by condensation reaction with a benzenediamine to obtain an attached-phenazine moieties. A technical proof of concept is given by the covalent capture of rhodizonic acid on the Norit activated carbon and potentiality for supercapacitors is evidenced. The composite material obtained was tested as positive electrode for aqueous supercapacitors in 1 M H2SO4. The redox activity covering a wide range of potential gives an unprecedented increase in specific charge of 350% and a specific energy at the discharge 3.4 times higher than the unmodified carbon.
