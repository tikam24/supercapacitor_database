In the present study, we have successfully fabricated thermally reduced graphene oxide (TRGO) nanosheets on a flexible carbon fabric and demonstrated their implementation as a binder-free electrode for a flexible supercapacitor. The electrochemical measurements revealed that the flexible solid-state supercapacitor delivered a high device capacitance of 70.4Fg<sup>-1</sup> at 5mVs<sup>-1</sup> with excellent flexibility. Further, the capability of the device was demonstrated by driving a green and red light-emitting diodes for 15min. Finally, we demonstrated its viability in a self-powered photosensor application by integrating the fabric supercapacitor device with a nanogenerator and photosensor. Our results suggest that a flexible TRGO-coated fabric has great potential in energy storage devices for self-powered nanosystems as well as a flexible, wearable, micro-power source.
