Multi-functional polysaccharide-based gels have gained increasing interest for various applications because of their biodegradability, flexibility and porous structure. This paper focuses on the exploration of an all-polysaccharide hydrogel platform for sensing and electricity harvesting/storage, with hydrogels consisting of cationic guar gum (CGG) and chitosan (CS). The gelling and crosslinking are due to the imine and acetal formations between carbonyl groups in polysaccharides, which are in-situ generated via the sodium periodate (NaIO4) oxidation, and their hydroxyl/amine groups. Consequently, CS/CGG hydrogel is fabricated without any crosslinking agents, and it exhibits injectability, conductivity, adhesiveness, etc. Thanks to its pressure responsiveness, the CS/CGG hydrogel accurately detects human motions. More importantly, it generates an output voltage of 32.1 mV upon moist air flow blowing, due to the abundant hydrophilic groups. Furthermore, the aerogel obtained by freeze-drying of CS/CGG hydrogel produces a voltage up to 162.2 mV, demonstrating its good electricity harvesting capacity. The carbon aerogel obtained from the calcination of CS/CGG aerogel exhibits good electrochemical performance with a high capacity and capacitance retention (ca. 90% after 10,000 consecutive cycles). Thus, this work provides a novel strategy to design a sustainable hydrogel platform for many applications, which may provide inspiration for all-natural functional material development.
