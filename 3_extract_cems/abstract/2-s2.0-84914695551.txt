(Figure Presented). We report on the first synthesis of porous ZrO2-SiO2 sheets with well-defined ultrasmall WO3 nanoparticles for energy storage performance. In our system, for improving the surface deterioration of electrode, we use the ZrO2-SiO2 sheets using graphene oxide as a template to access electrode substrate. The synthesized electrode with about 20 nm thickness and about 10 nm pores, has a maximum value of 313 F/g at current density of 1 A/g and a minimum value of 160 F/g at current density of 30 A/g in the specific capacitance. In addition, over 90% of its initial speci fic capacitance is retained when they are cycled up to 2500 cycles.
