Commercially available supercapacitors currently require designers to experimentally characterise devices before integration for their specific applications. In this work a simple fractional-order equivalent model for a supercapacitor is used to derive the design equation to estimate the discharge time due to a constant current. This model is shown to capture the transient discharging behaviour in the voltage range of interest (5-3 V) typical of many embedded systems. Experimental results using Kemet FT0H105ZF supercapacitors (1 F rating) as a secondary power supply for an Arduino Uno system are presented to highlight the application of this model and equations to a ubiquitous embedded system.
