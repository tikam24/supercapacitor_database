To mitigate voltage disturbances in low voltage distribution system dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) with energy storage device is used in this paper. DVR is installed between supply and load which will inject voltage and active power to the distribution system during balanced voltage sag and swell disturbances. The super capacitor is used as an energy storage device in this paper. The performance of the DVR depends on control strategy used. In this work SRF Theory with Proportional Integral (PI) controller is used as an control technique. The performance of DVR for various disturbances is compared with and without energy storage device. The simulations are carried out using MATLAB/SIMULINK software.
