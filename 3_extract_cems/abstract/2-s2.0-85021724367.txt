Quasi solid-state electrolytes (QS-SEs) based on an ionic liquid ([EMIM][FSI]) immobilized in ordered mesoporous silica MCM-41 using physical imbibition process have been developed. Supercapacitor assembly obtained using activated carbon electrodes and QS-SEs can be operated up to 2 V and exhibit good specific capacitance of 30 F g−1. The specific energy and power densities of the supercapacitor are found ~17 Wh kg−1 and 1000 W kg−1, respectively, at 1 mA cm−2 current density and exhibit good cycle performance at room temperature.
