In this work, converting cotton fabrics into high-performance flexible carbon electrodes are achieved successfully by using traditional dyeing, flame retardant finishing and carbonization processes for wearable supercapacitors. The optimal carbon electrode (CCF-SP) doped with O, N, P and S heteroatoms, exhibits high surface area (643.7 m2 g−1), porous structure and good hydrophilicity. Because of electric double layer capacitance provided by carbon materials and faradaic capacitance provided by heteroatoms, the specific capacitance of CCF-SP electrode is as high as 3079.8 ± 17.9 mF cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2. After 5000 cyclic tests, residual capacitance of CCF-SP is still 99.3% of the initial value, suggesting good rate property and coulombic efficiency. In addition, flexible supercapacitor (FSC) assembled by CCF-SP electrodes exhibits an excellent energy density of 9.4 mWh cm−3 at power density of 37.5 mW cm−3. This device can power electronic gadgets at bending situation without loss of capacitance. The stunning electrochemical properties of the created carbon electrodes and its FSCs indicate that the method of heteroatoms doping combined with carbonization treatments is cheap and easy to mass produce, which can be utilized to fabricate electrodes for wearable electronic devices in the future.
