Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) are regarded as promising materials for supercapacitors (SCs) owing to their excellent redox activity and electrical conductivity. However, their inferior rate performance and poor long-term cycling stability hinder their real-world applications. Engineering nanostructured multicomponent TM-based hybrid materials with rational core@shell architectures is a promising approach to prepare advanced electrodes for SCs. Herein, hierarchical Fe-Co-P@Ni(OH)2 core@shell nanoarrays assembled from needle-type Fe-Co-P nanoarrays and ultrathin Ni(OH)2 nanosheets have been grown vertically on Ni-foam via a successive hydrothermal reaction, phosphorization, and chemical bath deposition method. The as-fabricated Fe-Co-P@Ni(OH)2 electrode exhibits an ultra-high specific capacity of 380.61 mA h g−1 at 5 mA cm−2, high rate capability (61% at 50 mA cm−2) and retains 90% of its capacity after 5000 galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor device was assembled by integrating Fe-Co-P@Ni(OH)2 (positive) and polyacrylonitrile-derived nitrogen doped carbon nanofiber (negative) electrodes, which delivers a high energy density of 65.09 W h kg−1 at a power density of 530.06 W kg−1, outstanding rate capability (54% at 80 mA cm−2), and excellent cycling performance.
