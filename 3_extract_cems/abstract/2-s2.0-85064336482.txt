Sb/ZnWO4/r-GO nanocomposite has been prepared by a single step solvothermal method. The crystal structure of the prepared nanocomposite has been characterized using a powder x-ray diffractometer (XRD). The optical properties of the prepared nanocomposite were studied using UV–visible spectroscopy and photoluminescence. The energy band gap of 3.52 eV is obtained for the ZWS-5 nanocomposite using Tauc plots. For both Sb/ZnWO4 and Sb/ZnWO4/r-GO nanocomposite XRD shows the monoclinic Wolframite structure. The supercapacitor performance of the prepared samples was carried out using electrochemical techniques such as cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The nanocomposite ZWS-5 exhibits a specific capacitance of 102 F/g, which is higher than pristine ZWS specific capacitance of 64 F/g. Both ZWS and ZWS-5 electrodes show good capacitance retention proficiency even after 1000 cycles.
