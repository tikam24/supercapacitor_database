Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their derivatives are promising electrodes materials because of their various modular and controllable structures as well as their high specific surface areas and large internal pore volume. This review elaborates the recent advances in MOFs and MOF-derived materials for supercapacitor applications. Derivatives based on several typical MOFs are discussed with a focus on material synthesis strategies and corresponding supercapacitor performances if applied as electrode materials. Challenges and opportunities in MOFs-derived materials as supercapacitors are also highlighted, and further research directions are proposed to facilitate research and development in this area.
