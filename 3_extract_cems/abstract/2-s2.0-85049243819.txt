This paper presents a self-power interface circuit with hybrid energy storage unit (ESU) for kinetic energy harvesting applications using super-capacitor and Li-polymer battery (LPB). The use of super-capacitor and charge management chip extend the battery's life. On the other hand, the Li-polymer battery (LPB) reduce the energy loss due to leakage current and equivalent series resistance (ESR). The paper also shows the characterizations of the ESUs for energy harvesting powered smart basketball hardware module. Before the power management circuit proposed, the kinetic energy-harvesting test system (KETS) is presented and used to evaluate the power generation characteristics of electromagnetic energy harvester with impact-type vibration. The optimized electromagnetic vibration harvester (EVH) can produce a power of 4.0 mW at low frequencies (< 10Hz).
