The fuel efficiency and performance of novel vehicles with electric propulsion capability are largely limited by the performance of Energy Storage System. The battery system choice is a crucial item but no single type of energy storage element fulfils high energy density, high power delivery capacity, low cost per unit of storage, long cycle life, low leakage, and so on at the same time. One of the best solution is to use a Hybrid Energy Storage System. The main objective is to design of a hybrid electrical energy storage system which gives substantial benefits against battery issues such as reduction in battery stress. Also to maintain battery current as constant as possible during transients to limit battery stress. On the other hand supercapacitor has capability to charge as fast as possible without exceeding maximum current from regenerative breaking and to discharge most of its stored energy during acceleration. Adding supercapacitor bank will assist the battery during vehicle acceleration and hill climbing and with its quick recharge capability, it will assist the battery in capturing the regenerative breaking energy. This significant advantage a battery-supercapacitor energy storage system gained attention. Battery and supercapacitor sizing includes the most important and difficult steps is, the determination of the numbers of batteries and supercapacitor connected in series and parallel. The power management is essentially the optimal distribution of power between battery and supercapacitor. With supercapacitor added into the hybrid energy storage system, battery workload is reduced, which leads to significant extension of battery life.
