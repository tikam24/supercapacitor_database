The influence of a ferrocene-modified fullerene derivative (FcC60) on the crystalline growth of fullerene microrods was studied based on the liquid-liquid interfacial precipitation (LLIP) process. By mixing a small amount of FcC60, a more obvious solvent effect on the packing of fullerenes was found, which resulted in the formation of microrod crystals with various edge morphologies. After carbonization of these fullerene microrods, the solvent effect and the effective intercalation of FcC60 led to the formation of carbon materials with large porosity and doped functional Fe and N simultaneously. They exhibited improved conductivity and better diffusion of electrolyte ions when used as the electrode for a supercapacitor. This work presents a new insight into both the manipulation and functionalization of fullerene superstructures for exploring a wider range of application potentials.
