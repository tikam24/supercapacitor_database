Poly(3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/activated carbon(PEDOT/AC) composites as electrode materials of supercapacitors were synthesized by in-situ polymerization on AC particles. The structure and morphology of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffractometer, scanning electron microscope and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry. The electrochemical properties of the samples were measured by cyclic voltammetry, constant current charge-discharge and alternating current impendence methods. The results show that specific capacitance is greatly improved by PEDOT grown on AC particles. AC/PEDOT exhibits the highest specific capacitance of 250 F/g at the ratio of n(AC):n(PEDOT)=10:1 and increases by 95.3% than the specific capacitance of AC. Low equivalent series resistance (0.29Î©), and retaining 80.4% of the initial specific capacitance after 1 000 cycles signify a long-term cycling stability. Furthermore, the miniaturization of carbon-based supercapacitor can be realized.
