Inorganic solid electrolytes are mechanically and thermally stable and thus may be regarded as the most promising electrolytes for the development of solid-state electrochemical devices. In this work all-solid-state symmetric and asymmetric supercapacitors with the oxide electrodes LiMn1.5Ni 0.45Mg0.05O4, Mn2O3, MnO2 and the composite solid electrolytes 0.4LiClO 4-0.6Al2O3 were assembled and investigated. Electrode materials were prepared by mixing of oxides with solid composite electrolyte and carbon black. The cells were prepared by hot-pressing and electrochemically tested. From an analysis of galvanostatic charge-discharge curves it was shown that specific capacitance of the cells at 150 C and the current density of 0.05 A/g reached 29 F/g corresponding to the charge capacity of 16 mA·h/g. © 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.
