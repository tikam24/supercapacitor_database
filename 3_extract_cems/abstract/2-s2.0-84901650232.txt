Supercapacitors with porous carbon structures have high energy storage capacity. However, the porous nature of the carbon electrode, composed mainly of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene oxide (GO) derivatives, negatively impacts the volumetric electrochemical characteristics of the supercapacitors because of poor packing density (<0.5 g cm-3). Herein, we report a simple method to fabricate highly dense and vertically aligned reduced graphene oxide (VArGO) electrodes involving simple hand-rolling and cutting processes. Because of their vertically aligned and opened-edge graphene structure, VArGO electrodes displayed high packing density and highly efficient volumetric and areal electrochemical characteristics, very fast electrolyte ion diffusion with rectangular CV curves even at a high scan rate (20 V/s), and the highest volumetric capacitance among known rGO electrodes. Surprisingly, even when the film thickness of the VArGO electrode was increased, its volumetric and areal capacitances were maintained. Â© 2014 American Chemical Society.
