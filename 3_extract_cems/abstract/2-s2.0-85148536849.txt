Due to the shortage of non-renewable energy sources supplies, supercapacitors (SCs) as one kind of energy storage and conversion systems have been extensively studied and used to store renewable energies, because they simultaneously compensate the low power density of rechargeable batteries and low energy density of conventional capacitors. However, their practical applications are strongly restricted by electrode materials. Consequently, the development and innovation of advanced electrode materials are greatly of importance. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted considerable attentions and are fitting as electrode materials of SCs thanks to their unique characteristics, including easy generation of composites with other compounds, tunable structures and large specific surface area. Herein, we systematically review recent progresses of the MOFs-based materials (e.g., pure MOFs and MOFs derivatives) for SCs. The crucial effects of synthesis strategs on morphologies and sizes are discussed accordingly. In addition, some electrochemical performances of the MOFs-based materials as SCs electrodes are highlighted. Lastly, the challenges and future perspectives are proposed in the MOFs-based SCs. Furthermore, artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) are suggested to help researchers tackling current difficulties, thereby shortening the process of industrialization of the MOFs-based materials and SCs.
