The unique three-dimensional (3D) porous structure of graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) was prepared by an environmentally friendly one-step solvothermal method, and its electrochemical performance was assessed. Importantly, g-C3N4 is a low cost material with excellent chemical stability, and it supports the vertical charge transfer during the charge-discharge process, which promotes electronic transmission along this direction. In addition, V2O5 has good theoretical capacitance and is deemed as a potential electrode material for next-generation supercapacitors. Field emission scanning electron microscopy of the nanocomposite revealed a 3D porous morphology for g-C3N4 (3D PCN) and a spherical morphology for V2O5. This study estimated the viability of the graphite carbon nitride-based nanocomposite PCN@V2O5 as a new catalyst in the supercapacitor (SC) anodes. A series of SC anodes with different catalyst loadings were produced. The electrochemical behavior of the SC anodes was calculated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), charge-discharge and cycling test. When test in electrochemical performance, the ratio of PCN:V2O5 is lower than 1:1 and 3D PCN@V2O5 exhibits a lower specific capacity, the ratio of PCN:V2O5 is higher than 1:1 that most of the pores in 3D porous g-C3N4 are covered that reduces the electron transport rate and results in a lower specific capacity. Overall, 3D PCN@V2O5 has higher specific capacity (457 Fg-1 at 0.5 Ag-1) and better cycling performance (approximately 84% after 500 cycles). This attractive performance indicates that 3D PCN@V2O5 could be used as potential electrode materials for supercapacitors.
