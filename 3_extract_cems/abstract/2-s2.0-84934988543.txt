Abstract Layered titanium carbide (Ti<inf>3</inf>C<inf>2</inf>) has been synthesized by exfoliation of ternary carbides Ti<inf>3</inf>AlC<inf>2</inf> and evaluated as working electrodes with different mass loading from 1.8 mg to 7.6 mg. The effect of mass loading on the electrochemical properties of Ti<inf>3</inf>C<inf>2</inf> electrodes was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and impedance spectrum test. With increasing of Ti<inf>3</inf>C<inf>2</inf> mass from 1.8 to 7.6 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> in electrode, the specific capacitance calculated from the CV curves at 2 mV/s decreases at first from 117 to 78 F/g then maintains at 76 F/g, while areal capacitance increases from 211 to 579 mF/cm<sup>2</sup>. Moreover, both electrodes with low mass loading (1.8 mg) and large mass loading (7.6 mg) have delivered good cycling performances with capacitance retention of 97% and 98% after 10000 cycles. These results indicate that large mass loading electrode retains high specific capacitance and good cycling stability, due to the excellent electronic conductivity and layered structure of Ti<inf>3</inf>C<inf>2</inf>.
