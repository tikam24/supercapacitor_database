Elaborately developing metal oxide based core/sheath nanostructures are fascinating approaches to enhance the electrochemical properties of supercapacitors. Herein, we report the growth of hierarchal NiMoO4@CoMoO4 core/sheath nanowire arrays directly on the surface of Ni foam substrate via hydrothermal route and subsequent thermal treatment. Owing to the high utilization of electroactive materials and the efficient ion/electron transport pathways, the resulting binder-free NiMoO4@CoMoO4 electrode achieves a high areal capacitance up to 5.4 F cm−2 at a current density of 2 mA cm−2 and still maintains 3.1 F cm−2 even at 40 mA cm−2. In addition, the all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (NiMoO4@CoMoO4//AC)with PVA/KOH gel electrolyte delivers a superior energy density of 49.3 Wh kg−1 at 630 W kg−1. The exceptional electrochemical performance demonstrates that the NiMoO4@CoMoO4 core/sheath nanowires are promising electroactive materials for advanced supercapacitors.
