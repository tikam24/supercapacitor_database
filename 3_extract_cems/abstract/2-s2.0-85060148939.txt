One-dimensional WO3 microrods are prepared via hydrothermal method and are used as template to prepare three-dimensional WO3/FeOOH composites by means of Fe3+ hydrolysis. The structure, composition and electrochemical properties of the composites are characterized by XRD, XPS, FESEM and electrochemical tests. The results show that WO3/FeOOH composites has excellent electrochemical performance and can be used as materials for supercapacitors. It has a specific capacity of 296.7 F•g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A•g-1, and a capacity of 171.7 F•g-1 at a current density of 10 A•g-1. Its specific capacity retention remains 92.3% after 1, 000 cycles at a current density of 10 A•g-1.
