In order to improve the energy density and optimize the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors, a new double network calcium alginate/polyaniline (CA/PANI) aerogels were designed in this study, in which sodium alginate (SA) cross-linked by Ca2+ was the first network and the phytic acid cross-linked PANI was the second network. Due to the strong hydrogen bonds between PANI and CA, and the ionic cross-linking between CA molecular chains, CA/PANI aerogels can form a stable porous network structure with excellent performance, such as high BET specific surface area (330 m2/g) and high conductivity (2.66 S/cm). The aerogel further used as a supercapacitor electrode showed enhanced capacitive performance (463 F/g at 0.5 A/g). After repeated 10,000 galvanostatic charge/discharge tests, more than 84% of the initial capacitance could be maintained, while the capacitance retention of PANI was only 45%. Therefore, this aerogel showed great potential as an electrode material for supercapacitors.
