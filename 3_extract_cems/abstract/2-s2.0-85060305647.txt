We have built a high-performance supercapacitor anode based on carbon fabric (CF), vertically aligned graphene nanosheets (VAGN) and FeOOH nanorods. This CF/VAGN/FeOOH electrode can charge/discharge at a low potential window (0 to −1.1 V vs. Hg/HgO), and demonstrates a high specific capacitance of 909 F g −1 aided by the unique structure of VAGN. Additionally, we made an all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor by assembling CF/VAGN/FeOOH and CF/Co 3 O 4 electrodes. The asymmetric design broadens the working potential up to 1.7 V, leading to a high energy density of 33 W h kg −1 and a high power density of 26 kW kg −1 . We believe that the CF/VAGN/FeOOH electrode holds great promise for applications in high-performance asymmetric supercapacitors.
