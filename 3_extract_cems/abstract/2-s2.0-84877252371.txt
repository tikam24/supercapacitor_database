Present article is an attempt to develop a method to increase the conductivity of polyaniline (PANi) nanofibers. Nanofibers of MnO2 that have been prepared by a chemical precipitation method were used as the seeds to facilitate the polymerization of aniline and thereby manufacturing of metal-PANi nanofibers. High conductivity and good electrochemical capacitor property was observed for these metal-PANi nanofiber composites against PANi nanofibers. SEM, FT-IR and UV-vis were utilized for characterization of the manufactured composites. The I-V characteristics of samples investigated by two-probe and their resistance were compared. The viability of the composites to be used as an electrode material for supercapacitor application was tested by electrochemical methods. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
