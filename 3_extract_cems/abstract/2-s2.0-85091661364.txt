Supercapacitor energy storage devices recently garnered considerable attention due to their cost-effectiveness, eco-friendly nature, high power density, moderate energy density, and long-term cycling stability. Such figures of merit render supercapacitors unique energy sources to power portable electronic devices. Among various energy storage materials, graphene-related materials have established themselves as ideal electrodes for the development of elite supercapacitors because of their excellent electrical conductivity, high surface area, outstanding mechanical properties combined with the possibility to tailor various physical and chemical properties via chemical functionalization. Increasing the surface area is a powerful strategy to improve the performance of supercapacitors. Here, modified polyhedral oligosilsesquioxane (POSS) is used to improve the electrochemical performance of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) through the enhancement of porosity and the extension of interlayer space between the sheets allowing efficient electrolyte transport. rGO-POSS hybrids exhibited a high specific capacitance of 174 F g-1, power density reaching 2.25 W cm-3, and high energy density of 41.4 mW h cm-3 endowed by the introduction of POSS spacers. Moreover, these electrode materials display excellent durability reaching >98% retention after 5000 cycles.
