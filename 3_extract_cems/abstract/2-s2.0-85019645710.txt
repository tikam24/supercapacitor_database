A three-dimensional (3D) on-chip supercapacitor is fabricated by performing deep-ultraviolet lithography on a SU-8 photoresist. By using a cathodic deposition technique, ripple-like ruthenium oxide-carbon nanotube nanocomposites are synthesized. The carbon nanotube (CNT) network in the nanocomposite makes the electrolyte penetration easier and facilitates proton exchange and diffusion. A specific capacitance of 208.5 mF·cm-2 is achieved at 10 mV·s-1 in a neutral Na2SO4 solution. The interdigitated cell forms a supercapacitor when it is placed on a chip, and exhibits many desirable properties; the specific capacitance of as high as 28.70 mF·cm-2 is achieved at 120 mA·cm-2. The highest energy density (25.99 mJ·cm-2) and the highest power density (46.92 mW·cm-2) are also achieved with the interdigitated micro-supercapacitor. Therefore, 3D microstructures made with electrochemically deposited carbon nanotube composites are promising candidates for application as on-chip supercapacitors.
