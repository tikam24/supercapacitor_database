Employing fuel cell as main source requires increasing and regulating its output voltage. In this paper, flatness based controllers for a hybrid source system, which contains fuel cell (FC) and supercapacitor (SC), are presented. Non-isolated DC/DC converters are used for achieving the hybrid power source and evaluating the performances of the flatness based controllers. The FC is used as the main power source. The SC is employed as auxiliary source to deal with the slow transient response of FC. The limitation of FC current changing rate is taken into account. The hybrid source including the proposed controller is validated by experimental results. Controls of the whole systems are realized by energetic trajectories planning based on flatness properties of the systems.
