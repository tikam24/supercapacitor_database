This paper presents a grid-side inverter based supercapacitor direct integration scheme for wind power systems. The inverter used in this study consists of a conventional two-level inverter and three H-bridge modules. Three supercapacitor banks are directly connected to the dc-links of H-bridge modules. This approach eliminates the need for interfacing dc-dc converters and thus considerably improves the overall efficiency. However, for the maximum utilization of supercapacitors their voltages should be allowed to vary. As a result of this variable voltage space vectors of the hybrid inverter get distributed unevenly. To handle this issue, a modified PWM method and a space vector modulation method are proposed and they can generate undistorted current even in the presence of unevenly distributed space vectors. A supercapacitor voltage balancing method is also presented in this paper. Simulation results are presented to validate the efficacy of the proposed scheme, modulation methods and control techniques.
