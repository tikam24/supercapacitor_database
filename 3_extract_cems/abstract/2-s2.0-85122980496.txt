Here, nickel cobalt oxide micro-flowers (NCO-F) have been prepared by the hydrothermal method for their application as electrode material in supercapacitors. The electrochemical performance of the prepared material has been studied in three different aqueous electrolytes (1 M Na2SO4, 1 M KOH, and 1M Na2SO4 with hydroquinone (Hq) and benzoquinone (Bq) as redox additives). The NCO-F shows maximum specific capacitance in 1 M KOH (470 Fg1) followed by 1 M Na2SO4 with Hq and Bq additives (173 Fg1) and 1 M Na2SO4 (101 Fg1) at the scan rate of 5 mVs1. However, the higher value of energy density and power density is obtained in 1 M Na2SO4 (35.80 Whkg1 at 424 Wkg1). This is because of the higher potential window possessed by NCO-F in 1 M Na2SO4. The results illustrate that the role of the potential window is important which in turn is governed by the type of electrolyte.
