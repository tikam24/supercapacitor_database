Metal sulfides exhibit rich surface chemistry and electrochemical features and their comparison with polyaniline may give a new perspective to supercapacitor applications. Active chromium sulfide nanoparticles and polyaniline nanofibers were synthesized using the solvothermal and polymerization process, respectively. Chromium sulfide nanoparticles reveal a good specific capacitance of 594.38 F/g at the current density of 1 mA/cm2, meanwhile, the polyaniline nanofibers exhibit a maximum specific capacitance of 150 F/g at the current density of 4 mA/cm2, through the galvanostatic charge-discharge profile. The power density of the polyaniline was found 3111 W/Kg, which is greater due to the conductive nature of polyaniline, meanwhile, chromium sulfide nanoparticles also exhibit a reasonable power density of 2403.06 W/Kg. Comparatively, chromium sulfide nanoparticles maintained specific capacitance and power density. The two electrodes asymmetric system exhibits a good coulomb efficiency of 100 % at 1 mA/cm2. So, chromium sulfide nanoparticles exhibit good electrochemical characteristics for supercapacitor applications.
