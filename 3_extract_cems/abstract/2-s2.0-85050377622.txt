In this paper, the power balance DC microgrid system and linear permanent magnet generator (LPMG) is modeled. A control strategy is proposed to keep DC bus voltage stabilization, by combining supercapacitor (SC) with the wave energy generation. The voltage control of DC microgrid is considered as three state patterns separately, to guarantee the power balance under any generator power fluctuations or load changes. Finally, the simulation results are provided to demonstrate the feasibility of the presented control strategy.
