Supercapacitors are an electrochemical component with high-power density and an intermediate energy density between batteries and conventional capacitors. They are characterized by low series resistance, significant equivalent capacitance and long service life. Nowadays, they become an attractive alternative storage device for several applications. However, supercapacitors are subject to degradation due to aging, in addition to other factors, such as temperature and high voltage. Hence, there is a need to understand both electrical and energetic behavior of supercapacitor and to identify its capacitance and resistance during functioning. Such information is important to determine its state of health. Several electric models of supercapacitors, which characterize their real behavior, have been proposed in literature, like RC model. The purpose of this paper is the real-time estimation of RC model parameters, capacity and resistance, using recursive least squares method. The parameter values obtained with this method show a good correlation with real values of capacity and resistance using Maxwell test.
