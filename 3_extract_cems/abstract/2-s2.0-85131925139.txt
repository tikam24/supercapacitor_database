Yarn supercapacitors have attracted significant attention for wearable energy storage due to their ability to be directly integrated with garments. Conducting polymer polypyrrole (PPy) based yarn supercapacitors show limited cycling stability because of the huge volume changes during the charge–discharge processes. In addition, laundering may cause damage to such yarn supercapacitors. Here, the fabrication of PPy-based re-stickable yarn supercapacitors is reported with good cycling stability by employing vapor phase polymerization (VPP) and water-soluble polyethylene oxide (PEO) film as the adhesive layer. VPP duration and cycle are controlled to achieve multi-layered PPy electrodes. The assembled yarn supercapacitors show a good cycling stability with capacitance retention of 79.1% after 5000 charge–discharge cycles. The energy stored in the yarn supercapacitor is sufficient to power a photodetector. After gluing the yarn supercapacitors onto a PEO film, the devices can be stunk on and peeled off the garment to avoid the mechanical stresses during the washing process. Three yarn supercapacitors connected in parallel on PEO film show negative changes in electrochemical performance after 5 sticking-peeling cycles. This work provides a facile way to fabricate PPy-based re-stickable energy storage devices with high cycling stability for smart garments.
