The paper describes metod of energy management in standalone doubly fed induction machine supported by supercapacitor energy storage coupled to the DC link of main back-to-back converter through additional bidirectional DC/DC converter. The main finding presented in the paper are the rules according to which the management of energy in this system is feasible. The implementation of this management presented in the paper, based on PI controllers, is only one way, but the rules that govern the behavior of the system may be adapted to other ways eg. based on fuzzy control.
