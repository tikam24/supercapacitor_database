Functional hydrogels, which are soft and wet materials containing three-dimensional polymeric networks with flexibly tunable functions and properties, provide ideal materials for developing high-perfromance soft supercapacitors. This review summarizes recent progress of functional hydrogel materials for soft supercapacitors with emphasis on the introduction of the design, fabrication and performance enhancement of soft supercapacitors for electrochemical double-layer capacitors and pseudocapacitors. Strategies for enhancing the electrochemical and mechanical properties of supercapacitors are discussed via designing the composition and structures of hydrogels and regulating their performances. Meanwhile, the important roles of the compositional and structural design of hydrogels and their performance regulation in the achievement of function diversity such as self-healing and high anti-freezing properties are analyzed. In the final part, the prospects on the future development of functional-hydrogel-based soft supercapacitors towards the ones with properties such as high energy storage, high flexibility, high water-retention, self-healing, high cold-tolerance and degradability are provided.
