In this study, we fabricate polypyrrole(PPy)/functionalized-multiwalled carbon nanotubes (FM) composites (PPy/FM) by cyclic voltammetry onto the stainless steel mesh (MS) which is modified by FM before use. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results show that MS-PPy/FM composites form core (MWCNTs)-shell (PPy) structures via hydrogen bond. The electrochemical performances were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS). Electrochemical tests demonstrate that, at the current density of 5 mA cm−1, MS-PPy/FM composites show a larger specific capacitance of 1269 F g−1 when the addition amount of FM is 0.8%, and the capacitance retention of MS-PPy/FM is 88.1% after 1000 cycles. All the electrochemical properties of the composites are better than those of PPy.
