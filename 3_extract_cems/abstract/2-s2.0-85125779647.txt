The purpose of this investigation was the development of a new colloidal route for the fabrication of Mn3 O4 electrodes for supercapacitors with enhanced charge storage performance. Mn3 O4-carbon nanotube electrodes were fabricated with record-high capacitances of 6.67 F cm−2 obtained from cyclic voltammetry tests at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 and 7.55 F cm−2 obtained from the galvanostatic charge–discharge tests at a current density of 3 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M Na2 SO4 electrolyte in a potential window of 0.9 V. The approach involves the use of murexide as a capping agent for the synthesis of Mn3 O4 and a co-dispersant for Mn3 O4 and carbon nanotubes. Good electrochemical performance of the electrode material was achieved at a high active mass loading of 40 mg cm−2 and was linked to a reduced agglomeration of Mn3 O4 nanoparticles and efficient co-dispersion of Mn3 O4 with carbon nanotubes. The mechanisms of murexide adsorption on Mn3 O4 and carbon nanotube are discussed. With the proposed method, the time-consuming electrode activation procedure for Mn3 O4 electrodes can be avoided. The approach developed in this investigation paves the way for the fabrication of advanced cathodes for asymmetric supercapacitors and multifunctional devices, combining capacitive, magnetic, and other functional properties.
