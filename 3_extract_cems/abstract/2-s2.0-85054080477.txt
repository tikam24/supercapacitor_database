The renewable energies are growing faster today due to advancement in technology. The wind energy is likely to be more widespread as it is a clean energy, but the extraction of energy from wind turbine at standalone mode is difficult task because random variation of wind speed leads to fluctuating torque of the wind turbine generator resulting in voltage and frequency excursions. This paper presents the importance of storage system for standalone wind turbine system, it consists of Unitron Wind Turbine, Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator [PMSG] a hybrid energy storage system consisting of lead acid battery and supercapacitor and it is modeled in Matlab/Simulink. The main objective of this paper is to develop a hybrid energy storage system to improve the performance of battery, a control algorithm is written for battery and supercapacitor to manage the power between them. For variable wind data performance of lead acid battery and supercapacitor is studied by considering hourly and monthly wind data collected from 1-6-2017 to 30-6-2017 from wind mast situated at BEC Energy Park Bagalkot. simulation studies carried shows that supercapacitor improve the performance of lead acid battery.
