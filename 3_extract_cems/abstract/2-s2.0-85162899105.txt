Porous organic polymers (POPs) with high physiochemical stability and pseudocapacitive activity are crucial for supercapacitors with high specific capacitance and long cycle life. We report herein a hexaazatrinaphthylene-based POP (HPOP-1) for high-performance supercapacitor by introducing redox-active hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATN) moiety through Sonogashira–Hagihara coupling reaction. HATN moiety can undergo a proton-induced electron transfer redox reaction, which endows HPOP-1 with high pseudocapacitive activity. As electrode materials for supercapacitor application, HPOP-1 exhibits high specific capacitance (667 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1) and long-term cyclic stability (90% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles at 5 A g−1) in a three-electrode system with 1 M H2SO4 as the electrolyte. In addition, HPOP-1 also exhibits a specific capacitance of 376 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in 1 M KOH electrolyte. An asymmetric supercapacitor was further fabricated with HPOP-1 as negative electrode and rGO as positive electrode, respectively. The device delivers a specific capacitance of 63 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and a rate performance of 37 F g−1 at 5 A g−1. Our work provides a facile approach for the design and preparation of pseudocapacitive POPs with high specific capacitance and long cycle life.
