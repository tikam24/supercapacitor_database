The large electric resistance among adjacent layers limits the applications of MoS2 in energy storage and conversion. In this work, dual-ion intercalated MoS2 is successfully synthesized with inserts of Na+ and NH4 + by a facile hydrothermal method. With the assistance of Na+, the specific capacitance of single NH4 + inserted MoS2 can be significantly enhanced from 568 to 760 F•g-1 at 1 A•g-1. Moreover, the dual-ion intercalated MoS2 also exhibits good rate capability. A possible improvement mechanism is also discussed, which can be attributed to the increased content of 1T phase and larger distance among adjacent layers.
