Electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs), also known as supercapacitors, have received growing attention because they can achieve a higher energy density than conventional capacitors and provide a better power density than batteries. The performance of supercapacitors depends predominantly on the properties of their electrode materials. Carbon nanofibers prepared via the technique of electrospinning followed by the thermal stabilization and carbonization have been actively explored as innovative electrode materials for supercapacitors due to their unique morphological structure of freestanding nanofiber mats with controllable fiber diameters. Nonetheless, the most common source today to develop carbon nanofibers from electrospinning is polyacrylonitrile (PAN) which is derived from non-renewable petroleum. We are still lack access to high performance electrode materials from sustainable sources. In this research, sustainable carbon nanofiber mats with mechanical flexibility were prepared by electrospinning aqueous mixtures of alkali lignin (a natural product) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) into composite nanofiber mats along with subsequent thermal-stabilization and carbonization of the precursor mats in air and in inert environment, respectively. Morphological and structural properties as well as specific surface area, total pore volume, average pore size, and pore size distribution of the lignin-based carbon nanofiber mats were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy(TEM), and nitrogen sorption measurements, respectively. Electrochemical performance (i.e., capacitive behavior) of these lignin-based carbon nanofiber mats was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The alkali lignin-based carbon nanofiber mats demonstrated outstanding performance as freestanding and binder-free electrode materials for supercapacitors.
