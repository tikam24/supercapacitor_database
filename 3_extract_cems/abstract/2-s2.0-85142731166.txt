In order to solve the problem that it is difficult to install emergency battery with limited space on some flight planes, a micro emergency power supply based on super capacitor was designed in combination with the good energy storage characteristics of super capacitor. The selection calculation of capacitor and the design process of main control module and charge and discharge module are discussed in detail. In the laboratory environment, a small airborne test system was built to carry out verification experiments. The results show that the device meets the basic requirements of the system for backup power supply, and has the advantage of taking up less space and avoiding maintenance, which provides a new choice for the backup power supply selection of the future in-flight test system.
