Supercapacitors are characterized by a long service lifetime and high power density, which can meet the instantaneous high-power demand during the acceleration of electric vehicles. In this study, a fractional-order model is developed to simulate the polarization effect and charging/discharging characteristics of supercapacitors, considering the precision of the electrochemical model and the amount of calculation of the equivalent circuit model and using the adaptive genetic algorithm to identify the parameters. The accurate prediction of the state of charge (SOC) can improve efficiency, prolong the service lifetime, and ensure the safety of supercapacitors. This study proposes a multi-innovation unscented Kalman filter algorithm based on the fractional-order model to improve the SOC estimation accuracy. The proposed algorithm is compared with other algorithms and analyzed under different temperatures and operating conditions to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in estimating the SOC and tracking the terminal voltage. Experimental results show that the root mean squared error and mean absolute error of the proposed algorithm are less than those of the other algorithms. The proposed algorithm accurately estimates the SOC and tracks the terminal voltage. The maximum root mean squared error and mean absolute error of SOC estimation error are 1.8% and 1.78%, respectively.
