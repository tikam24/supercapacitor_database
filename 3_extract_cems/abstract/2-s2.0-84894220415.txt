One-dimensional (1D) ZnCo2O4 porous nanotubes (PNTs) have been synthesized using a simple technique of electrospinning followed by calcination in air and firstly applied in supercapacitors (SCs). The obtained ZnCo2O4 nanomaterial displays 1D architecture with a highly porous nature and hollow interiors. This unique structure significantly enlarged the electroactive surface areas of the ZnCo2O4, leading to better electrolyte/electrode contact, more efficient transport pathways and good strain accommodation. Our experimental results demonstrate that it exhibits a high specific capacitance of 770 F g-1 at 10 A g-1, excellent rate property (84% of the capacity retention at 60 A g-1) and good cycling stability of only 10.5% loss after 3000 cycles. Compared with the ZnCo2O4 nanoparticals, such obtained PNTs possess enhanced rate and capacitive properties. Our work confirms the as-prepared ZnCo2O4 PNTs can serve as advanced SCs materials. It is highly expected this simple method of electrospinning can be extended to prepare other superior electrochemical materials. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
