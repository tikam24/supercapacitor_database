In this report, a simple and facile method was developed for preparation of MnO2 nanowires by calcinations of MnOOH nanowires previously synthesized under hydrothermal conditions, using hexamethylenetetramine as a reducing agent, without any template. The as-prepared MnO2 nanowires displayed an enhanced specific capacitance (262.7 F g-1) and good cycling stability (e.g., no loss within 1,500 cycles), showing good electrochemical performances as electrode material for supercapacitors.
