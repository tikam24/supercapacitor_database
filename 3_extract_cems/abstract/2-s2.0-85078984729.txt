Here, we report the synthesis of hollow porous gold nanoparticles-decorated reduced graphene oxide (HPAuNPs/RGO) nanocomposites and their electrochemical performances as active electrode material for supercapacitors. Accordingly, the HPAuNPs were first prepared using a simple solution phase template method according to the modified literature procedure, and the size control of hollow porous gold particles was achieved by varying the concentration of hydroquinone used as the reducing agent. Then, the surface of the RGO nanosheets was decorated with HPAuNPs through the self-assembly approach. The structural and morphological features of synthesized nanoparticles and nanocomposites were evaluated by spectroscopic and morphologic methods. Also, the electrochemical supercapacitive performances of the HPAuNPs/RGO/GC nanocomposite electrodes as both cathode and anode materials were analyzed in Na2SO4 solution using electrochemical methods. As a control sample, the RGO/GC electrode was also examined under identical experimental conditions. The results indicate that the composite materials display higher specific capacitances (107â€“325 F/g) compared with bare RGO (55 and 37 F/g) at a potential scan rate of 20 mV/s. Furthermore, it is obtained that the specific capacitances of the composite electrodes based on hollow porous gold nanoparticles are larger than those of previously reported supercapacitors with spherical gold nanoparticles/graphene as electrode materials. The improved electrochemical properties of the HPAuNPs/RGO/GC nanocomposite electrodes can be ascribed to the hollow and porous structure of the gold particles on RGO sheets.
