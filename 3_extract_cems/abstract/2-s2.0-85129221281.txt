Aqueous electrolytes show the potential of application for high-performance supercapacitors. However, their limited operating voltages set limits for widespread applications. Herein, the feasibility of applying the sulfolane (SL)-saturated 3 m LiTFSI aqueous electrolytes for supercapacitors is shown. These electrolytes possess high conductivities and wide electrochemical stable windows (ESWs), demonstrating the potential applications in high-voltage supercapacitors. Activated carbon//3 m LiTFSI SL/Water //activated carbon supercapacitor is assembled to possess a high voltage of 2.5 V and outstanding capacitive performance (106 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, >10 000 cycles). Also, a high areal capacitance up to 1.52 F cm−2 is obtained by applying a high mass loading electrode (13.06 mg cm−2). Furthermore, a flexible symmetric semi-solid-state supercapacitor (2.5 V) is fabricated. Impressive performance can be obtained. Thus, the finding suggests a promising electrolyte design for high-voltage aqueous supercapacitors.
