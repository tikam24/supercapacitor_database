In this paper, we investigate an event-based protection scheme for a multiterminal dc power system, which includes hybrid energy resources and various loading schemes. The proposed protection scheme transfers less data when compared with commonly used data-based protection methods, and does not require high-speed communication and synchronization. Each protection unit is able to autonomously identify the type of event using the current derivative fault identification method, employing an artificial inductive line impedance. In order to accurately set the protection relays, detailed fault current analysis considering low pass resistor capacitor filter effects are presented. The decision for fault isolation is made based on the unit judgment and the data received through high-level data communication from other interconnected units. The performance of the proposed protection scheme was evaluated under different dc feeder and bus faults. The results show that this scheme is able to accurately identify the type of fault, isolate the faulted area, and restore the system quickly while limiting the load voltage drop to its preset limit.
