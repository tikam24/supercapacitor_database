The aim of the paper has always been to explore the possibility of constructing new electronics devices based on Au/CNT/TiO2/SiO2/p-Si/Al multi-layers structure highlighting the appearance of negative dielectric constant (ϵ′) and dielectric loss tangent (ϵ′) at low frequencies in the range 5000-10 Hz. We have investigated the structural, electrical, and dielectric properties of this structure using different techniques like SEM, XRD pattern, Raman spectroscopy, I-V, and C-V measurements. At various temperatures, frequencies, and voltages, we present a detailed analysis of the dielectric constant and dielectric loss tangent. The highest dielectric constant combined with the lowest dielectric loss tangent would improve the use of Au/CNT/TiO2/SiO2/p-Si/Al structures in various electronic applications such as diodes, energy storage, and supercapacitor devices. In this study, the maximum dielectric constant values were around 4000, with dielectric loss tangents ranging from 0.08 to 0.32 at high and mid-frequency ranging from (2 107 - 105 Hz). The Col-Col diagram of ϵ′ as a function of ϵ′ of Au/CNT/TiO2/SiO2/p-Si/Al was also investigated.
