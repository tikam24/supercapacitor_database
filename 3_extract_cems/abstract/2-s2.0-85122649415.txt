For supercapacitors, high self-discharge rate is an inevitable issue that causes fast decay of cell voltage and loss of stored energy. Designing supercapacitors with suppressed self-discharge for long-term energy storage has been a challenge. In this work, we demonstrate that substantially reduced self-discharge rate can be achieved by using highly concentrated electrolytes. Specifically, when supercapacitors with 14 M LiCl electrolyte are charged to 0.80 V, the open circuit voltage (OCV) drops to 0.65 V in 24 h. In stark contrast, when the electrolyte concentration is reduced to 1 M, the OCV drops from 0.80 to 0.65 V within only 0.3 h, which was 80 times faster than that with 14 M LiCl. Decreased OCV decay rate at high electrolyte concentration is also confirmed for supercapacitors with different electrolytes (e.g., LiNO3) or at higher charging voltages (1.60 V). The slow self-discharge in highly concentrated electrolyte can be largely attributed to impeded electron transfer between the electrodes and electrolyte due to the formation of hydration clusters and reduced amount of free water molecules, thereby faradaic reactions that cause fast self-discharge are reduced. Our study not only supports the newly revised model about the formation of electric double layer with the inclusion of electron transfer, but also points a direction for substantially reducing the self-discharge rate of supercapacitors.
