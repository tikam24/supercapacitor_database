Few layer graphene was formed on the surface of Ni foam using the chemical vapor deposition technique, which effectively decreased flaws and inhibited stack of graphene. The CoS nanorods were synthesized on the surface of bare Ni foam after hydrothermal method, while graphen on Ni foam facilitated to form CoS nanowires with porosity surface structure and large specific surface area. The CoS nanowires on Ni foam coated with graphene showed an high specific capacitance of 1506 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 88.2% capacity retention at a current density of 1 A g−1 after 5000 cycles charge-discharge test. The improved electronic conductivity of current collector Ni foam by graphene and porous microstructure of CoS nanowires catalyzed by graphene enhanced significantly supercapacitors performance. This was attributed to large CoS nanowires electrode-electrolyte contact area and reduced volume change during the charge-discharge process.
