In past decades, the performance of supercapacitors has been greatly improved by rationalizing the electrode materials at the nanoscale. However, there is still a lack of understanding on how the charges are efficiently stored in the electrodes or transported across the electrolyte/electrode interface. As it is very challenging to investigate the ion-involved physical and chemical processes with single experiment or computation, combining advanced analytic techniques with electrochemical measurements, i.e., developing in-situ characterizations, have shown considerable prospect for the better understanding of behaviors of ions in electrodes for supercapacitors. Herein, we briefly review several typical in-situ techniques and the mechanisms these techniques reveal in charge storage mechanisms specifically in supercapacitors. Possible strategies for designing better electrode materials are also discussed.
