Nitrogen-doped graphene (NG)-supported Fe3O4 nanoparticle composites were prepared via a facile solvothermal and calcination process. The experimental results showed that the Fe3O4 nanoparticles were evenly embedded in the surface of NG without agglomeration and that pyrrolic N was the main N binding form in NG. The as-prepared Fe3O4@NG composites displayed a good specific capacitance of 244.3F/g at a current density of 1A/g. Furthermore, the Fe3O4/NG composites exhibited a low capacitance loss after 1000 cycles.
