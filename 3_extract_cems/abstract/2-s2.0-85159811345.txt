We have synthesized the hierarchical FeCo-MIL-88 (FC-MOF) derived CoFe2O4 and NiMn2O4 (CFO@NMO) composite using a hydrothermal route. The combination and formation process were presented. The prepared composite of CFO@NMO is studied using XRD, XPS, FESEM with EDS, HRTEM, and nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherm. The formation of composite with CoFe2O4 (CFO) and NiMn2O4 (NMO) may effectively boost the conductivity thereby enhance the performance of electrochemical activity. Benefitting from the formation of composite, the hybrid CFO@NMO electrode achieved a high specific capacity (i.e., 353.6 mAh/g), 86.1 % retention in capacity after 5000 galvanostatic charging and discharging (GCD) cycles. To utilize the advantages of ultra-long cycling stability and high specific capacity, the aqueous electrolyte-based hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) device with AC//NF as a negative electrode and CFO@NMO//NF as a positive electrode was fabricated. The assembled HSC device provided a specific capacitance 312.8 F/g, 88.4 % retention in capacitance after 10,000 GCD cycles along with high energy density (90.3 Wh/kg) and power density (12.9 kW/kg). An easy and cost-effective preparation of CFO@NMO composite with outstanding supercapacitor performance demonstrates an excessive potential for utilization in the near future.
