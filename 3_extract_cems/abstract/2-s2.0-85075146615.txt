Carbon based composite materials have gained much attention because of fulfilling desirable properties for supercapacitor application. In the featured work, the thin film of Bi2S3:PbS solid solution has been synthesized on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) by simple successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. The nanoparticle morphology provides sufficient electroactive channels for electrolyte ions to penetrate during electrochemical activities. The composite exhibits superior specific capacitance 676 F/g at constant specific current density of 5.56 A/g with fast charge-discharge cycles. In association of energy storage characteristics, the fabricated symmetric cell exhibits excellent energy density of 13.36 Wh/kg by acquiring power density of 0.83 kW/kg. The superior results of the hybrid electrode promise a novel direction for high performance supercapacitor application.
