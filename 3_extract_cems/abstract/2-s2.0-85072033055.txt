The widely accepted theory concerning the electrochemical energy storage mechanism of copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) for supercapacitors is that CuHCF stores charge by the reversible redox processes of Fe3+/Fe2+ couple and Cu cations are electrochemically inactive. In this work, CuHCF nanocubes (CuHCF-NC) were synthesized in the presence of potassium citrate and its electrochemical properties were tentatively studied in 1 mol/L Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. Good supercapacitive performance was exhibited. The combined analyses of cyclic voltammogram (CV) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) disclosed that the CuHCF nanocubes underwent the redox reactions of Fe3+/Fe2+ and Cu2+/Cu+ couples to store charges. The Cu2+/Cu+ redox couple was activated due to the strong coordination interaction between the carboxylate groups of citrate ions and surface Cu cations.
