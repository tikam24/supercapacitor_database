Supercapacitors have been widely studied around the world in recent years, due to their excellent power density and long cycle life. As the most frequently used electrode materials for supercapacitors, carbonaceous materials attract more and more attention. However, their relatively low energy density still holds back the widespread application. Up to now, various strategies have been developed to figure out this problem. This research news summarizes the recent advances in improving the supercapacitor performance of carbonaceous materials, including the incorporation of heteroatoms and the pore size effect (subnanopores' contribution). In addition, a new class of carbonaceous materials, porous organic networks (PONs) has been managed into the supercapacitor field, which promises great potential in not only improving the supercapacitor performances, but also unraveling the related mechanisms. Three representative strategies for the development of carbon-based supercapacitors are outlined in this Research News in combination with recent progress, including the incorporation of heteroatom-containing functionalities, construction of subnanopores, and exploitation of new synthesis formulas. The elaborate coupling of heteroatom-containing functionalities, subnanopores, and new synthetic approaches holds great potential in advancing the performances of carbon-based supercapacitors.
