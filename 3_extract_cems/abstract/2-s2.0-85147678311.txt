The article considers a power reservation system for high-voltage consumers based on supercapacitor storage. The relevance of the topic is due to the requirement to improve the reliability of power supply for process units in the petrochemical industry through the use of an energy storage system. The power supply system includes 35/6 kV lines and transformers, 6 kV consumers in the form of a load motor and an energy storage system. The energy storage system consists of a supercapacitor bank, a three-phase voltage inverter with a control system, and a 6/0.4 kV step-up transformer. The article provides a method for determining the capacity and power of storage devices, as well as oscillograms of the load voltage in various emergency modes of the power supply system: power outage, voltage dip, operation of automatic reserve input in case of a short circuit. As a result of the research, it has been shown that the power backup system for high-voltage consumers based on supercapacitor storage is effective for maintaining stable consumer operation modes.
