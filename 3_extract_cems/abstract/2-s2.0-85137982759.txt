Integration of renewable energies, particularly wind and PV, with energy storage systems in microgrids and electric vehicles has gained tremendous attention worldwide. To maintain a power balance between the load demand and power generation, an energy management system plays an important role. Keeping this in view, a neuro-fuzzy-based energy management system has been presented in this paper for charging the electric vehicles with microgrids having PV-FC as renewable energies and battery-supercapacitor as an energy storage system. The findings of this paper present a bi-directional flow of grid power showing that the power is either taken or provided to the grid depending upon the load demand and generated power which fulfills the goal of the designed energy management approach.
