In this paper, a method to cope with short-term interruption is proposed. The proposed method uses a capacitor bank consisting of supercapacitors. A supercapacitor is a good means for energy storage for short-term usage. The proposed circuit is simple and accordingly easy to construct and to control. A prototype of 360 W single-phase PFC ac-dc converter is constructed and experimental results are presented.
