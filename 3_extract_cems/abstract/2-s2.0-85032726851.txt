This paper concentrates on the problem of control of a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) for an improved and optimized operation of load-frequency control applications. The HESS consists of a supercapacitor serving as the main power source and a fuel cell serving as the auxiliary power source. First, a Hammerstein-type neural network is proposed to identify the HESS, which formulates the Hammerstein model with a nonlinear static gain in cascade with a linear dynamic block. It provides the model information for the controller to achieve the adaptive performance. Second, a feedforward neural network based on a back-propagation training algorithm is designed to formulate the proportional-integral-derivative (PID)-type neural network, which is used for the adaptive control of the HESS. Meanwhile, a dynamic antiwindup signal is designed to solve the operational constraint of the HESS. Then, an appropriate power reference signal for the HESS can be generated. Third, the stability and the convergence of the whole system are proved based on the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, simulation experiments are followed through on a four-area interconnected power system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.
