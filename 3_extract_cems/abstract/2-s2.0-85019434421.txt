Nickel nanowire foams are primarily synthesized by the calcination of dimethylglyoxime nickel microfibers in Ar gas. Moreover, mesoporous nickel hydroxide-nickel nanohybrids are successfully obtained via oxidation of Ni nanowire foams in an alkaline H2O2 aqueous solution. Due to the mesoporous structure of nickel hydroxide and the high conductivity of the central Ni metal, electrodes assembled with nickel hydroxide-nickel nanohybrids show a highly accessible surface-interface site and high conductivity, and are successfully applied as high-performance supercapacitor electrodes.
