This proposes a novel ZVZCS hybrid bidirectional DC-DC converter based on fuel cells and supercapacitor devices. The described converter employs only one high frequency transformers to couple the half-bridge and full-bridge circuits together in the primary side and voltage doubler circuit in secondary side. Boost type converter can limit the output ripple current of the fuel cells; All the primary side switches can turn on under zero-voltage-switching(ZVS) condition and turn off under zero current switching (ZCS) due to the existence of auxiliary switch in boost mode and transformer secondary side switches can turn on under zero voltage switching(ZVS). With the proposed ZVZCS concept, the MATLAB simulation results of the application of fuel cell and supercapacitor have been obtained and these results of the simulations confirm the feasibility and effective performance of the proposed converter topology.
