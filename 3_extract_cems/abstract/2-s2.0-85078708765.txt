Hybrid energy storage systems (HESS) are often used in stand-alone power supply systems in order to conform fluctuations of electric energy generation and its consumption. In this work, bidirectional power supply system with battery/supercapacitor HESS based on a new topology of a two-way modular multilevel DC-DC converter of triangular structure was proposed. This topology is marked by high-boost and at the same time sufficiently simple due to the non-isolated configuration. Conducted investigation shows that only one SC pack must have a sufficient capacitance, but other SC packs may be low capacity. The capacitances of these SC packs depend from the power of one module of multilevel DC-DC converter and from the allowable error of DC bus voltage regulation. Because of significant nonlinearity and interconnection of the boost DC-DC converters, the passivity based control (PBC) approach was used. Effectiveness of the obtained control lows was demonstrated by the results of conducted simulation.
