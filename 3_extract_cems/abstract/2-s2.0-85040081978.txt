Freestanding N-doped carbon coated Fe3O4 particles nanocomposites with three dimensional (3D) carbon fibers network (NC@Fe3O4/CF) derived from bacterial cellulose (BC) was fabricated by simple hydrothermal and carbonization. This self-supporting structure, as promising electrode without current collector or conductive additive, showed high area capacitance and volume capacitance (1.36 F·cm− 2, 2300 F·cm− 3 at 3 mA·cm− 2). Simultaneous, the electrode showed good cycle life (88.5% capacitance retention over 4000 cycles) and wide potential window (− 1.2 to 0 V), possessed the property of pseudo and carbon materials. This low-cost, non-toxic and high capacity freestanding electrode is a potential candidate for supercapacitor applications.
