Doubly fed induction machines, wound field synchronous machines and DC homopolar machines all require a slip ring connection to the rotor conductors. This connection inherently limits the performance and/or lifespan of these machines. Noncontact methods, such as brushless exciters and high frequency wireless power transfer, have been used to support some of these machines types but can be physically large and/or overly reliant on power electronics. Additionally, these methods do not support the cooling of the rotor conductors since they are purely electrical structures. This paper proposes a rotating electric double layer capacitor, or supercapacitor, to form a noncontact, slip-ring-like, AC electrical connection between the stator and rotor while simultaneously providing a rotor cooling platform. Here, a double layer capacitor is formed between a hydrostatic bronze bushing and the rotating shaft via flowing electrolytic liquid. The flowing electrolyte also serves as a heat transfer mechanism to remove heat from the shaft. Experimental results demonstrate increases in coupling capacitance and throughput A/Hz over prior work by factors of 100,000 and 100, respectively. The ability to simultaneously cool the shaft is demonstrated and measured as well.
