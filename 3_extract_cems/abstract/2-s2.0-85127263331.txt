Sea balls (pillae marinae) were impregnated with diammonium hydrogen phosphate (DAHP), carbonized, and activated using carbon dioxide or steam. Thus, activated carbon fibers (ACFs) with unique morphology and specific surfaces of 243 m2 g-1 were produced. These ACFs were studied as electrode materials for supercapacitors that achieved specific capacities of 38 F g-1 in an organic electrolyte, resulting in specific energy for the supercapacitor of 9.7 W h kg-1
