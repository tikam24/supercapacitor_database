Nowadays in modern industrial applications, such as electric vehicles, space stations, energy harvesting systems, etc., where the power supply efficiency is more important than the output noise performance, DC-DC converters are widely used in order to satisfy the requirements. The efficiency and performance behavior depend on correct parameter estimation for circuits design and operation, where traditional design methodologies cannot ensure an optimal solution regarding the output performance. Nevertheless, component selection and precise estimation of parameters can improve the converter's performance, leading to smaller and more efficient designs. This work, presents and optimization methodology based in a metaheuristic algorithm inspired on earthquakes, for parameter estimation and component selection, using the inductance selection in a non-inverting buck-boost DC-DC converter, designed as supercapacitor charger as a case study. Results validate the proposed algorithm and its implementation selecting optimum inductor value, improving the performance in transitory response with a smaller inductance, also leading to better design and implementation capabilities.
