In the current study, biological sludge generated from petrochemical industries was first used to prepare nitrogen-doped carbon materials via an one-step carbonization and activation method using ZnCl2 as an activation agent. Then, a novel polymer binder-free nano-composited electrode was fabricated using the prepared activated biological sludge as active material and carbon nanotube as binder as well as conductive agent. The effect of carbon nanotube loading on the capacitor performance was systematically evaluated in KOH electrolyte. The morphology, structure and surface properties of the carbon materials were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, N2 adsorption, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Due to the synergistic effect of N,O-doped species of activated biological sludge and the interaction between activated biological sludge and carbon nanotube, the nano-composited electrode at 10% of carbon nanotube loading shows a good capacitive performance, with capacity of up to 281.7 F/g in 6 M KOH electrolyte, and an acceptable cycle life with a relative high capacitance value of 254.1 F/g after 2000 cycles. This strategy provides an effective method of developing high-performance electrode material derived from industrial bio-waste for energy storage application.
