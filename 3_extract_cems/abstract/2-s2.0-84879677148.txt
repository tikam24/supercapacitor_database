Potassium vapor was used to longitudinally split vertically aligned multiwalled carbon nanotubes carpets (VA-CNTs). The resulting structures have a carpet of partially split MWCNTs and graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). The split structures were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. When compared to the original VA-CNTs carpet, the split VA-CNTs carpet has enhanced electrochemical performance with better specific capacitance in a supercapacitor. Furthermore, the split VA-CNTs carpet has excellent cyclability as a supercapacitor electrode material. There is a measured maximum power density of 103 kW/kg at an energy density of 5.2 Wh/kg and a maximum energy density of 9.4 Wh/kg. The superior electrochemical performances of the split VA-CNTs can be attributed to the increased surface area for ion accessibility after splitting, and the lasting conductivity of the structure with their vertical conductive paths based on the preserved GNR alignment.
