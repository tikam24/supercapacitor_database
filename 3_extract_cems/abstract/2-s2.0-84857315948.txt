The electropolymerization of 3,4-(2,2-dibutylpropylenedioxy)thiophene (ProDOT-Bu 2) onto single carbon fiber microelectrode (SCFME) was conducted in acetonitrile (ACN) containing sodium perchlorate (NaClO 4) as electrolyte and investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The nanostructured films of poly[3,4-(2,2-dibutyl-propylenedioxy)thiophene] (PProDOT-Bu 2) which were depositing showed complete reversible redox behavior in monomer-free electrolyte solution. The capacitive behavior of the films was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at applied potentials from 0.1 V to 1.3 V. The analysis by equivalent circuit modeling revealed an applied potential around 0.4 V to be most suitable for the system PProDOT-Bu 2/SCFME as a double layer supercapacitor component inducing a double layer capacitance C dl value of 62 mF cm -2.
