Polyaniline–few-layer molybdenum disulfide nanocomposite (PANI–MoS2) has been synthesized by in situ polymerization of aniline over MoS2 using HCl as the dopant. X-ray crystallographic studies show the characteristic peaks of few-layered MoS2 in the PANI matrix. The changes in Raman and UV–Vis spectra have proved that there are definite interactions between PANI and few-layer MoS2.PANI–MoS2 nanocomposite as an electrode material for supercapacitor exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 687 Fg−1 at a scan rate of 5 mVs−1 using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and a Csp of 612 Fg−1 at a current density of 0.2 Ag−1 using chronopotentiometry (CP). Further, the material also exhibits a high energy density of 128 Wh kg−1with a maximum power density of 9.8 kW kg−1 and a tremendous cyclic stability with 93% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles. These superior electrochemical results over bare PANI and MoS2 showed the PANI–MoS2 nanocomposites to be a capable electrode material for energy storage systems.
