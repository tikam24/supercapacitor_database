MoS2/CoS2 binary composites with different raw material ratios was prepared by a facile one-step hydrothermal process as electrode material for supercapacitors. Results of electrochemical performance show that MoS2/CoS2 binary composites exhibit the highest specific capacitance (549 F/g at 2 mV/s or 434 F/g at 1 A/g) and excellent cycling stability as the molar ratio of Mo:Co is 2:1 in raw materials. And microstructure and morphology analyses reveal that the MoS2/CoS2 binary composites are composed of octahedron-shaped CoS2 and flower-liked MoS2. Above all, due to the coupling of two components, large surface areas and tunable composition, the obtained MoS2/CoS2 binary composite electrodes possess the best electrochemical properties.
