MnCo2O4, a cubic structured spinel compound, was successfully synthesized (at 550 °C/4h) using a novel sonochemical route utilizing the power of indirect microwave heating for phase formation. MnCo2O4 displayed good supercapacitive performance, exhibiting a specific capacitance of 190.2 F/g at 2 mVs, with energy and power densities of 2.7 Wh/kg and 540 W/kg, respectively. A semiconducting to metallic phase transition was found from its temperature-dependent conductivity behaviour at 423 K, with the activation energy of 0.156 eV, and band conduction at higher temperatures. Also, MCO exhibited excellent conductivity ranging between 7 × 10−3 to 1.1 × 101 Scm−1, significantly higher than the earlier reported.
