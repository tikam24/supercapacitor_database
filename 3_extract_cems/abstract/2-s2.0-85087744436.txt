Microsupercapacitors, as an energy storage device, have unique electrochemical performance, such as high power density, fast charging, long cycle life, and high safety. The reduction time and cost in fabrication processes of microsupercapacitors are important factors in microfabrication technology. In this work, a simple, scalable, and cost-effective fabrication of interdigitated reduced graphene oxide@polyaniline flexible microsupercapacitors is presented. We found that in fabricating the interdigitated microelectrode patterns on PET substrate; the reduction of graphene oxide and growth of conducting polymer are rapidly performed simultaneously in one step by laser irradiation. The capacitance was 72 mF/cm2 at a 35 Î¼A/cm2 current density. These high-capacitance microsupercapacitors demonstrate good stability and more than 93.5% of the capacitance is retained after 1000 cycles at a 0.7 mA/cm2 current density.
