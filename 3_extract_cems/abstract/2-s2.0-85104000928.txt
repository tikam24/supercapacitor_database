In this work, honeycomb-like Yb-doped V2O5 ⋅ nH2O binder-free thin film electrodes are synthesized via a simple and convenient sol-gel method. Benefiting from the synergy of V2O5 ⋅ nH2O and rare-earth metal ion Yb3+, thin-layer honeycomb-like morphology formed upon the introduction of Yb3+ into the V2O5 ⋅ nH2O, which markedly promotes the electrochemical performance of the V2O5 ⋅ H2O thin-film electrode. After the condition optimization, 8 % Yb−V2O5 ⋅ H2O exhibits superior electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 703 F g−1 (at 1 A g−1) and outstanding cycling stability. Besides, owing to the ultra-high conductivity of oxide super-P (OSP) nanoparticles, the V2O5 ⋅ H2O@OSP-4 binder-free film electrode shows a high specific capacitance of 627 F g−1, which was prepared by the same simple sol-gel strategy. The assembled 8 % Yb−V2O5 ⋅ nH2O//V2O5 ⋅ nH2O@OSP-4 device delivers a high specific energy density and excellent cycling stability. This study may have certain inspirations for the fabrication of thin-film electrodes for high-efficiency energy storage systems.
