To solve the problem of response delay in eletrolyzer and fuel cell of wind power coupled with hydrogen system, we proposed a dc-coupled structure system with wind generator, fuel cell, electrolyzer and supercapacitor According to the characteristics of fuel cell, electrolyzer and supercapacitor, we put forward a control strategy of energy management. Based on the proposed control strategy, the fuel cell and electrolyzer can gradually compensate/consume the difference between the power generated by wind turbines and the power required by load. Meanwhile, the supercapacitor can quickly smooth unbalance power caused by the response delay of fuel cell and electrolyzer, and ensure that the power output of hybrid system is consistent with load demand. Matlab/Simulink simulation results verify the effectiveness of the control strategy of hybrid grid-connected system of wind and hydrogen. The proposed control strategy improves the absorption capacity of wind power and reduces the grid connected power fluctuation.
