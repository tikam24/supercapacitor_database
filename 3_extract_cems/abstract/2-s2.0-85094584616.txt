Progressive depletion of energy resources and large-scale detrimental environmental hazards such as global warming, pollution, climate changes and others have caused an alarming concern among scientists, policymakers and public globally in finding possible solutions to the current crisis. This has led the scientific community from multidisciplinary fields to focus their research on studying minutely the key aspects of this change and systematically identify productive strategies for inhibiting or moderating any possible catastrophic events. Several concerted efforts are being carried out in terms of direct behavioral change or development of environmentally benign technologies such as designing semiconductors through band-gap engineering technique for the harvesting of renewable energy resources into the grid and at the same time storing the energy for operating many real-world applications. In the beginning, this chapter aims to provide the readers about the basic introductory concepts and importance of photocatalysis and supercapacitors along with the presentation of important results. Overviews of the various synthetic methodologies involved in the designing of semiconductor-based nanocomposites are discussed. Finally, the mechanistic pathways involved in particle reinforced nanocomposites which govern the high performing renewable energy systems are illustrated.
