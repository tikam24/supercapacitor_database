Lithium-Ion Capacitor (LIC) has shown promising performance to meet the needs of high energy and power-density-energy storage system in the era of electric vehicles nowadays. The development of electrode materials and electrolytes in recent years has improvised LIC performance significantly. One of the active materials of LIC electrodes, activated carbon (AC), can be synthesized from various biomass, one of which is the water hyacinth. Its abundant availability and low utilization make the water hyacinth as a promising activated carbon source. To observe the most optimal physical properties of AC, this study also compares various activation temperatures. In this study, full cell LIC was fabricated using LTO based anode, and water hyacinth derived AC as the cathode. The LIC full cell was further characterized to see the material properties and electrochemical performance. Water hyacinth derived LIC can achieve a specific capacitance of 32.11 F/g, the specific energy of 17.83 Wh/kg, and a specific power of 160.53 W/kg.
