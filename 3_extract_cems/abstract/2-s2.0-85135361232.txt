Background: Electrodes with engineered hybrid nanostructures offer several possibilities for improved electrochemical performance in the energy storage device. Hybrid of conducting polymer and metal oxide combine synergistically the advantages of both materials such as good electronic conductivity, rate capability and cycling stability. Methods: In the present investigation, a simple and efficient method has been adopted in which ZnFe2O4 with polypyrrole (PPy) nanoparticles has been produced directly on versatile flexible carbon cloth (CC) substrate by utilizing a basic hydrothermal approach with in-situ oxidative polymerization. Significant Findings: The investigation proved that the electrodes made from CC enrobed ZnFe2O4@PPy (CC-ZnFe2O4@PPy) nanocomposite with a mass loading of 2.5 mg cm−2 offered outstanding electrochemical efficiency. The CC substrate supports the three-dimensional conductive network, flexibility, effective ion diffusion route, and a large surface area for ZnFe2O4@PPy nanocomposite; resulting in an improvement in the specific capacitance of CC-ZnFe2O4@PPy nanocomposite. The specific capacitance of the flexible CC-ZnFe2O4@PPy electrode was as high as 1598.9 F g−1 at 1A g−1 current density. The mounted symmetric supercapacitor, utilizing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)–H2SO4 gel electrolyte as a separator, provides good energy density and power density of 32.9 Wh Kg−1 and 500 W Kg−1, respectively. Such impressive findings have shown that the CC-ZnFe2O4@PPy electrodes will provide us with a new direction to develop high-performance flexible supercapacitors.
