Zn(OH)2 nanosheet was synthesized using Zinc acetate as precursor and Sucrose as a capping agent. The structure and morphology of the prepared Zn(OH)2 were characterized by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern indicated the orthorhombic structure of the Zn(OH)2 nanosheet. The average particle size of the prepared Zn(OH)2 sample was found to be 28 nm. The surface morphology shows a nanosheet-like structure. The electrochemical performance was analyzed using CHI 660 D Electrochemical workstation. Electrochemical studies indicate that the Zn(OH)2 nanosheet exhibit maximum specific capacitance of 126 F g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1.
