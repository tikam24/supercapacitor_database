α-Cobalt hydroxide is synthesized through a novel radiation-induced route using a cobalt nitrate hexahydrate isopropanol solution by irradiating 60Co γ-rays. The as-prepared product shows a layer-structured mesoporous morphology with an average size of 250 nm. Crystalline property analysis exhibits the presence α-Co(OH)2 as a predominant phase with a tiny amount of secondary phases of β-Co(OH)2 and CoO. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy discloses the existence of Co as Co(OH) 2 and CoO with a stoichiometric ratio of 76.7:23.3. In addition, the supercapacitive properties of the product are investigated using cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy in 1M KOH aqueous solution, showing a maximum capacitance value of 246.7 F g-1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.
