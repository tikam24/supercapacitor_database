Supercapacitor is a new type energy storage device studied widely. Because of its excellent characteristics, such as large specific capacitance, high cycle stability and fast charge and discharge process, it has been widely used in electrical energy storage and conversion. Electrode material is the core technology of supercapacitor. Graphene is a new nano material, it has excellent conductivity and large specific surface area; therefore, it can be used as electrode materials for the supercapacitor. The modify graphene with other conductive substances can not only increase the conductivity and cycle stability of electrode materials, but also maintain the unique advantages of graphene. Herein, the classification and research progress of the modified graphene electrode materials for supercapacitor including semiconductor/graphene nano-composites, metal and metal oxides/graphene nano-composites and graphene/conductive polymer nano-composites were reviewed. By comparing and analyzing the preparation methods and performances of the composite electrode materials, it is pointed out that the R&D of the graphene-based composites as the electrode materials of supercapacitor with low-cost, high specific capacitance and high cycling stability will be future direction.
