Self-assembled ZnCo2O4 nanosheets were synthesised by a one-step hydrothermal method and their electrochemical supercapacitor properties were investigated in 2 M aqueous KOH solution. Interesting capacitive properties were observed with a superb cyclic stability obtained even at a current density of 20 A g-1. A specific capacitance value of 1691 F g-1 was obtained at a current density of 1 A g-1 with an energy density of âˆ¼57.4 W h kg-1. The experimental findings provide useful insights into the design of supercapacitors for potential high performance energy storage applications in the future.
