We demonstrate a simple novel approach for the preparation of polypyrrole-Ag nanocomposites via oxidative aqueous polymerization (PPy-Ag-Aq) and interfacial polymerization (PPy-Ag-IF) methods. The prepared PPy-Ag-Aq and PPy-Ag-IF nanocomposites systematically analyzed by FT-IR, TGA, XRD, FE-SEM, TEM and XPS, confirming the formation of PPy-Ag nanocomposites. From the FE-SEM analysis, PPy-Ag-Aq nanocomposite was present in the highly porous form and TEM analysis shows the PPy-Ag-Aq nanocomposite was present in the form of nanospindles (∼30 nm) and nanospheres (∼5 nm) and PPy-Ag-IF nanocomposite present in the nanospheres form (∼2–10 nm). The PPy-Ag-Aq and PPy-Ag-IF nanocomposites used to study the applicability of the electrode material for supercapacitor by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge analysis. Mesoporous PPy-Ag-Aq nanocomposite was showing more capacitive response than PPy-Ag-IF nanocomposite.
