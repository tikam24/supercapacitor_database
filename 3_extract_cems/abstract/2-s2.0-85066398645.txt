In this work, nitrogen doped porous carbon nanorods for supercapacitor electrodes have been successfully fabricated through solvothermal method and direct pyrolysis of metal-organic frameworks under N2 atmosphere. In the procedure, in-situ synthesis of two Zn-based metal-organic frameworks (Zn-BTC and ZIF-8) is the key point to obtain high N doping content and stable porous structure. The prepared porous nanorods were characterized by power X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm. The results show that the nitrogen doped porous carbon nanorods, as the supercapacitor electrodes, exhibit good performance with a specific capacitance of 162 F g−1 at 1.25 A g−1, and the excellent cycle performance (capacity retention even increases to 107% after 10000 cycles at 20 A g−1) due to the unique pore structure.
