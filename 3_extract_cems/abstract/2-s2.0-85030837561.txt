Dulse-derived porous carbon (DDPC)–polyaniline (PANI) nanocomposites were fabricated by a method based on the in situ chemical oxidation polymerization of aniline on DDPC. The characterization of the material showed that the nano-PANI was grown on the surface of DDPC in the form of nanosticks or nanoparticles. The DDPC–PANI nanocomposites were further used as electrode materials for energy-storage applications. Meanwhile, the effect of the amount of aniline on the electrochemical performance of DDPC–PANI was also investigated. The results show that a maximum specific capacitance of 458 F/g was achieved for the DDPC–PANI nanocomposites; this was higher than that of the DDPC electrode (218 F/g), and the PANI electrode (318 F/g). The specific capacitance of DDPC–PANI remained 66.0% of the initial value after 5000 cycles; this was higher than that of PANI (50.5%). Finally, a device of DDPC–PANI–activated carbon (AC) was assembled with DDPC–PANI as a positive electrode, which exhibited a high energy density of 9.02 W h/kg, which was higher than that of PANI–AC device. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
