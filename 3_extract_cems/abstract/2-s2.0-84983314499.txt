The MnO2/TiO2 composite electrodes were prepared with modifying MnO2 onto the anodized TiO2 nanotube arrays by the hydrothermal method. The supercapacitor was assembled with the two symmetric MnO2/TiO2 electrodes. The surface morphology, valence of the elements and electrochemical performance of the samples were characterized by FESEM, TEM, XPS and the electrochemical workstation. The results show that the MnO2 nanoparticles are uniformly loaded onto the outer and inner surface of the TiO2 nanotube array. The specific capacitance is 429.3 F/g at a charge-discharge current density of 1 A/g with 82.4% of the initial capacitance after 5000 cycles. The MnO2/TiO2 symmetrical supercapacitor exhibits the charge-discharge specific capacitance of 39.9 F/g at the current density of 5 A/g with 91.5% of the initial capacitance after 5000 cycles and the energy density of 18.98 Wh/kg at the power density of 400 W/kg. Not only the anodized TiO2 nanotube arrays could serve as the carrier of MnO2, but also the Ti substrate could be used for the current collector, which alleviates the weight of the supercapacitor and provides a method for preparing supercapacitors.
