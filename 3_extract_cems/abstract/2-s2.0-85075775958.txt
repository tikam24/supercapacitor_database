To improve the performance of supercapacitors, a simple wet chemical method for the deposition of palladium (Pd) film on stainless steel (SS) as a current collector for an activated carbon (AC) electrode had been conducted. AC electrodes were produced using physical and chemical activation from oil palm empty fruit bunches (OPEFB) biomass material. The chemical activation comprised of KOH at concentrations of 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 M. Physical activation involved CO2 gas at a temperature of 700 °C with holding activation time for 2 hours. The synthesized Pd film was characterized using FESEM-EDAX, and cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to its electrochemical properties in a 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte solution. XRD, FESEMEDAX have been used to investigate the structural and elemental AC electrodes. The microstructure of the AC electrode corresponds to (002) and (100) in a semi-crystalline form with diffraction peaks at 2θ of 24.92° and 45.12°. The result of EDAX showed that the AC electrode with KOH activation has an elemental carbon range 87.02 to 92.48 at. %. FESEM characterization indicated that the Pd film deposited onto a SS substrate consists mainly of microcrystallites coated with cauliflower-like structures in the size range 200- 600 nm. Data from the EDAX analysis showed a palladium of 44.05 at. %. It was shown that the wet chemical method, which really affected the growth of Pd film on the SS surface, acts as a current collector electrode to improve the specific capacitance. CV charge-discharge value of modified supercapacitor electrode before (SS/AC) and after (SS/Pd/AC) Pd film coating increases the specific capacitance from 106 to 115 Fg -1. The modified SS/Pd/AC electrode with AC/KOH ratio of 0.3 showed a good maximum specific capacitance at a scan rate 1 mVs -1.
