In order to develop an excellent pseudocapacitor with both high specific capacitance and outstanding stretchability to match with other devices applicable in future wearable and bio-implantable systems, we focus our studies on three vital aspects: Stretchability of hybrid film electrodes, the interface between different components, and the integrated performance in stretchability and electrochemistry of supercapacitors based on single-walled carbon nanotube/polyaniline (SWCNT/PANI) composite films on pre-elongated elastomers. Owing to the moderate porosity, the buckled hybrid film avoids the cracking which occurs in conventional stretchable hybrid electrodes, and both a high specific capacitance of 435 F·g−1 and a high strain tolerance of 140% have been achieved. The good SWCNT/PANI interfacial coupling and the reinforced solid electrolyte penetration structure enable the integrated pseudocapacitors to have stretch-resistant interfaces between different units and maintain a high performance under a stretching of 120% elongation, even after 1,000 cyclic elongations.[Figure not available: see fulltext.].
