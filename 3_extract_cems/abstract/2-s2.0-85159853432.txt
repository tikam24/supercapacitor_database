Abstract: Ni3V2O8 nanoparticles were synthesized using sonochemical method and studied its electrochemical properties for supercapacitor. The prepared Ni3V2O8 nanoparticles were characterized using thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis. The formation of highly phase pure Ni3V2O8 nanoparticles was confirmed from XRD analysis that belonged to orthorhombic crystal structure. The morphology of prepared Ni3V2O8 was spherical in shape with a size range of 40–50 nm as observed from SEM images. The electrochemical supercapacitive properties were studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) analysis. A maximum specific capacitance of 218 F g–1 was obtained at 2 mA cm–2 with good cycling stability which inferred that Ni3V2O8 nanoparticles could be utilized as an efficient electrode material for supercapacitor.
