In the research of flexible smart electronics, obtaining particular structure electrodes to provide excellent electrochemical performance remains challenging. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of nanocomposite by a two-step method of polypyrrole (PPy) with Co3O4@SiO2 in the presence of an oxidizing agent. Co3O4@SiO2 was prepared by firing SiO2-coated zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67/SiO2) in a tubular furnace at a high temperature. Subsequently, PPy was coated and dispersed on Co3O4@SiO2 by chemical methods at room temperature. In addition, we also explored the optimal ratio experiment of Co3O4@SiO2 and PPy. The results show that the specific capacitance of Co3O4@SiO2 and Co3O4@SiO2/PPy (2 mL) is 33.36 A/g and 107.7 A/g, at 0.6 A/g current density, indicating that the addition of PPy greatly improves the electrochemical performance of Co3O4@SiO2. This may be due to synergies between Co3O4@SiO2 and PPy polymers, and the addition of PPy may help Co3O4@SiO2 to construct more ion channels to enhance ion transport. This report will contribute to the development and application of cobalt oxide and silicon-shell electrode materials in the field of energy storage. It is helpful for the development and application of cobalt oxide and silicon-shell structures as electrode materials in the field of energy storage.
