Intermittency and fluctuation of wind power lead to low capacity credit and poor schedulability of wind power plant, and give rise to voltage instability as well as frequency fluctuation in the grid, which negatively affects power quality and stability of power system. To solve this problem, the paper set up rapid energy storage device based on the supercapacitor and the battery, which was used for wind power flow optimization. A triple two-way DC-DC converter was applied to distribute power between two energy storage components, and a four-quadrant DC-AC converter was applied to adjust the energy exchange between the energy storage and the grid. Power distribution method based on low-frequency fluctuation elimination of supercapacitor voltage can significantly reduce the times of charge and discharge of the battery; Storage energy regulation rule based on state-of-charge (SOC) of the energy storage components can avoid overcharge and deep discharge, and optimize power adjustment capability. The experimental results show that the system can realize advantage complementation of both energy storage components, effectively smooth and regulate the active power injected in the grid, and compensate the reactive power at the access point of wind power in real-time.
