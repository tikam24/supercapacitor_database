Materials with sheet like morphology which stores charge through highly reversible redox reactions find numerous application in energy storage. They are advantageous to that of the carbon materials storing charge only electrostatically. Molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) has gained significant attention and proves to be expedient attributed to the charge storage in the large surface area as well as in the bulk of the material. The limited conductivity of ion across the layers of the MoS2 can be improved by integrating MoS2 with conducting polymer. Amongst the various conducting polymers, polyindole (PIn) is exceptionally stable attributed to the presence of fused aromatic structure. Integration of MoS2 along with PIn results in the uniform spreading of the polymer eliminating its agglomeration hence, enhancing the active surface area. Presence of PIn in the interlayers can significantly enhance the conductivity of the resulting PIn/MoS2 composite. This work reports the synthesis of PIn/MoS2 composite via. in-situ oxidative polymerization of indole monomer in the presence of MoS2 showing an enhanced specific capacitance of value 173 F gâˆ’1.
