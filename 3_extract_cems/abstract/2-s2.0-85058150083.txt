We show the use of lignin as a carbon source to prepare electrode materials using nitrogen-doped, nitrogen doping introduces a nitrogen functional group to increase the hydrophilicity and active sites of the electrode material. Due to its high specific surface area (870.2 m2 g-1) and porosity, the introduction of functional groups can increase the charge transfer rate, Ultimately, the electrode has a high specific capacitance (320.4 F g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1), excellent rate performance and cycle stability (94.1% specific capacitance retention after 5000 cycles). The results of the above studies indicate that a low-cost, high-performance supercapacitor can be fabricated using abundant waste lignin.
