Separation and recovery of residual carbon from coal-series kaolinite is an important prerequisite for its high value comprehensive utilization. In this paper, the residual carbon was separated and recovered from Inner Mongolia coal-series kaolinite by reverse flotation technology. The separation and recovery effect of residual carbon under the condition of multi-stage reverse flotation was explored. Moreover, porous carbons applied as electrode materials for supercapacitors were prepared from residual carbon via NaOH or KOH activation. The microstructure of porous carbon and the electrochemical performance porous carbon electrode were characterized by N2 adsorption/desorption, scanning electron microscope, galvanostatic charge/discharge and cyclic voltammetry. The results show that residual carbon can be effectively separated and recovered from coal-series kaolinite through "roughing - two step cleaning-scavenging" reverse flotation technology, and its recovery was 85.22%. High-performance porous carbons with specific surface area of 2 079 m2/g and 2 324 m2/g, total pore volume of 1.167 cm3/g and 1.328 cm3/g were prepared by NaOH and KOH activation, respectively. These porous carbons exhibited interconnected "macropore-mesopore-micropore" pore size distribution and superior adsorption performance, their iodine adsorption value reached 2 205 mg/g and 2 491 mg/g, methylene blue adsorption value reached 322 mg/g and 406 mg/g. The two kinds of porous carbon electrode materials for supercapacitor exhibited an excellent electroche-mical performance. The specific capacitances were as high as 256 F/g and 285 F/g and exhibited good high current charge-discharge characte-ristics as well as excellent cycling performance, and its initial specific capacitance were retained more than 90% after 1 500 cycles.
