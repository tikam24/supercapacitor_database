The layered polypyrrole-graphene oxide-sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (PPyGO-SDBS) nanocomposites were facilely fabricated via an in situ emulsion polymerization method with the assistance of SDBS as dopant and stabilizer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and electrochemical performance were employed to analyze the structure and the characteristics of the composites. The results showed that SDBS played an important role in improving the electrochemical performance of the PPyGO-SDBS, by dispersing the PPy between the layers of the GO. The obtained PPyGO-SDBS exhibited remarkable performance as an electrode material for supercapacitors, with a specific capacitance as high as 483 F g-1 at a current density of 0.2 A g-1 when the mass ratio of pyrrole to GO was 80:20. The attenuation of the specific capacitance was less than 20 % after 1,000 charge-discharge processes, supporting the idea that PPy inserted successfully into the GO interlayers. The excellent electrochemical performance seemed to arise from the synergistic effect between the PPy and the GO and the dispersion of the PPy induced by SDBS.
