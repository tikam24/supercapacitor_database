A straightforward multitemplate carbonization method for producing nanoporous carbons has been implemented using magnesium citrate as the carbon source and magnesium powder as the template. Notably, the crystallinities of the carbon materials were greatly enhanced with increasing carbonization temperatures. Sample C-4:1-900 obtained by carbonizing the mixture of magnesium citrate and Mg powder (in a mass ratio of 4:1) at 900 C exhibited a large BET surface area of 1972.1 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> and a high pore volume of 4.78 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, thereby resulting in the best electrochemical behaviors. It delivered a large specific capacitance of 236.5 F g<sup>-1</sup> at 1 A g<sup>-1</sup> when measured in a three-electrode system. Additionally, in a two-electrode system, the energy density was 15 Wh kg<sup>-1</sup> for a power density of 0.5 W kg<sup>-1</sup>, when measured at an operating temperature of 80 Â°C.
