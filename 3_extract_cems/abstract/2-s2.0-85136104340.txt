Specific capacitance (Cs) and cyclic stability are two significant performance criteria for practical supercapacitors (SCs) applications. This study applied a binder-free approach to attaching Zn@Fe2O3 nanoparticles to MoS2@rGO ultrathin nanosheets. Then, it was used as active material in a supercapacitor, which provides an electrochemically active surface area and numerous ion and electrolyte penetration pathways. This design of the electrode materials offers a novel approach to enhancing electrical conductivity, cycle stability, and electrochemical performance. The nanomaterial was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). A three-electrode system was used to examine the nanomaterial's electrochemical characteristics as an electrode for supercapacitor application in a 3.0 M KOH solution. The nanomaterial demonstrates a high specific capacitance of 3078 F/g at 1.0 A/g. Also, Zn@Fe2O3/MoS2@rGO//AC asymmetric configuration (ASCs) results showed a high energy density of 38.88 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 1000 W kg−1 and significant cycling stability.
