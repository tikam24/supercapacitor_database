Carbon incorporated ceria nanomaterials (C-CeO2) are prepared by combusting ethanol solution of cerium nitrate in one step.The successful fabrication of C-CeO2 nanomaterials is confirmed by the characterizations of crystal phase and morphology.The electrochemical measurements demonstrate that the specific capacitance value of the prepared C-CeO2 can reach 125 F•g-1 at a current density of 1 A•g-1,which is 2.3 times that of pure CeO2 nanomaterials (55 F•g-1).Moreover,the prepared C-CeO2 nanomaterials remain 83% of the initial capacitance after 1,000 cycles of charge/discharge test.
