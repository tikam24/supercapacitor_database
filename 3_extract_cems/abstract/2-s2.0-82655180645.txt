This paper investigates the idea of providing the supply for daytime interior lighting with the photovoltaic (PV) system. The match between electricity demand and availability of solar radiation allows for significant supply autonomy with moderate PV system dimensions. The simulation has been aimed at providing optimal choices for PV-generator and energy storage dimensions, relatively to the illuminated area, with view of the electrical energy savings. The best results have been observed for spaces with limited or no glazing.
