In this paper, a sizing methodology is proposed for a grid-connected PV and hybrid energy storage system, which is used to determine the capacity share ratio of the Li-ion battery and the supercapacitor. Based on one case of the PV and the load mission profiles, the proposed sizing scheme can reduce the cycle numbers of the Li-ion battery and utilize the supercapacitor most, hence improving the self-consumption of the PV system with hybrid energy storage.
