The rapidly increasing need of the energy and the requirement of the current and further generation compact electronic devices have emerged the development of micro-scaled energy storage devices. These energy storage devices should be efficient enough to store the sufficient energy in a limited area. The micro-supercapacitors have reported as the best alternative to power the miniaturized electronic devices. A lot of energy storage materials, fabrication methods, and the electrode design have been explored to achieve the high performance of the micro-scaled energy storage devices. This review focuses on the current progress to fabricate and improve the performance of the micro-supercapacitor devices for their potential application in the miniaturized electronic devices.
