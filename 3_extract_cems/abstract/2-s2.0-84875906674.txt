Supercapacitor is an emerging technology in the field of energy storage systems that can offer higher power density than batteries and higher energy density over traditional capacitors. Supercapacitor will become an attractive power solution to an increasing number of applications, such as renewable energy power generation, transportation, power system and many others, because of its advantages which include high charge/discharge current capability, very high efficiency, wide temperature range, etc. In this paper, the advantages and disadvantages of supercapacitor are discussed and some critical technologies for designing supercapacitor energy storage system are presented in detail. Finally, the role of the supercapacitor in renewable energy power system is discussed and a supercapacitor based uninterrupted power system (UPS) for the wind turbine pitch systems is presented as a design example.
