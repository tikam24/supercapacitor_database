This paper presents three energy storage systems, based on chemical batteries, flywheels and supercapacitors as the energy source of low earth orbit satellites in eclipse duration. Each system is designed and optimized with regard to energy requirement of a typical LEO satellite and various vital parameters in satellites which are discussed. The storage system and electronic interface are presented to give an adequate view for comparing them in different aspects. Afterwards, a comparison between these energy storage systems (ESSs) is applied considering their efficiency, reliability, weight, operational temperature and self-discharge dissipation (trickle charge). Finally, the conclusion presents the most recommended systems in order of their capability. Â© 2011 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.
