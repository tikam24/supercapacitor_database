Selected material combination, higher electrical conductivity, and high specific capacity were cognizance to favor supercapacitors (SCs), but their recognition at the same time has still a great challenger task. Herein, we demonstrate on copper-cobalt sulfide nano-reeds array with excellent nanoarchitecture has been developed by simplistic hydrothermal approach for SCs. The as-developed Cu-Co sulfide nano-reeds array possesses boosted electrochemical activities. In the performed SCs results, a specific capacity of 158.93 mA h g−1 has been reported at a current density of 2 A g−1 with well capability rate of 86.6% of the first capacity was remain at 20 A g−1. The effects of highly electroactive capabilities of Cu-Co sulfide nano reeds array electrode was optimized so that 93.1% of the first capacitance has been exhibited after 4000 cycles at 5 A g−1. Finally, these better most results demonstrated that the Cu-Co sulfide nano-reeds array material presents a progressive electroactive material for the future generation energy storage applications.
