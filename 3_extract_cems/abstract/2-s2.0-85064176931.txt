Tailoring transition-metal oxide nanoparticles with two-dimensional carbon has become a favorite way to improve their electrochemical performance. In this study, a composite of reduced graphene oxide was anchored by Co 3 O 4 nanocubes and easily prepared with the assistance of polydopamine (PDA), using a combination of hydrothermal reaction and pyrolysis (Co 3 O 4 @PDA-rGO). Polydopamine, which possesses abundant catechol and amine groups, could be easily grafted onto graphene oxide to reduce the aggregation of graphene particles. Furthermore, PDA provided active sites, i.e., catechol and amine groups, which coordinated with Co 2+ , enabling enrichment of metal ions on the surface of graphene. After the pyrolysis of Co 2+ -containing PDA-grafted graphene at 400 Â°C, the Co 2+ ions were converted into Co 3 O 4 nanocubes, while the PDA carbonized to form N-doped porous carbon on the surface of graphene. The resulting product, Co 3 O 4 @PDA-rGO, demonstrated extraordinary supercapacitive behavior with good cycling stability owing to its unique porous structure as well as the intimate contact between Co 3 O 4 and the carbon matrix.
