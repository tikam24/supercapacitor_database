This paper presents the design and characterization of a low-cost system capable of measuring the impedance of a device-under-Test over a wide range of frequencies. The target application of the system is in those fields where measuring the impedance of components and devices such as rechargeable batteries or supercapacitors is important for monitoring purposes. In such fields, requirements on size, cost, and accuracy are crucial. Therefore, in this work, the system-level design is carried out by considering such requirements. The main subsystems are described and their specifications are presented. Implementation issues are discussed and a prototype is introduced. Experiments performed using the prototype to measure electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of a resistor, an RC parallel circuit, a lithium-ion battery and two electrical double layer supercapacitors validate the proposed system design.
