The impediments confronted by flexible batteries for fabrication methodologies and lower specific power for real-time applications ameliorate the stand of flexible supercapacitors as a novel impartial executor in the storage of energy. The commendable attributes of specific energy, long-cycle stability, and rapid ion transport make supercapacitors a crucial candidate in the devices of storage of energy. Eying on these recompenses of supercapacitors, Ni4CuO5-mw-CNT and rGO-FeVO3are fabricated for higher energy asymmetric solid-state supercapacitors through a facile solvothermal procedure delineated. The typical morphology of bimetallic oxides with crystallinity variation depicts a high surface area that grossly supersedes the sites of redox-active, which influences the diffusion of electrolyte ions and the variable-valence redox reaction with ion embolism. The synthesized oxide is investigated using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron, and Raman spectroscopy to affirm the phase and inspected by electron microscopy for structural features with BET. The Hirshfeld surface simulation analysis assists in grasping the electronic interaction to explicate the experimental consequences. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device comprising Ni4CuO5-mw-CNT as a cathode and rGO-FeVO3as an anode is assembled. The electrochemical response of Ni4CuO5-mw-CNT and rGO-FeVO3electrodes exhibits higher specific capacitances of ∼778.8 and ∼478 F/g at a current density of 0.4 A/g, respectively, superior long-cycle stabilities, and rate capabilities. Moreover, the convened ASC device achieves a maximum specific energy of ∼29.2 Wh/kg and a specific power density of ∼3201.6 W/kg, along with a retention of the capacitance of ∼82.6% after 10,000 cycles. The associated porous morphology network affords instantaneous accessibility of the electrolytic ions that utterly revamp the proficiency of the electrodes in the field of energy storage.
