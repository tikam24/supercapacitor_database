A flexible technique is developed using hydrochloric acid to modify the redox reaction between potassium permanganate and sodium nitrite in order to grow ultrafine α-MnO 2 nanorods, hydrothermally. The nanorods grown were 10–40 nm diameters in range. Not any crack, fissure, imperfection or dislocation is observed in the nanorods suggesting it to be finely ordered. Structure, phase and purity of as developed nanorods were determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Peseudocapacitance of α-MnO 2 nanorods was tested using a three electrode system. Considerably very high pseudocapacitance value of 643.5 F/g at 15 A/g current density was calculated from the galvanostatic discharge current measurement. Also excellent cyclability is observed with high retention of 90.5% after 4000 cycles. Highly uniform and confined morphology of the nanorods helps smooth the electron dynamics between electrode/electrolyte interfaces resulting in superior performance. Most importantly, the use of potassium ferricyanide as redox additive to KOH electrolyte was proved to be quite effective as it provides extra redox couple [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3 − /[Fe(CN) 6 ] 4− which helps in further smoothening of electron transition thereby resulting in considerably superior pseudocapacitive performance.
