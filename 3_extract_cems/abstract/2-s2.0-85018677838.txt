Advanced Linear Devices (ALD) offers a universal PCB designed to automatically balance leakage currents and manage overvoltage, enabling ultra-low-power usage in supercapacitors used in a series stack. The board uses ALD's SAB MOSFETs (SABMB16, SABMB8100XX, SABMB9100xx) to balance the leakage current in each individual supercapacitor cell from 0.1 F to 3,000 F. It is designed to allow system engineers to test, evaluate, prototype, or use for in-production products. SABMB16/SABMB810025/SABMB910025 are universal application boards. Importantly, the charging or discharging of supercapacitor currents pass through the supercapacitors but do not pass through the SABMB16 boards or SAB MOSFETs mounted on the PCB board. The SABMB16 is designed for ease of use as a plug-and-play PCB for supercapacitors of 0.1 F to 3,000 F. The average additional power dissipation due to dc leakage of the supercapacitor is zero, which makes this method of supercapacitor balancing energy-efficient and suited for low-loss energy-harvesting and long-life battery-operated applications.
