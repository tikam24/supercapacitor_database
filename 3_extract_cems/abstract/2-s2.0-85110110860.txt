Supercapacitors are favored by researchers because of their high power density, especially with the acceleration of people's life rhythm. However, their energy density, especially from the point of view of the whole energy storage device, is far lower than that of commercial batteries. In this work, a kind of customizable full paper-based supercapacitor device with excellent self-healing ability is fabricated by simple and low-cost screen printing, electropolymerization and dip coating methods. The resultant separator-free supercapacitor device exhibits both ultrahigh gravimetric and areal specific energy (power) densities of 39 Wh kg−1 (69 kW kg−1) and 692 μWh cm−2 (236 mW cm−2), achieving excellent supercapacitor performance. Notably, the addition of vitrimers endows the whole device with outstanding self-healing properties, which is helpful for enhancing the adaptability of the device to the environment. In addition, this kind of paper-based device also displays good photothermal and electromagnetic shielding performances. These striking features make paper matrix composites attractive in the fields of supercapacitors, medical photothermal treatment and electromagnetic shielding.
