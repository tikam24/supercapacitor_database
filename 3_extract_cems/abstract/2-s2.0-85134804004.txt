â€” In current research a hybrid autonomous supplying system for electric vehicles applications is presented. The hybrid system is consisted of fuel cell, micro gas turbine and supercapacitor. There are realized with averaged models in MATLAB/Simulink environment. The supplying elements are connected to a DC bus for charging a different type of EVs. In this case as a load is use two EVs: BMW-i3 and Nissan Leaf. This system can operate autonomously in hard-to-reach places where there is no supplying from the distributed grid and other sources. These places could be remote holiday villages, research centers positioned at hard-to-reach places and also for production of agricultural crops with the aids of electric vehicles. This requires the necessity for searching of different structural and conceptual solutions for production and storage of electric energy. An optimization problem is resolved in order to reduce the value of the capacitance of the supercapacitor with which it will decrease his price. Thus, it also decreases the price for construction of the entire charging station. Recently, the usage of natural gas and his transportation is well organized which can contribute for assuring of the reserved energy for the autonomous charging station.
