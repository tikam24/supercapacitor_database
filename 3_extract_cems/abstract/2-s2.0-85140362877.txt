Metalâ€“organic frameworks (MOFs), which are synthesized through the self-assembly of organic ligands and inorganic metals, have drawn considerable research interest owing to their unique properties and attractive structures. Many studies on various MOF derivatives, such as MOFs and cellulose aerogels, hydrogel composite materials, and bimetallic-centered MOF materials, have provided the potential for wide application of MOFs. However, MOFs mostly exist in the form of powder particles, which are difficult to form. In addition, MOFs have problems with structural instability. MOF-based gels can overcome this problem. MOF-based gels also have significant advantages in secondary processing. In this review, synthetic methods for MOF-based gels, particularly the synergistic effect with other materials, are introduced. The applications of MOF-based hydrogels and aerogels in supercapacitors, water treatment, catalysis, adsorption, and energy storage are also discussed.
