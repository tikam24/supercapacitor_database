Microgrids (MGs) are drawing growing attention due to their advantages in the distribution. Hierarchical control strategy including local and global layers has been employed in the MG. The local control layers of the DC MG are the focus in this study. These local control layers may face some problems under load disruptions and power generation variations. Therefore, this paper proposes to develop local control layers of the DC MG depending on Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm to overcome such issues. The simulation studies has been carried out and the main results indicate that the proposed control approach applied in the local layers has superior performance in terms of the voltage adjustment besides the power-exchange amongst PV, and battery accompanied by the supercapacitor as compared to that of the existing approaches.
