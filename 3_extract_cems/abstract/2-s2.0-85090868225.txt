This paper presents a robust stability analysis of the battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system within the power supply for resistance welding. Kharitonov's theorem approach and D-stability condition allow considering uncertainty in parameters of electronic circuit components and load fluctuations. The gain factors of the proportional-plus-integral controller are chosen to meet Hurwitz criteria for four Kharitonov polynomials. The analysis results verify that the presented battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system should be characterized by stable behavior regardless of variations of the components parameters within the tolerance region and for a wide range of anticipated loads.
