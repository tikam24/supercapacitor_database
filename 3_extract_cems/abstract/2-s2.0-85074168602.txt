Surface activation of carbon materials produced by chemical vapor deposition onto a Ni plate was investigated. The products of pyrolysis of a gas mixture composed of propane, butane, and isobutane were for the most part nanofibers. This material was employed as the active mass for electrodes of supercapacitors. The electrodes were activated with a KOH at 700째C and 800째C in Ar atmosphere. The activation efficiency was studied by the capacitance of supercapacitor cells by measurement of the electrochemical properties based on activated and unactivated materials. The salt 1.1-dimethylpyrrolidinium tetrafluoroborate in acetonitrile was used as an electrolyte. The specific surface area of the electrodes was determined from adsorption data. The results showed that the specific surface areas of non-activated samples and samples activated at 700째C and 800째C were 190, 338, and 586 sq m, respectively. The specific capacitance of the samples increased with increasing specific surface area.
