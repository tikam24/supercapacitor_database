The development of energy storage electrode materials is important for enhancing the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors. Despite extensive research on improving electrochemical performance with polymer-based materials, electrode materials with micro/nanostructures are needed for fast and efficient ion and electron transfer. In this work, highly ordered phosphomolybdate (PMoO)-grafted polyaniline (PMoO-PAI) deposited onto Au hole-cylinder nanopillar arrays is developed for high-performance pseudocapacitors. The three-dimensional nanostructured arrays are easily fabricated by secondary sputtering lithography, which has recently gained attention and features a high resolution of 10 nm, a high aspect ratio greater than 20, excellent uniformity/accuracy/precision, and compatibility with large area substrates. These 10 nm scale Au nanostructures with a high aspect ratio of âˆ¼30 on Au substrates facilitate efficient ion and electron transfer. The resultant PMoO-PAI electrode exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance, including a high specific capacitance of 114 mF cm-2, a high-rate capability of 88%, and excellent long-term stability.
