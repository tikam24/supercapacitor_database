Nano-structure carbon materials are among the most widely studied and used inorganic non-metallic materials. This article summarizes the recent research progress and development of the nitrogen doping materials, which have a great influence on the electrical conductivity of carbon materials, field emission performance, supercapacitor performance, oxygen reduction catalytic performance, other catalytic properties and hydrogen storage performance. Recent researches have indicated that nitrogen doping can significantly enhance the electrochemical and catalytic performance of these materials, while endue these materials with some peculiar properties. Therefore, it is expected to explore novel methods to improve the performance and efficiency of equipment and the catalytic process based on the nano-structure carbon materials.
