The main purpose of this article is to develop the energy management for off-road hybrid vehicle with cyber-physical approach. Three main endeavor make this paper different from the existing relevant literature. First, a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) is utilized in an off-road hybrid vehicle to study its potential benefits over conventional use of only a battery or ultracapacitor (UC) packs. The main potential advantages of coupling a UC and a battery pack are in reducing cost, space, and weight. Second, an average power based model predictive control is proposed to solve the energy management of the vehicle with multiple energy sources without any priori information of the drive cycles. After modeling, the optimization problem with multiobjective that takes battery life into account is introduced. Finally, a comparison study is presented to analyze the benefits of the HESS in off-road hybrid vehicles over vehicles equipped with only a UC or a battery pack. The results show that using an HESS in off-road hybrid vehicles reduces the total cost, space, and weight. More specifically, the cost of the energy storage system (ESS) is decreased by 36% and 32.5% compared to only battery and only UC ESS, respectively.
