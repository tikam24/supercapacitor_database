Hierarchically porous, oxygen-doped ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs) were synthesised and compared for the first time from different types of plant-derived polyphenols through a nanocasting route: phloroglucinol, gallic acid, catechin and Mimosa tannin. All are secondary metabolites naturally occurring in various plant species and are available at low cost at the industrial scale. The infiltration was carried out in one single step without using toxic solvents or long polymerisation-stabilisation times. When applied as electrode materials for supercapacitors in 1 M H2SO4electrolyte, those OMCs led to specific capacitances up to 277 F g−1at 0.5 mV s−1and high rate capabilities as measured by cyclic voltammetry, good cycling stabilities up to 5000 cycles and maximum energy densities between 15 and 8 W h kg−1under exceptionally high power outputs ranging from 200 W kg−1to 22.1 kW kg−1, respectively, in the range of current density of 0.1–12 A g−1, as determined by galvanostatic charge − discharge. Moreover, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests evidenced that the gallic acid-derived electrode exhibited the highest electrical conductivity and the fastest frequency response, making it an excellent candidate for high-power commercial devices.
