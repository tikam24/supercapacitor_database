Lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) have gained significant attention in recent years for their increased energy density without altering their power density. LICs achieve higher capacitance than traditional supercapacitors due to their hybrid battery electrode and subsequent higher voltage. This is due to the asymmetric action of LICs, which serves as an enhancer of traditional supercapacitors. This culminates in the potential for pollution-free, long-lasting, and efficient energy-storing that is required to realise a renewable energy future. This review article offers an analysis of recent progress in the production of LIC electrode active materials, requirements and performance. In-situ hybridisation and ex-situ recombination of composite materials comprising a wide variety of active constituents is also addressed. The possible challenges and opportunities for future research based on LICs in energy applications are also discussed.
