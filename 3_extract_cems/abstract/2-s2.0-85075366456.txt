Creating a hybrid cobaltous-based oxide/sulfide core-shell composite is an effective strategy to improve the composites conductivity thus enhance the electrochemical performance of cobaltous oxide. By using Co3O4 nanosheets (NSs) as precursor, a room-temperature sulfurization for obtaining Co3O4/CoS core-shell NSs via anion exchange is developed which show better supercapacitor performance in contrast to the most high-temperature material process required in synthesis of CoS. The study demonstrates that the preceding step of introducing oxygen vacancies to Co3O4 by NaBH4 solution reduction is crucial, which allows S2− to facilitate entering the position of O2− in the solid phase successfully at room temperature. The as-obtained Co3O4/CoS NSs preserve the porous morphology and have larger accessible active surface area and better conductivity than those of Co3O4 and CoS composite. In this report, the Co3O4/CoS NSs exhibit an improved specific capacitance of 1658 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 which can be maintained at 92.3% after 10,000 cycles. The corresponding assembled asymmetric supercapacitor with activated carbon as anode displays a high energy density of 23.6 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 250 W kg−1.
