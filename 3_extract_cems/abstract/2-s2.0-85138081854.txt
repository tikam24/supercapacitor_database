Supercapacitors (SCs) have ultra-high specific capacitance far exceeding traditional capacitors, and have become an important direction in the field of capacitor research. However, SCs devices based on carbon materials usually require a high temperature environment for N-doping or compounding of pseudocapacitive materials, which greatly increases the manufacturing cost and the difficulty of industrialized production. Herein, we fabricated cellulose-based flexible hydrogel supercapacitors by Fe3+ facilitated one-step ternary composite of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO)-oxidized cellulose nanofibrils (TOCN)/sulfonated carbon nanotubes (SCNT)/polyaniline (PANI). The combination of these three substances could form a porous and flexible three-dimensional conductive hydrogel just at room temperature. By comparing the performance of supercapacitors prepared with different ratios of three substances, it was found that the best supercapacitors exhibited a high area specific capacitance of 1786 mF/cm2 at a current density of 1 mA/cm2 and excellent flexibility. Therefore, these composite hydrogels are promising for high-performance flexible solid-state supercapacitors.
