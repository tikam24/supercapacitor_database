Despite the global push for net-zero emission and the power system's decarbonization, there are still a lot of developing countries (especially in sub-Saharan Africa) with electricity crises or inadequate electrification. Coincidentally, these countries have enormous renewable energy potential. Therefore, this paper presents a brief summary of the electricity incapacitation and renewable energy potential in many sub-Saharan African countries. This study is novel as it presents a techno-analysis of 100% renewable electrification in Chad which is one of the countries with the least electricity access globally. Also, the models developed are simulated using the EnergyPLAN tool with targeted implementation years set as 2030, 2040, and 2050 based on different global decarbonization targets. From the result of this study, the use of biomass power plants is the only scenario that does not have critical excess electricity production (CEEP) in the power system. Also, these scenarios require the least power capacities (270 MW for 2030, 650 MW for 2040, and 1600 MW for 2050) out of all the scenarios in this study. Solar PV and wind power can be categorized as the most probable options as they are matured technologies and in application in many countries, however, they will require pumped hydro storage integration.
