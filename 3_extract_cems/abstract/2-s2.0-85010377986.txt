Enhanced performance of electrochemical capacitors can be achieved by larger capacitances as well as higher power and energy densities. In this work, such battery-like supercapacitors were fabricated using a three-dimensional and conductive diamond network as the capacitor electrode and water-soluble redox couples as the electrolyte. In 0.05 M Fe(CN)6 3-/4- + 1.0 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution, a capacitance of 73.42 mF cm-2 was obtained at a current density of 1 mA cm-2. This value is 10000 times higher than the capacitance of diamond electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs). The energy and power densities of a fabricated diamond network symmetric pseudocapacitor were up to 56.50 W h kg-1 and 13.7 kW kg-1, respectively. Compared with those of diamond EDLCs obtained with the same cell voltage, they are enhanced about 3500 and 1440 fold, respectively. Therefore the combination of diamond networks and water-soluble redox electrolytes is a novel approach to construct electrochemical capacitors and thus bridges the gap between normal dielectric capacitors and rechargeable batteries.
