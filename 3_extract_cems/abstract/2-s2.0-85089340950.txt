The surge in wearable devices and demands in transport sector necessitate the development of energy storage devices in the form of supercapacitors that are thin, flexible, lightweight, energy and power dense, have high charge-discharge rate capability, and have stability for a large number of charge-discharge cycles. Solid-state or quasi-solid-state polymer-based electrolytes are important to not only impart these abovementioned properties but also make the device safer and more packageable, provide more freedom for design, and lead to larger operable temperature range, better electrode/electrolyte interface, high ionic conductivity, and electrochemical stability. In this chapter, we discuss the principles of supercapacitor working and classify various electrolytes for supercapacitor applications. This is followed by performance characterization of polymer electrolyte-based supercapacitors and the challenges faced in their further development.
