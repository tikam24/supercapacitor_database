In this article, Ni-Al LDHs/graphene composite is successfully fabricated via exfoliation and restacking method. As fabricated composite exhibits ultrathin nature of exfoliated LDHs deposited onto surface of graphene, yielding special chiffon like structure. Such structure can effectively overcome the agglomeration of initial LDHs and graphene sheets. The results of electrochemical performance confirm that Ni-Al LDHs/graphene composite exhibit enhanced performance in comparison with LDHs, which is related to the special chiffon like structure and high conductivity of graphene nanosheets. High performance of as-fabricated material can be identified via various electrochemical tests. In addition, an assembled asymmetric supercapacitor based on Ni-Al LDHs/graphene and active carbon exhibits a maximum energy density of 46.4 Wh kg−1 as well as a maximum power density of 6080 W kg−1, which indicates the potential of composite applied in energy storage-conversion devices.
