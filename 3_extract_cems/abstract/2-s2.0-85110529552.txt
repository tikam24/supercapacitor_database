Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are considered as a promising material for energy storage in recent years. Here, core-shell structured ZIF-7@ZIF-67 is synthesized in this work. The core-shell structured material can promote electron transfer of inner-outer metals ions of ZIF-7@ZIF-67, quicken diffusion of electrolyte ions and improve the capacitance performance compared to the ZIF-7 and ZIF-67. ZIF-7@ZIF-67 delivers good energy storage ability with a specific capacitance of 518.9 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and remarkable stability with a retention of 99.6% after 4000 cycles in the three-electrode system. Furthermore, an all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device is assembled based on core-shell structured ZIF-7@ZIF-67 as positive electrode. Impressively, the ASC device displays an energy density of 31 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 400 W kg−1 and an excellent cyclic stability with 99.5% retention after 10,000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g−1. Finally, two all-solid-state ASCs are contacted to power various lighting-emitting diodes (LED). The red LED can be kept glowing for over 10 min. These electrochemical characteristics suggest that core-shell structured ZIF-7@ZIF-67 is a potential material for energy storage device with long-life cyclic stability.
