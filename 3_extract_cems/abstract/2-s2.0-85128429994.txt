This research work deals with a new adaptive Energy Management Strategy (EMS) for a multi-source hybrid electric vehicle. Three different kinds of power sources, fuel cell, battery, and supercapacitor, compose the power supply system, where all the sources are currentcontrolled and paralleled together with their associated DC/DC power converters on a common DC link. The DC bus voltage should be regulated regardless of load variations corresponding to the driving cycles. The flow of the systemâ€™s electrical energy is managed by an optimized filtering-based power sharing strategy that allows a flexible use of energy sources by an auto-adaptation to the electrical system states evolution. According to the proposed approach, the fuel cell and the battery are sheltered from harmful power dynamics, and the distribution of the energy demand is coordinated between the battery and the supercapacitor according to their state of charge, respectively. A Lyapunov based controller is conceived to maintain a constant DC-bus voltage. In order to track the reference currents determined by the proposed EMS approach, sliding mode controllers are designed to act on the converters. Numerical simulations on MATLAB/Simulink, and real-time implementation on an experimental test bench are carried out in order to evaluate and validate the performances of the novel proposed method. Different current profiles issued from urban driving situations are used to serve the study.
