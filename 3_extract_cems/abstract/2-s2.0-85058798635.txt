Ultrathin single crystalline nanoplates of Ni12P5 are synthesized via a facile, template-free, wet chemical method. The thickness is about 6 nm with sizes tunable from 5 to 50 nm. The exposed plate surface is formed of {2Â¯11} lattice plane. Benefitting from the high electrical conductivity and the two dimensional (2D) nanostructures, the Ni12P5 nanoplates exhibit excellent supercapacitor properties. The specific capacity is about 697 C/g at the current density of 1 A/g. Even at 20 A/g, it is measured as 446 C/g, with 64.0% retention indicating an outstanding rate capability. The charge storage mechanisms include a battery-type behavior related to the bulk redox processes and a double-layer capacitance arising from the 2D geometric morphology. In particular, the morphological effects accounts for about 63% of the total charge storage effects at the voltage sweep rate of 2 mV/s in the cyclic voltammetry measurement, and is even higher percentage-wise at a higher sweep rate. This is, by far, the best performance with facile synthesis techniques for single crystalline nickel phosphides.
