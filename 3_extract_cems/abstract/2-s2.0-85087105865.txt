Material storage property enrichment with good electrochemical performance is a foremost challenge. Cobalt hydroxide and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composite synthesized via chemical precipitation method showed improved specific capacitance and cycle stability. The unique rGO layered structure in composite enhanced overall electrochemical performance. Raman spectra revealed disordered rGO structure and A1g mode of Co(OH)2 in composite. rGO/Co(OH)2 electrode showed increased specific capacitance of 1100 Fg−1 at 0.5 Ag−1 with better rate capability and good stability (98.1%) after 2000 cycles. These results proved that rGO/Co(OH)2 is a perfect electrode for electrochemical energy storage applications.
