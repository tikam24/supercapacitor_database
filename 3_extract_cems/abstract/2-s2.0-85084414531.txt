Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-derived nanoarrays have been widely used as electrode materials in energy storage applications with the unique morphology and large specific surface area. Herein, we report a series of N-doped carbon arrays embedded with different metal compounds (noted as NC@Co3O4, NC@CoSe2 and NC@CoS2), which have been derived from a Co-based MOF through simple fabrication processes. The resulted structures have high surface-to-volume ratio and short charge-transfer paths in electrochemical reactions, which greatly benefit the energy storage performance. An asymmetric supercapacitor of NC@CoS2//Co-NC@Fe2O3 is also demonstrated, which has a power density up to 23.5 kW/kg and illustrates good cycling stability after long-time rapid charging and discharging. This work demonstrates a promising way to develop MOF-derived nanoarrays for flexible energy storage devices.
