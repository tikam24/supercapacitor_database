In response to direct driven wind power system with full scale back to back converter and permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG), an energy storage system (ESS) composed of supercapacitor and bidirectional DC/DC converter is proposed to improve the wind turbines' low voltage ride through (LVRT) capability. A detailed description of PMSG and its controller options were presented. And the characteristics of the ESS based on supercapacitor in balancing the flow power between the generator and the grids. Also, the simulation model of the whole system was established and the main parameters are presented. Simulation results show that ESS deals with the unbalance power quickly when the network voltage dips, and the DC-bus voltage keeps constant. Then the wind turbines are isolated from grid fault. The wind power system can remain connected to the grid and the system's low voltage ride through capability is enhanced.
