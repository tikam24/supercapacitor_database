In this work, commercial Ni foams are directly oxidized into Ni@Ni(OH) 2 foams in a mild NH 4 NO 3 solution at 80 Â°C. When used as binder-free electrodes, these Ni@Ni(OH) 2 electrodes demonstrate a high areal capacitance of 6.4 F/cm 2 at a current density of 2.5 mA/cm 2 , or 1.62 F/cm 2 at a high current density of 30 mA/cm 2 . Nevertheless, they show a poor cycling ability with 70.4% (or 42%) capacitance retention after 2000 (or 5000) cycles at 30 mA/cm 2 . This kind of electrodes has a promising application in low-cost, high-performance supercapacitor, if an effective strategy is found to improve their cycling ability.
