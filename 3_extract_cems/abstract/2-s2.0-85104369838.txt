In this study, nanocrystals of a cerium-based metal-organic framework (Ce-MOF), Ce-MOF-808, are directly grown on the surface of carboxylic acid-functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by a facile one-step solvothermal synthesis method. Ce-MOF-CNT nanocomposites with various Ce-MOF-to-CNT ratios are synthesized, and their crystallinity, morphology, porosity, and electrical conductivity are examined. The redox-hopping and electrochemical behaviors of the pristine Ce-MOF in aqueous electrolytes are investigated, suggesting that the pristine Ce-MOF is electrochemically active but possesses a limited charge-transport behavior. As a demonstration, all the Ce-MOF, CNT, and nanocomposites are used as active materials for application in aqueous-based supercapacitors. The capacitive performance of the CNT can be significantly boosted with the help of redox-active Ce-MOF-808 nanocrystals.
