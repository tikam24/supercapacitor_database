In this work, hierarchical Co3O4@MnO2 nanosheet (NS) hybrid nanostructures are grown on carbon cloth by a facile method combining the metal–organic framework (MOF) templating process and electrodeposition. Due to the synergetic effect between Co3O4 triangle NSs and MnO2 NSs and the unique structure with large surface area and numerous channels for ion diffusion, the Co3O4@MnO2 core–shell NS array electrode shows good electrochemical properties with a high specific capacitance of 644.8 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, remarkable rate capability (capacitance retention of 64.5% at 20 A g−1) and excellent cycle performance (capacitance retention of 91% after 3000 cycles at 5 A g−1). The excellent electrochemical performance makes the Co3O4@MnO2 core–shell NSs promising candidates in supercapacitors.
