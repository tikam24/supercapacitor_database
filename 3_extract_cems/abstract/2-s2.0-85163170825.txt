Iron oxide (FeO) nanoparticles have gained considerable interest from researchers over the past few decades and have a massive effect on wave absorption materials, magnetic fluid, adsorbent, and a variety of industrial applications. In this study, ferric nitrate, sodium hydroxide, and ammonium hydroxide coalesced to form FeO nanoparticles using the chemical co-precipitation approach. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), UV-VIS analysis, Photoluminesence (PL) spectrum analysis, and electrochemical measurements were used to characterize FeO nanoparticles. As per XRD, the sample's crystallite size was 22.63 nm and 22.64 nm after it was annealed at 300°C and 400°C, respectively. Utilizing XRD, the diffraction patterns were seen. The particles appear to have a fine surface and smooth shape, as seen by SEM photographs. For the detection of FeO nanoparticles, optical and electrochemical examinations were carried out.
