This paper proposes a high-efficiency energy storage system within the micro resistance welding device based on battery-supercapacitor semi-active hybrid topology. A SEPIC converter is considered for power distribution between energy storages in order to improve the Li-ion battery performance in terms of cycle life and to increase the efficiency of the overall energy storage system. A comprehensive analysis of energy storage system losses has shown that the efficiency of the proposed topology is 92% at the target switching frequency of 100 kHz. Finally, the theoretical analysis is validated by simulation results, which illustrate the supercapacitor charging process and voltage and current traces of the SEPIC converter individual components.
