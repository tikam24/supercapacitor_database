Placement, sizing and cost of power electronic switches and converters in battery energy systems (BESS) are critical parameters for consideration to implement in real applications. Present battery systems incorporate highly accurate measurement systems and controllers for efficient management. However, lower energy efficiency and flexibility cause to limit the performance of large-scale battery systems. In this paper, with the view to increase the performance (in terms of flexibility, lifetime, efficiency, safety and reliability) of battery packs, a new design of battery and switches, also known as reconfigurable battery is developed and control strategies have been presented. To show and compare the performance, a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) is developed, which consists of reconfigurable battery, super capacitor and power electronic interfaces. The proposed system is modeled in the time domain simulation of MATLAB/SIMULINKÂ®. Results demonstrate that proper control strategy in the drive-train can improve the deliverable energy efficiency and flexibility, without compromising the health of the battery cells.
