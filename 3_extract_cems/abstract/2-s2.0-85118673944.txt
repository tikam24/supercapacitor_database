Carbon aerogels prepared from low-cost renewable resources are promising electrode materials for future energy storage applications. However, their electrochemical properties must be significantly improved to match the commercially used high-carbon petroleum products. This paper presents a facile method for the green synthesis of carbon aerogels (CAs) from lignocellulosic materials and graphene dots (GDs) from commercially available biochar. The produced carbon aerogels exhibited a hierarchical porous structure, which facilitates energy storage by forming an electrical double-layer capacitance. Surprisingly, the electrochemical analyses of the GD-doped carbon aerogels revealed that in comparison to pristine carbon aerogels, the surface doping of GDs enhanced the electrochemical performance of carbon aerogels, which can be attributed to the combined effect from both double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance. Herein, we designed and demonstrated the efficacy of a supercapacitor device using our green carbon electrode as a sustainable option. These green carbon aerogels have opened a window for their practical use in designing sustainable energy storage devices.
