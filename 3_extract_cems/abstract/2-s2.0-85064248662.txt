Nitrogen-doped activated carbon (NAC) with a high specific surface area was successfully fabricated through graphitization derived from cotton and ammonia doping. The obtained NAC exhibits an enhanced specific capacitance of 156.4 F g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 and good cycling stability with capacitance retention of 95% after 5000 cycles. Hydrothermal route was used to synthesize CuCo 2 O 4 nanoneedles with diameter of 20 to 50 nm. CuCo 2 O 4 electrode showed good electrochemical performance with specific capacitance of 390 F g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 and high stability. Based on the two electrodes, an all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was assembled, which can achieve specific capacitance of 26.2 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 , energy density of 8.2 Wh kg −1 at a power density of 750 W kg −1 and still retains 5.6 Wh kg −1 at power density of 7500 W kg −1 . Two ASCs in series successfully illuminated 52 LEDs connected in parallel, indicating the practical application of the device.
