Conductive polymers implemented in fibrous energy devices have drawn considerable attention because of their economic importance, good environmental stability, and electrical conductivity. Conductive polymers demonstrate interesting mechanical, electronic, and optical properties, controllable chemical and electrochemical behavior, and facile processability. This review elaborates on the latest research in conductive polymers in fibrous energy devices, such as fibrous supercapacitors, fibrous solar cells, and fibrous integrated energy devices. The performance requirements of these fibrous energy devices, with specific reference to related materials, fabrication techniques, fiber structure, and electronic transport as well as mechanical functionality, are also reviewed in this paper.
