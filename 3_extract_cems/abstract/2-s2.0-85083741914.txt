N-doped carbon encased iron catalyst is a potential alternative of Pt/C for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The adjacent Fe-Nx and FexC within the Fe@N/C structure is normally identified as the main active sites toward ORR. Here, we prepared Fe2O3/Fe3C nanoparticles wrapped in nitrogen doped porous carbon nanosheets (Fe-N@C) via pyrolyzing the composites of L-leucine and FeCl3. The optimized sample Fe-N@C-800 showed high ORR catalytic activities with the half-wave potential of 0.82 V (vs. RHE), the onset potential of 0.90 V and electronic transfer number of 3.82. It also exhibited stronger methanol tolerance and better electrochemical stability than commercial Pt/C under 0.1 M alkaline condition. The good ORR performance of the catalyst could be associated with the synergy among Fe3C, Fe2O3 nanoparticles and nitrogen doped carbon. Besides, Fe-N@C-800 also possessed the high specific capacitance (240 F g−1) and good rate capability in KOH aqueous electrolyte. The assembled symmetric capacitor based on Fe-N@C-800 shown a high energy density of 15.4 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 225 W kg−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. In particular, the capacitance of Fe-N@C-800 was not attenuated after 130,000 cycles in alkaline electrolyte, indicating excellent long-term stability.
