Spherical porous VN materials were synthesized by a facile NH 3 reduction method with spherical V 2 O 5 as the precursor,while the spherical V 2 O 5 was prepared via soft template method and spray drying technology. The structure, morphology and electrochemical performance of the prepared VN were characterized by means of XRD,SEM,TEM,and N 2 adsorption-desorption analysis, as well as cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge- discharge measurements. The results show that the synthesized spherical porous VN powder presents cubic crystallographic structure with abundant mesopores,and its specific surface area is 120 m 2 •g -1 . In addition, the spherical porous VN powder presents characteristics both in electrical double- layer capacitance and redox pseudo- capacitance. Its specific capacitance is 513 F•g -1 by current density of 100 mA•g -1 ,and which remained 76.8% even after 5000 cycles. For power density is 590 W•kg -1 ,its energy density is 65.0 W•h•kg -1 . When the power density was 3260 W•kg -1 ,the energy density was as high as 24.17 W•h•kg -1 .
