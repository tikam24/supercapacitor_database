Aligned Ni-NiO core-shell nanowire arrays on a glass substrate were prepared via electrochemical deposition using porous alumina oxide templates. The core-shell nanowire electrodes displayed prominent supercapacitive behaviors. The rate capability of the electrodes depends strongly on the thickness of the NiO shell layers.
