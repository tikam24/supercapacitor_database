The need of energy harvesting and storage in stand alone embedded systems is a primary issue to be tackled to grant effectiveness of the technology in a wide spectrum of applications. Once electric power is extracted from the energy providing sources it must be effectively stored into the storage means to power the electronics. In this paper, two storage solutions for tiny embedded systems are discussed and tested in a real deployment. The first solution relies on a twin battery system, the second on a supercapacitor-based one. Â© 2009 IEEE.
