The proper design of a polysaccharide/hydrocolloid modifier significantly affects the conductivity, self-healing, and viscoelastic properties of nanocomposite hydrogels. Due to the presence of different functional groups, these hydrogels can participate in the covalent, hydrogen and dynamic bonding of a system. The improvement of interactions in this system can lead to the development of high-performance nanocomposite hydrogels. In this study, resilient, self-healing and self-adhesive conductive nanocomposite hydrogels were produced by multiple and diverse coordination connections between various polysaccharide-based modifiers (Arabic gum, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, and xanthan), the poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) network and different graphene-based fillers. Graphene nanoplatelets (GNP), activated carbon black (ACB), and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) have distinct functionalized surfaces, which were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Furthermore, the introduction of fillers balanced the hydrogelsâ€™ viscoelastic properties and electrical conductivity, providing the hydrogels with resilience, improved electrical conductivity, and extreme stretchability (5000%). The self-healing properties were analyzed using time-dependent measurements in a shear strain mode using an RSO Rheometer. The improvement in electrochemical and conductivity properties was confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The obtained conductive nanocomposite hydrogels design opens new possibilities for developing high-performance polysaccharide-based hydrogels with wearable electrical sensors and healthcare monitoring applications.
