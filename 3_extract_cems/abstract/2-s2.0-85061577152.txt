In order to stabilize the wind power fluctuation, this paper proposed a method that using the wavelet packet to decompose the wind power signal to obtain the overrun component of power fluctuation, applying higher order statistics analysis to acquire the characteristic value of each component, classifying each the component by using support vector machine algorithm, obtaining the high and low frequency fluctuation component which needed to absorb respectively by using supercapacitor and hydrogen production and generation system in the wind hydrogen hybrid energy storage system, the power smoothing control strategy of wind hydrogen hybrid energy storage system is built. At last, The proposed method can stabilize the wind power fluctuation and smooth the wind power curve effectively, by comparing with the conventional hybrid energy storage system in the simulation, it provides a reference for the new energy storage technology of the Power to Gas.
