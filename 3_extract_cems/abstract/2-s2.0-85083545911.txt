High-surface area activated graphene has a three-dimensional porous structure that makes it difficult to prepare dispersions. Here we report a general approach that allows the preparatioon of stable water-based dispersions/inks at concentrations of ≲20 mg/mL based on activated graphene using environmentally friendly formulations. Simple drying of the dispersion on the substrate allows the preparation of electrodes that maintain the high specific surface area of the precursor material (∼1700 m2/g). The electrodes are flexible because of the structure that consists of micrometer-sized activated graphene grains interconnected by carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The electrodes prepared using activated graphene demonstrate performance superior to that of reduced graphene oxide in supercapacitors with KOH and TEA BF4/acetonitrile electrolytes providing specific capacitance values of 180 and 137 F/g, respectively, at a specific current of 1 A/g. The high surface area of activated graphene in combination with the good conductivity of CNTs allows an energy density of 35.6 Wh/kg and a power density of 42.2 kW/kg to be achieved. The activated graphene dispersions were prepared in liter amounts and are compatible with most industrial deposition methods.
