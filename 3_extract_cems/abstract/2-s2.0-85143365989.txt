Graphene is rapidly expanding for applications ranging from nanoelectronics to space exploration. A material with such enormous potential requires a variety of synthesis methods. Here, we report a library of relatively sustainable redox-active organic molecules for the reduction of graphene oxide (GO) namely N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD), 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ), ferrocene (Ferro), and decamethylferrocene (DFerro). Among them, the reduction of GO using TMPD starts even with simple hand-shaking for just a few minutes. By controlling the sonication time under ambient conditions, one can control the electronic properties of the reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The resulting free-standing films delivered a capacitance of 185 F/g when tested them as supercapacitor electrodes. We also demonstrated that TMPD can exfoliate graphite into few-layer graphene sheets with simple sonication. We further show that under mild heating, these molecules can serve as dopants during the reduction process to produce nitrogen-doped graphene. Our results may guide researchers to explore sustainable organic molecules for the large-scale production of graphene-based materials for diverse applications.
