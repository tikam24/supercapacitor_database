In the global energy market, hybrid power system (HPS) is pave attractive approach due to the integration of renewable and/or alternative energy resources. Renewable energy is highly dependent upon atmospheric conditions, so, in order to meet the sustained load, various energy sources need to integrate with one another. This paper presents photovoltaic (PV), solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and super-capacitor (SC) based gird-integrated hybrid power system. PV is the primary power source of the HPS, whereas, SOFC-electrolyzer system and SC are used backup sources. In order to meet the sustained load, the power flow between different energy sources, storages unit and residential load is managed by using a power management algorithm (PMA). The performance of the HPS, for different scenarios of PMA is varied under dynamic load demand and varying weather conditions. The stated HPS is developed using MATLAB/Simulink.
