In this manuscript, the load frequency control (LFC) of multiple area hybrid power system (PS) integrated with renewable energy sources (RESs) using energy storage system (ESS) is proposed. The proposed hybrid method is the joint execution of Meta-heuristic Anopheles Search Algorithm (MASA) and artificial intelligence (AI) technique and hence it is named as MASAAI technique. The main aim of the proposal is “to diminish the load frequency deviations in 3-area hybrid PS.” The thyristor controlled phase shifter (TCPS) and ultra-capacitor (UC) application are used in LFC. During the operation of power system, the power distribution quality is suffered owing to continual and random changes in load. Hence, the PS control is necessary for maintaining a continual balance amid the power generation and load demand. The proportional integral derivative (PID) is agreed to LFC mode. Here, the 3-area system is incorporated with conventional RESs like solar, biomass, and fuel cell. UPFC is joined in series with tie-line, ensures the stabilization of the system and also presents more service and the quality of power is sustained by the subordinate control of super capacitor energy storage. With the help of MASAAI method, suppressing the peak value of the frequency deviation by power modulation control is a way to lessen this issue. With this proper control, the MASAAI method efficiency becomes optimum in deregulated environment that is agreed to LFC mode. Finally, the proposed method is activated in MATLAB/Simulink site and the performance is compared with existing methods. Finally, the simulation outcomes demonstrate that the efficiency of MASAAI method is more efficient compared to the existing methods.
