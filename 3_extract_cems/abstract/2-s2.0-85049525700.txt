In this study, carbon nanorods (CNR) and graphene nanoribbons (GNR) derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) were first prepared by solvothermal method. Then, Ni-Co layered double hydroxide (LDH)/CNR and LDH/GNR composite materials for supercapacitors were synthesized using a facile co-precipitation method. With the help of GNR, the Ni-Co LDH/GNR composite material showed great specific capacity (1765 F g-1), rate performance (68% capacity retention when current density increased from 1 to 20 A g-1) and cycling stability (83% capacity retention after 2000 charge-discharge cycles at 5 A g-1). Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) with Ni-Co LDH/GNR as positive and activated carbon (AC) as negative electrodes was fabricated. The ASC device delivered a high energy density of 25.4 W h kg-1 at power density of 749 W kg-1 and exhibited excellent cycling stability (96% specific capacity retention after 5000 cycles).
