Battery electric vehicles are the optimum way of clean transportationwithout any pollutant emission. The power source needs to have both high powerand high energy densities in electric vehicles. Lithium-ion is the most energy- andpower-dense battery type, compared with the other types; however, none of theother commercial batteries provide both of these two features together. Therefore, mostly battery-supercapacitor hybrid systems including high-energy batteries andhigh power supercapacitors are used. Supercapacitors have higher power densitiesand longer life cycle than batteries; however, they are heavy and have longer chargeand discharge times. Besides, following the development in lithium battery technologies, features of lithium batteries are improving while the prices decrease.Thus, a suitable battery can be used rather than a supercapacitor in order to maintainhigh power. In this study, a new structure named hybrid battery system is proposed.The system includes two different lithium batteries with different energy and powercharacteristics. One of these batteries has high energy density, while the other hashigh power density. In this paper, the proposed system is introduced in details, energy management of the system is performed, and the results are validated byreal-time experiments by using Kokam SLPB55205130H and Altairnano 13 Ahautomotive-grade batteries.
