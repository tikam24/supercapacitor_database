Hydrogel materials are receiving increasing research interest due to their intriguing structures that consist of a crosslinked network of polymer chains with interstitial spaces filled with solvent water. This feature endows the materials with the characteristics of being both wet and soft, making them ideal candidates for electrolyte materials for flexible energy storage devices, such as supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries that are under intensive studies nowadays. More importantly, the highly abundant and tunable chemistries of these hydrogels allow the introduction of novel functionalities into the existing hydrogels so that it is possible to fabricate unprecedented energy storage devices with additional functions. Here, the state-of-the-art advances of the hydrogel materials for flexible energy storage devices including supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries are reviewed. In addition, devices with various kinds of functions, such as self-healing, shape memory, and stretchability, are also included to stress the critical role of hydrogel materials. Furthermore, the challenges embedded in the current technologies are also highlighted and discussed with the hope to continually boost future research for the fast-developing field.
