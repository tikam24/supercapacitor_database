Three-dimensional CuO nanoflowers were prepared on the surface of flexible Cu foil (CuO@Cu) by a chemical deposition method. The morphology and composition of CuO nanoflowers were examined by scanning electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction spectroscopy, respectively. The electrochemical supercapacitive properties of CuO nanoflowers were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Electrochemical tests indicated that the optimized product showed a high specific capacitance of 284.5 F g−1 at the current density of 0.5 mA cm−2. EIS analysis indicated that the CuO nanoflowers exhibited good conductivity and very low internal resistance. The cyclability of the electrode demonstrates a 20% loss in capacitance over 1000 cycles. Thus, the results revealed that CuO nanoflower active materials hold the potential for electrochemically stable supercapacitors.
