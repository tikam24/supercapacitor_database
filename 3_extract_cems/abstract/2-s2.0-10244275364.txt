A simulation model for a hybrid electric vehicle is developed. A permanent magnet synchronous motor is considered for the drive part of the hybrid electric vehicle which comprises three energy sources: (i) a fuel cell, (ii) a battery bank, and (iii) a supercapacitor. A rotor-oriented speed controller is designed, and also verified by simulation results, to achieve trajectory tracking requirements of the hybrid electric vehicle within the inverter voltage and current limits.
