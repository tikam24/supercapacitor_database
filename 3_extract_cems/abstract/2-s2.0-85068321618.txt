As fuel cell systems, originally have a large time-constant to deliver energy into a load, it is very critical in distributed generation systems, especially those based on fuel cells to response more rapidly to disturbances. In this paper, a new method based on ultra capacitor systems and bidirectional buck-boost converter is proposed to improve voltage response of fuel cells under the condition of rapid load changes. To illustrate the validity of the method, the proposed system has been employed and simulated by MATLAB SIMULINK. The simulation results show that slow-response drawback of fuel is eliminated appropriately.
