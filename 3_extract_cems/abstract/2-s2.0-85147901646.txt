Supercapacitor devices are emerging as one of the promising energy devices for the future energy technology. This chapter focuses on metal oxide based nanomaterials as the electrodes for supercapacitors. The size, morphology and orientation of metal oxide nanostructures can also be easily tuned, which makes it possible to systematically investigate the relationships between the structure and electrochemical properties. Most metal oxides are of great interest because of their richness in nature and low cost. The chapter discusses metal oxides including Co3 O4, NiO, Fe2 O3, MnO2, and V2O5. The chapter presents different synthesis methods and characteristics of electrode materials and energy storage mechanism of supercapacitors. It also discusses the disadvantages of supercapacitors based on metal oxide materials. It is very important to integrate active/synergetic nanostructures into flexible substrates for improving energy density and power density of the devices. Integration of diverse conducting agents can also improve the overall electrical conductivity of metal oxide films/arrays.
