In this paper the common rectifier, connected to the diesel-generator used in the drivetrain of large off-road vehicles, is omitted in favour of an inverter with field-oriented control. The generator in casu is a salient-pole wound-rotor synchronous machine. The FOC allows fast and accurate control of the power delivered by the diesel-generator to the dc-bus of the electric motors. This fast dynamic control allows the combination of the diesel-generator with a dc-dc converter connected supercapacitor storage system. The supercapacitor storage system allows partial recuperation of the regenerative brake energy provided by the electric motors. The stored energy is later used to power the auxiliaries during stand-still of the vehicle and to power the electric motors during slow-speed driving. This results in significant fuel savings and a wear- and-tear reduction as the diesel-generator can be switched off during down-hill driving, stand-still and slow-speed driving.
