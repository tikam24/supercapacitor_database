The supercapacitor tank is used to save and feedback energy which is conventionally wasted by a breaking resistor in crane. This paper proposes a bidirectional buck-boost converter to interface the difference in voltage level between the supercapacitor tank and DC bus in transducer. The control strategy of buck and boost model was unified, the current of inductance was used to demonstrate working condition. Theory analysis and simulation results also proved the feasibility and effective of the proposed topology. Simulation results show that the unify control for bidirectional buck-boost converter was suitable for supercapacitor energy storage system in crane.
