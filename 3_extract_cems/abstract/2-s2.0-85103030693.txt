The study of metal–organic framework (MOF) as supercapacitor materials has attracted much attention. Here, a novel vapor-phase approach is developed to in situ grow arrays of Cu2+1O (Cu2O with metal excess defects) @Cu-MOF clusters on copper foam (CF) from the well-aligned Cu(OH)2 nanorods in response to the exposure in the ligand gas. Benefiting from highly oriented and hierarchical structure of Cu-MOF clusters arrays, synergistic effect between Cu2+1O and Cu-MOF, and intimate connection of Cu2+1O@Cu-MOF and CF, the Cu2+1O@Cu-MOF/CF displays enhanced specific capacitance compared to Cu(OH)2/CF and Cu2+1O/CF (≈2.5 F cm−2 vs ≈0.8 and 0.9 F cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2). The quantitative analysis reveals that the capacitance of the Cu2+1O@Cu-MOF/CF is largely contributed by the surface capacitive processes, consisting of double-layer capacitance coming from porous Cu-MOF and Faradaic capacitance rooting from Cu ion. The asymmetric supercapacitor of Cu2+1O@Cu-MOF/CF//AC achieves high energy density of 38.3 Wh kg−1 at power density of 824.6 W kg−1 with capacitance retention of 90% after 5000 cycles. This study provides new avenue for in situ growth of MOF as electrodes for supercapacitors, by directly using high conductive metal as precursor through vapor-phase approach, rather than traditional combination of linkers and metal salts in organic solvent.
