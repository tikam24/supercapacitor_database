Technology producers and distribution specialists expect energy storage to resolve the fluctuations in energy supply caused by solar and unstable wind power. Techniques are in continuous improvement, the research and technological development provides innovative solutions for fixing the variations, and the system operators integrate new technologies into the network. Despite all mentioned, the massive integration of the bank technologies has not found exploitation in Estonia. In addition to solving fluctuation issues, energy storage is preferable in places where new small power plants or other renewable systems require new line construction. Unfortunately, in this situation, a connection to the network becomes expensive. Therefore, the stand-alone storage with a generator is a less expensive solution for the new consumer or producer. Currently, Distributed System Operator Elektrilevi already has one technological solution for the described case as an off-grid solution in isolated and remote locations. Still, in some urban places exist buildings with very high electricity consumption, where any changes may cause more expenses.This paper provides four scenarios for a residential building with a veto for ten years on making any changes in agreement with service providers and the existing system, where power is used for heat and water heating. The craftily, but at the same time, legally composed service providing contract leads to annual high electricity bills. The solution for the building is found and represented in the current study.
