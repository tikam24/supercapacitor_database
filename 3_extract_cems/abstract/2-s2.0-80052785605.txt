The performance of mixed bi-material electrodes composed of the battery material, LiMn2O4, and the electrochemical capacitor material, activated carbon, for hybrid electrochemical energy storage devices is investigated by galvanostatic charge/discharge and pulsed discharge experiments. Both, a high and a low conductivity lithium-containing electrolyte are used. The specific charge of the bi-material electrode is the linear combination of the specific charges of LiMn2O4 and activated carbon according to the electrode composition at low discharge rates. Thus, the specific charge of the bi-material electrode falls between the specific charge of the activated carbon electrode and the LiMn2O 4 battery electrode. The bi-material electrodes have better rate capability than the LiMn2O4 battery electrode. For high current pulsed applications the bi-material electrodes typically outperform both the battery and the capacitor electrode. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
