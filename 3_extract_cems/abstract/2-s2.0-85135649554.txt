Flexible supercapacitors (FSCs) or ultra-capacitors have attracted the main attention for advanced energy storage, because of their high specific capacitance (HSC), high current density (HCD) or high energy density (HED), high power density (HPD), long cycle life, a cost-effective and wide range of temperature. The carbon materials are extracted from biomass waste, including dried leaves, flower seeds, stem, outer shell, root, and fruits which are excellent promising electrode materials for flexible supercapacitors. The uses of these carbon electrode materials for FSC have several essential properties like eco-friendly, simple, sustainable, recyclable, and widely available across the world. Here, in this chapter, we discussed about the preparation of carbon-derived composite materials and their properties which are represented as CNT-conducting polymer composite, CNT-metal oxide composite, and activated carbon-conducting polymer composite and activated carbon-metal oxide composite. At last, prepared composite materials have attracted great potential for energy storage devices (ESD). The main aim of this article is to give an overview of the latest progress of the development of the FSCs modified based on the carbon electrode materials and also discusses their challenge and perspectives in this field.
