Binder restricts electrode materialâ€™s performance by increasing the contact resistance and preventing electrolytes from utilizing the whole surface area of the electrode. A binder-free supercapacitor is a new approach for improving the performance of supercapacitors by growing or depositing the active material on the conducting substrate. It will also increase the flexibility and energy density of the supercapacitor device because dead mass has been removed. Binder-free electrode material can be fabricated by physical, thermal, and electrical methods. This article discusses different fabrication methods and performances of binder-free electrodes for supercapacitor applications.
