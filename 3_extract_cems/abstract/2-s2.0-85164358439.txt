In this study, binder-free carbon nanofibers (CNFs) were coated on a porous metallic nickel foam (NF) substrate using a solution-based spin-coating method to produce flexible supercapacitor electrodes. The morphology, elemental composition, and electrochemical performance of the flexible electrodes were analyzed. A specific capacitance of 89 Â± 0.15 F/g and a specific energy of 8 Wh/kg with a high specific power of 400 W/kg at a current density of 1 A/g was measured from the flexible supercapacitor, using polyvinyl alcohol-potassium hydroxide as the gel electrolyte. The binder-free CNFs on the NF are an interesting flexible supercapacitor electrode because of its simple and easy electrode manufacturing process without the need for an external catalyst, expensive noble metals, and even complex thermal or chemical processes.
