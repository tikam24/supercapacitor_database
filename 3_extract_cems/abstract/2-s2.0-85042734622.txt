Currently, carbon materials, such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, activated carbon, porous carbon, have been successfully applied in energy storage area by taking advantage of their structural and functional diversity. However, the development of advanced science and technology has spurred demands for green and sustainable energy storage materials. Biomass-derived carbon, as a type of electrode materials, has attracted much attention because of its structural diversities, adjustable physical/chemical properties, environmental friendliness and considerable economic value. Because the nature contributes the biomass with bizarre microstructures, the biomass-derived carbon materials also show naturally structural diversities, such as 0D spherical, 1D fibrous, 2D lamellar and 3D spatial structures. In this review, the structure design of biomass-derived carbon materials for energy storage is presented. The effects of structural diversity, porosity and surface heteroatom doping of biomass-derived carbon materials in supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries are discussed in detail. In addition, the new trends and challenges in biomass-derived carbon materials have also been proposed for further rational design of biomass-derived carbon materials for energy storage.
