Fabrication of new materials with unique nanostructure has emerged as a potent strategy to enhance their properties for various applications. Presently, we report the successful incorporation of SnSe (a metal chalcogenide) into LaDySn2O7 (a pyrochlore) in order to enhance the electrochemical performance as well as stability of composite. The synthesized materials were characterized by various techniques to confirm the phase and morphology. A good pseudocapacitive behavior was observed through cyclic voltammetry. Galvanostatic charge/discharge profile of nanocomposite affirmed a specific capacitance of 1780 F/g at 0.1 A/g. Moreover, the fabricated electrode material showed an excellent specific power of 6157.411 W/kg at a current density of 0.3 A/g. An excellent electrochemical stability of the composite material after 2000 cycles was also observed. These properties make the fabricated material a potential candidate for supercapacitor applications.
