Polyaniline/Graphene oxide (PANI/GO) composite was synthesized via in situ polymerization in the presence of graphene oxide under acidic conditions. The PANI/GO was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), FT-IR, scanning electron microscope (SEM). The electrochemical tests showed that GO could enhance the electrochemical performance of the PANI electrode material. In electrochemical supercapacitors, PANI/GO electrode showed a higher capacity of 413.28 F/g compared with 322.56 F/g of PANI electrode. After 1 000 cycles, the capacity of PANI/GO electrode still maintained 70% of the original capacity. The cathodes prepared using PANI and PANI/GO delivered initial discharge capacities of 78 mAh/g and 104.4 mAh/g, respectively and stable reversible capacities of 50 mAh/g and 103.7 mAh/g after 50 charge-discharge cycles, respectively. PANI/GO is a good candidate as electrode material in lithium ion batteries and electrochemical supercapacitors.
