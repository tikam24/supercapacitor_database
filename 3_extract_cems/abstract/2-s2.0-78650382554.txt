Ordered crystallized Co3O4 nanoarrays were synthesized by replicating mesoporous silica template and its electrochemical capacitance performance was evaluated in 6 mol/L KOH electrolyte solution. Electrochemical tests results indicated that the ordered mesoporous structure of Co3O4 nanoarrays provide a capacitance of about 250 F/g, approximately four times larger than that of Co3O4 prepared by direct calcining Co(NO3)·6H2O at 550°C and also exhibits a good rate capability. This is due to that the well ordered mesoporous structure provide large specific surface area and facilitates the fast transport of the electrolyte.
