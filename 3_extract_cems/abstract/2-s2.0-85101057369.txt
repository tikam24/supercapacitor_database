Among the existing anode materials for lithium-ion capacitors (LICs), Nb-based oxides are considered as one of the most promising anode materials. This review takes Nb2O5, M-Nb-O (M = Ti, Cr, Ga, Fe, Zr, Mg, Li, Na, K, etc.) and (H, Li, K)-Ti-Nb-O group anode materials as examples, and introduces the advantages of niobium-based oxides as anode materials for LICs, the energy storage mechanism, synthetic methods. Moreover, the existing problems for each material currently and corresponding solutions are proposed, which will promote their further development and applications in the field of emerging energy storage devices.
