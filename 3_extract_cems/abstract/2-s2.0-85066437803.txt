The rapid development of wearable and portable electronic devices towards "lightweight" and "miniaturization" has greatly stimulated the strong demand for high energy/power density, lightweight and portable and flexible energy storage devices in modern society. As a new type of micro-power storage device, in-plane micro-supercapacitors (IPMSCs) are considered as an important energy storage device for integrated electronic devices due to their ultra-thin thickness, high power density and long cycle life. However, with the development of IPMSC processing technology towards high efficiency, high precision, and low cost, the commonly used processing technologies cannot meet its requirements. A laser processing technology with easier operation, more scalable, higher precision and lower cost has been proposed and has become the research focus of IPMSC processing technology.The working principle and electrochemical performance of different types of IPMSCs are summarized, as well as the types and processing techniques of laser processing IPMSC are introduced in detail from four aspects of laser reduction, laser-induced, laser etching and laser sintering.The research progress of laser processing IPMSC in mechanical properties and electrochemical performance is reviewed.The characteristics and challenges of electrolytes used in IPMSC are summarized. Furthermore, based on the technical challenges faced by laser processing IPMSC, the application prospects in wearable and portable electronic devices are prospected.
