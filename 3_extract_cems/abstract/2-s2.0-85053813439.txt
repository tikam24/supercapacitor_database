Although ruthenium oxide nanoparticles (RuO 2 ), graphene, and their composites have been widely used as supercapacitor electrode materials, transparent supercapacitors of these materials have been rarely investigated. In this work, we fabricated high-performance transparent solid-state supercapacitors of 2 nm RuO 2 decorated on a 3D nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide aerogel (NGA) with 27-54% transparency. The as-fabricated symmetric supercapacitor of RuO 2 /NGA at a finely tuned mass loading of 16.3 μg cm -2 with a finely tuned transmittance of 34.1% at a wavelength of 550 nm exhibits a maximum areal energy of 0.074 μW h cm -2 and a maximum areal power of 64 μW cm -2 . The cycling stability of the device can also be maintained at 100% over 2000 cycles. The high transparent supercapacitor in this work may practically be used in many advanced transparent electrical devices.
