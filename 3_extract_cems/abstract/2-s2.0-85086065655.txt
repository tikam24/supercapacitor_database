In order to solve the problems of lack of scientific selection of calibration parameters and low efficiency of manual real-time calibration in simulation calibration processes of the control parameters of PHEBs under driving cycles, an automatic calibration method of control parameters was proposed in any driving cycles. Based on the actual bus driving cycles, an orthogonal experiment was designed to analyze the fuel consumption impact of control strategy parameters, and five control parameters with greater impacts were selected as calibration parameters. An optimization model of control parameters was constructed by using self-optimizing characteristics of optimization algorithm instead of manual analysis results and adjusting parameters. Real-time simulation platform for automatic calibration of control parameters was developed using Cruise, MicroAutoBox, Isight and other tools. Simulation results show that under the same calibration times, the time of automatic calibration is shortened by 75.51% compared with that of manual calibration. The fluctuation of supercapacitor SOC is reduced due to the reasonable torque distribution, and the fuel consumption of control strategy is reduced by 12.30% after automatic calibration. These results verify the feasibility of the calibration method herein.
