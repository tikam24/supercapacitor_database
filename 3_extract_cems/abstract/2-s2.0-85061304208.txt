A dinuclear cobalt-based pillar-layered-like metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), namely [Co2(TPPA)(sdba)2]n (1) has been synthesized hydrothermally (TPPA = tris(4-(pyridin-4-yl)phenyl)amine, H2sdba = 4,4′-sulfonyldibenzoic acid). MOF 1 features a two-fold interpenetrated CdSO4-type (cds) network. MOF 1 can be used as an electrode material for supercapacitors, the maximum specific capacitance is 75.7 F g−1 at current density 0.5 A g−1, while the maximum specific capacitance of the Co3O4 material with sheet-like nanoporous structure by calcination of 1 at 500 °C achieved 118.6 F g−1 at current density of 0.5 A g−1. The above two materials have excellent recycling stability, their capacitance retention can be kept at 94% and 97% after 3000 cycles at 1 A g−1 in 3 M KOH electrolyte, respectively. In addition, MOF 1 also displays photocatalytic activity for the decomposition of RhB under UV irradiation, approximately 94% of RhB was decomposed after 60 min.
