RuO2-TiO2 coating were prepared by thermal decomposition method on pure titanium TA2 substrate at 270â„ƒ. The supercapacitor behavior of RuO2-TiO2 coating was investigated by cyclic voltammetry(CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and charging-discharging test in 0.5 mol/L H2SO4, 0.5 mol/L Na2SO4 and 1.0 mol/L NaOH electrolytes, respectively. The results show that the Ti/RuO2-TiO2 electrode has low charge transfer resistance in acidic and alkaline electrolytes, and the specific capacitance of 550 F/g and 578 F/g are obtained in these two electrolytes, respectively. Conversely, the electrode has relative higher charge transfer resistance and lower specific capacitance (335 F/g) in neutral Na2SO4 electrolyte than that of in acidic and alkaline electrolytes. However, the electrode losing 17% and 29% of the maximum capacity after 2000 charging-discharging cycles in acidic and alkaline electrolytes, respectively, but just only 3% lost in neutral Na2SO4 solution. Combined with the SEM and EDS analysis, the electrode is hardly corroded in Na2SO4 solution, thus exhibits good cycle stability. In contrast, Ti/RuO2-TiO2 electrodes occur serious surface corrosion in NaOH solution, while occurring serious pitting corrosion in H2SO4 solution. Severe corrosion results in a significantly reduction of active substance, and thus reduces the charge capacity of the electrode.
