AgCuTe species have been proved to be an interesting materials in the field of thermoelectric. However, our recent research find that it is also particularly attractive for the supercapacitor system. Supercapacitors, which are distinguished of their high power density, long cycle life and fast charging/discharging rates, are expected to be widely used in energy storage devices. Herein, we first synthesize the metal chalcogenide-based AgCuTe0.9Se0.1 with high electrical conductivity (733 S cm-1@300K) for supercapacitor electrode. Specifically, it exhibits high specific capacitance of 2124 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 and 987 F g-1 at a current density of 10 A g-1. Moreover, it exhibits super-long cycle life (83.0% retention rates after 8,000 cycles at high current density of 10 A g-1). We speculate that this phenomenon may be attributed to the highly conductive of AgCuTe0.9Se0.1 itself, which simplifies the diffusion of electrolyte ions to access active materials and facilitates the rapid electron transport. Further, we will try to explore the in-depth analysis to understand whether there is a certain mechanism for applying thermoelectric materials to supercapacitors. Totally, our work find a new AgCuTe electrode material for supercapacitor, which is of paramount importance for advanced energy storage devices.
