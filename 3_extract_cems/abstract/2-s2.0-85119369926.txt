A novel and scalable method is reported to produce flexible and freestanding fabrics composed of high surface area activated carbon nanofibers (aCNF) for applications in supercapacitors. The electrochemical behavior of a symmetric supercapacitor using the aCNF electrodes and the operando Raman spectra study accomplished under polarization conditions are reported. The evolution of Raman spectra during polarization supported the aCNF stability and suggested the insertion of the HSO4− ions in carbon micropores. These findings evidenced a new symmetry at the aCNF/electrolyte interface, where electronic and ionic charges accumulate. The distributed capacitance in the time domain was studied by numeric differentiation of galvanostatic charge-discharge findings. The impedance behavior of the solid and liquid phases composing the aCNF/solution interface was modeled using a macro homogeneous description of two closely mixed phases represented by a single-channel transmission line incorporating the anomalous transport of the ionic charges in the disordered structure of aCNF. Electrochemical findings revealed outstanding charge-storage properties in neutral aqueous electrolyte resulting in long lifespan, low equivalent series resistance (12 mΩ g), high coulombic efficiency (∼99.8 %), a maximum distributed capacitance of 82 F g−1 (0.25 A g−1-1.1 V), maximum specific energy and power of 2.98 W h kg−1 and 72,672 W kg−1, respectively.
