The practical application of graphene (GR) has still been hindered because of its unsatisfied physical and chemical properties resulting from the irreversible agglomerates. Preparation of GR-based materials with designed porosities is essential for its practical application. In this work, a facile and scalable method is developed to synthesize carbon nanotubes/holey graphene (CNT/HGR) flexible film using functional CNT and HGR as precursors. Owing to the existence of the small amount CNT, the CNT-5/HGR flexible film with a 3D conductive interpenetrated architecture exhibit significantly improved ion diffusion rate compared to that of the HGR. Moreover, CNT-5/HGR flexible film can be used as binder-free supercapacitor electrodes with ultrahigh specific capacitances of 268 F gâˆ’1, excellent rate capabilities, and superior cycling stabilities. CNT-5/HGR flexible film could be used to fabricate high-performance flexible supercapacitors electrodes.
