Supercapacitor is a storage technology proposed as means of supplying short-duration transient energy. Inherent long time constant associated with supercapacitor means that this short-term energy transfer is inefficient. The proposed energy storage system combining supercapacitor and electrolytic capacitor is an improvement to supercapacitor based energy storage system with less volume, less cost and higher efficiency. Although the proposed system structure is simple with only two parallel capacitors, its performance relating to several parameters is improved. Based on constant current discharge mathematical model, relationship between the parallel system parameters and its performance are analysedand verified with experiment. It is shown that the parallel system improves energy transfer efficiency by 10% compared to supercapacitor system, and the efficiency can also be improved by adjusting certain parameters of the parallel system.
