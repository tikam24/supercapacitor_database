The dynamic physiochemical response of a functioning graphene-based aerogel supercapacitor is monitored in operando by soft X-ray spectroscopy and interpreted through ab initio atomistic simulations. Unanticipated changes in the electronic structure of the electrode as a function of applied voltage bias indicate structural modifications across multiple length scales via independent pseudocapacitive and electric double layer charge storage channels.
