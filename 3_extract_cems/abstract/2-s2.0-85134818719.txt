The boom in ultra-thin electronic devices and the growing need for humanization greatly facilitated the development of wearable flexible micro-devices. But the technology to deposit electrode material on flexible substrate is still in its infancy. Herein, the flexible symmetric micro-supercapacitors made of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on commercial printing paper as electrode materials were fabricated by combining tetrahedral preparator auxiliary coating method and laser-cutting interdigital configuration technique on a large scale. The electrochemical performance of the obtained micro-supercapacitors can be controlled and tuned by simple choosing different models of tetrahedral preparatory to obtain CNTs film of different thicknesses. As expected, the micro-supercapacitor based on CNTs film can deliver an areal capacitance up to 4.56 mF/cm2 at current of 0.02 mA. Even if, micro-supercapacitor undergoes continuous 10000 cycles, the performance of device can still remain nearly 100%. The as-demonstrated tetrahedral preparator auxiliary coating method and laser-cutting interdigital configuration technique provide new perspective for preparing microelectronics in an economical way. The paper electrode appended by CNTs achieves steerable areal capacitance, showing broad application prospect in fabricating asymmetric micro-supercapacitor with flexible planar configurations in the future.
