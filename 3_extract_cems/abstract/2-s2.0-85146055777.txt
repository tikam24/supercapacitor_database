La2CoMnO6 double perovskite was synthesized via modified combustion route. XRD with Rietveld refinement confirms monoclinic structure with space group of P21/n. Irregular shaped porous morphology was determined from FE-SEM and elemental analysis was done using EDAX spectra. Existence of mixed valence state of Co and Mn were verified by XPS spectra and its bandgap was determined using Tauc plot. Vibrational analysis validates the formation of perovskite phase and degeneracy in Raman modes/thermal broadening provides signature vibrational bands corresponding to stretching and bending motions of MnO6 and CoO6. Supercapacitor performance using La2CoMnO6 as electrode material exhibits 84% of cyclic stability after 500 cycles. The material exhibits a combined saturable and reverse saturable absorption behaviour under open aperture and self-defocusing nature due to thermal effect under closed aperture measurements with Z-scan method, using continuous wave irradiation. These findings confirmed that La2CoMnO6 manganite can be used for energy storage and photonic applications.
