Carbon materials with favourable porous architecture and heteroatom functionalities are well considered for energy storage applications due to its excellent structural and electrochemical properties. In this paper solid-state symmetric supercapacitor (SC) using heteroatom (nitrogen and oxygen) inherently co-doped microporous carbon (HMC) was investigated. HMC was prepared by simple carbonization method without any additives by adopting multistep experimental procedures. 4, 4′-diamino-diphenyl sulphone (DDS) was pyrolyzed at 950 °C in a single step and HMC with surface area of 1766 m2 g−1 and a total pore volume of 0.87 cm3 g−1 was obtained. The structural characteristics and the content of heteroatom functionalities were manipulated with pyrolysis time to improve the elctrochemical behaviour. The symmetrical SC was fabricated with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) supported 6 M KOH and 1 M Na2SO4 as gel electrolytes. The performance of solid-state SC showed good cycling stability and high energy density. The device exhibited a maximum energy density of 35 W h kg−1 with a maximum power density of 3180 W kg−1 remained stable (91% capacity retention) after 5000 cycles. Finally, the device using porous carbon electrode material with PVA+1 M Na2SO4 able to light a LED after charging for about 5sec.
