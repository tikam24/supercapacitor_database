A template-free strategy has always been attractive to design and fabricate advanced carbon materials with tunable nanostructures from cheap precursors. Herein, honeycomblike mesoporous carbons (HPCs) are prepared from pitch-based polymers through a self-assembly foaming strategy without using any templates. Rich mesopores specific in sizes of 2-5 nm and abundant open-ended honeycomblike holes endow a hierarchical pore-in-pore feature of HPCs and an ultrahigh specific surface area (3473 m 2 g -1 ). With their superior structure, HPCs can deliver a high supercapacity of 339 F g -1 at a current density of 1 A g -1 in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte and retain 85.6% of the capacity even at a current density of 50 A g -1 . Meanwhile, a supercapacitive cell assembled by two HPC electrodes yields a conspicuously ultrahigh energy density of 34.5 Wh kg -1 (12.8 Wh L -1 ) at a high power density of 679.4 W kg -1 (251.4 W L -1 ). This work provides a new method for the controllable synthesis of advanced carbon materials from pitch and presents further applications in flexible electrochemical supercapacitors.
