The recently increasing demand for portable or wearable electronic devices has called for advancements in portable and miniaturized energy storage devices. Microbatteries used for portable energy storage applications have shorter lifetime, low power density and can contain toxic constituents. Micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) are promising energy storage devices with high power density, short charge-discharge time, longer service time and contain no toxic metals or liquids. Micro-supercapacitors can be fabricated as sandwich type or planar type configuration. Planar architecture of micro-supercapacitors makes the device more flexible, decreases the ionic diffusion length and also easy on-chip integration of device compared to conventional three-dimensional architecture. The recent advancements in planar micro-supercapacitors in terms of fabrication methodology, material and architecture is reviewed in this paper.
