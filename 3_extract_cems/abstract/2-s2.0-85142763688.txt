Design of rational electrode materials with hierarchically structured pseudocapacitive materials has been identified as a successful strategy for revamping the electrochemical characteristics of supercapacitors. However, the simultaneous assurance of strong electrical conductivity and higher specific capacitance via a simple and cost-effective synthesis protocol is of concern today. In this work, Ni-CoWO4 incorporated MXene nanocomposite has been successfully prepared by a facile hydrothermal process. The structure, morphology, stoichiometry, and chemical characterization of the prepared Ni-CoWO4, Ti3C2Tx, and Ni-CoWO4@MXene nanocomposite were explored extensively. MXene demonstrated a layered 2D nanoscale structure whereas pure Ni-CoWO4 was composed of spherical nanoparticles. The composite Ni-CoWO4@MXene revealed the morphology of spherical Ni-CoWO4 nanoparticles decorated on MXene sheets. Furthermore, a series of electrochemical characterizations illustrated the contribution of the delightful morphology of Ni-CoWO4@MXene composite to excellent electrochemistry. The resultant Ni-CoWO4@MXene electrode exhibited high specific capacitance of 582 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 93.5 % capacitance retention over the 10,000 cycles., which is higher than that of the individual counterparts Ni-CoWO4 and MXene. The excellent electrochemical performance of Ni-CoWO4@MXene is attributed to the synergistic interaction between Ni-CoWO4 nanoparticles and nanolayered MXene that may create new active sites that enhanced the charge transfer, charge/discharge kinetics and the electrical conductivity. Significantly, the unique Ni-CoWO4@MXene supercapacitor prototype delivered a higher energy density of 85.7 Wh kg−1 and power density of 0.85 kW kg−1 establishing its superiority over other Co[sbnd]W based supercapacitors. A theoretical study was also performed to correlate the improved charge storage capacity of the prepared Ni-CoWO4@MXene composite.
