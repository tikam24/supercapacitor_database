Paper-based electrodes are of special interest for the industry due to their degradability, low cost, ion accessibility, and flexibility. However, the poor dispersibility and stability of loading conductive fillers, for example, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), limit their applications. In this study, bacterial cellulose (BC) was embedded within the cellulosic fiber matrix to prepare a paper substrate with a dual fiber matrix structure. BC with its unique nanoporous surface structure assisted the adsorbing, dispersing, and stabilizing of CNTs; cellulosic fibers reduced the cost, enhanced the ion accessibility, and improved the rigidity of the material. The prepared paper electrodes exhibited a high conductivity up to 5.9 Ã— 10-1 S/cm and an extraordinary durability under high bending strain; it can be rolled into a 2 mm radius 800 times while maintaining the conductivity almost constant. The paper electrode had a gravimetric capacitance up to 77.5 F/g, which remained more than 98% after 15,000 charge/discharge cycles. This study suggests that this paper electrode has potential applications in supercapacitors with high performance and durability.
