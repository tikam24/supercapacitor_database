The characteristics of large surface area, high conductivity and mechanical flexibility performances make graphene suitable for high power next-generation energy storage devices. However, it only stores charge through double-layer capacitors, which limits its energy storage mechanism, resulting in a limited specific capacitance of graphene. In this paper, black Ti3+ self-doped nano titanium dioxide rods (TiOxNRs) were introduced into graphene nanosheets to improve capacitor performance. The results manifest that when 20 wt% TiOxNRs were added into the TiOxNRs/rGO composite, the capacitance performance is the best and the specific capacitance value is 149.5 F g−1 at the scanning speed of 40 mV s−1. In addition, the specific capacitance of the electrode prepared with the TiOxNRs/rGO composite still maintains the original 89.57% after 2000 charge–discharge cycles and has a good cycle life at a current density of 1 A g−1. In short, the TiOxNRs/rGO composite is a prospect and potential material for supercapacitor electrodes in the future.
