Herein, we report a simple laser holography technology for hierarchically structuring and synchronous photoreduction of graphene oxides (GO), toward the development of efficient graphene-based electrodes for supercapacitor applications in cost effectively manners. Hierarchical micro-nanostructures, formed due to laser treatment induced photoreduction and ablation effect. Interestingly, both the morphology and reduction degree of the laser holography reduced GO (LHRGO) show strong dependence on the laser intensity, providing the feasibility for controlling the micro-nanostructures, chemical composition, and the conductivity of the graphene electrodes. Furthermore, the supercapacitors based on LHRGO show higher capacitance values and better electrochemical performance compared to that based on thermal reduced GO (TRGO) of same reduction level. Photoredution and micro-nanostructuring of GO using laser holography may hold great promise for production of effective carbon-based electrodes towards practical applications in energy storage devices.
