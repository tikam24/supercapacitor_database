The societal major concern of the moment is energy storage, energy production and global warming. Researchers are striving to create novel, highly efficient energy storage materials for developing faster, safer as well as more effective energy storage systems. One effective method to improve the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors (SCs) is the construction of highly efficient electro active materials, employing multivalent binary transition metal oxides (BTMOs) with electrical conducting polymers (CPs). For the first time, we report SrWO4/PPy composite synthesized by In-situ chemical polymerization route. The physio-chemical characteristics of the synthesized material was extensively examined with spectral and analytical techniques. SrWO4/PPy composite on Ni foil was fabricated as an alternate electrode material and was investigated for its capacitive behaviour. SrWO4/PPy electrode achieved a high specific capacitance of 747 Fg-1 at 5 mVsâˆ’1 and a remarkable cyclic stability of 93.8% even after 5000 cycles at 1 Ag-1. The notable electrochemical property of the electrode was attributed to its distinctive composite morphology, which is crucial in facilitating high conductivity, quick electron transfer, short ion diffusion distance and excellent active sites for enhanced electrochemical performance. The substantial capacitive behaviour can be attributed to the synergetic effect of SrWO4 and PPy. This work introduces platform to design efficient electrodes for the energy storage devices as well as for wearable electronics.
