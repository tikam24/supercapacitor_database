Storage technologies devices are very interesting solutions for improving energy saving and guaranteeing contemporaneously to enhance the electrical characteristics of Light Rail Transit (LRT) systems. Onboard Energy Storage System based on Lithium Ion Capacitor (LiC) devices represent a viable engineering solution for energy saving optimization. The authors suggest a multi-objective design optimization procedure based on catenary and storage power losses minimization. A test characterization of ESS has been presented in order to use the better appropriate modeling of LiC for the examined case study. The numerical simulation allows to confirm the feasibility of the proposed design procedure.
