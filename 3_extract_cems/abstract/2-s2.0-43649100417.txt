A new type of supercapacitor was constructed by using carbon nanofibers (CNFs) and DAAQ (1,5-diaminoanfhraquinone) oligomer. DAAQ was deposited on the carbon nanofibers by chemical polymerization with ammonium peroxodisulfate ((NH4J2S2O8) as oxidant in the 0.1 M H2SO4. Polymerization reaction was carried out with constant sonication. From the analysis, it is clear that surface of carbon nanofibers was quite uniformly coated with DAAQ. The performance characteristics of the supercapacitors have been evaluated using Cyclic Voltammetry. CNFs/DAAQ based composite electrode showed relatively good electrochemical behaviors in acidic electrolyte system. CNFs/DAAQ composite electrode showed relatively good capacitance (7 Ah/kg) compared to conventional capacitors in the range of-0.4-0.4 V. Â© 2006 IEEE.
