Voltage-stabilized supercapacitors: A single supercapacitor formed with PCBM/Pt/IPS nanorod-array electrodes is designed and delivers enhanced areal capacitance, capacitance retention, and excellent electrical stability under bending, while a significant voltage-decrease is observed during the discharging process. Once integrated with the memristor, the memristor-integrated supercapacitor systems deliver an extremely low voltage-drop, indicating greatly enhanced voltage-stabilizing features.
