This study proposes a unique control strategy to enhance the life time of the battery in a stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) system employing energy storage devices such as battery and super capacitor. The intermittent fluctuations in PV power and load power affect the DC bus voltage leading to a random and frequent charging/discharging profile of the battery since the controlling converters are operated as constant voltage sources. To overcome this drawback, the supercapacitor converter is commanded as a constant voltage source so as to adapt to varying load conditions and the battery converter is commanded as a constant current source. This strategy helps to decouple the power imbalances from the charge-discharge profile of battery, thereby contributing to the improved battery life. The detailed experimental results are presented. Further, the proposed control strategy is tested and validated under various scenarios.
