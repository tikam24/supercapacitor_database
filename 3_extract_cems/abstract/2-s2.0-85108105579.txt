The on-going energy crisis and environmental pollution have motivated the scientific community to develop a sustainable energy technology. The energy storage is one of the main focus areas in this development process and supercapacitors are gaining significant research importance on that context. The electrode material of a supercapacitor plays a crucial role in its charge storage capability. Fe–S based materials are cheap owing to their high natural abundance and shows high specific capacitance value. One-pot hydrothermal reaction is the widely used procedure for synthesizing transition metal sulfides; however, there exists the possibility of impurity formation in this process. The Fe2+ and Fe3+ salts are the common precursors of Fe and two extensively utilized S-sources are Na2S and thiourea. Four different iron pyrite samples were synthesized by varying the reaction precursor and this variation regulated the phase purity and morphology of the final product. The combination of Fe2+ and thiourea was more suitable for synthesizing pure FeS2 and little to higher amount of Fex−1Sx impurity was formed in other three cases. The charge transfer and ion diffusivity of FeS2 decreased with the incorporation of Fex−1Sx, which diminished its specific capacitance. The superiorly active pyrite-based electrode material achieved ~ 1142 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1. This investigation revealed the necessity of choosing accurate precursors for synthesizing electrode material through a one-pot hydrothermal reaction.
