A carbon aerogel/nickel oxide composite was prepared by gelatinization of liquid system and subsequent carbonization of gelated intermediate synthesized via reaction of formaldehyde, resorcinol and nickel nitrate with malonic acid and sodium dodecyl sulfate as catalyst and dispersing agent, respectively. The structure, morphology and electrochemical performance of the composite were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge as well as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, respectively. The results show that the composite samples have better capacitance characteristic and cyclability in the potential range from -0.4 to 0.6 V (SCE) in KOH solution as an electrolyte. The specific capacitance of the electrode reached 348.3 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g. The specific capacitance changed little in KOH solution after 2000 cycles at 100 mV/s.
