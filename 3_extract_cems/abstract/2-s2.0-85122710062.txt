Two-dimensional MoS2-based composite has remarkable potential as an electrode material for advanced energy storage. However, the potential application of MoS2 electrode is limited by its low electrical conductivity and cyclic stability. Herein, a novel three/two-dimensional (3D/2D) ternary nanostructured composite consisting of MoS2/g-C3N4/reduced graphene oxide (rGO), denoted as MCNG, is synthesized using an in-situ sonochemical-assisted method. Owing to the combined 3D/2D morphological features, large surface area, enriched interfacial conductivity, numerous surface-active edge sites, and mesoporous structure, the composite electrode exhibits a remarkable specific capacitance of 663 F g−1 at current density of 0.5 A g−1 and outstanding cyclic stability with a retention of 91.7% after 10,000 charge–discharge cycles. A coin-cell-type asymmetric supercapacitor composed of MCNG as the positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as the negative electrode, presents an energy density of 11.43 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 4125 W kg−1. This synthesis scheme provides a new pathway for the development of multi-component 3D/2D sheet-like networks as efficient electrode materials and their applications in energy storage devices.
