Supercapacitor is a new type of energy storage device, and electrode material as its key component has been attracting much attention, among which the modification treatment of electrode material is crucial for the research of high-performance supercapacitor.Coal-based capacitive carbon with high specific surface area (2 586 m2 / g) was prepared with using Hebei anthracite coal as the precursor, KOH as the activator, alkali to coal mass ratio of 2 ∶ 1 and activation temperature of 800 ℃. The evolution of microstructure and surface chemistry of the capacitance carbon during hydrothermal reduction at different temperatures (600-1 000 ℃) and their effects on electrochemical properties were investigated by using coal-based capacitance carbon as raw material. The results show that with the in- crease of hydrothermal reduction temperature, the specific surface area of the samples first slightly increases and then gradually decreases, and the mesoporosity increases to different degrees compared with the original coal-based capacitive carbon. Among them, the samples obtained by hydrothermal reduction treatment at 700 ℃ have lower oxygen content (0. 35%), stronger electrical conductivity, better wettability with organic electrolyte and higher degree of defects, and the electrochemical properties has been significantly improved:higher specific capacitance (179 F/ g at 0.5 A/ g current density), energy density (33.36 Wh/ kg), power density (1 014.75 W/ kg), multiplicative performance (58.7% capacitance retention at 5 A/ g current density), and cycling stability (82% capacitance retention at 5 000 cycles). For coal-based capacitive carbon, hydrothermal reduction is a good modification treatment.
