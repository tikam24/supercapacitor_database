Dynamic Wireless Power Transfer (DWPT) is an approach of charging Electric vehicles (EV's) and is rapidly growing due to its advantages upon wired charging and static charging. This paper proposes static and dynamic wireless charging of Hybrid Power Source (HPS) where the battery bank and Super Capacitors (SCs) bank are charged by using single transmitter and dual receiver pair which is distinctive. HPS are charged in different modes based on the rider requirements. Further, this paper also proposes a simple and unique SC cell voltage balancing circuit which is less complex and light in weight considering for EV's application.
