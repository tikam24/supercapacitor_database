This paper designs and fabricates CeO2 nanoparticles on a large scale by hydrolysis and oxidation of cerium carbide. The electrochemical supercapacitor behavior of CeO2 nanoparticles was investigated. The nickel foam (NF) supported CeO2 nanoparticles show a high areal capacitance of 119 mF/cm2, demonstrating a strong synergistic effect between NF and CeO2 nanoparticles. The high capacitance of the CeO2/NF nanoparticles is possibly due to an improved conductivity by NF and a better utilization of CeO2 nanoparticles.
