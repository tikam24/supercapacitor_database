We combined an extremely efficient energy saving function with electrochemical energy storage by assembling an electrochromic multifunctioning smart glass (MSG) using crystalline nanosheets of WO3·H2O. Unlike the previous standards, this all-solid-state device employed a single pure-phase active layer for visual and near-infrared (NIR) modulation (350–1600 nm). We demonstrated that the modulation bandwidth could be preselected (full range or NIR) by controlling the pulse duration of the applied voltage (−2.8 V). The prototype exhibited an outstanding IR modulation efficiency (IRME, normalized) of ∼63%, a solar modulation efficiency (SME, normalized) ∼54% with high coloration efficiency (97.8 cm2 C−1 at 600 nm). The electrode was characterized by an exceptional volumetric capacitance of ∼173 Fcm−3 that transpired to a significant 28.7 Fcm−3 in the all-solid prototypes (operational voltage range ±2.5 V). At a galvanostatic discharge current density of 0.1 mAcm−2, we obtained the highest volumetric energy density of 85.7 mWhcm−3 with a power density ∼3.57 Wcm−3 making it well suitable as an input power source. The device showed good stability (1000 continuous cycles) and recoverable degradations over a period of one year. This unique and high-performing practical all-solid system is a big advancing for the realization of multifunctional smart windows and facades.
