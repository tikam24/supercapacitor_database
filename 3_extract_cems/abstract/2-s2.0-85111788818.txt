In the recent decades, shortages of energy and resource, together with pollution of environment, have become the biggest problems on earth. Thus, construction of novel renewable and biodegradable materials based on nanopolysaccharides, such as nanocellulose, nanochitin or nanochitosan, and nanostarch, and exploration of their energy related applications, have received more and more attention. In this chapter, we review the preparation of nanopolysaccharide-based energy materials as well as their applications in the fields of energy storage, e.g. dielectric capacitor, supercapacitors, batteries, etc.
