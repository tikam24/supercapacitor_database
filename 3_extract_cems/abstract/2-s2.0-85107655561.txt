Porous multicomponent surface layers consisting of bimetallic oxide nanoparticles, carbon nanomaterials reduced graphene oxide (GO) and multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were prepared by reactive inverse matrix assisted pulsed laser evaporation. The layers were tested as electrodes for supercapacitor devices. Bimetallic oxide nanoparticles were grown through the mixing of simple inorganic oxides and organic compounds in distilled water. A frequency quadrupled Nd:YAG laser was used for the irradiation of the target dispersions consisting of GO platelets, MWCNTs, NiO, and Zn acetate. Besides oxide nanoparticles synthesis, which were present both on the surface of GO platelets and MWCTs and were also encapsulated within the MWCNTs walls, the GO platelets used for the preparation of the target dispersion were reduced under the effect of the laser pulses. An enhancement of the electrochemical performances of the nanohybrid electrodes were obtained as a results of the formation of bimetallic oxide nanoparticles. The electrodes exhibit fast chargeâ€“discharge cycling rate and improved storage capacity as compared to compound layer counterparts containing carbon nanomaterials, reduced graphene oxide, carbon nanotubes and simple binary transition metal oxide nanoparticles, 40F/cm3 volumetric capacitance at 10 mV/s scan rate, 1.5 mW/cm3 energy density and 12 W/cm3 power density at 4 mA/cm3 current density.
