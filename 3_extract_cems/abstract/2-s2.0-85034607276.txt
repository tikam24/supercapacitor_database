A simple but useful hydrothermal method is developed to prepare molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) flower-like spheres by sodium molybdate dehydrate (Na2MoO4·2H2O) and thiocarbamide (CS(NH2)2). In this work, the appropriate hydrothermal condition is at 180°C reaction temperature for 48 h and the atomic ratio of S and Mo is 1: 4 in 0.001 mol·L-1 aqueous solution. The morphologies and microstructures of as-prepared MoS2 are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and specific surface area test method (BET). Results indicate that the average diameter of as-prepared products is about 1 µm with good crystallinity and dispersibility, and their specific surface area is about 87 m2·g-1. In order to character the electrical properties of MoS2, the electrochemical performance was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Analysis results show that in 3 mol·L-1 KOH electrolyte, the specific capacitance of single electrode is 130.6 F·g-1 at 5 mV·s-1 scan rate and 110.9 F·g-1 at 0.1 A·g-1 current density. The charge-transfer resistance (Rct) is of 0.33 Ω. The loss of specific capacitance is 14.7% after 1 000 cycles. These electric properties illustrate the MoS2 prepared by hydrothermal processing can act as an ideal material for supercapacitor electrode.
