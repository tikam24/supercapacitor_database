Urchin-like NiCo2O4 was synthesized onto flexible carbon felt (CF) substrate via facile hydrothermal process as a high performed electrode for supercapacitors. The hydrothermal temperature was varied from 140 to 200 °C in order to investigate its effect on the morphological, structural, and electrochemical properties of the as-synthesized NiCo2O4@CF. Moreover, X-ray diffraction analysis revealed the formation of NiCo2O4 composite with polycrystalline nature. The SEM images demonstrate the development of NiCo2O4 structure from nanowires to a combination between nanowires and urchin like during the increasing of the hydrothermal temperature. This combination is extremely advantageous in accomplishing an exceptional electrochemical capacity by virtue of the high surface area of interaction with electrolyte and the decrease in the ion transport path. Indeed, the double nanostructured NiCo2O4 synthesized at 200 °C allowed to obtain excellent electrochemical performance with high specific capacity of 243.1 mAh.g−1(0.278 mAh.cm−2) at current value of 2 mA and capacity retention of ~ 91.3% after 5000 cycles in 6-M KOH aqueous electrolyte. As a consequence, the obtained double nanostructured NiCo2O4@CF flexible electrode is well suited for use in hybrid devices and flexible electronic devices.
