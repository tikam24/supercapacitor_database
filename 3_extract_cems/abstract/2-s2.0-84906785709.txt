Herein, we report the in situ growth of single-crystalline Ni(OH) 2 nanoflakes on a Ni support by using facile hydrothermal processes. The as-prepared Ni/Ni(OH)2 sponges were well-characterized by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), SEM, TEM, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. The results revealed that the nickel-skeleton-supported Ni(OH) 2 rope-like aggregates were composed of numerous intercrossed single-crystal Ni(OH)2 flake-like units. The Ni/Ni(OH)2 hybrid sponges served as electrodes and displayed ultrahigh specific capacitance (SC=3247 F g-1) and excellent rate-capability performance, likely owing to fast electron and ion transport, sufficient Faradic redox reaction, and robust structural integrity of the Ni/Ni(OH)2 hybrid electrode. These results support the promising application of Ni(OH)2 nanoflakes as advanced pseudocapacitor materials. Â© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
