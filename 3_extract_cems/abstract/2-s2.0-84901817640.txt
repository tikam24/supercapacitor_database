A ternary manganese ferrite/graphene/polyaniline (MGP) nanostructure is designed and synthesized via a facile two-step approach. This nanostructure exhibits outstanding electrochemical performances, such as high specific capacitance (454.8 F g-1 at 0.2 A g-1), excellent rate capability (75.8% capacity retention at 5 A g-1), and good cycling stability (76.4% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 2 A g-1), which are superior to those of its individual components (manganese ferrite, reduced-graphene oxide, polyaniline) and corresponding binary hybrids (manganese ferrite/graphene (MG), manganese ferrite/polyaniline (MP), and graphene/polyaniline (GP)). A symmetric supercapacitor device using the as-obtained hybrid has been fabricated and tested. The device exhibits a high specific capacitance of 307.2 F g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 with a maximum energy density of 13.5 W h kg-1. The high electrochemical performance of ternary MGP can be attributed to its well-designed nanostructure and the synergistic effect of the individual components. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.
