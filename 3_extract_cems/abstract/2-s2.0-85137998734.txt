Supercapacitors have recently gained interest due to their unique features such as high-power density, low equivalent series internal resistance, long lifespan, and wide operating temperature ranges when compared with other electrochemical energy storage technologies. However, due to supercapacitor cells low voltage, it's necessary to interconnect multiple cells in series in order to obtain the required voltage levels for vehicular or utility applications. The need for series interconnection combined with the existence of intrinsic and extrinsic differences between supercapacitor cells, make it mandatory to perform a voltage equalization of each cell in the pack. Therefore, supercapacitor packs require a management system to effectively monitor and control the cells keeping them within operational and safety boundaries. This article provides a critical overview of the different supercapacitors balancing methods proposed in the literature. A comparative analysis is performed in terms of cost, balancing time, efficiency, speed, size, modularity, and control.
