N, B co-doped graphene oxide (NB-GO) establishes a novel electronic structure owing to the distinctive B and N coupling significantly differs from the conventional electrical double-layer mechanism of carbon-based electrodes. The remarkable electrochemical properties of NB-GO are owed by the high content of N (4.61 at.%), and B (4.41 at.%) shrinkages charge transfer resistance, and inflation of the surface polarity as well as pseudocapacitive electro-active sites. The new motifs B-N, C-N, and C-B-N contribute affluent and stable redox-active sites for enhanced pseudocapacitive properties of NB-GO compared to that of the un-doped GO and B doped GO (B-GO), including excellent specific capacitance (885 Fg−1), outstanding rate capability (525 Fg−1 at 10 Ag−1) and good cycle stability (77.8%) retained till 10,000 continuous cycles. NB-GO//RGO asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) demonstrate an affordable energy density of 23.23 Wh/kg consistent with a massive power density of 872 W/kg with 80% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles. Therefore, a facile hydrothermal route will be a successful method for synthesizing NB-GO as an alternative for metal oxide/sulfide and polymer-based pseudocapacitive electrode materials for supercapacitor applications.
