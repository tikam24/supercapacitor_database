Three types of V 2 O 5 structures including nanobelts, nanoparticles and microspheres were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal route and combination of calcination. The morphology of the sample depends on the quantity of oxalic acid used in the experiments. V 2 O 5 nanobelts, nanoparticles and microspheres were respectively obtained when 0.63, 1.89 and 3.78 g of oxalic acid were used. The composition, morphology and structure of the samples were characterized by XRD, IR, SEM and TEM, respectively. The electrochemical properties of V 2 O 5 nanobelts, nanoparticles and microspheres as electrodes in a supercapacitor device were measured using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD). The electrochemical results indicate that V 2 O 5 microspheres lead to a significant improvement of storage capacity and they show the largest specific capacitance of 308 F g -1 when used as supercapacitor electrode in 1 mol L -1 LiNO 3 electrolyte. It turns out that V 2 O 5 microsphere is an ideal material compared with other morphologies for supercapacitor electrode in the present work.
