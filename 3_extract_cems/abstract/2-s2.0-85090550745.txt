Lanthanum-based LaMO3 (M = Fe, Co, Ni) perovskite nanofibers were effectively fabricated by electrospinning approach coupled with calcination process. The crystallinity, microstructures, morphologies, elemental compositions, and chemical bonding states of LaMO3 perovskites were investigated in detail. The electrochemical properties of LaMO3 perovskite nanofibers as supercapacitor electrodes and lithium-ion battery anodes were elucidated. The specific capacitances of LaFeO3, LaCoO3, and LaNiO3 nanofibers were 183.6, 95.8 and 116.3 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1, respectively. The supercapacitive properties of LaMO3 NFs had originated from the redox reactions of M3+/M2+. As lithium-ion battery anodes, LaMO3 (M = Fe, Co, Ni) nanofibers exhibited the specific discharge capacities of 331, 646, and 92 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles, respectively. This research endowed the potential and competent candidates of the perovskite type lanthanum-based nanofibers for supercapacitor electrodes and lithium-ion battery anodes.
