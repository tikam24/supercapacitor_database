This review is focused on the fundamental developments in the charge transfer processes and charge storage properties of different kinds of nanoparticles. Special attention is paid to metallic nanoparticles and nanostructured carbon materials. Behavior related to the discrete electron levels distribution is emphasized. Depending on the nanoparticle size, the electrochemistry is systemized in three regimes: bulk-continuum electrochemistry, electrochemical behavior reflective of quantized double-layer charging, and molecule-like behavior. Recent progress in understanding charge transfer process in two-and three-dimensional films of metallic nanoparticles based on electron-hopping model is discussed. A conductivity of carbon nanostructures, nanotubes, nano-onions, and graphene is briefly described in terms of their electronic structure. The exemplary results of nanoparticles thin film conductivity determination are presented. The review is concluded with an outlook on the technological potential of nanoparticles in charge storage devices. Principles of double-layer and faradaic electrochemical supercapacitors are given. Double-layer capacitance performances of carbon nanostructure that involved materials are summarized. Pseudocapacitance properties of polymeric nanoparticles that involved thin films are also discussed. Finally, electrochemical supercapacitors based on the nanocomposites containing carbon nanostructures are described.
