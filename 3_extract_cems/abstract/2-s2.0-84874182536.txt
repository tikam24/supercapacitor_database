A new topology of multiphase resonant inverters with limited voltage over the commutating capacitor (with energy dosing) is explored in this paper. In the document are present analysis and formulas for design of this kind of inverters, when they are used as high frequency power supplies for charging capacitors and batteries. In the paper are shown the advantages of the proposed new topology in comparison with classical circuits for charging capacitors. Â© VDE Verlag GMBH - Berlin.
