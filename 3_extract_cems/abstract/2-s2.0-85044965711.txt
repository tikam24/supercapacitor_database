In the current paper, an improved control strategy designed for synchronizing and transferring autonomous microgrids (MGs) to the grid is presented. The proposed approach is based on an MG leading inverter (MGLI) supplied by a supercapacitor energy storage system, which takes over the MG only during a transitory load and distributes it to the available MG supporting inverters (MGSIs). This paper presents the control systems for both the proposed MGLI and the associated MGSIs, the focus being on the specific issues related to MG synchronization and grid transfer. By means of the proposed solution, the operation of the MG and its transition between autonomous and grid-connected modes require merely the adaptation of the MGLI control system, while the MGSIs operation remain unchanged during all MG states. The comprehensive experimental results, which were carried out on a laboratory-scale MG, have shown that the system is kept stable and with minimum disturbance to the local MG voltage and frequency during the analysed events, namely the scheduled MG transfer to the grid, power-flow control during grid-connection operation, and disconnection from the grid, respectively.
