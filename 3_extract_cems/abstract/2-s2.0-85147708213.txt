Electrochemical energy storage is a growing field, highly conductive metallic selenium has emerged as an electrode material that shows great promise. In this study, tandem NiSe2/CoSe2 nanocubes with carbon nanotubes (CNT) as their structural backbone were created by employing the easy chemical precipitation and heat treatment selenization approach. Controlling the CNT inclusion during the chemical precipitation process allowed researchers to examine the effects of variations in CNT content on the electrochemical characteristics of NiSe2/CoSe2/CNT. The findings demonstrated that metal selenides made with CNT outperformed those without CNT. At a current density of 1 A g−1, NiSe2/CoSe2/CNT-20 with 20 mg CNT mass exhibited an electrochemical properties of 848 F g−1. Additionally, the combination NiSe2/CoSe2/CNT-20/AC asymmetric supercapacitor also displayed an energy density of 50 Wh kg−1 when at power density of 800.0 W kg−1, and it has good cycling stability (Cycle stability reached a high of 62% after 1000 cycles), demonstrating that NiSe2/CoSe2/CNT-20 is a viable electrode material for storing energy and has further research potential.
