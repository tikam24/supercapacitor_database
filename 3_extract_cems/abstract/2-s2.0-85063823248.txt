Hematite nanotubes (α-Fe 2 O 3 NTs) are synthesized via a cost-effective and environmental-friendly hydrothermal technique. Field emission scanning electron microscopy and X-ray powder diffraction analyses reveal the formation of α-Fe 2 O 3 NTs with high crystallinity and purity. Optical behavior of α-Fe 2 O 3 NTs is studied employing UV-visible spectroscopy. Electrochemical properties of the as-prepared electrode material are investigated by cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in a three electrode cell. The synthesized α-Fe 2 O 3 NTs present enhanced pseudocapacitive performance with high specific capacity of 230 Fg -1 at current density of 1 Ag -1 . The prepared α-Fe 2 O 3 NTs can be utilized as a potential electrode material for electrochemical capacitor applications.
