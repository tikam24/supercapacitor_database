The heteroatom self-doped activated carbon hollow fibers from liquefied wood (ACHFs) were prepared by melt spinning, half-curing, carbonization and activation using steam. The results showed that the ACHFs with N and P doping exhibited high specific surface area (1896.6–2040.8 m2g−1) and total pore volume (1.02–1.058 cm3g−1). It was also found that the mechanisms of P from catalyst and N from curing agent were different in the formation of pore structure of ACHFs. When applied to supercapacitor, the ACHF-N10P16 can deliver a high specific capacitance of 151 F g−1 at current density of 1 A g−1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte. In addition, ACHFs displayed the synergistic advantages of pseudo-capacitance and double-layer capacitance because of N and P doping. As a result, the ACHFs with adjustable heteroatom doping have a broad application prospect in electrochemical energy storage.
