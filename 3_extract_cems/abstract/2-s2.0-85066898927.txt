In this paper, we estimate the parameter values of a fractional-order model of supercapacitors involving fractional derivatives of Liouville-Caputo, Caputo-Fabrizio, and Atangana-Baleanu and fractional conformable derivative in the Liouville-Caputo sense. We present the exact solution of the considered model using the properties of the Laplace transform operator together with the convolution theorem. They developed numerical simulations using each one of the fractional derivatives; the results were compared graphically with experimental data obtained from different supercapacitors using standard laboratory equipment. The nonlocal parameters involved in the equivalent electrical circuit for the supercapacitor model are recalculated for each fractional derivative using a particle swarm optimization algorithm for generating optimal solutions.
