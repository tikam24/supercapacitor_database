Layered transition metal carbonitride (MXene) is a new type of two-dimensional nanomaterials. It has attracted increasing attention due to its unique crystal characteristics and structural characteristics, especially its excellent performance in electrical and electronic applications. In recent years, there have been many studies on the composite applications of MXene and textile materials, their outstanding performance have been found in the applications of fiber-based flexible electronics. This paper introduced the preparation approaches and properties of MXene nanosheets, systematically analyzed the latest research of the composite application of MXene and fibrous materials at different dimensions and then summarized the application performance of MXene-based fibrous composite materials. Finally, the cutting-edge research and current challenges of composite applications of MXene and fibrous materials were discussed.
