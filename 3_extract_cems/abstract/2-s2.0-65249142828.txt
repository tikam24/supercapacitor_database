Electrochemical capacity retention of nearly X-ray amorphous nanostructured manganese oxide (nanoMnO2) synthesized by mixing directly KMnO 4 with ethylene glycol under ambient conditions for supercapacitor studies is enhanced significantly. Although X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of nanoMnO2 shows poor crystallinity, it is found that by Mn K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) measurement that the nanoMnO 2 obtained is locally arranged in a δ-MnO2-type layered structure composed of edge-shared network of MnO6 octahedra. Field emission scanning electron microscopy and XANES measurements show that nanoMnO2 contains nearly spherical shaped morphology with δ-MnO2 structure, and 1D nanorods of α-MnO 2type structure (powder XRD) in the annealed (600 d̀C) sample. Volumetric nitrogen adsorption - desorption isotherms, inductively coupled plasma analysis, and thermal analysis are carried out to obtain physicochemical properties such as surface area (230 m2 g-l), porosity of nanoMnO2 (secondary mesopores of diameter 14.5 nm), water content, composition, etc., which lead to the promising electrochemical properties as an electrode for supercapacitor. The nanoMnO2 shows a very high stability even after 1200 cycles with capacity retention of about 250 F g -1. © 2009 American Chemical Society.
