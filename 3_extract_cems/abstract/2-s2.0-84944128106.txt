Single conversion stage DC/AC boost inverters are an attractive solution when integrating energy storage devices, such as a battery, fuel cell, or supercapacitor to a single-phase AC grid. However, a second-order harmonic current ripple appears at the DC side of the inverter increasing the internal heat and losses in the energy storage device and degrading its lifetime. In this paper, a rule-based controller is proposed to reduce such harmonic current ripple component. A key feature and advantage of the proposed controller is its ability to reduce the ripple current amplitude in all four inverter output power operating quadrants without being affected by the capacitor tolerances and the internal resistance of the inductors. Presented experimental results validate the performance of the proposed controller on a single-phase grid-connected DC/AC boost inverter-based battery energy storage system.
