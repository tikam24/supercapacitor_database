Hydrophilic cobalt oxide (Co3O4) electrode was deposited by galvanostatic electrodeposition method. The Co3O4 electrode was characterized by using different characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) shows cubic structure, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shows nanoflakes like morphology and surface wettability study shows hydrophilic in nature. TEM image of the Co3O4 electrode reflects highly crystalline structure. The supercapacitive properties of deposited Co3O4 electrode is probed using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. The Co3O4 electrode shows maximum specific capacitance of 315 F g−1 obtained from CV techniques in 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution at scan rate 5 mV s−1. Hence, the electrodeposited Co3O4 electrode is best for supercapacitor application.
