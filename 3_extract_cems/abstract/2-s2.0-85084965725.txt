The selection of anode materials for asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) has been a great challenge for the further development. As a promising anode material, Fe2O3 can effectively improve the energy density of supercapacitors. This article reviews the modification methods of Fe2O3 anodes based on different elements, which improves the conductivity and specific capacitance. In terms of carbon modification, different forms of carbon are used to change the structure or properties of Fe2O3 to obtain a larger specific surface area and electron transmission rate. In terms of modification based on metal elements, the synergy between metal oxides or metal ions and Fe2O3 improves the specific capacitance and energy density of Fe2O3. When the metal surface is modified, the core-shell structure is used to improve the charge storage and transmission capabilities. In addition, a variety of elements have been used together to further develop the properties of the elements. The proposal of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) doped with other elements provide a new reference for investigation. The article introduces the current situation of using elements to transform Fe2O3 anodes from several components, and illustrates the potential applications of these methods in the future. This paper aims to provide ideas for improving the study of the Fe2O3 anode which is a promising electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.
