Redox-active organic materials with the advantages of light weight, flexibility, and low-cost are promising alternatives to high-performance green energy storage devices due to their high theoretical capacitance and availability from renewable resources. Therefore, in this paper, we successfully synthesized a novel 2-aminoanthraquinone (AAQ) organic molecules non-covalent anchored on N-doped reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites (N-RGO@AAQ) by a simple improved solvothermal method. Mainly benefiting from the enhanced ion/electron transport kinetics, the introduction of pseudocapacitance, and the stable nanostructure that facilitate fast ion intercalation and de-intercalation, the synthesized N-RGO@AAQ nanocomposite exhibits excellent electrochemical performances as an electrode material. A satisfactory high specific capacity of 532.48 C g−1 at 0.6 A g−1 and excellent rate capability (60.42%) from 0.6 to 60 A g−1 are achieved. Moreover, the assembled symmetrical supercapacitor device (SSD) assembled by using N-RGO@AAQ electrode delivers a maximum energy density of 21.13 W h kg−1 at a power density of 750 W kg−1 and an outstanding ultra-long cycling durability (maintain 94.67% of the initial capacity after 18 000 cycles at 30 mV s−1). This study provides a strategy and a potential electrode material for the development and application of green energy storage devices with high-performance.
