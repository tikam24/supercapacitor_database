Stretchable supercapacitor with two-dimensional (2D) stretchability had high received attention for its practical applications such as wearable electronics and electronic skins. However, mechanical strength of devices and stretchable stability during repetitive movement have been seriously affected the device performance, which is all caused by the device structural design. Herein, we report a simple laser holography technology for periodic elastic substrate with 500-800Î¼m microgrooved structures, and laser holography technology not only structured the elastic substrate but also could provide synchronous photoreduction of grapheme oxides (GO) for graphene electrodes. When the scan speed of 50mV/s, the tensile of devices is 54%, the area specific capacitance is 0.96mF/cm2, which shows less significant changes to area specific capacitance of 0.79mF/cm2 (0% tensile ratio). This work may hold great promise for production of stretchable grapheme supercapacitor that can be used in wearable electronic devices.
