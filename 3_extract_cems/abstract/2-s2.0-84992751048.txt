To develop a kind of flexible electrode for supercapacitors working in neutral electrolyte, nickel hexacyanoferrate nanocubes (NiHCF-NCs) are uniformly deposited on flexible carbon fibers (CFs) by using a facile unipolar pulse electrodeposition (UPED) technique. It is found that NiHCF film prepared by UPED is composed of NCs with more uniform size than those prepared by the common cyclic voltammetry (CV) and potentiostatic (PM) methods. Pulse potential of UPED has significantly influence on the morphology and crystal structure. Uniform NiHCF-NCs with approximately 200 nm side length are successfully formed on flexible CFs at 0.3 V. Moreover, the ratio of two structures of NiHCF, i.e., “insoluble” and “soluble” structures, can be well controlled by the applied pulse potential. Electrochemical performances are characterized by CV, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests. NiHCF-NCs film on flexible carbon fibers prepared at 0.3 V applied pulse potential exhibits remarkable electrochemical performance with a capacitance as high as 476 F g−1at 0.2 A g−1in the neutral electrolyte, and the capacitance retains 92.5% of its initial value after 8000 charge/discharge cycles. It indicates that such a simple, cost-effective and readily scalable NiHCF-NCs film fabrication method has commercial potential for preparation of flexible electrode for high performance supercapacitors working in neutral electrolyte.
