Polyacrylonitrile/phenylsilane/cyclodextrin-derived carbon nanofiber composites (PPSCD) are prepared by one-step electrospinning using α-cyclodextrin (CD) and phenylsilane (PS) as the pore generator, because many organic molecules are easily decomposed by a self-activation process during heat treatment. We optimize the effects of different α-CD contents on the electrochemical performance of the PPSCD derived from the inclusion complex of PS/α-CD. The PPSCD electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 193 F g−1 at 1 mA cm−2 and a high energy density of 23.5–16.21 Wh kg−1 at power densities ranging from 400 to 10,000 W kg−1 in an aqueous solution. The superior electrochemical properties of PPSCD are favorable for ion storage and transfer due to the synergistic effects of high specific surface area and well-balanced micro/mesoporosity. Hence, PPSCD electrodes have a promising potential as a supercapacitor electrode material in the development of high performance energy storage systems.
