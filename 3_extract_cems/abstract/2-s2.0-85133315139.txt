The aim of this work is to fabricate polyindole (PIn) electrode electrochemically onto a graphite sheet substrate as a supercapacitor electrode. Structural, morphological and electrochemical properties of the prepared supercapacitor electrodes were studied and discussed. The electrochemical properties included cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charging-discharging (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for PIn supercapacitor electrode were investigated. The scanning electron micrographs of PIn film deposited at I V and 300 s exhibited uniform and homogenous surface that contains both dense region and porous structure. The obtained results indicated that PIn supercapacitor electrode possesses high specific capacitance of 1308.60 F/g, and cycle life retention of 130% after 850 repetitive cycle. Notably, this electrode produced high energy and power densities of 356.22 Wh/kg and 700.91 W/kg.
