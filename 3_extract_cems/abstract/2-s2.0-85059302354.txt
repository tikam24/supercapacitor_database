In our work, a two-step hydrothermal route was employed to fabricate NiMoO4/Ni3S2 nanohybrid. In hybrid nanostructure, the ultrathin nanosheets were decorated with abundant nanodewys, which could usefully induce more electrochemical active sites. Furthermore, the existence of high-conductivity Ni3S2 phase is in favor of reducing the charge transport resistance. Served as supercapacitive electrode, NiMoO4-S electrode possesses a high capacitance of 1195.7 C g−1 at 0.5 mA cm−2, ca. 3.5 times higher than NiMoO4 electrode. The NiMoO4-S electrode also displays an ultrahigh cyclic stability (97.3% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles). In long-term cyclic process, Mo and S elements of hybrid structure gradually dissolved in electrolyte, thus forming porous winkle structure and ensuring abundant active sites. Further hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) was developed, which exhibits high capacitance of 237.5 C g−1 (at 5 mA), excellent energy density of 55.1 Wh kg−1 (at 953.2 W kg−1) and outstanding stability (115.2% retention after 10000 cycles), further demonstrating its enormous advantages in energy storage.
