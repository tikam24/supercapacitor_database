NanocrystallineLa 2 Sn1.6 Zr0. 4 O7 is synthesized by microwave assisted combustion method. The phase formation and morphological features ofLa 2 Sn1.6 Zr0. 4 O7 are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectrum and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) respectively. XRD pattern shows the formation of cubic Pyrochlore structure ofLa 2 Sn1.6 Zr0. 4 O7 . FTIR studies attributed the presence of characteristic functional groups of La-O, Sn-O and Zr-O. TEM image reveals that the size ofLa 2 Sn1.6 Zr0. 4 O7 particle exhibits from 50 nm to 100 nm and the observed d -spacing from HRTEM is matched well with the XRD d -spacing. The SAED pattern shows the polycrystalline behaviour ofLa 2 Sn1.6 Zr0. 4 O7 . The room temperature electrical conductivity ofLa 2 Sn1.6 Zr0. 4 O7 is 3.12 Ã— 10 -6 S cm-1 . The synthesizedLa 2 Sn1.6 Zr0. 4 O7 particle is explored as electrodes for supercapacitor and the performances are studied by cyclic voltammetric and charge discharge studies using 1 M H2 SO4 electrolyte. From charge-discharge analysis the specific capacitance was found to be 74 Fg-1 at 1 mA cm-2 . The resistive behaviour of the electrodes is studied through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Also the cycling stability is studied by performing the 100 charge-discharge cycles. It reveals that there is almost 100% cycling stability is achieved. Hence nanocrystalline La 2 Sn1.6 Zr0. 4 O7 pyrochlore can have the feasibility as an electrode material for supercapacitor application.
