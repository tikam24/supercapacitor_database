This report presents a novel ionic liquid-based method for fabricating flexible double layer supercapacitor electrodes utilizing natural substrates. It investigates the performance of these yarns knitted as fabrics and with other cellulose-based fibers welded with carbon particles. Scanning electron microscopy, mechanical properties testing, conductivity and other electrochemical testing are performed to characterize both individual yarns and knitted devices.
