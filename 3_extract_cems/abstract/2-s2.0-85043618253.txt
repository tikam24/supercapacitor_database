Due to their unique physical and chemical properties,nanostructured metal sulfide materials have shown excellent electrochemical performance. Herein,we present a review on the research progresses of the nanostructured cobalt sulfides materials for supercapacitors following the clues of the various morphologies of cobalt sulfides,their compositing with graphene and the nanoarrays grown directly on the conductive substrates. The preparation methods of the nanostructured cobalt sulfides and the principles of improving their electrochemical performance are summarized. Both the compositing with graphene and the growth on the conductive substrates strengthen the structure stability and facilitate the electron-transport,and the rate capability and cycling stability are improved accordingly. It indicates that the design and modification of hollow nanostructure,the compositing ways with graphene and the pretreatment of conductive substrates are the research emphases in the future. Additionally,it is crucial to develop a simple and cheap route for the large-scale production of cobalt sulfides in order to meet the need of the commercial applications.
