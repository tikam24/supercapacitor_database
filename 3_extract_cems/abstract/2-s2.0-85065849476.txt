Graphene-polypyrrole hollow sphere composite was synthesized for the first time via Pickering emulsion polymerization using graphene oxide as Pickering stabilizer. It was found that polypyrrole and graphene were well hybrid and all graphene-polypyrrole composites had a uniform hollow sphere structure, whose diameters gradually decreased as the pyrrole content decreased. The electrochemical properties of the composites as supercapacitor electrode were investigated. The test results displayed that the specific capacitance of the optimal ratio of composite could reach 238F/g at a current density of 1A/g, and a 90.7% capacitance retention could be achieved after 1500 cycles, which was a significant improvement compared with the 62.2% retention of pure polypyrrole.
