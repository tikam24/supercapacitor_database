The improvement of the wettability between electrode materials and ionic liquid electrolytes is critical to increase the performance of electrode materials for supercapacitors. Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of a urea phosphate-derived graphene aerogel (UPGA) with good wettability by one-step hydrothermal treatment using graphene oxide (GO) as the precursor and urea phosphate (UP) as both the nitrogen dopant and hydroxyl group protector. The as-obtained UPGA has appropriate doped-N atoms, unique hierarchical porous structure, and good wettability by 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIMBF4) ionic liquid. The UPGA displays a high specific capacitance of 196.7 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. Moreover, a symmetrical UPGA-based supercapacitor delivers an excellent energy density of 97.2 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 0.9 kW kg−1 and a good cycling stability with the capacitance retention of 78.3% after 5500 cycles at 1 A g−1. Therefore, the UPGA exhibits great potential in supercapacitor as electrode material.
