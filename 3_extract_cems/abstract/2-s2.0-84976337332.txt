Supercapacitors have attracted much interest in the past decades owing to their important applications, but most of them are focused on solitary or simple metal oxides. Here, a novel supercapacitor electrode composed of multicomponent MnCo2O4@Ni(OH)2 belt-based coreâ€“shell nanoflowers is reported by a facile and cost-effective method. This hybrid electrode exhibits a significantly enhanced specific capacitance. An asymmetric supercapacitor based on this unique hybrid nanoflowers as anode and an activated carbon film as cathode demonstrates high energy density, high power density, and long cycling lifespan.
