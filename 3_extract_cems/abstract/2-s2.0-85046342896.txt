The preparation of highly conductive, high-surface-area, heteroatom-doped, porous carbon nanocomposite materials with enhanced electrochemical performance for sustainable energy-storage technologies, such as supercapacitors, is challenging. Herein, a route for the large-scale synthesis of nitrogen-doped porous carbon wrapped partially exfoliated carbon nanotubes (N-PPECNTs) with an interconnected hierarchical porous structure, as an advanced electrode material that can realize several potential applications for energy storage, is presented. Polypyrrole conductive polymer acts as both nitrogen and carbon sources that contribute to the pseudocapacitance. Partially exfoliated carbon nanotubes (PECNTs) provide a high specific surface area for ion and charge transportation and act as a conductive matrix. The derived porous N-PPECNT displays a nitrogen content of 6.95 at %, with a specific surface area of 2050 m2 g−1, and pore volume of 1.13 cm3 g−1. N-PPECNTs, as an electrode material for supercapacitors, exhibit an excellent specific capacitance of 781 F g−1 at 2 A g−1, with a high cycling stability of 95.3 % over 10 000 cycles. Furthermore, the symmetric supercapacitor exhibits remarkable energy densities as high as 172.8, 62.7, and 53.55 Wh kg−1 in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([BMIM][TFSI]), organic, and aqueous electrolytes, respectively. Also, biocompatible hydrogel and polymer gel electrolyte based, stable, flexible supercapacitors with excellent electrochemical performance could be demonstrated.
