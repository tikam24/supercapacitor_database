Nickel silicate hydroxide on hierarchically porous carbon derived from rice husks is prepared as electrode material for supercapacitors. AAEMs in rice husks and CO2 promote the development of pores, which act as pore-forming agent and catalyst respectively. The rice husks carbon is used as the substrate and the SiO2 in rice husks is converted into Ni–Si compound by loading Ni. The C/NiSi-600-1 shows remarkable electrochemical performance with 237.07 F/g at 0.5 A/g. The performance declines with crystalline SiO2 formed above 900 °C. A high-performance asymmetric water-system supercapacitor device is fabricated by C/NiSi-600-1 and activated carbon. This device shows capacitance of 142 mF/cm2 at 4 mA/cm2, the energy density of 25.24 Wh/kg at 551.4 W/kg and great cycle stability with 90% after 10,000 cycles. This work provides new insights into the green application of rice husks and promotes the development of electrode materials for supercapacitors.
