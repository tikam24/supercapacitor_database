A new graphene oxide/pristine graphene/polyaniline (GPP) composite is successfully prepared. Transmission electron microscope, Scanning electron microscope, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to characterize the electronic structure and morphology of GPP composites. The specific capacitance of GPP is 1231.8 F g-1 and 598.1 F g-1 in a three-electrode system and a symmetric supercapacitor at 1.0 A g-1. The specific capacitance of GPP maintains about 71.2% and 55.1% after 10000 cycles in the three-electrode and two-electrode systems, respectively.
