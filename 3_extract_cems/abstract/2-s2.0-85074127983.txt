Great efforts have been dedicated to fabricating electrode materials of supercapacitors especially for carbon-based system. To achieve satisfied device performance, the fabrication of electrodes generally involved complicated procedure, poisonous agents, and expensive materials. Herein, we develop a facile and economical method to prepare carbon-based electrode materials. The nitrogen-rich g-C3N4 is used as template and N source, and glucose is used as C source to prepare N-doped 3D porous carbon materials by hydrothermal treatment followed by calcinations. The structure and N content could be adjusted by hydrothermal temperature. The specific surface area of 954 m2 gâˆ’1 and 11% N content is achieved, thus providing the excellent carrier storage ability and electrocatalytic activity. The supercapacitors fabricated from present 3D carbon networks achieve a specific capacitance of 90F/g, and shows excellent cycling stability. Present method is free of involving complicating procedure and poisonous reagents for fabrication of 3D carbon structures.
