Electrochemical supercapacitors are a promising type of energy storage device with broad application prospects. Developing an accurate model to reflect their actual working characteristics is of great research significance for rational utilization, performance optimization, and system simulation of supercapacitors. This paper presents the fundamental working principle and applications of supercapacitors, analyzes their aging mechanism, summarizes existing supercapacitor models, and evaluates the characteristics and application scope of each model. By examining the current state and limitations of supercapacitor modeling research, this paper identifies future development trends and research focuses in this area.
