Hierarchically porous yet densely packed MnO2 microspheres doped with Fe3O4 nanoparticles are synthesized via a one-step and low-cost ultrasound assisted method. The scalable synthesis is based on Fe2+ and ultrasound assisted nucleation and growth at a constant temperature in a range of 25-70 °C. Single-crystalline Fe3O4 particles of 3-5 nm in diameter are homogeneously distributed throughout the spheres and none are on the surface. A systematic optimization of reaction parameters results in isolated, porous, and uniform Fe3O4-MnO2 composite spheres. The spheres' average diameter is dependent on the temperature, and thus is controllable in a range of 0.7-1.28 μm. The involved growth mechanism is discussed. The specific capacitance is optimized at an Fe/Mn atomic ratio of r = 0.075 to be 448 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV/s, which is nearly 1.5 times that of the extremely high reported value for MnO2 nanostructures (309 F/g). Especially, such a structure allows significantly improved stability at high charging rates. The composite has a capacitance of 367.4 F/g at a high scan rate of 100 mV/s, which is 82% of that at 5 mV/s. Also, it has an excellent cycling performance with a capacitance retention of 76% after 5000 charge/discharge cycles at 5 A/g.
