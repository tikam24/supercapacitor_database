In this study, a closed loop feed-forward direct current (DC)-DC converter has been designed which operates solely on two supercapacitor modules. This is an innovative new design where the challenge was to maintain the constant output voltage when the input voltage of the converter is decaying continuously as a function of time as long as the output load draws current. The second innovation is the selection of all the components that are required to design the regulated output DC-DC converter, even though the parameters like the supply voltages for the components have been falling continuously as a function of time since the supercapacitor modules are providing these supply voltages. The design is also robust enough to withstand certain fluctuations in the output current ranging between 200 and 950 mA and yet maintain a regulated output voltage. In this study, the authors have successfully demonstrated that one can design a DC-DC converter powered by supercapacitors to generate a constant voltage and desired output current while all the components required making that DC-DC converter remain operational although the input voltage of the supercapacitors is dropping constantly, due to the output drawing current. The operating frequency, i.e. the switching frequency ranges from 1.5 to 3.5 kHz.
