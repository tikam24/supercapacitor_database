Increasing climate change-caused natural disasters calls for mobile self-powered backup solutions for rescue and survival. However, existing portable solar systems rely on single storage with high risk of suspension in emergency and prolonged cloudy period. This work presents a portable solar-dual storage system, which enables essential loads to function continuously regardless of weather. The system operates with a supercapacitor to buffer fluctuating solar power in the Direct mode, a battery-supercapacitor integration to enable extended low light load usage in the Off-grid mode, and a developed mode selector controller for overall energy management. Optimum size of the supercapacitor was determined to buffer the load and quickly recharge within the average low light period of 5â€“12 min. The simulated solar irradiance from 400-1000 W/m2 was utilized to verify automatic selection between two independent modes: direct and off-grid. Furthermore, outdoor behavior of the system has been investigated on a representative sunny, cloudy, and mixed day. Moreover, different combinations of DC and AC loads including an 80 W notebook with a power larger than the solar panel (20 W) have been demonstrated to function steadily for a few hours outdoor. This system's signatures include manual mode selection possibility by users and automatic switching ability to a direct mode for when the battery is completely discharged or malfunction for continuous operation of the loads. This portable solar-powered system can be used in variety of scenarios and provides clean solar energy to essential electrical appliances for lighting, communication etc., thus increasing the chance of survival during emergency.
