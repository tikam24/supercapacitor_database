Load frequency control (LFC) plays a crucial rule in matching the power generation with variable power demand, and hence, maintains the system frequency and tie-line power to its esteemed value. Further, most of the countries are dependent on thermal power plants to meet the electrical energy requirement, and hence, LFC strategies are available for these types of power plants only. As the world is moving to generate electrical energy via cleaner sources to reduce harmful environmental pollutants, and hence, hydro power are one of the well-developed and cleanest sources of electrical energy. Subsequently, this article shows up a novel LFC design for hydro-hydro system based on joint endeavors of fuzzy logic with PID viably optimized through particle swarm optimization (PSO) coming into a new and robust Fuzzy-PSO-PID for LFC. At to beginning with, the result of Fuzzy-PSO-PID is evaluated for step load alteration, and the outcomes of Fuzzy-PSO-PID are matched with recently published outcomes of LFC with regards to values of PID, error minimization, and graphical results. In any case, still, there may be a scope of LFC upgrade in Fuzzy-PSO-PID due to higher responding time of turbines used in hydro-hydro plants and subsequently, the combinations of storage devices such as ultra-capacitor (UC) in each zone and UC with redox flow battery combination are used to improve the LFC and the application outcomes are analyzed again and uncover considering the step load alteration, non-linearity, load pattern, and parametric modification to see the benefits of the proposed work for hydro-hydro LFC.
