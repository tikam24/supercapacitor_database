In the present study, GO/MWCNT/NiCo2O4 decoration of a hybrid nanocomposite was synthesized by a hydrothermal process, with nickel and cobalt nitrate precursors. The electrochemical performance of the hybrid composite was investigated as a supercapacitor electrode material through cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvano static charge–discharge and electrochemical impedance analysis. The cyclic voltammetry result showed that the excellent capacitive behaviour of the MWCNT/GO/NiCo2O4 hybrid composite had a specific capacitance of 707 F g−1 at a current density of 2.5 A/g and a 88% specific capacitance retention after 5000 continuous charge–discharge cycles, indicating their high potentials for high-performance supercapacitor applications.
