This paper deals with energy management for electric vehicle using SuperCapacitors (SCs) and battery. SCs are connected to the DC bus through a converter whereas battery is directly connected to the DC bus. Using the inversion-based rules of Energetic Macroscopic Representation (EMR), a systematic control structure can be deduced. Some differences can be shown in comparison with classical control schemes. This paper aims to compare a control scheme deduced from EMR and another control structure designed thanks to a more classical way. It can be noticed that some differences appear. As far as the structure is concerned, the number of sensor can be reduced in the EMR case. In terms of performances, some control errors appear in the classical scheme case.
