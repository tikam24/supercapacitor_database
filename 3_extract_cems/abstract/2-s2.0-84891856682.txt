Graphite oxide/Co(OH)2 layered composites are prepared by nanosheet assembling between the exfoliated Co(OH)2 and graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets. The subsequent thermal treatment of GO/Co(OH)2 composites in controlled atmospheres converts GO into reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and Co(OH)2 into Co3O4. The RGO/Co 3O4 hybrid nanocomposites with different amounts of Co3O4 are thoroughly characterized, and their electrochemical properties as supercapacitor electrode are systematically investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in the KOH electrolyte. In particularly, the RGO/Co3O4 hybrid composite with 94.3 wt% Co 3O4 exhibits a high specific capacitance of 331 F g -1 at the current density of 5 A g-1, and shows the excellent electrochemical cycle stability with capacitance retention over 122% after 5000 continuous charge-discharge cycles. These outstanding capacitive performances make the RGO/Co3O4 hybrid nanocomposites one of the promising candidates for the supercapacitor electrode. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
