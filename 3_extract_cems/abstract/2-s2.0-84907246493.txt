Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been widely studied due to its characteristic one-dimensional structure, re- markable mechanical, electronic and thermal properties. However, it remains challenging to extend them to a macroscopic scale due to the aggregation and random dispersion during preparation. Recently, CNTs are highly aligned through wet and dry spinning process to continuously produce CNT fibers that maintain the excellent properties of individual CNTs, and these aligned CNT fibers have been extensively used for wire-shaped solar cells, supercapacitors and other energy devices. This article reviews the preparation, structure, property and application of the aligned CNT fibers in recent years with an emphasis on the use in energy, as well as their future direction.
