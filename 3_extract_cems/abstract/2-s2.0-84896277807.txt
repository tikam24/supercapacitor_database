The energy storage system (ESS) is playing an important role in the hybrid system. Because of the high power density of the supercapacitor (SC) and the high energy density of the battery, the hybrid ESS with the two energy storing devices is widely used in the hybrid vehicles. But the research on the hybrid ESS in hybrid construction machinery is nearly blank. According to the characteristics of the hybrid ESS, the structure applied to the hybrid construction machinery is put forward, and the power converter DC-DC is designed and simulated, too. The simulation results prove that the bidirectional DC-DC can meet the requirement of the hybrid ESS. Â© (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
