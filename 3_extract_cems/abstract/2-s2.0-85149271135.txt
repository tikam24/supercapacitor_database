Transition metal nitrides are trustworthy electroactive materials due to their merits like good electrical conductivity, wettability, multi-oxidation state, and higher specific capacity than metal oxides and carbon materials. In the present work, titanium nitride is deposited over a highly flexible graphite substrate using physical vapour deposition process. The physiochemical studies confirmed the formation of TiN film over the graphite substrate and also exhibited flexible characteristics. The nitrogen content of the electrode provides considerable wettability to the electrode surface while having better conductivity. Noticeably, the as-fabricated negative electrode showed pseudocapacitive property with a good specific capacitance of 86 mF cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2 and stable cycling performance with 80% capacitance retention even after 3000 cycles at 3 mA cm−2. The results of this study demonstrate that these metal nitrides can be considered as an alternative negative electrode for supercapacitor applications.
