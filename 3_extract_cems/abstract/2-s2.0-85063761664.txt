Electric double-layer supercapacitors are a class of energy storage device whose strengths are long lifespan and high power handling. They have a niche to fill in the gradual transition to fully electric transport systems and are expected to have future applications in textile-based energy storage and flexible electronics. Relatively new electrode materials, based on graphene, offer an opportunity for improvement over the existing commercial standard of activated carbon; however, challenges still lay ahead to bring more of these materials to market. In this review, we discuss the scientific challenges in the development of novel electric double-layer supercapacitor electrodes and present some recent highlights.
