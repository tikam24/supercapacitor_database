By condensing M and TFP under solvothermal conditions, a new porous organic polymer POP M-TFP was obtained. The electrode modified with triazine containing POP M-TFP exhibits well-defined rapid redox processes and showed a high specific capacitance of 130.5 F g −1 at 2 A g −1 , suggesting well electrochemical performance.
