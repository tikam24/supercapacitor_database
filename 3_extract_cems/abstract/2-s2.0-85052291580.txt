Two-dimensional MXene materials have demonstrated attractive electrical and electrochemical properties in energy storage applications. Adding stretchability to MXene remains challenging due to its high mechanical stiffness and weak intersheet interaction, so the assembling techniques for mechanically stable MXene architectures require further development. We report a simple fabrication by harnessing the interfacial instability to generate higher dimensional MXene nanocoatings capable of programmed crumpling/unfolding. A sequential patterning approach enabled the design of sequence-dependent MXene textures across multiple length scales, which were utilized for controllable wetting surfaces and high-areal-capacitance electrodes. We next transferred the crumpled MXene nanocoating onto an elastomer to fabricate an MXene/elastomer electrode with high stretchability. The accordion-like MXene can be reversibly folded/unfolded and still preserve efficient specific capacitances. We further fabricated asymmetric MXene supercapacitors, and the devices demonstrated efficient electrochemical performance and large deformability (180Â° bendability, 100% stretchability). Our texturing techniques can be applied to large MXene families for designing stretchable architectures in wearable electronics.
