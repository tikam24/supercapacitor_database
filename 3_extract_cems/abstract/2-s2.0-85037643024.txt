Currently, supercapacitors have the shortcoming of limited operation temperature mainly owing to the low thermal stability of separators, which seriously hinder their application at high temperatures. In this work, a simple and universal method for the fabrication of high-temperature standing ceramic-based separators is reported. It was demonstrated that such a separator can withstand over 350 °C without any shrinkage. Supercapacitors fabricated by using such separators can be operated at as high as 120 °C efficiently and even after 9000 cycles at 2.5 V operation voltage, their capacitance still retained approximately 88 % of their initial performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a separator with such high thermal stability.
