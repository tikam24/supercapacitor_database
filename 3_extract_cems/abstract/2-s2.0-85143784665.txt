Ti3C2Tx MXene fiber has shown extraordinary potential for supercapacitor electrode in wearable electronics and textile energy storage, but realizing high energy density and practical-powered applications remains a great challenge. Here, we report a covalent-architected molybdenum disulfide-Ti3C2Tx (MoS2-Ti3C2Tx) core-shell fiber for high-performance supercapacitor. Benefiting from the microfluidic and micro-reaction strategies, the ordered MoS2 arrays are strongly bridged on Ti3C2Tx fiber via Ti-O-Mo bond, resulting in large exposed surface, enhanced porosity and excellent interfacial conduction for charges high diffusion and faradaic transfer. The MoS2-Ti3C2Tx fiber exhibits ultra-large capacitance of 2028 F cm−3 and admirable reversibility in 1 M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. Meanwhile, MoS2-Ti3C2Tx fiber-based solid-state supercapacitor presents high energy density of 23.86 mWh cm−3, capacitance of 1073.6 F cm−3 and superior cycling ability of 92.13% retention after 20,000 cycles, which can realize stable energy supply for wearable watch, LEDs, electric fans, toy ship and self-powered devices. Our work may provide an insightful guidance for the advanced design of structural fiber towards robust new energy and next-generation wearable industry.
