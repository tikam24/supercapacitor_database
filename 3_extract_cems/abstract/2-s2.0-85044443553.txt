Capacitance properties of TUBALL single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were studied. The SWCNTs were pretreated in hydrochloric acid, washed, and dried at 200 째C. The modification reaction was carried out in a flow reactor with a McBain balance. A SWCNT sample was heated in an argon flow to a specified temperature. The surface of carbon nanotubes was modified with nitrogen atoms in a 40 % NH3-C2H4 medium at a temperature of 600-750 째C. The modified N-SWCNTs were found to contain four nitrogen species: pyridinic, pyrrolic, graphitic (quaternary), and oxidized ones. As the treatment temperature of SWCNTs in an ethylene-ammonia mixture was raised, the fraction of pyridinic nitrogen decreased and the fraction of graphitic nitrogen increased. Capacitance characteristics of carbon nanotubes were studied in a two-electrode electrochemical cell (the prototype of a symmetric supercapacitor) using an organic electrolyte represented by the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMIMBF4). The shape of cyclic voltammetry (CVA) curves was virtually similar for all samples. However, the modified N-SWCNT samples had a lower resistance as compared to the initial material, which was indicated by a smaller broadening of their CVA curves. The maximum specific capacitance for all samples was reached at a slow charging-discharging of electrodes. Nitrogen doping of SWCNTs decreased the capacitance of the material, which showed up as a higher capacitance at an increased charging-discharging rate. Upon raising the nitrogen doping temperature, the specific surface area of the samples substantially decreased from 960 m2/g for SWCNTs and N-SWCNT (600째C) to 410 m2/g for NSWCNT (750째), whereas the specific capacitance calculated per 1 m2 increased.
