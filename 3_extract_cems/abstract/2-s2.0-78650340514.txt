Ni(OH)2 and Co(OH)2 with a nanostructure were synthesized by an easy hydrothermal method without using any organic reagent. NiO and Co3O4 were obtained via heat-treatment of the hydrates at 250°C and characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and N2 adsorption-desorption analysis. The characterization results indicate that the metal oxides have a disordered mesoporous structure and high BET surface area. The results of electrochemical tests show that the mesoporous metal oxides have fine supercapacitive behaviors and their specific capacitance values at the discharging current of 5 mA are 176 and 298 F · g-1, respectively.
