Planar interdigital micro supercapacitor with the graphene growth via Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) with the different temperatures has been investigated in this works. The structure of the micro supercapacitor consists of SiO2 substrate, graphene growth on Nickel (Ni) electrodes coated with Polypyrrole (Ppy) and Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) layers as solid state electrolyte. A single layer of graphene which has sp2 hybridized carbon atoms is one of the promising material that has been used for micro supercapacitor electrodes due to several advantages such as high specific surface area, high thermal conductivity and high electron mobility. PECVD method is a main method for graphene growth due to the advantages such as high growth selectivity and good control in nanostructure patterning. In this works, the graphene growth on the interdigital electrodes was investigated in various temperatures from 400°C to 1000°C. The graphene growth structure on the interdigital electrodes of micro supercapacitor was characterized by Raman Spectroscopy. Raman Spectroscopy was carried out using a 532 nm laser excitation. A Raman spectrum of graphene was observed on interdigital electrode have identified three peaks which is D band, G band and 2D band. Raman spectra show that the intensity ratio of the 2D band and G band at 1000°C of 0.43 indicating a good quality of multilayer graphene growth.
