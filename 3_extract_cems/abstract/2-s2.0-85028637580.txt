Melamine/graphene (GO/MF) aerogel composite was prepared through a simple one-step hydrothermal route, freeze-drying, and subsequent carbonization with graphene oxide (GO) and melamine resin. The structure, morphology and electrochemical performance of the composites were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD-ray, Raman spectroscopy, and electrochemical tests. GO/MF aerogel possessed 3D porous structure and enlarged surface like aerogel materials for efficient ionic diffusion and transport. Melamine resin was used as N-doping agent, and the electrochemical performance of GO//MF was improved effectively. GO/MF aerogel shows a higher capacitance of 106 F/g at a current density of 0.1 A/g comparing to reduce graphen oxide (rGO). Not only the macroporous structure but also the N-doping agent had a significant impact on the capacitive behavior of graphene. These results provide a new method to prepare high performance electrode material as supercapacitors.
