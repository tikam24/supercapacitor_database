Chlorophylls (Chls) are the most naturally abundant organic dye pigments on earth. However, there is little research on Chl polymers so far. In this paper, we demonstrate the fabrication of a series of polymerized chlorophyll-a derivatives with different central metals (PolyMChls, M = Mg, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Ga) via the electrochemical coupling of a peripheral vinyl group at the C3-position on the chlorin macrocycle. The formation of PolyMChls is confirmed by the broadening and slight red-shift of the Soret band in their ultraviolet−visible absorption spectra. PolyMChl films yield a morphology of uniform stacked nanospheres (PolyCuChl ∼ 237 nm), while the original MChl particles are irregular with a size of about 10 μm by scanning electron microscopy. When these PolyMChl films are employed as the working electrodes in a three-electrode system, the highest capacitance of 334 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 is obtained for PolyCuChl. Basing on the widely existing Chl derivatives, we find a new biopolymer family. The great potential of biopolymer PolyMChl is also exhibited in the energy storage area.
