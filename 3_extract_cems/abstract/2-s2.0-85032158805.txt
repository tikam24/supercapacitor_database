This chapter summarizes the various strategies for the controlled synthesis of conducting polymer/inorganic nanostructure interfaces. We aimed to give a brief overview on the wealth of possibilities, also highlighting the particular importance of each method. The presented approaches span through chemical, electrochemical, and photo-polymerization of the conducting polymer (CP), but certain examples for the in situ formation of the inorganic component was also demonstrated. One common feature in all cases was the precise control over the properties of the organic/inorganic interface. Such control may include the manipulation of the composition, morphology, and optoelectronic properties of the hybrid assembly. It is also important that various comparative studies evidenced the superior performance of such prepared hybrid materials compared to their counterparts obtained via simple mechanical mixing. We really hope that the materials science community will increasingly exploit these smart methods in the future, to obtain nanohybrid materials with advanced properties.
