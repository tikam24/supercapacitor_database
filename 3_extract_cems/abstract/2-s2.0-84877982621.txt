Well-separated RGO sheets decorated with MnO2 nanoparticles facilitate easy access of the electrolyte ions to the high surface area of the paper electrode, enabling the fabrication of a thicker electrode with heavier areal mass and higher areal capacitance (up to 897 mF cm-2). The electrochemical performance of the bent asymmetric device with a total active mass of 15 mg remains similar to the one in the flat configuration, demonstrating good mechanical robustness of the device.
