The conventional PV metrology using resisters, electronic loads, or capacitors as the load to any PV generator is replaced in this approach by using a bank of supercapacitors, distinct advantages of which have been thoroughly pre-verified. An exhaustive I-V databank for varying capacities of PV modules has been drawn up and analyzed for different levels of climatic conditions on a daily and seasonal basis. Encouraging and consistent results pertaining to standard electrical parameters of a PV module assures the highly satisfactory quality of the new PV measurement technique. An appropriately scaled-up version of the plotter is expected to enhance the reliability of PV metrology and related forecasting.
