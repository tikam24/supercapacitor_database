Hybrid capacitors, which bear the advantages of secondary batteries and supercapacitors, can deliver high power with a relatively fair amount of energy. However, its kinetic performance, especially at low temperatures, is strongly limited by the battery-type electrode and electrolyte. In this work, Na-ion, which has a lower solvation energy than Li-ion, is chosen as the charge carrier to build the hybrid capacitor. A sodium-ion hybrid capacitor is built with an activated carbon cathode and a pre-sodiated hard carbon anode. To achieve a better kinetic performance, the de-solvation energy and interphase resistance is decreased through replacing conventional carbonate electrolyte with a diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME) based electrolyte. As a result, the sodium-ion capacitor delivers an energy density of 42 Wh kg–1 and a high power of 4565 W kg–1 for 3000 cycles at 2.5 A g–1. Furthermore, this capacitor could sustain an energy density of 36 Wh kg–1 at the low temperature of −30 °C and maintain 70% of the capacity after 500 cycles. The strategies of reducing de-solvation energy and optimizing the solid electrolyte interphase property offers a clear path for developing electrochemical energy storage devices at lower temperatures.
