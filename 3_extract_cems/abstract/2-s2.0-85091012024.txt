Nanoscale polyaniline (PANI) is formed on a hierarchical 3D microstructure carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/carbon fiber paper (CFP) substrate via a one-step electrochemical polymerization method. The chemical and structural properties of the binder-free PANI/CNTs/CFP electrode are characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The specific capacitance of PANI/CNTs/CFP tested in a symmetric two-electrode system reaches 731.6 mF·cm-2 (1354.7 F·g-1) at a current density of 1 mA·cm-2 (1.8 A·g-1). The symmetric supercapacitor device demonstrates excellent cycling performance up to 10,000 cycles with a capacitance retention of 81.4% at a current density of 1 mA·cm-2 (1.8 A·g-1). The results demonstrate that the binder-free CNTs/CFP composite is a strong backbone for depositing ultrathin PANI layers at a high mass loading. The hierarchical 3D microstructure PANI/CNTs/CFP provides enough space and transporting channels to form an efficient electrode-electrolyte interface for the supercapacitance reaction. The formed nanoscale PANI film coaxially coated on the sidewalls of CNTs enables efficient charge transfer and a shortened diffusion length. Hence, the utilization efficiency and electrochemical performances of PANI are significantly improved. The rational design strategy of a CNT-based binder-free hierarchical 3D microstructure can be used in preparing various advanced energy-storage electrodes for electrochemical energy-storage and conversion systems.
