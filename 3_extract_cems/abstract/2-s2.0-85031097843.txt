Polyhedral-like NiMn-layered double hydroxide/porous carbon (NiMn-LDH/PC-x) composites are successfully synthesized by hydrothermal method (x = 1, 2 means different mass percent of porous carbon (PC) in composites). The NiMn-LDH/PC-1 composites possess specific capacitance 1634 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, and it is much better than that of pure LDH (1095 F g−1 at 1 A g−1). Besides, the sample can retain 84.58% of original capacitance after 3000 cycles at 15 A g−1. An asymmetric supercapacitor with NiMn-LDH/PC-1 as anode and activated carbon as cathode is fabricated, and the supercapacitor can achieve an energy density of 18.60 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 225.03 W kg−1. The enhanced electrochemical performance attributes to the high faradaic pseudocapacitance of NiMn-LDH, the introduction of PC, and the 3D porous structure of LDH/PC-1 composites. The introduction of PC hinders serious agglomeration of LDH and further accelerates ions transport. The encouraging results indicate that these materials are one of the most potential candidates for energy storage devices.
