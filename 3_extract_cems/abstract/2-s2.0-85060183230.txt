CuO-SnO 2 reverse cubic heterojunctions are successfully synthesized by a hydrothermal reaction and a subsequent heat treatment method. CuO-SnO 2 heterojunctions not only manifest a large specific capacitance of 1972 F g -1 even at 1.0 A g -1 , but also fine rate properties with 1695 F g -1 at 10 A g -1 and an excellent capacitance retention of nearly 96.05% over 10,000 cycles in 6 M KOH electrolyte. In addition, the specific capacitance of CuO-SnO 2 heterojunctions presents a parabolic trend with the increase of SnO 2 concentration. The asymmetrical supercapacitor made from the CuO-9 wt% SnO 2 heterojunction demonstrates a remarkable energy density of 117.32 W h kg -1 at a power density of 13,624.26 W kg -1 . It is noteworthy that even at a high power density of 36,663.16 W kg -1 , the energy density can reach 96.75 W h kg -1 . The higher specific capacitance of the CuO-SnO 2 heterojunctions mainly comes from their high conductivity which is improved by the high electron hole state in the heterojunctions. The excellent electrochemical properties of CuO-SnO 2 heterojunctions can be attributed to their unique band structures and great conductivity, which allows efficient charge transport and electrolyte diffusion.
