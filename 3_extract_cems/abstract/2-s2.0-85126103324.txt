Low-grade heat recovery through ion redistribution (i.e., Soret effect) in electric double-layer capacitors is a recent emergence for the conversion of thermal energy into electrical energy. A popular approach to improving the performance of such devices is optimizing the composition of the electrolyte. However, in addition to the thermodiffusion behavior of electrolyte ions, the electrode-electrolyte interactions also play a vital role in determining the ionic Seebeck coefficient, although it has not been clearly investigated. In this work, the crucial role of electrode-electrolyte interactions in thermoelectric conversion efficiency is demonstrated by employing vertical graphene as a base material for surface modification. After the surface modification via ozone treatment, oxygen-containing functional groups are enriched on graphene sheets. After improving the interfacial interactions between vertical graphene electrode and electrolyte, the ionic Seebeck coefficient is largely enhanced by 4.6-fold (up to 1 mV K-1) while the capacitance is improved by 1.29 times. Density functional theory calculations reveal that such a high thermal response originates from the stronger ion-electrode interaction and the higher charge transfer efficiency via oxygen-containing functional groups. In addition, the energy stored in supercapacitors can be extracted by discharging through a resistor. The findings of this study can help us to better understand the role of electrode-electrolyte interactions in increasing the ionic Seebeck coefficient, providing a new strategy for improved heat-to-electric conversion.
