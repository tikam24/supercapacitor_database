Renewable energy system such as a photovoltaic, a wind turbine generation and fuel cell has attracted attention as alternative energy sources of fossil fuel. However, a distributed generating system with the photovoltaic or the wind turbine generation is difficult to obtain a constant power supply. Thus control of power leveling system is required to maintain the balance of power flow for irregular power generation. The system is required to respond to change of voltage balance and bidirectional power flow of charge or discharge. Therefore the bidirectional buck/boost DC/DC converter with an electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) is applied for the control of PL system in this research. And the deadbeat control is applied to the system for obtaining quick and accurate response. This paper discusses the effectiveness of deadbeat control for power leveling unit by experiment.
