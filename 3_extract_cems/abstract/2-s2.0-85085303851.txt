Capacitance is one of the main electrical parameters of supercapacitors, and constant current discharge method is recommended to measure the capacitance of supercapacitors in related standards. Influences of the charging and discharge current, the initial terminal voltage of the capacitor were analyzed based on experiments. And uncertainty of the capacitance measurement was evaluated. Results show that the discharge current has a great influence on the measurement, and the capacitance decreases as the discharge current increases. The charging current and initial voltage have a small effect. The expanded uncertainty of capacitance measurement is 2.2% by constant current discharge method with a confidence factor of 2.
