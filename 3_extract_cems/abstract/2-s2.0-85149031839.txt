Herein, we reported the solution-based techniques to attach vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) to graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets. The composite has been checked for its improved hybrid super capacitive performance. The addition of the GO to V2O5 significantly enhances the nanocomposite electrochemical performance. The composites demonstrate markedly high specific capacitance up to 438.1 Fg−1 at 1 Ag−1. Moreover, the supercapacitor electrodes provide high energy density and improved retention capacitance. The introduction of GO in the composites increases the surface area by providing a highly conductive path and functional surface to attach V2O5 nanoparticles. The performance of the VG-3 sample electrode remained excellent electrochemically. These findings suggest that vanadium pentoxide/graphene oxide (VG) composites may be an effective active material for supercapacitor electrodes.
