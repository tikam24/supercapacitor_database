Micro/mesoporous carbon was prepared by chlorination of ordered mesoporous silicon carbide derived from magnesio-thermal reduction of templated carbon-silica precursors. These materials were then used as active materials for electrochemical capacitors and characterized in 1.5 M NEt4BF 4/AN. The electrodes showed outstanding rate capability (90% of capacity retention at 1 V/s and time constant of 1 s) with high specific areal capacitance (0.5 F/cm2 of electrode), that makes such hierarchical porous carbons promising for high power and energy density supercapacitors.
