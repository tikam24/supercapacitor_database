Multilevel inverters are readily used in renewable energy applications to overcome issues such as high harmonics distortion, higher switching losses and high voltage stress. This paper highlights a control scheme for multilevel inverter in a hybrid generation based islanded microgrid.Photovoltaic arrays and fuel cells are the prime sources for the multilevel inverter. Supercapacitor is employed as the energy storage system to overcome the slow nature of FC and variable nature of PV arrays. The control scheme includes voltage controlling ability of the inverter along with the pulse width modulation technique to generate controlled switching pulses for multilevel inverter switches. The results are verified through a simulation model on MATLAB / SIMULINK environment.
