In this work, nitrogen-doped carbon materials (NCMs) were prepared using aniline-phenol benzoxazine (BOZ) or aniline-cardanol benzoxazine as the carbon precursor and SBA-15 as the hard template. The effects of the carbonization temperature (700, 800, and 900 °C) and different nitrogen contents on the electrochemical properties of carbon materials were investigated. The samples synthesized using aniline-phenol benzoxazine as precursors and treated at 900 °C (NCM-900) exhibited an excellent electrochemical performance. The specific capacitance was 460 F/g at a current density of 0.25 A/g and the cycle stability was excellent (96.1% retention rate of the initial capacitance after 2000 cycles) in a 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte with a three-electrode system. Furthermore, NCM-900 also exhibited a high specific capacitance, comparable energy/power densities, and excellent cycling stability using a symmetrical electrode system. The characterization of the morphology and structure of the materials suggests it possessed an ordered mesoporous structure and a large specific surface area. NCM-900 could thus be considered a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.
