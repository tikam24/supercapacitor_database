In this paper, highly porous carbon as an electrode material was derived from litchi pericarp (denoted as L-PC) via carbonization combined with KOH activation process. L-PC displayed high specific surface area (3438 m2 g−1) and high pore volume (1.92 cm3 g−1). The electrochemical capacitive properties of L-PC using KOH aqueous electrolyte were studied in three and two-electrode cells. The specific capacitance was 407 F g−1 in the three-electrode system at 1 A g−1, which was much higher than that of other biomass-derived porous carbon. In the two-electrode cell, the symmetric supercapacitors could work in a voltage window of 1.0 V. The highest specific capacitance of 70 F g−1 and energy density of 9.7 Wh kg−1 were exhibited in the two-electrode cells. About 98% of the initial capacitance was retained after 6000 cycles at 2.0 A g−1 in the cell. The highly porous carbon derived from litchi pericarp might act as an ideal electrode material for high performance supercapacitors.
