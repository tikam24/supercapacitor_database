The nanocrystalline nickel oxide was prepared by a citrate-gel method. The results showed that the NiOx prepared in the optimum condition (CA:Ni2+ mole ratio 1.3: 1.0, annealing at 400Â°C for 1h). The electrochemical capacitive behaviors of the NiOx electrodes wer, characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronopotentiometry (CP) and A.C. impedance in 1 mol/L KOH aqueous solution. The electrochemical measurements indicated that the prepared samples exhibited high specific capacitance of 78.74 F/g, and excellent cyclic ability.
