In the present study, CoS2 thin-film electrodes are synthesized at different bath temperatures using a simple chemical bath deposition (CBD) method. The bath temperature controls the phase stability of the CoS2 thin film along the in-plane direction up to 353 K. However, at 363 K, an oxide phase is included in the film. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies showed enhanced crystallinity of CoS2 as the bath temperature increased and evolution in surface morphology from immature nanoflakes to well-grown aligned mature nanoflakes. A specific capacitance of 800 F g-1 is obtained from cyclic voltammetry measurements by utilizing the 83.6 m2 g-1 surface area of CoS2 nanoflakes synthesized at 353 K. The hierarchical distribution of pores gives rise to a high specific energy and specific power of 40.74 W h kg-1 and 3333 W kg-1, respectively, as a result of utilization of the high electrochemically active surface area. Furthermore, good long-term cycling stability of CoS2 nanoflakes has been observed in a 2 M KOH electrolyte. A low impedance value suggests that the CoS2 nanoflake electrode prepared by a facile CBD method is a potential candidate for supercapacitor application.
