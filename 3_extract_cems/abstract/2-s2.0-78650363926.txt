In this work a design and selection methodology for seamless integration of different components of the powertrain based on Multicriteria Decision Making is proposed. This paper describes powertrain selection process involved with electric city bus. First, all possible drivetrain classification are done based on number of motors used, their position and energy sources. For each of drivetrain obtained, possible motor drive type is chosen. Further, for each of drivetrain and motor drive, suitable power electronic converter/inverter is chosen. Finally, large number of powertrains obtained by combining drivetrain, motor type, and power converter are qualitatively compared on the basis of selection criteria governed by requirements of electric city bus driving pattern. A final powertrain is selected using Multicriteria Decision Making process. Â© 2010 IEEE.
