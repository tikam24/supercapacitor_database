In this study S doped g-C3N4 nanoparticles were successfully prepared by one step solid state microwave synthesis. The detailed characterizations through XRD, FT IR, SEM and XPS were studied. In addition, the electrochemical properties as supercapacitor of the sample were tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. The r esults showed a high specific capacitance of 691 F/g at current density of 4 A/g in 2 M KOH + 0.15 M K3[Fe(6 electrolyte This study shows that the microwave synthesis is a promising way to design carbon based elect rodes for supercapacitor.
