Polyaniline (PANI) is a promising material for developing high-performance supercapacitors, and adopting some specific templates to design one-dimensional nanostructured PANI electrode is considered to be a key strategy to enable high performance supercapacitors. Here, the nano-tubular PANI(HNTs) were successfully achieved by using the natural tubular halloysite as hard template with low cost, and the PANI(HNTs) were further compounded with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to prepare a binder-free, self-supporting PANI(HNTs)-rGO composite electrode. The characterization tests of Infrared, Raman and XRD diffraction proved that PANI (HNTs) and PANI (HNTs)-rGO composite material were successfully synthesized. SEM and TEM verified the nanotubular structure of PANI(HNTs) and the three-dimensional network structure of PANI(HNTs)-rGO. Owing to the rGO’ positive effect on the PANI(HNTs) electrode, the composite electrode exhibited excellent specific capacity performance of 762 F g−1, 660 F g−1, 595 F g−1, 545 F g−1 and 493 F g−1 at current densities of 1 A g−1, 2 A g−1, 5 A g−1, 10 A g−1, and 20 A g−1, respectively. This work prove that natural clay minerals have good application prospects in the design of nanostructured electrodes of conductive polymers (CPs) or other electrode materials for energy storage devices.
