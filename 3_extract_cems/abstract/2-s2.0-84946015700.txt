Herein, we report a facile, low-cost and one-step electrodeposition approach for the synthesis MnCo2O4 (MCO) nanosheet arrays on indium doped tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates. The crystalline phase and morphology of the materials are studied by x-ray diffraction, energy dispersive x-ray analysis and field-emission scanning electron microscopy. The supercapacitor performance of the MCO nanosheets are studied in a three-electrode configuration in 2 M KOH electrolyte. The as-prepared binder-free electrode shows a high specific capacitance of 290 F g-1 at 1 mV s-1 with excellent cyclic stability even after 1000 charge/discharge cycles. The obtained energy density and power density of the MCO nanosheets are 10.04 Wh kg-1 and 5.2 kW kg-1 respectively. The superior electrochemical performances are mainly attributed to its nanosheet like structure which provides a large reaction surface area, and fast ion and electron transfer rate.
