With the fast development of supercapacitor and triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), it is now possible to fabricate biomimetic pressure sensors with high flexibility and sustainability. Herein, an ultrathin supercapacitor is fabricated with the paper sheet and the solid electrolyte for storing energy generated by TENG. With a sandwich design, the triboelectrodes sandwiched within the two solid supercapacitors can not only store electrical energy by a wireless energy transfer mode but also help TENG imitate the receptor's unique characteristics by simultaneously measuring both static and dynamic pressures in a self-driven mode. In addition, the voltage of the supercapacitor increases linearly with the vibration times, which hints that this integrated device also endows functions such as vibration counting and frequency computing. This work contributes to new strategies for making multifunctional biomimetic electronics that promote the development of artificial intelligence.
