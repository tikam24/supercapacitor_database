Novel hybrid nanomaterials comprising metal-organic framework compounds carbonised in the presence of biomass material derived from rice husk have been investigated as a new class of sustainable supercapacitor materials for electrochemical energy storage. Specifically, two synthetic routes were employed to grow Co/Mn metal-organic framework compounds in the channels of rice husks, which had been activated previously by heat treatment in air at 400 °C to produce a highly porous network. Pyrolysis of these hybrid materials under nitrogen at 700 °C for 6 h produced metal-containing phases within the nanocarbon, comprising intimate mixtures of Co, MnO and CoMn2O4. The materials thus produced are characterized in detail using a range of physical methods including XRD, electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The synthetic pathway to the metal-organic framework compound is shown to influence significantly the physical properties of the resulting material. Electrochemical evaluation of the materials fabricated revealed that higher specific capacitances were obtained when smaller crystallite sized bimetallic Co/Mn-MOFs were grown inside the rice husks channels compared to larger crystallite sizes. This was in-part due to increased metal oxide loading into the rice husk owing to the smaller crystallite size as well as the increased pseudocapacitance exhibited by the smaller crystallite sizes and increased porosity.
