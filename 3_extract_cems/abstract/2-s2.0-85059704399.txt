We describe a facile and low-cost hydrothermal method to synthesize hierarchical CuMoO4 nanosheets (NS-CuMoO4) and their composite with graphene (NS-CuMoO4/rGO) on a nickel foam (NF) substrate without any binders. Maximum specific capacitances of 2342 and 1300 F g−1 at a current density of 1.8 A g−1 were estimated for NS-CuMoO4/rGO/NF and NS-CuMoO4/NF electrodes, respectively. Furthermore, the NS-CuMoO4/rGO/NF electrode maintained 86% of its initial capacitance when the current density increased from 1.8 to 16.5 A g−1, which indicates an exceptional rate capability. Notably, the NS-CuMoO4/rGO/NF electrode showed an excellent cycling stability of more than 98% over 4000 successive cycles, which was higher than the NS-CuMoO4/NF electrode with an 88% specific capacitance retention. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled using Ns-CuMoO4/rGO/NF that showed excellent performance with high energy/power densities and a substantial cycling stability. Our findings suggest the NS-CuMoO4/rGO/NF electrode has potential for future applications in high-performance supercapacitors.
