MXene based layered materials have exhibited excellent performance in supercapacitor applications owing to their high conductivity. However, device planarization hinders their broader ability in a film-based energy storage device. Here, we have demonstrated the fabrication of self-assembled MXene-graphene oxide (M-GO) composites based on the electrostatic interaction between MXene and GO solutions. The as-prepared M-GO composite possessed homogeneous structures and tunable conductivities according to different GO contents, which benefit both charge storage and ions transmission. The first-assembly sandwiched supercapacitors based on these M-GO composites showed a maximum specific capacitance value of 39.0 mF/cm2 (10.9 mF/cm2 for MXene based devices). The enhanced electrochemical performance after self-assembly was due to the improved interface effect between electrodes and electrolytes. Additionally, the introduction of GO guarantees the completeness of designed M-GO patterns without the need for additives, and it is worth noting that with the assistance of a laser fabrication technique, planar supercapacitors based on the most suitable M-GO (with mass ratio of M:GO = 1:1) composite could be obtained by ablating the unwanted areas. Additionally, planar M-GO based supercapacitors also exhibited excellent electrochemical performance, which demonstrated the great potential of M-GO composite supercapacitors in wearable electronic applications.
