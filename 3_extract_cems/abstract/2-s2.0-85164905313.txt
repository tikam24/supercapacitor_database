Biomass-derived carbon materials have gained momentum due to their natural abundance, unique porous structures and environmental friendly behavior. In this work, different machine learning methods have been applied for studying the effect of surface chemistry on the in-operando behavior of various biomass-derived carbon electrode materials with different structural properties, such as pore size, specific surface area of mesopores and micropores. Further, quantitative descriptions have been established for predicting the electrochemical properties of electrode materials. In addition, the effect of key features on energy density was also investigated. ANN model for both the parameters showed the highest correlation coefficient value as 0.99 suggesting good fit of the predicted and experimental data. Through an exhaustive analysis of literature-driven experimental data with various machine learning methods, we report the quantitative correlations between the different physiochemical features of carbon-based electrodes which would be useful for their efficiency optimization in energy storage devices.
