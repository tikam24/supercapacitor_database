In order to facilitate applications of fiber-based flexible wearable electronic devices, upgrade flexible wearable electronics technology and drive the transformation of the traditional textile and clothing industry, the recent research development and advances in fiber-based wearable electronic devices were summarized in this review. According to the end-uses, fiber-based wearable devices were systematically classified into sensors, energy devices and other functional electronics. Problems in the development of fiber-based wearable equipment were discussed, and it is established that the research concentration of fiber-based wearable electronic devices will be focused on multi-interdisciplinary, electronic integration to form a system, safety, washability and wearing comfort. The fiber/yarn-based wearable electronic devices will play an important role in the next generation of multi-functional flexible wearable electronic products.
