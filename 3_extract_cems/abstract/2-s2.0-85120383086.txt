MXenes have attracted wide attention in the field of energy storage due to their high electrical conductivity, good hydrophilicity and diversified surface terminals. Herein, Ti2C MXene film with good flexibility is successfully prepared which exhibits excellent gravimetric capacity in the currently reported MXene family. And the coupling mechanism of the surface terminations of Ti2C MXene in aqueous electrolytes on the capacitance behavior is proposed. The flexible Ti2C film directly used as electrode for supercapacitors shows good electrochemical performance with specific capacitance up to 382F g−1 at 2 mV s−1 and 265F g−1 at 100 mV s−1, indicating that it is a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.
