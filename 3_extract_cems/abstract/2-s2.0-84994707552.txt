Mesoporous reduced graphene oxide (m-rGO) was synthesized by mixing Zn and graphene oxide in acidic conditions followed by ultrasonication and was investigated as a supercapacitor electrode in a 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (EMIM-TFSI) electrolyte. m-rGO shows a specific capacitance of 104.3 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and a decrease in capacitance of 3% after 5000 cycles. The high performance is attributed to the significant mesopores, facilitating mass transport of the electrolyte. Thus, we report the facile synthesis of m-rGO with enhanced capacitance and durability in an ionic liquid electrolyte that has great potential for electrochemical energy storage applications.
