Investigation of commercial supercapacitor cell samples indicates a specific capacitance of maximum 25-30 F/g whereas in the literature more than 100 F/g has been reported for experimental cells. Activated (nanoporou carbon based electrodes on aluminum foil substrate extracted from the assembled coil of a typical supercapacitor cell of high performance at this time have been analyzed. The electrode thickness can reach 200 μm and the metallic foil substrate 30 μm. SEM images have indicated carbon particles with a size in the range of 0.1-10 μm as the main constituent. At higher magnification, thin fibers attributed to polymer binder have been distinguished. The binder material may cover part of the particle surface and lower exposed area at the interface with the electrolyte (or lower specific capacitance) is available for the electrode. Mesopores of 10-20 nm and higher size are not exhibited in large number at the particle's surface and most of the surface is free of such pores. Existing micropores (size up to 2 nm) have not been revealed with the available magnifications and their contribution to the specific capacitance depends on the penetration of electrolyte ions. Activated carbon of high specific capacitance demonstrated in experimental cell electrodes, reported in the literature may be not yet cost effective for its use in commercial supercapacitors. © 2010 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.
