Transition metal tungstate-based nanomaterials have become one of the research hotspots in electrochemistry due to their abundant natural resources, low costs, and environmental friendliness. Extensive studies have demonstrated their significant potentials for electrochemical applications, such as supercapacitors, Li-ion batteries, Na-ion batteries, electrochemical sensing, and electrocatalysis. Considering the rapidly growing research enthusiasm for this topic over the last several years, herein, a critical review of recent progress on the application of transition metal tungstates and their composites for electrochemical applications is summarized. The relationships between synthetic methods, nano/micro structures and electrochemical properties are systematically discussed. Finally, their promising prospects for future development are also proposed. It is anticipated that this review will inspire ongoing interest in rational designing and fabricating novel transition metal tungstate-based nanomaterials for high-performance electrochemical devices.
