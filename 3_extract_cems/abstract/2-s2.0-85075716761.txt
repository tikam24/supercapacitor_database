Hybrid materials have obtained well-deserved attention for energy storage devices, because they show high capacitances and high energy densities induced by the synergistic effect between complementary components. Polyoxometalate-based metal–organic frameworks (POMOFs) possess the abundant redox-active sites and ordered structures of polyoxometalates (POMs) and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), respectively. Here, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) NENU-5/PPy/60//FeMo/C was fabricated in which both its electrodes are prepared from POMOF precursors. A typical POMOF material, NENU-5, was first connected with polypyrrole (PPy) through electrodeposition to form the cathode material NENU-5/PPy. Another representative POMOFs material, PMo12@MIL-100, was carbonized to obtain the anode material FeMo/C. Cathode NENU-5/PPy exhibited an extraordinary capacitance of 508.62 F g−1 (areal capacitance: 2034.51 mF cm−2). In addition, anode FeMo/C shows excellent cyclic stability attributed to its unique structure. Finally, benefiting from the outstanding capacitances and structural merits of the anode and cathode, assembled asymmetric supercapacitor NENU-5/PPy/60//FeMo/C achieves an energy density of 1.12 mWh cm−3 at a power density output of 27.78 mW cm−3, as well as a notable life of 10 000 cycles with an capacity retention of 80.62 %. Thus, the unique ASC is strongly competitive in high capacitance, long cycle life, and high energy-required energy storage devices.
