MXene composites with different metal oxides have recently demonstrated good electrochemical performance with enhanced conductivity and also hinder the restacking of MXene. With this motivation, we synthesized the nickel oxide@MXene (NO@MXene) series with varying compositions, which was screen-printed on a flexible stainless-steel mesh (FSSM) substrate as an anode for a supercapacitor. The effect of sample composition, i.e., 5% NO@MX, 10% NO@MX, 15% NO@MX, and 20% NO@MX, on the electrochemical properties is studied systematically. The 15% NO@MX composite electrode demonstrated a maximum capacitance of 1542 F g-1@6 mA cm-2 current density in 1 M KOH. An all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) with 15% NO@MX (anode) and copper oxide (cathode) displayed a 1 V potential window. The device exhibited a specific capacitance of 73.3 F g-1@10 mA cm-2 current density with a maximum energy density of 10.7 Wh kg-1 and a power density of 3333 W kg-1 in polymer gel of PVA-KOH electrolyte. The cyclic stability of the device demonstrates 90.6% capacitance retention over 5000 cycles. It is envisaged that 15% NO@MX as an anode would serve as a promising electrode for the all-solid-state device for supercapacitor applications.
