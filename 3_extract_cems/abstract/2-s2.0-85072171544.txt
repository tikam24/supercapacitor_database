Graphitic carbon nitride doped Manganese sulfide (g-C3N4 doped MnS) nanoparticles are synthesized by Sol-gel technique and its structural and supercapacitive behavior are studied. X-ray diffraction pattern and Raman spectra results confirm the presence υ-MnS phase. Scanning and Transmission electron microscope image reveals the formation of spherical morphology with an average diameter of the particle is around 40 nm. g-C3N4 doped MnS electrode exhibits excellent supercapacitive behavior. The material delivers a high specific capacitance of 463.32 F g−1 at the scan rate of 10 mV s−1 and 98.6% specific capacitance retained after 2000 cycles. The existence of spherical morphology and doping of graphitic carbon nitride, facilitate the electron transport and improves the structural stability of the material.
