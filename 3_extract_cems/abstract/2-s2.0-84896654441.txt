The proceedings contain 129 papers. The topics discussed include: wireless automatic water-meter reading system; testing and shaping for the performance of a system, used for solar energy production; measurement of the sinewave RMS value in noncoherent sampling mode; frequency domain analysis for electrochemical supercapacitors; analysis of individual PEM fuel cell operating parameters for design of optimal measurement and control instrumentation; a digital signal processing technique for pulsed electromagnetic inspection of steel tubes; electrochemical supercapacitor time domain analysis by means of multi-channel measurement system; the importance of the short-circuit impedance measurement to the operation of the transformer units; a multi-rate filter for broadband radiotelescopes; generation of robot motion based on measurement of human movement; hysteresis distortions for two-tone signals; and TDR moisture measurements in sand-like materials: a comparison between different calibration procedures.
