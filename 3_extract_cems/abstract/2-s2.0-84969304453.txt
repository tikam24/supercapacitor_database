The most key materials in electrochemical energy storage devices are electrode materials mainly including inorganic cathode and anode materials. However, inorganic electroactive materials often suffer from low conductivity, low capacity, low cycling life. In order to solve these problems, much research work focused on the design of electrode materials and the construction of novel electrode structures in the field of electrochemical energy storage. In this review, we reported the latest development of the design principles of the high-performance electrodes for lithium ion batteries and supercapacitors. We mainly discussed three kinds of examples, blended electrode, integrated electrode and in-situ formed electrode, to display the principles of electrode materials design and electrode construction. The new-developed integrated electrode and in-situ formed electrode maybe the promising candidates for next-generation high-performance energy storage devices. In addition, we conclude this review with personal perspectives on the directions toward which future research in this field might take.
