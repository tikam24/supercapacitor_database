As typical electrode materials for supercapacitors, low specific capacitance and insufficient cycling stability of transition metal oxides (TMOs) are still the problems that need to be solved. Design of core-shell structure is considered as an effective method for preparation of high-performance electrode materials. In this work, NiO flakes@CoMoO4 nanosheets/Ni foam (NiO flakes@CoMoO4 NSs/NF) core-shell architecture was constructed by a two-step hydrothermal method. Interestingly, the CoMoO4 NSs are vertically grown on the surface of NiO flakes, forming a two-dimensional (2D) branched core-shell structure. The porous core-shell architecture has relatively high surface area, effective ions channels, and abundant redox sites, resulting in excellent electrochemical performance. As a positive electrode for supercapacitors, NiO flakes@CoMoO4 NSs/NF core-shell architecture exhibits excellent capacitive performance in terms of high specific capacitance (1097 F/g at 1 A/g) and outstanding cycling stability (97.5% after 2000 circles). The assembled asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) of NiO flakes@CoMoO4 NSs/NF//active carbon (AC)/NF possesses a maximum energy density of 25.8 Wh/kg at power density of 894.7 W/kg. The results demonstrate that NiO flakes@CoMoO4 NSs/NF electrode displays potential applications in supercapacitors and the design of 2D branched core-shell architecture paves an ideal way to obtain high-performance TMOs electrodes.
