The development of sustainable renewable energy systems that provides both energy conversion and storage is highly desirable to compensate the energy needs in daily life. But the key challenge is to fabricate a self powered energy conversion and storage device that possess holds both high conversion efficiency and high storage capability. Herein, we fabricate a solid state hybrid supercapacitor with the aid of bismuthene-graphitic carbon nitride nanocomposite and activated carbon electrodes (Bi-g-C3N4//AC HSC) as an energy storage device and integrated with a dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC) as energy conversion device. The fabricated Bi-g-C3N4//AC HSC delivers a high energy density of 31.597 μWh/cm2 and the high power density of 3.25 mW/cm2. Moreover, the integrated solar powered supercapacitor (SPSC) delivers a competitive total energy conversion and storage efficiency (ηtotal) of about 5.418 % and an unprecedented energy storage efficiency (ηstorage) of 68.35 %.
