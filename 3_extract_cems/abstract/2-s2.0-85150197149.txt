Through a simple sol-gel process, chromium doped vanadium pentoxide (V2-xCrxO5-δ, where x = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15 and 0.20) nanomaterials were synthesized. The XRD data confirmed the occurrence of orthorhombic crystalline structure. FTIR spectra exhibited the presence of V = O and V-O-V along with carbon di oxide and moisture in the samples.The particle diameter was found to be 146-227nm. The SEM results exhibited a sheet like structure. From the electrochemical studies, it was found that V1.95Cr0.05O5-δ electrode has exhibited a specific capacitance of 232.15 Fg−1 at the scan rate of 10 mVS−1. It can be an electrode for supercpacitors.
