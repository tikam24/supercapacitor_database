In order to increase the surface area of MEMS supercapacitor electrode structure, and improve MEMS supercapacitor charge storage capacity. In this paper, high aspect ratio three-dimension electrode microstructures prepared by SU-8 photoresist production has been researched. After substrate cleaning, spin coating, soft bake, exposure, and post exposure, development and solidify membrane process, a microstructure of an aspect ratio of 6 was fabricated. Affection factors of the microstructure production process of basal cleanliness, increasing and decreasing the temperature, exposure time, development time for structure fabrication were analyzed and discussed. Experimental results show that high aspect ratio three-dimension electrode microstructure prepared by SU-8 photoresist can effectively increase the surface area of electrode structure on the same base area and improve storage density of the capacitor in unit base area.
