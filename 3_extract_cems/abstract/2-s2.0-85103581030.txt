The concept of this paper was to explore the comparative advantage of polymer composite in the formation of a critical part of electrodes, separators, and electrolytes. These parts largely determine the overall performance of new evolving supercapacitors (SC) as against many other existing storage devices. Polymer materials are reputed for their low weight and life-cycle flexibility which makes supercapacitors unique in their functions. In this paper, application and classification of SCs were undertaken to take into consideration the peculiarities of polymer composite suitable for each class of SCs identified in this work. Part of the rationale of this review paper was to bridge the existing gap identified in many storage devices using salient properties inherent in light-weight materials. This paper also discussed the potential threats to SCs, which require further research works. It is expected that this paper would assist other researchers in evolving SCs devoid of low cell voltages, lower energy density, and reduction of production cost.
