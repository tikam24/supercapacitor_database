Energy and environment are two important issues in today's social development. With the depletion of fossil energy and the increasingly se-rious environmental pollution, it has become a consensus to search for clean alternative energy. New energy storage and conversion devices, such as secondary lithium/sodium batteries and supercapacitors, have become a research hotspot. Appropriate electrode materials are the key to improve electrochemical performance and realize industrialization. Pyrite iron disulfide(FeS2) is a kind of transition metal sulfide with a high theoretical specific capacity, which exists in the form of pyrite in nature, with abundant reserves, wide distribution, environmental protection and non-toxic. FeS2 has been widely applied in commercial high-energy Li-FeS2 primary batteries and put into the market in large quantities at present. Moreover, FeS2 shows great potential in secondary lithium/sodium batteries and supercapacitors, becoming the focus and hotspot of new energy industry research. The energy storage research of FeS2 mainly includes two aspects: FeS2 prepared by chemical synthesis methods and processing of natural FeS2. However, the low conductivity of FeS2 and poor stability during cycling are the urgent problems to be solved in the application of FeS2 materials in energy storage. Nano design of FeS2 is the main way to improve its electrochemical performance. In this paper, the crystal structure of FeS2 is introduced, and the preparation methods of nanosized pyrite FeS2 are briefly described, including the chemical synthesis of nanosized FeS2 and the processing of natural pyrite. Besides, the energy storage mechanism and research progress of nanoscale FeS2 in lithium/sodium batteries and supercapacitors are briefly reviewed.
