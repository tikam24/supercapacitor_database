The electrochemical properties of the nitrogen-enriched carbons obtained by plant raw treatment as electrode material for supercapacitors were investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cycling voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling in KOH aqueous electrolyte. The effect of activation agent (NaOH) concentration and carbonization temperature were analyzed. The separation of double layer and redox capacitance components was done. The dominating role of microporosity for capacitive properties was demonstrated. The capacitance of model capacitors based on carbons obtained at different modes was calculated from both from cycling voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge data. The maximal values of specific capacitance of carbon materials carbonized at 600oC and 900oC are about 100 and 120 F/g, respectively.
