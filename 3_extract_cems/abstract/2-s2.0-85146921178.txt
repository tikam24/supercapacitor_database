In this study, using Fe3O4, graphene oxide (GO), Na2WO4, and ionic liquid (IL), GO@ Fe3O4-IL-W as a novel nanocomposite has been synthesized to obtain a high-performance supercapacitor. The morphologies and structures of materials have been characterized by Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), vibrating-sample magnetometer (VSM), scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and energy diffraction X-ray (EDX) analysis. The behavior of electrochemical and supercapacitive nanocomposite has been investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The fabricated electrode material exhibited high specific capacitance (332.45 F/g at 0.2 A/g) and excellent electrochemical performance based on the cyclic stability (capacitance retention of 91.3% after 10,000 cycles). Furthermore, a symmetric supercapacitor device based on GO@ Fe3O4-IL-W was successfully assembled and an energy density of 7.38 Wh/kg at a power density of 40 W/kg has been obtained. Consequently, the GO@ Fe3O4-IL-W nanocomposite electrode material is expected to be a promising material for supercapacitor applications and other energy devices.
