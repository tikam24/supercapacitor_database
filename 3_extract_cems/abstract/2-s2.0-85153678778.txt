Here, we report high surface area nanoporous activated carbon (AC) derived from bhang (Cannabis) stems by H3PO4 activation method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman scattering confirmed the formation of graphitic structure of the resulting AC, which also incorporate oxygen/nitrogen/sulfur-containing functional groups as confirmed by the XPS. The AC was studied as a supercapacitor electrode, and it exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 160 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 with a cyclic stability of 101 % after 3000 cycles. The obtained results suggest that the bhang stems, an abundantly found bio-waste, could be the potential precursor of nanoporous carbon for supercapacitors.
