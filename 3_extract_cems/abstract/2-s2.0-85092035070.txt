A flexible ternary composite film based on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyaniline (PANI) and WS2 was prepared via the electropolymerization of the prefabricated PVA/aniline/WS2 hydrogel. As-prepared PVA/PANI/WS2 composite film was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry, and electrochemical technologies. The PVA/PANI/WS2 film had a specific capacitance of 2437 mF cm-2 at 2 mV s-1 in H2SO4 solution (1.0 M). After 5000 cycles, the capacitance retention reached 70% of initial specific capacitance. The high electrochemical behavior of composite film was mainly attributed to the ionic conductivity of PVA and the integration of pseudocapacitance of PANI and WS2. This flexible PVA/PANI/WS2 film provided a potential application in flexible supercapacitor.
