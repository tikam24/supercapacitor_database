The Supercapacitor electrodes made from activated carbon from biomass waste have attracted researchers' interest as an energy storage medium. Activated carbon was synthesized from pepper peel waste with 1 M ZnCl2 activator and an activation temperature of 700Â°C Meanwhile, the supercapacitor electrodes were prepared using activated carbon which had been synthesized by adding acetylene black (AB) and polyvinyl de fluoride (PVDF) materials to make a homogeneous mixture. Then the sample is printed and dried using an oven. The electrode samples were then tested using SEM-EDX and CV to characterization of their morphology and energy storage capability. The CV results show that the sample has a specific capacitance value of 17.4 F/g.
