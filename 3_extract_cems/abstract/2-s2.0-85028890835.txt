In this study, the discharge voltage behavior of electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) during high-g impact is studied both theoretically and experimentally. A micro-scale dynamic mechanism is proposed to describe the physical basis of the increase in the discharge voltage during a high-g impact. Based on this dynamic mechanism, a multi-field model is established, and the simulation and experimental studies of the discharge voltage increase phenomenon are conducted. From the simulation and experimental data, the relationship between the increased voltage and the high-g acceleration is revealed. An acceleration detection range of up to 10,000g is verified. The design of the device is optimized by studying the influences of the parameters, such as the electrode thickness and discharge current, on the outputs. This work opens up new avenues for the development of autonomous sensor systems based on energy storage devices and is significant for many practical applications such as in collision testing and automobile safety.
