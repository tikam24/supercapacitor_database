Aluminum (Al) current collector is one of the most important components of supercapacitors, and its performance has vital effects on the electrochemical performance and cyclic stability of supercapacitors. In the present work, a scalable and low-cost, yet highly efficient, picosecond laser processing method of Al current collectors was developed to improve the overall performance of supercapacitors. The laser treatment resulted in hierarchical micro-nanostructures on the surface of the commercial Al foil and reduced the surface oxygen content of the foil. The electrochemical performance of the Al foil with the micro-nanosurface structures was examined in the symmetrical activated carbon-based coin supercapacitors with an organic electrolyte. The results suggest that the laser-treated Al foil (laser-Al) increased the capacitance density of supercapacitors up to 110.1 F g-1 and promoted the rate capability due to its low contact resistance with the carbonaceous electrode and high electrical conductivity derived from its larger specific surface areas and deoxidized surface. In addition, the capacitor with the laser-Al current collector exhibited high cyclic stability with 91.5% capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles, 21.3% higher than that with pristine-Al current collector due to its stronger bonding with the carbonaceous electrode that prevented any delamination during aging. Our work has provided a new strategy for improving the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors.
