Within this study, which is a pioneer in what it is undertaking, the synergetic effect of copper iodide/graphitic carbon nitride (CuI/g-C3N4) hybrid nanocomposites as electrode materials which are highly conductive and transfer ions/electrons are being investigated as high-performance supercapacitors (SCs). CuI/g-C3N4 nanostructure is synthesized applying two various facile and simple methods combined namely sonochemistry and coprecipitation. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) spectral techniques are applied for morphology investigation, phase evaluation and purification analysis of synthesized nanostructure. CuI/g-C3N4 hybrid nanocomposite electrode is investigated on two different substrates, Ni-foam@CuI/g-C3N4 (NF@CuI/g-C3N4) and graphitic plate@CuI/g-C3N4 (GP@ CuI/ g-C3N4). Redox reaction, diffusion electron/ion, specific capacity, power and energy density, cycling stability of nanocomposites are evaluated through cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD). The attained NF@CuI/g-C3N4 and GP@ CuI/ g-C3N4 hybrid nanocomposites reveals perfect electrochemical proficiency with a great specific capacitance of 623 and 318 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g. Besides, these nominated electrodes depict a considerably well energy density of 17.5 and 34.2 Wh Kg−1, power density of 224 and 440 W kg−1 and ideal cyclic stability by maintain 85 % of their primary capacitance after 3000 and 1500 cycles respectively. This work intends to introduce an unprecedented strategy, applying a novel nanocomposite on two different substrates, and yet revealing an excellent electrochemical property as a result.
