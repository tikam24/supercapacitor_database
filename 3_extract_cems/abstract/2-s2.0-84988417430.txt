We designed and fabricated hierarchical Co3O4@MnO2 nanoarrays directly grown on nickel foam by hydrothermal and calcination methods. After the investigation of growth mechanism, we found that the deposition of MnO2 was based on the self-decomposition of KMnO4 and the reducibility of Co3O4 during the hydrothermal process. Thanks to the hierarchical structure, the obtained electrode exhibited excellent capacitive performance in supercapacitor. It delivered 21.72 F cm−2 at a current density of 5 mA cm−2 and retained ~94 % capacitance of initial value after 5000 cycles.
