Two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have drawn much attention due to their unique physical and chemical properties. Using TMDs as templates for the generation of 2D sandwich-like materials with remarkable properties still remains a great challenge due to their poor solvent processability. Herein, MoS2-coupled sandwich-like conjugated microporous polymers (M-CMPs) with high specific surface area were successfully developed by using functionalized MoS2nanosheets as template. As-prepared M-CMPs were further used as precursors for preparation of MoS2-embedded nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanosheets, which were revealed as novel electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction with mainly four-electron transfer mechanism and ultralow half-wave potential in comparison with commercial Pt/C catalyst. Our strategy to core-shelled sandwich-like hybrids paves a way for a new class of 2D hybrids for energy conversion and storage. Hierarchically porous MoS2/N-doped carbon hybrids were fabricated by pyrolysis of MoS2-templated microporous polymer sandwiches. The hybrids are characterized by high specific surface areas and aspect ratios and show promising oxygen reduction reaction and supercapacitor performances.
