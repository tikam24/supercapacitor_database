Monoclinic wolframite-type Ni1-xMnxWO4 (x = 0 and 0.10) nanoparticles were successfully grown on a nickel foam (NF) skeleton via a facile one-step hydrothermal pathway. Mn2+ ions were incorporated into the NiWO4 lattice, which enhanced the specific surface area and reduced the pore diameter of Ni0.90Mn0.10WO4. In comparison to NiWO4, the electrical conductivity of Ni0.90Mn0.10WO4 was enhanced double due to its narrower bandgap as well as the introduction of an impurity level between the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB). As a supercapacitor (SC) electrode, Ni0.90Mn0.10WO4/NF revealed excellent specific capacity of 485 C g−1 (970 F g−1) at a specific current of 0.5 A g−1 and maintained a specific capacity of 86 C g−1 (171 F g−1) even at a high specific current of 20 A g−1. Moreover, Ni0.90Mn0.10WO4/NF exhibited outstanding cycling stability with a residual capacity of ∼67% of the original capacity after 10,000 cycles at a specific current of 10 A g−1. A solid-state symmetric supercapacitor (SSSC) based on Ni0.90Mn0.10WO4/NF as the cathode and anode delivered a maximum energy density of 41 W h kg−1 at a power density of 1069 W kg−1. The enhanced electrochemical behavior of the Ni0.90Mn0.10WO4/NF electrode was ascribed to its large surface area, fast diffusion kinetics, high electrical conductivity, and good wettability. First-principles simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) were used to provide additional theoretical interpretations of the improved electrochemical behavior.
