Heteroatom doping is an effective way to raise the electrochemical properties of carbon materials. In this paper, a novel electrode material including nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur co-doped pyrolyzed bacterial cellulose (N/P/S-PBC) nanofibers was produced. The morphologies, structure characteristics and electrochemical performances of the materials were investigated by Scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectra, X-ray diffraction patterns, X-ray photoelectronic spectroscopy, N2 sorption analysis and electrochemical measurements. When 3.9 atom% of nitrogen, 1.22 atom% of phosphorus and 0.6 atom% of sulfur co-doped into PBC, the specific capacitance of N/P/S-PBC at 1.0 A/g was 255 F/g and the N/P/S-PBC supercapacitorsâ€™ energy density at 1 A/g was 8.48 Wh/kg with a power density of 489.45 W/kg, which were better than those of the N/P-PBC and N/S-PBC supercapacitors. This material may be a very good candidate as the promising electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors.
