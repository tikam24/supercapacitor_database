Abstract: In recent years, graphene quantum dots with unique physiochemical properties have received considerable research attention in many fields. In this report, as a novel approach toward improving the capacitance value of MoS2 electrode, GQDs-MoS2 nanocomposite thin film was synthesized through one-step hydrothermal process. The microstructure and surface morphology of both MoS2 and GQDs-MoS2 nanocomposite thin films were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, field emission-scanning electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The electrochemical performances of MoS2 and GQDs-MoS2 nanocomposite thin films was thoroughly compared via Autolab potentiostat–galvanostat with the three-electrode system. The results indicated that GQDs-MoS2 nanocomposite thin film demonstrates enhanced specific capacitance of 380 F g−1 under the current density of 0.6 A g−1. Moreover, the MoS2-GQDs thin film exhibited the highest energy density of 38.47 Wh kg−1 at the Current density of 0.6 A g−1. Graphic abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
