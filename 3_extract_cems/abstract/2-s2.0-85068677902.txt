The large-scale spread of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) in the automotive industry is dominated today by continuous variable transmission parallel powertrain as far as medium size car are concerned. As a matter of fact, the tendency in this sector is to design parallel architectures in that they have provided until now a higher overall powertrain efficiency. However, technological improvements in many electric components and their increased efficiency can reshape this vision and give new outlines on HEV structure design. This paper aims to show the potentials of the series architecture, thanks to the latest electrical improvements especially in storage systems and power electronics. In particular, simulation models and fuel consumption data over different road missions are presented for the series architecture proposed in this study. In addition, a comparison between these results and data available in the scientific literature for state-of-the-art HEVs is reported.
