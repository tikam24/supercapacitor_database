Engineering the physical characteristics of a novel Ti3C2 MXene/MoSe2 hybrid by a facile methodology is crucial for synergistic chemical interactions and improved aspects. Highly conductive Ti3C2 MXene, functioned as an outstanding support together with the active sites of MoSe2 in the hybrid structure, increases the active area and porosity to increase the insertion/abstraction of electrolyte ions. The synergistic MXene/MoSe2 hybrid-based symmetric supercapacitor delivered an enhanced capacitance of 350 F g−1 with worthy solidity (93% of retained capacitance after 5000 cycles) and a good specific energy of 48 Wh kg−1 at a specific power of 500 W kg−1. MXene/MoSe2 unveiled fabulous electrocatalytic behavior of hydrogen evolution with overpotentials of 136 and 149 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and Tafel slopes of 88 and 83 mV dec−1 in acidic and base solutions, respectively. This work surfaces the way of designing distinct two-dimensional (2D)/2D heterostructures for efficient energy storage/conversion applications.
