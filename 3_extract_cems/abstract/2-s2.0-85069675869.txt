TiO2-C@polyaniline (PANI) are synthesized on the surface of carbon cloth (CC) as flexible electrode, in which TiO2-C nanowire arrays (NWAs) work as supporting frame to enhance the mechanical stability of composites, while PANI is coated on TiO2-C NWAs to make a core-shell structure and form a continuous conductive 3D network between isolated TiO2-C nanowires. By virtue of such unique structure design, the as-prepared TiO2-C@PANI composites achieve desirable cycling performance while possess high specific capacitance. Concretely, this TiO2-C@PANI composite shows remarkable specific capacitance of 1818 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, good rate capability with 75.5% capacitance retention at 10 A g−1, and excellent cycling performance with 80% capacity retention over 5000 cycles at a charge-discharge current of 10 A g−1. Besides, the prefabricated TiO2-C@PANI//AC asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor also exhibits a high energy density of 32.4 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 850.0 W kg−1. In sum, such TiO2-C@PANI CC electrode material has a bright future in the application of supercapacitors and provides a new strategy for other conductive polymer-based electrochemical devices.
