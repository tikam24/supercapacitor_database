A facile method for the synthesis of porous carbon from molasses with K2CO3 as the activator (KPCs) was present. Effects of different conditions on the yield of KPCs were analyzed. The samples were characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption-desorption analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The results show that the KPCs have graphitized layer stack structure, and have surface functional groups of hydroxyl, carboxyl, ester and ether group. Also, the KPCs have porous structure and their specific surface area is up to 1219 m2/g. The optimized activation temperature was 800â„ƒ. The porous carbon based molasses will be an ideal electric double layer capacitors material in the field of energy storage.
