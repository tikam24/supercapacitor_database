In the present work, NiCo2O4 nanowires grown directly on carbon fibers self-organize into a nanoflower morphology. The materials are prepared by hydrothermal treatment and subsequent low-temperature annealing. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results reveal a hierarchical three-dimensional mesoporous structure, which facilitates ion transport and electronic conduction for fast redox reactions. As a result, the electrode achieves a respectable specific capacitance of 1626 F· g- 1 at 1 A· g- 1 and high rate capability (65% retention at 10 A· g- 1), so it shows promise for application in supercapacitors. © Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.
