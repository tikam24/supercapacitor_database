The thriving energy demand of the gradually increasing population and modernized life style requires development in energy storage devices for usage in commercial electronic devices. The synthesized La-Fe MOFs was found electrochemically active and its electrochemical performances as battery-type electrode. In this work, an enzyme-free electrochemical sensor based on La-Fe MOFs was developed for the detection of chlorambucil (CBL) and paracetamol (PCT). Further modification of La-Fe MOFs can improve the high surface area and catalytic capability of the composites. Under the optimal detection conditions, the prepared sensor has good linearity in the detection of CBL and PCT within range 0.05-265 μM. The limit of detection (LOD) of CBL and PCT is 18.4 nM and 15.6 nM, respectively. The real sample analysis, stability and selectivity of the sensors were analyzed. The electrochemically active La-Fe MOFs exhibited with higher charge storage capacity. The La-Fe MOFs exhibited specific capacity as high as 171 C g−1 at a constant applied current density of 1.5 A g−1 in 1 M KOH. The addition of Fe to the La-MOFs has helped to overcome the issues and achieve a better electrochemical performance. It can be a promising candidate for electrochemical energy storage device to meet the global energy demand.
