MoS2, the second most widely studied two-dimensional nanomaterial, has fascinating physical and chemical properties and thus has a wide variety of applications. MoS2 has been getting much attention in the area of energy storage applications in the past few years, and there has been a drastic improvement in the number of scientific reports published in this area. In this regard, here we summarize the electrochemical charge storage properties of MoS2 and its various nanocomposites, including those that are carbon based, conducting polymer based composites, and flexible and wearable MoS2 supercapacitors made in last four years (from 2015 to 2019) along with their structural design. Finally, the major opportunities and challenges of MoS2 based electrode materials are presented in the concluding section.
