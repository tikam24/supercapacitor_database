Carbon nanodots (CNDs) and graphene/carbon quantum dots (GQDs/CQDs) have emerged as useful components for the fabrication of electrodes in electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs). In this review, we highlight the emerging trend of employing CNDs and their relatives as active components in EDLCs. We discuss recent progress in converting CNDs with intrinsically low electrical conductivity into conductive electrode materials. Specifically, we highlight advances in improving specific surface area (SSA) and rate capability, as well as employing abundant active sites on CNDs to increase electrode specific capacitance based on conductive carbon, metal compounds, and/or conductive polymers.
