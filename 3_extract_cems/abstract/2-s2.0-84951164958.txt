Hierarchical nanoporous carbon (HNC) anode material with average pore size of 4.7nm and Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) surface area of 248.66 m2/g was prepared for super lithium ion capacitor by using phenolic resin as raw materials and Ni(OH)2 / NaNO3 / NaOH composites as templates,. The electrochemical performance of the carbon electrode was tested in both electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC) and lithium ion battery (LIB). Voltage-current peoples for the carbon electrode in EDLC exhibit non-ideal rectangular response to different scan rates from 10 mV/s to 100 mV/s, confirming the double-layer behavior and high reversibility of the carbon studied. When acting as LIB anode, it exhibits a good cyclability after the initial irreversibility, associated with a stable capacity of of 234 mAh/g during the first 50 cycles at a reasonable current density (0.2C).
