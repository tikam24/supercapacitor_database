In this work, we present a chemical strategy for the synthesis of stable nanostructured polyaniline electrodes for supercapacitor applications. Based on field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis, average nanograined polyaniline electrode diameter was found to be 20-30 nm. The specific capacitance reaches a maximum value of 503 F g-1 with a specific energy and a specific power of 96.23 Wh kg-1 and 8.88 kW kg-1, respectively. Additionally, a working toy fan is demonstrated. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
