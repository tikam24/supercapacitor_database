Combining MnO 2 with conductive carbon materials is an efficient approach to improve the electrical conductivity of MnO 2 -based electrodes, which could greatly improve the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors. Here, a ternary composite consisting of sulfonated graphene, carbon nanotubes, and manganese dioxide (SG/CNTs/MnO 2 ) has been successfully fabricated by a facile yet efficient method. The electrochemical properties are evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. The results show a prominent improvement of electrochemical performance of MnO 2 -based electrodes. For instance, the specific capacitance of SG/CNTs/MnO 2 composite is 336.4 F g −1 at the current density of 0.5 A g −1 , which is much higher than pure MnO 2 (77.1 F g −1 ) and binary SG/MnO 2 (213.0 F g −1 ). Moreover, SG/CNTs/MnO 2 composite shows good cycling stability with 91.3% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g −1 .
