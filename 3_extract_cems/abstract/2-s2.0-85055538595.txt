Zinc cobalt oxide (ZnCo 2 O 4 ) microspheres are prepared at three different hydrothermal process temperatures (100 °C, 130 °C, and 160 °C) assisted with urea. XRD studies reveal the spinel face-centered cubic (Fd3m) structure of ZnCo 2 O 4 microspheres. The optical and vibrational properties of the product are characterized by photoluminescence and FTIR studies. The strong near-band edge emission peak observed at 392 nm corresponds to the direct recombination of the exciton-exciton collision process for all three synthesized products; SEM analysis reveals the complete growth stage of spherical ZnCo 2 O 4 microspheres at three different temperatures. The electrochemical properties of synthesized ZnCo 2 O 4 microspheres are analyzed by cyclic voltammetry, electroimpedance spectroscopy, and galvanostatic charging and discharging studies. ZnCo 2 O 4 microspheres (SH3–160 °C) exhibit the superior specific capacitance of 500 F/g at 0.75 A/g current density and retain their specific capacitance of 80% at current density 2 A/g. ZnCo 2 O 4 microspheres (SH3–160 °C) may be considered as a good candidate as electrode in supercapacitor applications.
