Nanoflowers-like CuO/Cu(OH)2 hybrid thin films have been synthesized by simple and inexpensive successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. Prepared CuO/Cu(OH)2 samples have been used for the structural and morphological characterization with different characterization techniques. The electrochemical supercapacitive properties of CuO/Cu(OH)2 nanoflowers were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Results showed that, CuO/Cu(OH)2 nanoflower exhibits the maximum specific capacitance of 459 F g-1 at 5 mV s-1 in 2 M KOH electrolyte. Further, EIS analysis shows lower ESR value, high power performance, excellent rate as well as frequency response of CuO/Cu(OH)2 nanoflowers. Ragone plot ascertains good power and energy densities of CuO/Cu(OH)2 nanoflowers which confirms their suitability for energy storage devices. Thus, present investigation successfully reports the applicability of easy and inexpensive SILAR method for synthesis of CuO/Cu(OH)2 nanostructure to be utilized in supercapacitors.
