Copper (Cu)-dipicolonic acid (DPA) based metal-organic coordination polymers (MOCPs) has been evaluated as an electrode material for supercapacitors. Cu-MOCP exhibits specific capacitance of 217.3 F g −1 at 0.4 mA cm −2 and superior capacitance retention of 95.5% after 2000 cycles at 6.7 mA cm −2 in 1.0 M NaOH electrolyte using galvanostatic study. It may arouse from the micro structure in Cu-MOCP that gives enough void for storage and diffusion of electrolyte, suggesting its promising electrode material for supercapacitors.
