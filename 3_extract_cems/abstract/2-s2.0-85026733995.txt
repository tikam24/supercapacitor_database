By a simple and cost effective chemical precipitation-hydrothermal method, novel hierarchical structured Sm 2 O 3 modified CuO nanoflowers are prepared and investigated as electrode materials for supercapacitors. The physical properties of prepared materials are characterized by XRD, FE-SEM, EDX and FTIR techniques. Furthermore, electrochemical performances of prepared materials are investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectrum in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. The resulting Sm 2 O 3 modified CuO based electrodes exhibit obviously enhanced capacitive properties owing to the unique nanostructures and strong synergistic effects. It is worth noting that the optimized SC-3 based electrode exhibits the best electrochemical performances in all prepared electrodes, including higher specific capacitance (383.4 F g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 ) and good rate capability (393.2 F g −1 and 246.3 F g −1 at 0.3 A g −1 and 3.0 A g −1 , respectively), as well as excellent cycling stability (84.6% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles at 1.0 A g −1 ). The present results show that Sm 2 O 3 is used as a promising modifier to change the morphology and improve electrochemical performances of CuO materials.
