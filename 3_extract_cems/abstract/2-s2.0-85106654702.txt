Design of hollow nanostructure and controllable phase of mixed metal oxides for improving performance in supercapacitor applications is highly desirable. Here we demonstrate the rational design and synthesis of Mn3−xFexO4 hollow nanostructures for supercapacitor applications. Owing to high porosity and the specific surface area that provides more active sites for electrochemical reactions, the electrochemical performance of Mn3−xFexO4 hollow nanostructure substantially enhanced comparing with pristine Mn3O4. Particularly, in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, Mn0.16Fe2.84O4 with a typical diameter of 20 nm exhibits excellent specific capacitance of 2675, 2320, 1662, 987 F g−1 at current densities of 1, 2, 5, 10 A g−1, respectively, which is significantly superior to those of other transition metal oxides. Besides, an asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled by using Mn0.16Fe2.84O4 and activated carbon as a positive and a negative electrode, respectively. Electrochemical results indicate a high energy density of 42 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 0.75 kW kg−1, which makes this hollow nanostructure a highly promising electrode for achieving high-performance next-generation supercapacitors.
