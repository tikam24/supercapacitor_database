Hierarchical hollow tubular porous carbons have been widely used in applications of supercapacitors, batteries, CO2 capture and catalysis due to their hollow tubular morphology, large aspect ratio, abundant pore structure and superior conductivity. Herein, hierarchical hollow tubular fibrous brucite-templated carbons (AHTFBCs) were prepared using natural mineral fiber brucite as the template and KOH as the chemical activator. The effects of different KOH additions on the pore structure and capacitive performance of AHTFBCs were systematically studied. The specific surface area and micropore content of AHTFBCs after KOH activation were higher than those of HTFBC. The specific surface area of the HTFBC is 400 m2 g−1, while the activated AHTFBC5 has a specific surface area of up to 625 m2 g−1. In particular, compared with HTFBC (6.1%), a series of AHTFBCs (22.1% for AHTFBC2, 23.9% for AHTFBC3, 26.8% for AHTFBC4 and 22.9% for AHTFBC5) with significantly increased micropore content were prepared by controlling the amount of KOH added. The AHTFBC4 electrode displays a high capacitance of 197 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and the capacitance retention of 100% after 10 000 cycles at 5 A g−1 in the three-electrode system. And an AHTFBC4//AHTFBC4 symmetric supercapacitor exhibits the capacitance of 109 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in 6 M KOH and an energy density of 5.8 W h kg−1 at 199.0 W kg−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. In addition, the capacity retention of AHTFBC4 in the symmetric supercapacitor was maintained at 92% after 5000 cycles in both 6 M KOH and 1 M Na2SO4 electrolytes.
