The existing research explores the effect of annealing temperature on manganese oxide incorporated cobalt oxide thin films synthesized on stainless steel (SS) using potentiodynamic electrodeposition via aqueous route. Film thickness of synthesized material decreases with increase in annealing temperature. Contact angle measurements show decrease in the hydrophilicity with increase in annealing temperature. XRD of the synthesized samples reveals face centered cubic Co3O4 and orthorhombic MnO2 with polycrystalline nature. FESEM and TEM images display nano-spikes with nano-granular morphology. The presence of elemental composition was observed from EDX analysis. The AFM analysis also confirms the nano-granular morphology of fabricated thin film electrodes. The optimized electrodes were investigated for electrochemical characteristics. All CV curves show mixed capacitive behavior. Optimized sample shows maximum specific capacitance (SC) of 605.82 F/g at 2 mV/s using 1 M KOH electrolyte solution. The maximum designed values of energy density, power density and columbic efficiency were 25.20 Wh/kg and 31.10 kW/kg and 92.11% respectively. The observed internal resistance from Nyquist plot (Ri) was 0.64 Î©. The MnO2 incorporated Co3O4 thin films on SS substrates can be a potential candidate for cost-effective supercapacitor applications.
