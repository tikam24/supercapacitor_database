MnO2 nanosheets decorated with NiCo-LDH nanoplates were developed for high-performance supercapacitors. The construction strategy involved a facile two-step method including hydrothermal step and co-precipitation step. The samples were characterized by TEM, XRD, XPS, BET, and FT-IR. The prepared MnO2/NiCo-LDH composites with a large specific surface area and a certain active sites, realized the excellent energy storage capability in supercapacitors, due to the proper integration and optimization of the advantages of both MnO2 and LDH. Consequently, MnO2/NiCo-LDH shows a specific capacitance 555.6 F/g at current density of 1 A/g in 6 M KOH electrolyte, which is much higher than that of pure MnO2. Besides, MnO2/NiCo-LDH still can keep good cycling stability after 1000 cycles. This study indicates that MnO2/NiCo-LDH composite may have great potential as electrode material for supercapacitors.
