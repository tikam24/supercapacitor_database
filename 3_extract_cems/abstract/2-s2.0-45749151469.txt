We present a review of the structural properties of LiFePO4. Depending on the mode of preparation, different impurities can poison this material. These impurities are identified and a quantitative estimate of their concentrations is deduced from the combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Raman scattering (RS) spectroscopy and magnetic measurements. An optimized preparation provides samples with carbon coated particles free of any impurity phase, insuring structural stability and electrochemical performance that justify the use of this material as a cathode element a new generation of lithium secondary batteries. copyright The electrochemical Society.
