In this paper, Se-doped NiTe electrode materials for supercapacitor are synthesized through a one-step hydrothermal method by using Ni foam as Ni source and substrate. The as-obtained Se-doped NiTe electrode exhibits maximum specific capacitance of 998.2 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1, which is better than the value of NiTe electrode 603.6 F g−1. Moreover, the Se-doped NiTe electrode assembled with AC electrode to form an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC), which can extend the potential window to 1.6 V, and possesses of a superior energy density and power density of 42.7 Wh kg−1 and 800.6 W kg−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1, respectively. In addition, the ASC shows an outstanding cycling stability (76.4% retained after 10,000 cycles).
