This paper presents a novel impedance-source bidirectional DC-DC converter. The proposed converter has a wide regulation range of voltage when comparing to conventional bidirectional DC-DC converters. Moreover, it has higher reliability due to elimination of the dead time and use of the shoot through states. The main advantage of this novel topology is the ability to utilize supercapacitors with high voltage gain. This paper describes the operation principles of the proposed converter and analyzes the theoretical and simulated results.
