Electrochemical Double Layer Capacitors (EDLC), also known as supercapacitors, have been fabricated using Single Walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWCNTs) as active material for electrode assembling. In particular a new way of fabrication of ultra-thin electrodes (<25 μm) directly formed on the separator has been proposed, and a prototype of EDLC has been realized and tested. For such devices the specific capacitance is in the range 40-45 F/g and the internal resistances in the range 6-8 O-cm2, at current density of 2 mAcm -2.
