Nanoplates of Cu2WSe4 (âˆ¼50 nm) were synthesized via a hot-injection method by one-pot selenation of WCl6 and Cu(acac)2. This synthetic route provided another perspective towards the intrinsic electrochemical properties of Cu2MSe4 (M = Mo or W), where their nanoparticles were previously synthesized via a metathesis route. Cations-dependent cathodic events and surface activation anodic events were identified by cyclic voltammetry in acetonitrile.
