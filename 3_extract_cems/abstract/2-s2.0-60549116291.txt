MnO2 multilayer nanosheet clusters were prepared via electrochemical deposition route, which shows simpleness and high efficiency. The growth process of MnO2 multilayer nanosheet clusters was investigated in this paper. The deposited MnO2 films were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, and XPS. In addition, it was also electrochemically characterized by cyclic voltammetry in 1.0 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The MnO2 multilayer nanosheet clusters show a big specific capacitance, and it can be achieved about 521.5 F g-1 at 5 mV s-1. These materials also have a high electrochemical stability.
