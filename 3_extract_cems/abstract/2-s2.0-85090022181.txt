A graphene aerogel-coated molybdenum trioxide/polypyrrole (MoO3/GA@PPy) composite was synthesized via hydrothermal and in site polymerization reactions. The character of PPy, MoO3/GA, and MoO3/GA@PPy were investigated by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results of the morphological and structural analysis clearly revealed the formation of ternary nanocomposites. The electrochemical properties, such as capacitance, specific capacitance retention at different current loads, cycling stability, and impedance, were discussed as well. Improvement of electrochemical performances of the ternary nanocomposites was observed. The MoO3/GA@PPy showed a maximum specific capacitance of 1788 F/g at current density of 1 A/g.
