This work demonstrated an efficient plasma exfoliation of graphite oxides to fabricate graphene at ambient temperature. The microstructure, morphology and composition of the prepared graphene were confirmed by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The plasma exfoliation mechanism was revealed based on the plasma emission spectra. The electrochemical performance of symmetrical electrode supercapacitors made of the plasma exfoliated graphene was tested by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and cycle-life measurement. It was showed that graphite oxide exfoliated by CH4 plasma led to better specific capacitance and stability than that exfoliated by O2 and N2 plasmas. This study provided a new perspective and potentially efficient way to upscaling graphene manufacturing.
