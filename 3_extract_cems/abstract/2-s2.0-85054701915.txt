The molten salt activation containing different oxysalts are proposed to activate the ordered mesoporous carbons loading on graphene layers (OMC/G). The effects of different oxysalts activations on the structures of OMC/G are thoroughly investigated by scan electron microscopy (SEM), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), Raman spectroscopy and nitrogen adsorption-desorption at 77 K. The structures of these carboneous materials are related with the oxidizing nature of these oxysalts. By using weak oxysalt of K2CO3, the original structure of OMC/G is almost kept together with the appearance of a lot of micropores and mesopores. The electrochemical performances of OMC/G after different oxysalts activation are also studied for supercapacitor applications. OMC/G after weak oxysalt of K2CO3 based electrode results in the highest specific capacitance up to 332.5 F g−1 at a current density of 1.0 A g−1, which is higher than those after both KOH activation (276.8 F g−1) and the other three oxysalts activation. Moreover, OMC/G-K2CO3 shows an excellent cycling stability with no capacitance loss over 5000 cycles. The molten salt activation would be potentially applied to activate the porous carbons for supercapacitor applications.
