Supercapacitor electrode based on polypyrrole/graphene nanosheets composite (PPy/GNS) is synthesized via in situ chemical polymerization of pyrrole monomer in graphene-dispersed solution. The morphology and structure of the composites are characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Electrochemical properties were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and constant current charge-discharge in 1 M NaNO3 electrolyte. PPy/GNS composite exhibited the better electrochemical performances than the pure polypyrrole. The composite is a promising candidate for supercapacitors to have higher specific capacitance and better rate capability than those of pure individual components. The composites exhibited specific capacitance of 354 F g-1 at the charge/discharge current density of 0.5 A g-1.
