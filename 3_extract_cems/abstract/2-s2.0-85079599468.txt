At present, recycling of spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is receiving phenomenal attention owing to valuable resources and make the alternative choice to reutilize the materials in the energy storage applications. Herein, the sandwich layered structure of Li0.32Al0.68MnO2(OH)2 is successfully regenerated for supercapacitor application via reutilizing the different manufacturers of spent LIBs cathodes by considering the upcoming different composition of spent LIBs in the near future. The regenerated layered material by hydrothermal treatment displays a high specific capacitance of 424 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 134 F g−1 at a high current density of 10 A g−1 in a half-cell configuration. Further, in order to construct high performance and cost-effective asymmetric supercapacitor, the regenerated electrode is paired with bio-waste orange peel derived nanoporous carbon using 3.5 M KOH. The constructed Li0.32Al0.68MnO2(OH)2/orange peel derived nanoporous carbon ASC exhibits an excellent specific capacitance of 377 F g−1, and delivers a high energy and power density of 42.5 Wh kg−1 and 16.5 kW kg−1 in the working cell voltage of 1.8 V, respectively. Notably, the constructed ASC holds a long cycle life by retaining 88% capacitance retention after 1,00,000 cycles at 20 A g−1. These outcomes are much higher than those of regenerated material based symmetric supercapacitor. This approach is highly beneficial to recycle the massive quantity of the forthcoming different composition of spent mixed cathodes in the waste stream along with recycled bio-waste to fabricate high-performance energy storage device in the low cost besides to keep the environment in a cleaner and greener manner.
