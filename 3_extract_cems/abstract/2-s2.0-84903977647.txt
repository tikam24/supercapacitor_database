Polyaniline (PANI) and Poly 3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT)-based MnO2 conducting nanocomposites were synthesized and their electrochemical properties were studied in order to find out their suitability as electrode materials for supercapacitor., Structural morphology and characterization of the nanocomposite with nanorods of δ- MnO2 (having∼20 nm diameter) materials were studied using XRD, XPS and TEM. Electrochemical measurements of these electrode materials have been carried out using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge at different constant current densities (0.5-10mA/cm2). Contribution of pseudocapacitance (CFS) in the composite materials has also been investigated through the measurement of AC impedance in the frequency range 10 kHz-10 mHz with potential amplitude of 5 mV.
