In the present work, TiC nanowires with a typical size of 50 nm to 200 nm in width and several micrometers in length were synthesized via a simple biotemplating method using natural nanoporous cotton fibers as both carbon source and template. Afterwards, the uniform growth of NiO nanosheets on the surface of TiC nanowires was implemented by chemical bath deposition method. The as-constructed TiC@NiO core-shell nanostructure showed good electrochemical energy storage performance with an electrode specific capacitance of 560 F/g at 1 A/g, much higher than that of pure NiO (193.5 F/g) prepared via the similar process, as well as good cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 83.6% when the electrode experienced 5000 charge-discharge cycles at 20 A/g.
