Synthetic approaches based on deep eutectic solvents allow the preparation of phophate-functionalized carbon monoliths with a hierarchical structure. Both functionalization and hierarchy combining macropores and high surface areas while preserving high monolith densities are critical for the ahievement of remarkable energy densities in supercapacitor cells.
