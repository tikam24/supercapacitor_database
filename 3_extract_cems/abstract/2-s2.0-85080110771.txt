One-dimensional array structure with bi-metal components can simultaneously expose large surface area on surface and utilize the synergistic effects for improving the specific capacitance performance. Herein, based on Cu(OH)2 nanorod precursors, we have prepared one dimensional arrays composed of Cu and Ni hybrids at room temperature, which exhibit large specific surface area and are convenient for ions diffusion. The introduction of Ni not only extremely improves the capacitance, but also makes the electrode more stable and less deformed during the electrochemical process. In addition, the in-suit formed nanorod array structure has no organic binder and conductive agent, facilitating its fast electron transfer and mass diffuse in the three-dimensional framework. The charge storage performance of the as-prepared CuNi-hybrid/Cu foam (CuF) electrode can reach 2420 mC cm−2 at a current density of 2 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH electrolyte. An hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) is assembled, which delivers a potential window of 1.5 V. The storage performance of this HSC can reach 2052 mC cm−2 at a current density of 5 mA cm−2. Furthermore, this study can provide a reference to the combination of other transition metals to form multi-metal based battery-type electrodes with one-dimensional nanorod array structure.
