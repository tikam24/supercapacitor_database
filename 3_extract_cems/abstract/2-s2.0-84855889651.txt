This paper aims to investigate the relationship between surface morphology of poly ortho aminophenol (POAP) films and synthesis conditions. POAP with different particle sizes was deposited on a glassy carbon (GC) electrode using direct current (DC) and pulse techniques. POAP nanoparticles with good electrochemical stability and high doping degree were obtained by applying ultra short on time current pulse for polymerization. The surface morphology of POAP films was revealed by using the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatic charge-discharge studies showed that the polymer obtained by pulses have higher electrochemical performance in acidic solution. Moreover, nanoparticles of POAP have a highly porous structure, high fractal dimension and large specific surface area, which can be employed as an excellent electrode material in supercapacitors. It was also found that the morphology of POAP varies with the synthesis conditions of the pulse. Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
