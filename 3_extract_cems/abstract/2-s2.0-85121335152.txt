Abstract—The synthesis of NiMoO4 hierarchical nanostructures using the hydrothermal method has been studied. The decomposition of NiMoO4·xH2O crystalline hydrate formed during the synthesis has been studied using synchronous thermal analysis upon heating in a stream of air and argon. According to X-ray diffraction as well as scanning and transmission electron microscopies, the proposed conditions allow one to synthesize single-phase nanosized (average CSR size of about 25 ± 2 nm) nickel(II) molybdate, which has a spinel-type monoclinic structure (space group C2/m) without impurity inclusions.
