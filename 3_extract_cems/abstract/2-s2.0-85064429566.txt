Hierarchical porous activated carbon particles covered with graphene were prepared by spray-drying a GO/maltodextrin aqueous suspension followed by carbonization and activation. The as-prepared core-shell particles had a high specific surface area (up to 2457 m2 g−1) and exhibited an outstanding specific capacitance (up to 405 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1, 299 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 199 F g−1 at 50 A g−1) along with excellent cycling stability, high energy density and power density in a KOH electrolyte. Moreover, the spontaneous formation of the core-shell structure during the spray-drying process was verified by DFT calculations with the support of XPS chemical analysis and TEM characterization. This designable and controllable strategy of spray-drying could be introduced to design and develop new composite materials with a core-shell structure for potential applications in energy storage, catalysis and adsorption.
