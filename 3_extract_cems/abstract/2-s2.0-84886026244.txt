Electrochemical capacitors (ECs), sometimes referred to as 'double-layer' capacitors, also appear under trademarked names such as 'Supercapacitor' or 'Ultracapacitor.' The phrase 'double layer' refers to their storing electrical charge in a double layer at a surface-electrolyte interface of high-surface-area carbon. Because of the high surface area and the small dimensions of the double layer, these devices can have very high specific and volumetric capacitances. This enables them to combine a previously unattainable capacitance density with an essentially unlimited charge/discharge cycle life. The operational voltage per cell is limited only by the breakdown potential of the electrolyte and is usually <1 or <3 V per cell for aqueous and organic electrolytes, respectively. Electrochemical capacitors have evolved through several design generations since Nippon Electric Corporation (NEC), under license from Standard Oil of Ohio, introduced their first Supercapacitorâ„¢ in 1978. Initially, ECs were used as backup power for volatile clock chips and complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor computer memories. Many other applications have emerged during the past 25 years, including portable wireless communication, power quality for distributed power generation systems, and high-efficiency energy storage and delivery for electric and hybrid gas-electric vehicles.
