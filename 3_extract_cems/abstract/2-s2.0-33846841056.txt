We developed a hybrid supercapacitor with N-butyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (PYR14TFSI) ionic liquid electrolyte, activated carbon (AC) as the negative electrode and poly(3-methylthiophene) (pMeT) as the positive which provides at 60°C maximum cell voltages higher than 3.4 V as well as long cycling stability over 15,000 cycles. In the present paper we present and discuss the results of our study as well as the strategies for materials and cell design optimization in view of the developmert of 2 kF-3.9 V AC/PYR14TFSI/pMeT supercapacitors operating at 60°C. copyright The Electrochemical Society.
