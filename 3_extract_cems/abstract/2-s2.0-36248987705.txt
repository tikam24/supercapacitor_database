High density activated carbons electrode materials, for supercapacitor were prepared by chemical KOH activation of cokes as the starting material under Ar atmosphere. By controlling the synthesis conditions and reducing KOH quantity in the activation step, the specific surface area of the product was decreased. BET surface area was measured to be 500 - 1260 m2/g, and the electrode density was in the range of 0.68 ~0.83 g/cm3. Volumetric specific capacitance (unit cell test) was as high as 20 F/cc, which corresponds to gravimetric specific capacitance of about 95 F/cc on the basis of half cell test. It should be noted that the specific capacitance of the activated carbons prepared in this study is superior to that of commercial activated carbons.
