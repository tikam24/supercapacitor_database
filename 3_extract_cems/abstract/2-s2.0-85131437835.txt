Vanadium pentoxide and conducting polymers have promising applications in the field of electrical energy storage devices and combine flexible substance to form binder-free ternary electrodes, which would pave a new way for designing supercapacitors. Herein, graphite felt (GF)@V2O5 nanosheets is synthesized by hydrothermal and calcinating treatment, on the surface of which polyindole (PIn) nanospheres are anchored orderly using electrochemical deposition to obtain GF@V2O5@PIn ternary electrode material. The pseudocapacitive properties of both V2O5 nanosheets and PIn nanospheres are fully demonstrated through the synergistic effect of them, enabling ternary composite GVP-3 to exhibit superior electrochemical properties than two binary materials. The area capacitance of GVP-3 reaches 2254 mF/cm2, which is significantly higher than that of GF@V2O5 with 1431 mF/cm2 and GF@PIn with 647 mF/cm2. The flexible quasi-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (FASC) can be operated at the potential window of 1.8 V with a significant energy density of 1.423 mWh/cm3 (64.404Wh/kg) The excellent electrical capacitance and prominent energy density of our device endow it with an overall improvement of electrical performance from 25% to 30%, which is compared to present researches. Two devices connected in series are able to make a 3.5 V LED bump light up normally for 2 min, illustrating desirable practicality.
