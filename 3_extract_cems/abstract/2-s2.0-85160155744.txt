Supercapacitors are power devices having lower energy storage capacities. Different materials are researched for increasing its energy density without decreasing its power density. Polymer nanocomposites are one of such materials researched intensively as electrode material for supercapacitor applications. Different conducting polymers such as polyaniline, polypyrrole, and polythiol were used in the synthesis of different carbon as well as ceramic polymer nanocomposites. Out of these conducting polymer nanocomposites, metal or ceramic-polyaniline (PANi) nanocomposites are researched for supercapacitor electrodes due to their higher energy density than its contributors. Herein, the utility, research progress, and the energy storage parameters of asymmetric supercapacitors employing ceramic/PANi composites as electrodes are detailed.
