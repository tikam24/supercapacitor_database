In order to meet the safety requirements of automobile braking, to improve the braking energy recovery rate of pure electric buses and increase their driving range, the maximum regenerative braking force that the motor can provide is used to determine the front and rear wheel friction braking force distribution curve. A parallel regenerative braking control strategy, A, is proposed to make full use of the motor performance. Aiming at the problems of low power density and short cycle life with a single power battery, a composite energy system composed of power batteries and supercapacitors is designed, and an alternative energy control strategy, D, using real-time wavelet transform control is proposed. The required power is decomposed into high-frequency components and low-frequency components by using the wavelet transform control, in which the high-frequency power is borne by the supercapacitor to avoid impact on the power battery. The simulation model was created using MATLAB/Simulink software, and the simulation was carried out under combined cycle conditions to verify the effectiveness of the control strategy. The simulation results showed that compared with the original vehicle control strategy, adopting the A regenerative braking control strategy can reduce the battery SOC drop by 5.15%, increase the relative increase by 47.9%, and improve the braking energy recovery rate. Compared with the traditional logic threshold regenerative braking control strategy, AC, the AD control strategy can effectively reduce the impact of the peak current and high-frequency demands of the power battery on the battery. The maximum output current of the battery was reduced by 39.5%. The decrease in battery SOC decreased by 0.69%, and the relative increase increased by 12.43%. The driving range and braking performance of the vehicle have thus been effectively improved.
