The rise of portable electronics has led to an increased need for energy storage systems which can offer high energy and power density, as well as significant cyclic stability and flexibility. Herein, we report a 2D-2D flake-on-sheet WS2@N-rGO epitaxial hybrid nanostructure (WNRHN), which significantly enhances energy storage capacity. In the developed epitaxial hybrid nanostructure, the C-O-W bond, that connects the flake and sheet, forms a highly integrated interface, facilitating interfacial charge transport and enhancing its mechanical strength to withstand volume variations. Such emergence of charge driven interfacial transport in the studied system is further supported by ab initio calculations. The epitaxial hybrid nanostructure exhibits remarkable specific capacitance (158.28 F g−1) and cyclability (118 % over 5000 cycles and 85 % over 9000 cycles), demonstrating its significant potential for energy storage. Moreover, the tailored WS2@N-rGO epitaxial hybrid nanostructure offers superior flexibility, making it ideal for use in flexible and portable devices. The as-fabricated symmetric supercapacitor has a remarkable cyclic stability (126 % up to 5000 cycles) with ultra-power (850.03 W/kg) and energy density (19.6 Wh/kg). The asymmetric supercapacitor can deliver maximum energy density (44.23 Wh/kg) and power density (1899.97 W/kg) with high capacitance (88.22 F g−1). The brilliance of this study will lay foundation for 2D-2D epitaxial hybrid nanostructure to fit into commercial application.
