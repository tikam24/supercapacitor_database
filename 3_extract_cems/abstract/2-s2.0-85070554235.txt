This paper addresses the implementation of autonomous radiofrequency identification sensor nodes based on wireless power transfer. For size reduction, a switching method is proposed in order to use the same frequency band for both supplying power to the nodes and wirelessly transmitting the nodesâ€™ data. A rectenna harvests the electromagnetic energy delivered by the dedicated radiofrequency source for charging a few-mF supercapacitor. For supercapacitors of 7 mF, it is shown that the proposed autonomous sensor nodes were able to wirelessly communicate with the reader at 868 MHz for 10 min without interruption for a tag-to-reader separation distance of 1 meter. This result was obtained from effective radiated powers of 2 W during the supercapacitor charging and of 100 mW during the wireless data communication.
