We report large-scale interdigitated supercapacitor chips based on pseudo-capacitive metal oxide electrodes. A novel method is presented, which provides a powerful fabrication technology of interdigitated supercapacitors operated by a pseudo-capacitive reaction. Also, we empirically develop an equation that describes the relationship between capacitance, mass, and sweep rate in an actual supercapacitor system. Â© 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
