Batteries and supercapacitors are promising candidates for electrochemical energy storage while the development of their electrode materials is becoming a bottleneck. This limitation necessitates the design of electrode materials with high specific capacity/capacitance and excellent cycling stability, yet at a low cost. Herein, we present the research progress of magnetron sputtering enabled nanostructured materials as electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage. Firstly, magnetron sputtered anode materials (Si-based materials, metal-based materials, metal oxides, etc.) and cathode materials (i.e., transition metal oxides and phosphates) for lithium/sodium ion batteries are systematically reviewed. Secondly, magnetron sputtered electrode materials (metals and metal oxides, metal nitrides, etc.) for electrochemical supercapacitors are discussed. Furthermore, critical insights into the corresponding electrical conductivity and cycling stability of the electrode materials are provided through illustrations of how to rationally design and optimize electrode materials via magnetron sputtering technology. Finally, the emerging challenges and future directions of magnetron sputtered electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage are discussed.
