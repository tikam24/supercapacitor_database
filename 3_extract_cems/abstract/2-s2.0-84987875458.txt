Direct conversion of mesoporous crystalline fullerene C70 microtubes into mesoporous graphitic carbon microtubes by heat treatment at high temperature (2000 °C) with retention of the initial one-dimensional tubular morphology is reported. The walls of the resulting graphitic carbon microtubes are composed of ordered conjugated sp2 carbon with a robust mesoporous framework structure. Cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry (charge-discharge) measurements revealed that this new carbon material exhibits high specific capacitance ca. 212.2 F g-1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1 and 184.6 F g-1 at current density 0.5 A g-1. Furthermore, the material showed high rate performance. These results demonstrate that mesoporous graphitic carbon microtubes derived from the π-electron carbon source fullerene C70 can be a promising electrode material for application in high performance electrochemical supercapacitors.
