In this paper, the metro supply network and metro trains are modeled using real official data obtained from Tehran metro. This data includes speed cycles of trains, travelling times of trains and technical characteristics of electric trains with considering the return line, which are necessary to design an appropriate energy storage system (ESS). Regenerative current in each station is analyzed and possible energy savings per year are estimated. Stationary supercapacitors are employed to store regenerative currents and necessary capacitance for each station is calculated. Â© 2011 IEEE.
