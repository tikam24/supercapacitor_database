A hydration-layered structure of buserite-type manganese oxide (Mg-buserite) was successfully synthesized by an ion exchange method. The as-prepared Mg-buserite possesses a large basal spacing of 10 Å, and contains Mg 2+ ions and two sheets of water molecules in the interlayer region. The supercapacitive behaviors of Mg-buserite were systematically investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (CD) experiments and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results showed that the specific capacitance of the Mg-buserite electrode sharply increased during the initial 500 cycles and reached a maximum of 164 F g -1 at approximately the 500th cycle at a scan rate of 1 mV s -1, and then it remained an almost constant value and decreased slightly upon prolonged cycling. After 22,000 cycles, the specific capacitance decreased by approximately 6% of the maximum specific capacitance. The superior capacitive behavior and excellent cycling stability of the as-prepared Mg-buserite are attributed to the large basal spacing, which can accommodate a larger amount of electrolyte cations and provide more favorable pathways for electrolyte cations intercalation and deintercalation. The experimental results demonstrate that Mg-buserite is a promising candidate as an electrode material for supercapacitors. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.
