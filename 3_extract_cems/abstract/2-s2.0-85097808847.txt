Polyaniline with oriented nanorod arrays could provide high surface area and relaxed nanostructure to optimize ion diffusion paths, thus enhancing the performance of the device. In this paper, we designed an all-solid symmetrical supercapacitor with good performance based on polyaniline nanorod arrays in situ-grown on a graphite flake free-standing substrate. The specific capacitance, cycle stability, and energy density of the prepared supercapacitor device were 135 F/g, 75.4% retention after 1500 cycles, and the energy density is 18.75 W h/kg at a power density of 500 W/kg. The good performance of the supercapacitor device was obviously related to the oriented nanorod arrays of polyaniline/graphite flakes. In order to find the application of the prepared supercapacitor device, the tandem device consisting of three single supercapacitor devices connected in series had been used to drive small electronic equipment. The red light-emitting diode and chronograph could be easily driven by the 3-series supercapacitor devices. These results indicated that the prepared supercapacitor device based on the polyaniline/graphite flake electrode had potential applications in energy storage devices.
