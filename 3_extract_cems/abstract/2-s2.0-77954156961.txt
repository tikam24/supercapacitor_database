Nanoporous carbon is synthesized by steam activation of a carbonized mixture of furfural and pyrolyzed tar from apricot stones and evaluated in nonaqueous supercapacitor constructed as a two-electrode cell. Two types of supercapacitors with different non-aqueous electrolytes with working voltage range 1.25-2.5 V were developed. The initial specific capacitance of the cell with L1BF4-PC electrolyte is 16.2 Fg-1 at constant current of 25 m.Ag-1, but it decreases with the increase of the current. For comparison, activated carbon electrodes were tested also in Et 4NBF4-PC electrolyte and a high initial specific capacitance of 24.4 Fg-1 was obtained, which means that the second electrolyte fits better to the specific porosity of the active carbonaceous material. The effect of charging potential on the cycling performances of the supercapacitors was also investigated. The control of energy flows in the power management system developed takes into account all important factors in order to obtain a flexible and adaptable power source.
