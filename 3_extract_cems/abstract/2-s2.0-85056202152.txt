This article examines the problem of sizing and managing an Energy Storage Sys- tem (ESS) composed of supercapacitors for a Direct Wave Energy Converter (DWEC), with the SEAREV project taken as an example. The main objective is to enable grid integration by satisfying the flicker constraint. An original sequantialization is proposed in order to simplify this co-optimization resolution. Then, a rule-based energy management is introduced that depends on both the Energy Storage System and the power produced by the Wave Energy Converter. This management has been optimized for each size in order to reduce electrical losses, while strictly satisfying the flicker criteria. The final design should minimize total system cost, by taking into account both the investment cost (supercapacitors) and the operating cost (losses).
