A Ti3C2/MnO2 hybrid structure synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method was reported here. 2D-Ti3C2, as a substrate, not only can enhance the electrical conductivity, also can prevent the structural damage of MnO2. Moreover, the 2D layered structure can expose more active surface area of MnO2. As a result, the Ti3C2/MnO2 delivered a high specific capacitance of 254 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g, and 95.5% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles. This work provide some new insights for designing novel hybrid structures for energy storage & conversion applications.
