In this work, the 3D macroscopic graphene hydrogels (MGHs) with a high capacitor performance were easily prepared by a one-step hydrothermal method from graphene oxide (GO) dispersions. A very small amount of 1,4-butanediamine was employed to realize the partial reduction of GO, modification of the 3D structure of MGHs, and nitrogen doping of graphene, at the same time. The synthesized MGH-6 sample in the wet state exhibit a high specific capacitance of 268.8 Fg−1 at 0.3 A g−1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte, and this capacitance can be maintained for 84.9% even as the discharging current density was increased up to 10 A g−1. The MGH-6 sample also shows good cycle stability along with a 1.03% increase of its initial specific capacitance after 10000 cycles at current density of 10 Ag−1. These remarkable properties are ascribed to the both nitrogen- and oxygen-containing functional groups, modified macroporous 3D framework, and the high specific surface area of the graphene. Combining with the economical and easy path toward mass production, the present MGH-6 can be expected as a promising candidate for high-performance supercapacitors.
