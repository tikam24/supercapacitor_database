The development of renewable energy conversion and storage has triggered the development of electrode materials for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and supercapacitors. Here we report a highly active Cu doped NiFe nanosheets hydroxide electrode with rich oxygen vacancies (OVs) (denoted as H-NiFeCuO/NF) prepared by in situ anodic electrodeposition on the three-dimensional macroporous nickel foam (NF) substrate followed by heat treatment with H2. The as-prepared H-NiFeCuO/NF electrode showed the initial potential of 1.44 V (versus RHE) for OER and 980 F gâˆ’1 specific capacity as supercapacitor in 1 M KOH. Further investigation suggested that the tuning of composition and structure by doping copper ions and creating OVs helped accelerate the electrochemical reactions. This practice provides an efficient approach for the fabrication of heteromultimetallic hydroxide monolithic electrode with high performance in OER or supercapacitor application.
