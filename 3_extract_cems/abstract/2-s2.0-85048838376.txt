This paper presents online diagnosis model based on the adaptive observer for supercapacitors' State-of-Health, which is an important feature since aging introduces degradation in supercapacitors' performance. Unlike Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy, that requires the interruption of the system, this paper presents online diagnosis technique for supercapacitors using the adaptive observer as well-known tool for theirs particularities and performances to study nonlinear parameters estimation. The main objective of this paper is the online State-of-Health diagnosis based on the supercapacitors aging indicators estimation. The effectiveness of the proposed online observers is shown through experimental results, which are compared and analyzed.
