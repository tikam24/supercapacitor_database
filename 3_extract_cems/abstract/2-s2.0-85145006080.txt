Organicâ€“inorganic nanohybrids are widely used in supercapacitor electrode materials. However, the role of the interfaces in nanohybrids is not well understood. Five different types of interfaces and combinations have been described in this chapter. The interaction quotient (IQ), a qualitative measure of the interfacial contact, increases from physical mixtures to intimate contact materials and provides a useful concept for classifying the nanohybrids. Several analytical techniques including XPS, Raman spectroscopy, and the use of probe molecules are discussed to assess the interface.
