From the perspective of electrode materials, the effectual implantation of charge storage and conductive materials has been substantially demanded for the supercapacitor's development. Still, fabrication of uniform structured electrodes with satisfactory electrochemical performance continues to pose a challenge. Herein, we delineate the synthesis and electrochemical performance of amorphous manganese oxide/multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MnO2/CNT) nanocomposite as an active material and gamma irradiated polyvinylidene-fluoride/silver (PVDF/Ag) nanocomposites as binders for using high-performance electrode material of pseudosupercapacitors. The synthesized nanocomposites and the fabricated electrodes were characterized in terms of structure, morphology, and electrochemical performance. The three-dimensional porous structure of the electrode surface provides large surface area that facilitates the rapid ions transport from the electrolyte to the electrode and active-site accessibility. Remarkable enhancement of the supercapacitive performance of MnO2/CNT-PVDF/Ag nanocomposite electrode was observed owing to its high specific surface area and distinctive hierarchy architecture that enable a rapid transportation of electrons and ions.
