Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) with numerous potential pseudocapacitive sites are quite appealing to supercapacitors with high specific and areal capacitances. However, MOFs suffer from a low conductivity nature, resulting in a mediocre electrochemical performance. Herein, we propose a template-growth strategy of MOF to enhance both specific and areal capacitances of MOF as the electrode material for supercapacitor. As the loading mass of MOF increases from 2 to 5 mg, the specific capacitance also increases from 937 to 2387 Fg-1 (431 to 1098 Cg-1) and areal capacitance 1.87 to 11.94 Fcm-2 (0.86 to 5.49 Ccm-1). Accordingly, a hybrid MOF//AC supercapacitor can deliver a maximum energy density of 67 Wh kg-1 and a maximum power density of 6000 W kg-1. These results point to a way to fabricate MOF electrode of supercapacitor with high specific and areal capacitance, which leads them to a more practical future.
