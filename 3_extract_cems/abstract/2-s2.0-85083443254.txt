Two lithium-ion hybrid supercapacitors (LiHSs) based on high power active materials like Li3V1.95Ni0.05(PO4)3/C (LVNP/C), Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) and activated carbon (AC) are investigated as high energy and high power devices. Both LiHSs are assembled by using a bi-material negative LTO:AC electrode (50 : 50), able to deliver 38.3 mAh g−1 at 35 A g−1 (200 C for LTO), and to retain 80 % of the initial capacity over 10000 cycles at 17.5 A g−1. Two positive electrodes are employed in complete devices: a battery-type LVNP/C and a bi-material LVNP/C:AC (65 : 35) based electrodes, for two LiHSs named Hybrid A and Hybrid B, respectively. The energies of the LiHSs are evaluated from 0.05 to 10 A g−1, and at different cell voltages (2.6, 2.7 and 2.8 V). The best performance is obtained with Hybrid A cycled between 0–2.7 V, that with 36.3 Wh L−1 at 4.3 kW L−1, possesses an energy density five time higher than that of the AC||AC (6.8 Wh L−1). Despite both LiHSs charged up to 2.8 V possess superior energy values, at this cell voltage Hybrid A and Hybrid B retain only 11 % and 8 % of the initial capacity cycled over 8000 cycles at 10 A g−1, respect to the 75 % and 81 % of the same systems cycled up to 2.7 V.
