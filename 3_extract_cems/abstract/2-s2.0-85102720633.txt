In order to solve the negative problems of environment and energy caused by fuel vehicles, the application of new energy sources in the field of automobiles has gradually become the focus of attention. A hybrid energy system of electric vehicle was studied, which is composed of ultracapacitors(UCs), solar panel (namely PV) and lead-acid battery set. Through the research, it was found that the maximum power tracker can track the maximum power point of the solar panel, and the ultracapacitors with high power density and the battery with high energy density can be complementary by each other, shorten the discharge time of high current and improve the dynamic performance of the vehicle.
