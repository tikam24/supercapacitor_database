Binary conducting polymer (CP)/transition metal oxides (TMO) fiber-based supercapacitors (FSCs) are considered to possess good electrochemical performance and cyclic stability compared with unitary ones since TMO within FSCs can prevent the structure damage of CP during charge/discharge cycles to some extent. In this study, the CP/TMO hybrid fibers are made by directly injecting the solution into capillary. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): polystyrene sulfonate/30 wt% vanadium pentoxide (PEDOT: PSS/30 wt% V 2 O 5 ) fiber-based electrode has good electrochemical performance and cyclic stability (cycle retention: 94.02% after 4000 cycles at 0.1 mA/cm 2 ). The energy density of the PEDOT: PSS/30 wt% V 2 O 5 fiber in gel electrolyte is 1.37 μWh/cm 2 at power density of 20 μW/cm 2 , which is much lower than the one in organic electrolyte (21.46 μWh/cm 2 at power densities of 162.5 μW/cm 2 ). Therefore, the method developed in this work induces good electrochemical performance for hybrid FSCs and promotes scalable fabrication of FSCs.
