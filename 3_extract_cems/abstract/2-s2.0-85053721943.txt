To lengthen the lifecycles of polyaniline (PANI) electrodes, a hierarchical porous PANI was synthesized from PANI/silica self-aggregates through a facile one-pot method. Hydrogen bonding between NH groups in aniline/PANI and OH groups in nanosilica template led to a type of self-assembly, which enabled the formation of uniform nanoparticles. Silica self-aggregates provided macroporous channels, resulting in a decreased diffusion distance. After removal of the hard template, the porous PANI had a large, porous surface area (55.89 m2 g−1), in comparison with nonporous PANI (12.45 m2 g−1). The porous PANI was analyzed using Fourier transform infrared and UV-visible spectroscopies, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements. Because of its hierarchical structure, the resultant porous PANI possessed a higher capacitance (397 F g−1) than nonporous PANI (280 F g−1) at 1 A g−1 in 1 mol L−1 H2SO4 electrolyte. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.
