Aqueous integrated stretchable supercapacitors (ISSCs) have attracted extensive attention due to the intrinsic safety in future wearable electronics. However, aqueous ISSCs usually suffer from low energy density and poor dynamic deformation stability owing to the conventional hydrogel electrolytes’ narrow electrochemical stability window (ESW) and dissatisfied interface bonding. Herein, an ant-nest amphiphilic polyurethane hydro/organogel electrolyte (sAPUGE) with a wide ESW (≈2.2 V) and superb self-adhesion is prepared by electrospinning, which interacts with carbon-based stretchable electrodes for the construction of flame-retardant PU-based sAPUGE-ISSC. Benefitting from the synergistic effect of chemical bonding and mechanical meshing between the electrode and gel electrolyte interface, as-assembled sAPUGE-ISSC delivers a high energy density of 13.7 mWh cm−3 (at a power density of 0.126 W cm−3) and outstanding dynamic deformation stability (98.3% capacitance retention after 500 stretching cycles under 100% strain). This unique hydro/organogel electrolyte provides a pathway toward the next generation of wearable energy products in modern electronics.
