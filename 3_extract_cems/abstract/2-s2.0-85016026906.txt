This paper presents a systematic evaluation for five typical equivalent circuit models (ECMs) of ultracapacitors (UCs) under different ambient temperatures. A comprehensive experimental profile is designed to obtain the test datasets. The genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to identify the model parameters for five UC models under different temperatures and state of charge (SOCs). Three results can be obtained from the systematic analysis. (1) Due to the better model accuracy and robustness, the Thevenin model is preferred for UC cell modeling with the maximum errors less than 8 mV. (2) Compared with the other four UC models, the Thevenin model with one-state hysteresis (Thevenin-hys model) is preferred for UC pack modeling because of its better performance. (3) From the point of view of model accuracy and robustness against different ambient temperatures, if the SOC is less than 0.5, the UCs are not suitable for further application.
