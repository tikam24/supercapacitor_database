Two dimensional tin dioxide (SnO2) nanoplatelets/graphene nanocomposites were synthesized by a simple template free hydrothermal reaction. The SnO2 nanoplatelets served as an effective inhibitor of the aggregation between graphene sheets and a place of charge accumulation, while the graphene sheets acted as a highly conductive carbon frame. Compared with the pure graphene, the as-obtained graphen/SnO2 nanocomposite exhibited higher surface area. The electrochemical measurements showed that the graphen/SnO2 nanocomposite electrodes have an enhanced specific capacitance as high as 294 F g-1 and excellent cycling stability compared to prime SnO2 nanoplatelets. Such results demonstrated that this graphene-based composite material was a promising candidate of electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
