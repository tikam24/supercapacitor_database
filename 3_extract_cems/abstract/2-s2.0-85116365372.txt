Aiming at the electric vehicle driven by hub motor, a test bench was designed and developed in order to study the brake recovery of the electric vehicle driven by hub. It can provide experimental basis for the use of the hub-driven electric vehicle. The test bench adopts modular design, and many other test modules can be added on the basis of the mechanical part of the bench. For some major electric vehicle tests, the designed bench can well realize simulation and experiment.The test bench is equipped with road resistance simulation, weight simulation, lateral force simulation, other test functions and braking energy recovery, etc. It is a test bench for the comprehensive performance of electric vehicle driven by hub motor. The electric wheel module integrates various functions of vehicle driving, steering and braking. The maximum limit of the platform is simulated under real working conditions. Therefore, it can test these performances well. The test bench uses a hybrid battery and ultracapacitor, that is, a battery-ultracapacitor hybrid storage unit, to give play to the advantages of large specific energy of the battery and large specific power of the ultracapacitor. It can satisfy the dual requirements of the electric vehicle's comparative energy and specific power and extend the driving range to the maximum extent, which provided a convenient for the research of wheel drive EV.
