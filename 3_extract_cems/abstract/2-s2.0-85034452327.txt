Considering cost and environmental protection, the harmful aquatic plant altemanthera philoxeroides derived carbon material with super high specific surface area (2895 m2 g−1) is an ideal electrode material for supercapacitor. The structure and composition of these carbon materials were characterized by SEM, EDS, XPS and BET measurements. The obtained material exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 275 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and retains a capacitance of 210 F g−1 even at 50 A g−1. In addition, it also shows excellent capacity retention of 5000 cycles at 10 A g−1.
