Black start recovery is the strategy to deal with power system collapse from severe accidents. A time source is widely applied in the advanced application of power system dispatching control, substation and plant for PMU, traveling wave ranging and lightning positioning. With the development of power system real-time sensing and control ability, an accurate and unified time source has become the premise of black start for successful recovery. However, there is a lack of research on black start mechanism analysis and optimization of power time synchronization system at present. Therefore, the mechanism of power time synchronization system black start and its time-consuming factors are analyzed in this paper. A black start optimization method for power time synchronization system based on supercapacitor is proposed and its effectiveness is verified by designed simulation experiments. Finally, the proposed method is further tested in the actual system and the results indicate that this method is effective in reducing the process time of black start.
