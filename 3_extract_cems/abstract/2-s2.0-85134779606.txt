The study conducted in this paper is on fabrication of thin poly-pyrrole film designed with an electro-deposition method on AISI304 stainless steel substrate. For enhancing super-capacitive characteristics of electrodes, a thin poly-pyrrole layer was deposited with an electro-deposition technique, following a potentiostatic method from an aqueous solution of pyrrole containing 5-sulfosalicylic dehydrated acid (SSA). The effects of thickness were also studied on the electro-chemical properties of samples on 10 min, 15 min, 20 min, 25 min and 30 min. The optimal performance while using supercapacitor was tested on room temperature with 30.72 F g−1 specific capacitance at 5mVs−1 at 25 min. SEM was used to characterise the surface morphology for 10 min, 15 min, 20 min, 25 min and 30 min. Electrochemical properties were studied with Cyclic Voltammogram from which a maximum specific capacitance value was calculated to be 30.72 F g−1 on 25 min. In this research, super capacitive behaviour was also studied using the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic discharging-charging technique.
