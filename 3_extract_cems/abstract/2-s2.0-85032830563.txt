The redox-active electrolyte supercapacitor (RAES) is a relatively new type of energy storage device. Simple addition of selected redox species in the electrolyte can greatly enhance the energy density of supercapacitors relative to traditional electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) owing to redox reactions. Studies on the kinetics at the interface of the electrode and redox mediator are important when developing RAESs. In this work, we employ highly accurate scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) to extract the kinetic constants at carbon/hydroquinone interfaces. The charge transfer rate constants are 1.2 × 10-2 and 1.3 × 10-2 cm s-1 for the carbon nanotube/hydroquinone and reduced graphene oxide/hydroquinone interfaces, respectively. These values are higher than those obtained by the conventional cyclic voltammetry method, approximately by an order of magnitude. The evaluation of heterogeneous rate constants with SECM would be the cornerstone for understanding and developing high performance RAESs.
