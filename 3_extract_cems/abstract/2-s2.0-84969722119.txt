A supercapacitor with two identical activated pyrolytic carbon electrodes prepared by pyrolysis of raw plant material has been studied. The transition from charge to discharge and vice versa in a partly charged capacitor is accompanied by an inductive-like effect. The magnitude of apparent induction has been determined. It is suggested that the observed effect can be determined by the kinetics of ions in the electrolyte solution filling porous structure of the electrode material.
