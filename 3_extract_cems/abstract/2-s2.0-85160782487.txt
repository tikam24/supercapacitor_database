Urban air mobility (UAM), defined as safe and efficient air traffic operations in a metropolitan area for manned aircraft and unmanned aircraft systems, is being researched and developed by industry, academia, and government. This kind of mobility offers an opportunity to construct a green and sustainable sub-sector, building upon the lessons learned over decades by aviation. Thanks to their non-polluting operation and simple air traffic management, electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft technologies are currently being developed and experimented with for this purpose. However, to successfully complete the certification and commercialization stage, several challenges need to be overcome, particularly in terms of performance, such as flight time and endurance, and reliability. In this paper, a fast methodology for sizing and selecting the propulsion chain components of an eVTOL multirotor aerial vehicle was developed and validated on a reduced-scale prototype of an electric multirotor vehicle with a (Formula presented.) of 15 kg. This methodology is associated with a comparative study of energy storage system configurations, in order to assess their effect on the flight time of the aerial vehicle. First, the optimal pair motor/propeller was selected using a global nonlinear optimization in order to maximize the specific efficiency of these components. Second, five energy storage technologies were sized in order to evaluate their influence on the aerial vehicle flight time. Finally, based on this sizing process, the optimized propulsion chain gross take-off weight (GTOW) was evaluated for each energy storage configuration using regression-based methods based on propulsion chain supplier data.
