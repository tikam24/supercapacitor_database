Co-Fe layered double hydroxides (Co1-xFex LDHs) were synthesized by a chemical co-precipitation method. It was found that the molor ratio of Co to Fe had a significant effect on the electrochemical activity. The specific capacitance of 869 F g-1 was achieved when the molor ratio of Co to Fe was equal to 0.74:0.26. The Co0.74Fe0.26 LDH sample had a BET specific surface area of 202.9m2 g-1 and total pore volume of 0.6cm3 g-1, which led to the high liquid'solid interfacial area and further increased the utilization of the active materials. Additionally, the Co0.74Fe0.26 LDH electrode exhibited a good electrochemical stability with beyond 99.5% of the initial capacitance over 1000 consecutive cycles at 1Ag-1. It is a promising electrode material for supercapacitor.
