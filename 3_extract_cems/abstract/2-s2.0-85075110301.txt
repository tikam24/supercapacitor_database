In the present work, tin oxide (SnO2)/Zinc manganite (ZnMn2O4) nanocomposites (NCs) were prepared via two step approach. The pure ZnMn2O4 NPs and SnO2/ZnMn2O4 NCs were developed from co-precipitation and hydrothermal method. The Powder x-ray Diffraction (PXRD) pattern demonstrates that the existence of spinel cubic and tetragonal rutile phase structure of ZnMn2O4 and SnO2/ZnMn2O4 NCs. The two peaks are located at 531 cm-1 and 618 cm-1 is originating from the metal oxide stretching vibration bonds of Mn-O and Sn-O. The spherical and cubic morphology was determined from the prepared ZnMn2O4 and SnO2/ZnMn2O4 NCs and elemental compositions of prepared material were identified in EDAX analysis. The electrochemical performance of the prepared material investigates by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. From the electrochemical study, specific capacitance behavior with high capacitance attained about 658 F g-1 in (6 M) KOH electrolyte solution at the current density 1 A g-1. These superior electrochemical features exhibit that the prepared SnO2/ZnMn2O4 NCs acts as a potential candidate for next-generation supercapacitor systems.
