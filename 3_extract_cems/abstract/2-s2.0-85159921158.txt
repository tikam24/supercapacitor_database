The proceedings contain 14 papers. The topics discussed include: carrier dynamics and nonlinear photonics in strained graphene with pseudo-magnetic fields; novel mid-infrared photodetectors and emitters using black phosphorus-based heterostructures; influence of Coulomb correlations on high harmonic generation in monolayer TMDCs; measurement of the out-of-plane optical constants of a two-dimensional crystal; enhanced four wave mixing from MoS2 disks supporting higher-order anapole resonance; liquid metal fabrication of ultrathin Ga2O3 and GaN layers for integrated optics; chiral harmonic generation studies from partially etched amorphous silicon nanodisk arrays; light emission and engineered carrier lifetime in strained 2D materials towards developing wavelength-tunable integrated emitters; performance enhancement of surface plasmon resonance biosensor based on prism with Kretschmann configuration assisted by 2D materials; and facile hydrothermal synthesis of vanadium disulfide nanomaterial for supercapacitor application.
