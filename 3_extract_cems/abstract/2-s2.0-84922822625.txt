Cotton stalk based activated carbon (AC) was prepared from Xinjiang, China by H3PO4 as activating reagent. In order to improve electrochemical properties of AC, a series of AC/MnO2 (electrolytic manganese dioxide)/AC composites with different MnO2 contents were prepared. The samples specific surface area and pore distribution were characterised by Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET); the structure and morphology were characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) respectively. Moreover, the improvements of activated carbon modified by MnO2 were confirmed by the experiment of galvanostatic current charge/ discharge, cyclic voltammograms and alternating current impedance tests respectively. The results show that the specific capacitance (169 F g-1) of the composite material electrode (the contents of MnO2 is 5%) would be higher in 1·0 mol L-1 Et4NBF4/AN electrolyte at 2·0 A g-1 than other composite materials, which is 39% higher than the present study. The capacitance was kept more than 99·2% after 500 cycles and still higher than that of activated carbon materials.
