This work reports the synthesis, characterization, and electrochemical analysis of composites comprised of copper nanoparticles grafted on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) for cost-effective, high-performance supercapacitor applications. A facile synthesis method was adopted to impregnate copper nanoparticles over g-C3N4 sheets, and structural and morphological characterizations evidenced successful in situ grafting of Cu/g-C3N4. Different electrochemical investigations were accomplished to estimate the supercapacitive behavior of the designed electrode material. These electrochemical analyses unveiled that the designed nanocomposites showed superior electrochemical performances than pristine g-C3N4. The equivalent series resistance of 1.61 Ω was obtained for Cu/g-C3N4, which is lesser than base material g-C3N4 sheets (2.19 Ω) from the Nyquist plot of EIS spectra. An asymmetric solid-state supercapacitor was designed, and a specific capacitance of 265.25 Fg-1 at 0.5 Ag-1 current density was found, along with an energy density of 36.87 Wh/kg at a power density of 2.50 kW/kg. Moreover, good cyclic consistency of 79.4% capacitance retention was obtained at 5 Ag-1 at 5000 cycles. These electrochemical performances indicate that Cu/g-C3N4 nanocomposites have a vast potential to use in energy storage perspective.
