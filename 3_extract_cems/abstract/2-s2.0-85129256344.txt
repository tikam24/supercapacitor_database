The spinel structured MnCo2O4 has been prepared by a facile solvothermal route. Structural properties of the prepared materials have been characterized by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray’s spectroscopy (EDS), and Fourier transform infra spectroscopy (FTIR). The XRD data suggests the formation of phase pure cubic phase crystalline material with space group of Fd-3m. The SEM studies reveal the formation of MnCo2O4 microspheres in size range of 1–2 μm. The EDS mapping confirms homogenous distribution of the Mn, Co and O atoms in the material. The FTIR spectroscopy confirms the metal oxygen bonding. Synthesized material was used as electrode material for supercapacitor. The MnCo2O4 exhibits specific capacitance of 273 F/g at 10 mV/s and specific capacitance of 320 F/g at 1 A/g. Asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device has been fabricated by using activated carbon (AC), and MnCo2O4 as negative and positive electrodes respectively and 1 M H2SO4 as electrolyte. ASC shows specific capacitance of 133 F/g at 10 mV/s and 89 F/g at 3 A/g. ASC exhibits energy density of 31.7 Wh/kg at power density of 2.46 kW/kg and retains to energy density of 8.9 Wh/kg at power density of 12.4 kW/kg. Based on these outcomes, it is assumed that this material can contribute greatly in the development of futuristic high performance energy storage devices.
