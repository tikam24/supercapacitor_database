The research on finding a suitable electrode material with high capacitance, stability, and rate performance is highly desirable for the advanced energy storage domain is a hot topic for a decade. Currently, metal selenides (MSs) are involved in considerable attention is owed to their unique physical and chemical properties. Herein, selenide/selenide composite based on NiSe2, SnSe, and their nanocomposite of NiSe2/SnSe (denoted as SN-1 and SN-2) was prepared via wet-assisted chemical method for the electrochemical energy domain. The comparative review showed that higher charge storage response was noticed for the SnSe electrode than the NiSe2 electrode due to its high conductivity, which is confirmed by the impedance plot. All electrodes pseudocapacitive charge storage response due to well-defined voltage plateaus and noticeable redox peaks in their charge/discharge, and the CV diagram. The SN-2||AC||KOH hybrid supercapacitor expands the voltage to 1.8 V, which supplies high energy (65.47 Wh kg−1) and power delivery (4500 W kg−1) with robust longevity of 94.4 % after 8000 galvanostatic charge/discharge platforms at 15 A/g. This study manifests that the construction of binary, ternary, and even quarterly composites can be utilized as effective electrodes for the future electronic market.
