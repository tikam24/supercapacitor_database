Ni1-xCoxO1-δ (Where x = 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.09) (CNO) based nanostructured materials were synthesized by facile soft chemical route and characterised for application as electrodes in electrochemical supercapacitors. The prepared materials were studied by XRD, FITR, particle size, EDAX equipped with SEM, TEM and electrochemical studies such as CV, GCD and impedance analysis. XRD has confirmed the presence of the FCC crystalline structure. FTIR results have shown peaks at ~450 cm−1 which are relevant to metal oxide. The existence of nanosized particles were confirmed by particle size measurements. SEM analysis has further shown the appearance of spherical-shaped particles with average grain size ranging from 19.7 to 37.74 nm in the samples. The EDAX data has reflected the occurrence of appropriate elements as per stoichiometry calculations. The TEM analysis carried-out on Ni0.91Co0.09O1-δ has confirmed the presence of polycrystalline behaviour. Among the samples, Ni0.91Co0.09O1-δ electrode material has achieved more capacitance (338.13Fg−1).
