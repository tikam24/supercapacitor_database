The controllable adjustment of pore structure is of great significance for the high capacitive performance of porous carbon materials. In this research, a versatile K2CO3 activation approach is proposed to adjust and control the porosity of sunflower plate-derived hierarchical porous carbon materials (HPC-x) by controlling the K2CO3/carbons mass ratio. Notably, the variety of pore types, including micropores, mesopores and macropores, can be detected at different K2CO3/carbons mass ratios (0 âˆ¼ 4). Impressively, the specific surface area of optimal HPC-2 material is 2526 m2/g. Compare with the other samples (HPC-1, HPC-3 or HPC-4), the HPC-2 possess superior capacitance activity (369.4 F/g at 0.5 A/g). On top of that, the energy density of HPC-2 assembled supercapacitors in 1 M Na2SO4 and 6 M KOH solutions can even reach 32.6 and 7.3 Wh/kg, respectively.
