Energy storage systems in recent days are witnessing an increased trajectory of hybridization to decrease the burden on the single energy storage systems in renewable energy sources. The hybridization of energy storage imposes the need for an efficient power-sharing strategy. This article proposes the interval type2 fuzzy logic controller-based power-sharing strategy to utilize hybrid energy storages in the solar-powered charging station effectively. Under this study, the hybrid energy storage system consists of a battery and supercapacitor with solar power generation as a primary source. The battery supports the slow varying power and the supercapacitor supports the fast-varying power. Electric vehicles are connected as load and a multi-step constant current charging technique is proposed to charge its battery. In order to inject/absorb the power, the hybrid energy storage utilizes bidirectional DC-DC converters. The perturb and observe algorithm is used to track the maximum power from the solar panel. The proposed system is designed in MATLAB/Simulink platform and the real-time validation has been carried out through the dSPACE (DS1202) real-time processor. An obtained result demonstrates the performance of the interval type2 fuzzy logic controller-based power-sharing strategy under variable generation and load scenarios.
