One of the solutions to increase the integration of wind generators to the grid is their association with a battery storage system. This later which offers the possibility of filtering the fluctuations of the generated wind power, remedies also its unpredictability. However, batteries have a limited charge/discharge cycles number, and the rapid fluctuations of wind power will reduce their lifespan. This paper proposes a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) combining batteries and supercapacitors in order to alleviate constraints on batteries. So, the whole system will be capable to satisfy at best grid power demand in terms of both quality and quantity. An appropriate supervisory control algorithm is developed to manage the hybrid storage system with the aim of adapting the generated wind power to the grid power requirement. The studied wind energy conversion system (WECS) is based on a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG), and three-level converters are used to connect the rotor to the grid. Modeling and control of the global system are developed and the control performances are analyzed through simulations on Simulink/Matlab software.
