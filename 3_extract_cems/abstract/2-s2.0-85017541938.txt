A new type of hierarchically mesoporous cobalt ferrite oxide nanosheets, CoFe 2 O 4 nanosheets, has been successfully fabricated via a simple hydrothermal method on the Ni foam followed by a post-annealing treatment. This CoFe 2 O 4 nanosheets was employed as a supercapacitor electrode and exhibited an excellent capacitance of 503 F g −1 at a current density of 2 A g −1 . When the current density increased to 20 A g −1 , the capacitance of CoFe 2 O 4 nanosheets can maintain 78.5% (395 F g −1 ) of the initial value, indicating the remarkable rate capability of the as-prepared CoFe 2 O 4 nanosheets. An aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) based on CoFe 2 O 4 nanosheets as a positive electrode and the activated carbon (AC) as a negative electrode was assembled for the first time. The as-fabricated ASC delivered a specific capacitance of 73.12 F g −1 at a current density of 1.2 A g −1 in a voltage window of 1.5 V. The CoFe 2 O 4 //AC ASC could achieve a high energy density of 22.85 W h kg −1 and good long-term cycling stability (98% retention after 5000 cycles). These results demonstrated that CoFe 2 O 4 nanosheets could be one of the promising electrode material for supercapacitors applications.
