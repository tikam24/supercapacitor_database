MnO2 nanowire/Ag nanoparticles composites for supercapacitor were synthesized with a two-step procedure, which involves preparing MnO 2 nanowires and acquiring conductive Ag nanoparticles grown on the surface of MnO2 nanowires with reducing Ag+. The results show that Ag nanoparticles are not only to improve the electric conductivity, but also to enhance the structural stability of the composites. The composites have an excellent specific capacitance of 396.4 F/g at a scan rate of 50 mV/s in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution, which is almost five times that of the pure MnO2 nanowires. Besides, capacitance retention of 95.2% for the MnO2/Ag over 2000 charge/discharge cycles at a charge/discharge current of 5 A/g is much better than that of the pure MnO 2 NWs.
