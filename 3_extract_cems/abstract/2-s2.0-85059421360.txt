The effect of physical activation time in production of activated carbon electrodes from pineapple crown waste on the physical and electrochemical properties of supercapacitor cells has been demonstrated in this study. The samples were activated in the CO 2 gas environment at a temperature of 900 Â°C with the activation time varied to 1.5; 2; 2.5 and 3 hours. Physical properties testing showed the activation time of 2.5 hours is the optimum activation time in the producing of carbon electrodes from pineapple crown waste. The optimum conditions are indicated by the minimum condition on the density and microcristalline height, and the maximum condition on specific surface area and carbon content, so it produce higest specific capacitance for supercapacitor cells. The optimum specific capacitance was found as high as 134 Fg -1 . As a complement also has been analyzed the appearance of the surface morphology of the sample where the electrode is composed of carbon nanofiber with an average diameter of 90-164 nm.
