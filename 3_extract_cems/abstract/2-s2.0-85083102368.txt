In this work, a flexible textile-based electrode material is developed. The vertical array of Co-Ni layered double hydroxide (Co-Ni LDH) nanosheets are successfully assembled on the conductive graphene/cotton composite fabrics (G/CF) using a chemical deposition method. Taking advantages of the highly conductive, porous nature of G/CF and high specific capacitance of Co-Ni LDH, the Co-Ni(OH)2 layered double hydroxide/graphene/cotton composite fabrics (Co-Ni LDH/G/CF) as electrode materials show good flexibility and high electrochemical performances. The specific capacitance of the Co-Ni LDH/G/CF electrode material is determined to be 578 Fg-1 at a scan rate of 5 mVs-1. It is believed that the Co-Ni LDH electrode material may have a promising application in the development of flexible energy storage devices.
