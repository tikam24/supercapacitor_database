High-quality ultra-long α-MnO2 nanowires, with diameter of about 25 nm and length of several hundred micrometers or even up to several millimeters, have been prepared using a simple hydrothermal approach without surfactants. By simple vacuum filtration, the superior flexible α-MnO 2 paper with adjustable thickness has been produced, and displays an average modulus of 225 MPa at the thickness of 30 μm. The crystallographic structure, chemical component and morphology of the α-MnO2 nanowires are characterized by XRD, FTIR, XPS, FESEM and TEM, respectively. The influences of NH4+ ion concentration and temperature on the crystallographic forms, morphological changes and aspect ratios of the α-MnO2 nanowires are systematically investigated. The as-prepared flexible α-MnO2 paper electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 118 F g-1 at 2 mV s-1 with excellent rate capability (42.4% at 200 mV s-1), and a superior cycling stability with only 4.7% loss after 1000 cycles. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.
