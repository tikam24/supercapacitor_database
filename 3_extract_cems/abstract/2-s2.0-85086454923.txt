N-O-P ternary-doped carbon materials (NOPCs) with hierarchical porous structure were prepared by a scalable, facile and one-step synthetic approach using kitchen waste as precursor without any extra nitrogen or phosphorus sources. The porous structure, morphology and surface element mapping of NOPCs were fully investigated by N2 adsorption-desorption analysis and TEM coupled with energy dispersive spectrometer. The investigations illustrated that the NOPCs featured high contents of nitrogen (11.48 at.%), oxygen (35.18 at.%) and phosphorus (1.94 at.%). The optimal NOPCs electrode can deliver a high specific capacitance of 290 F g−1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte. The assembled NOPCs asymmetric supercapacitor delivered high energy density of 20.5 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 477.9 W kg−1. This study significantly provided a promising pathway for the reuse of kitchen waste.
