In this paper, a novel ternary RGO/β-Ni(OH)2-CeO2 nanocomposite (NC) was synthesised through facile, one-step hydrothermal, and solid-state methods. The structural, morphological, and elemental composition analyses of powder composites were characterised by various techniques such as XRD, FTIR, TEM, and EDX. The electrochemical performance of RGO/β-Ni(OH)2-CeO2 composites prepared by hydrothermal and solid-state methods coated on Ni foam in presence of 3 M KOH an aqueous solution was studied through CV, GCD, and EIS techniques. The specific capacitance of 788 F g-1 achieved at a current density 0.5 A g-1 was observed for the SSM-2 sample at 250 °C calcination temperature as a result of the synergic effect and combination of RGO, β-Ni(OH)2, CeO2 compounds. The obtained electrochemical results show that the present novel ternary RGO/β-Ni(OH)2-CeO2 working electrode fabricated from the solid-state method is suitable for the next generation supercapacitor applications.
