Transition-metal selenides (TMSe) incorporate reversible multielectron Faradaic reactions that can deliver high specific capacitance. Unfortunately, they usually exhibit actual capacitance lower than their theoretical value and suffer from sluggish kinetics, which do not satisfy the demands of hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs), due to poor electron-transmission capability and inferior ion-transport rate. Herein, a kind of hollow biphase and bimetal cobalt nickel perselenide composed of metastable marcasite-type CoSe2 (m-CoSe2) and stable pyrite-type NiCoSe4 (p-NiCoSe4) is synthesized with metal glycerol alkoxide as precursors by regulating the Ni/Co ratios. This unique hollow biphase structure and bimetallic synergistic effect serves to boost electron-transmission capability and accelerate the ion/electron transfer rate, delivering an excellent specific capacitance of 1008 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 and a high discharge rate capability of 859 F g-1 at 20 A g-1. The capacitance remains around 80% of the initial capacitance after 5000 cycles. Consequently, a HSC based on the cobalt nickel perselenide cathode and a hierarchical porous carbon anode reveals a maximum energy density of 34.8 W h kg-1 and a maximum power density of 7272 W kg-1. This polymorphic bimetallic phase engineering provides an advanced and effective guidance for TMSe with high electrochemical properties.
