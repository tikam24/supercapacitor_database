Three-dimensional (3D) porous carbonaceous materials offer numerous merits such as light-weight, high surface area, flexibility, and thus hold immense potential in energy storage applications. In this work, we report preparation of nitrogen-rich free-standing compressible porous neuron-like carbon sponge using commercially available kitchen sponge by a facile, cost-effective, and scalable synthetic strategy. The unique neuron-like bubbled interconnected carbon structure with enhanced N/O functionalities improves the electrochemical performance by providing sufficient space for ion transport and large accessible surface-active sites. This material also delivers high current response under compressive stress acting as a pressure sensor. This bubbled carbon material achieves an improved specific capacitance of 268.5 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. As a self-supporting electrode in a symmetrical supercapacitor cell, it still delivers a good specific capacitance of 167 F g−1 at 0.35 A g−1, retaining 92.5% of capacitance over 7000 charge/discharge cycles. Furthermore, the device delivers a maximum energy density of 14.8 Wh Kg−1, demonstrating its immense potential for multi-functional applications owing to its unique features.
