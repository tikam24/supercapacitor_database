We have developed a new family of sub-fluorinated carbon fluoride materials, CFx (x<1) that show a good tradeoff between energy density and power density, together with excellent low temperature (down to -60Â°C) performances in lithium primary batteries application. The starting carbon materials consist of synthetic graphite and carbon multi-wall nanotubes. The outstanding CFx electrode kinetics may be related to its unique nano-composite crystal structure having intimately mixed fluorinated and unfluorinated carbon domains, as evidenced by x-ray diffractometry and electron microscopy studies. copyright The Electrochemical Society.
