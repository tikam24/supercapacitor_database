This paper deals with a topology without the entrance filter allowing the control of the power flow between a fuel cell, a storage device constituted by a supercapacitor bank and a load. The proposed control doesn't use algorithm commutation when the operating mode changes with the load power variation, and thus avoids chattering effects. Moreover it ensures that the power delivered by the fuel cell is limited and its dynamic is perfectly controlled. The proposed topology and its control allow obtaining a current delivered by the fuel cell which doesn't contain high frequency components. Therefore, there is no need of any additional filter. Simulated results prove the validity of the proposed approach. Â© 2006 IEEE.
