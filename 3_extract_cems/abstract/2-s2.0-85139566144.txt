The construction of flexible supercapacitors with high electrochemical performance and excellent mechanical properties to power flexible electronics and sensors is very important. Freestanding electrodes play a crucial role in flexible supercapacitors, and carbon has been widely used in this role because of its high electronic conductivity, tunable porosity, adjustable surface area, excellent mechanical properties, low density and easy functionalization. It is also abundant and cheap. Recent progress on the fabrication of freestanding carbon electrodes based on various carbon materials for use in flexible supercapacitors is summarized, and remaining challenges and future opportunities are discussed.
