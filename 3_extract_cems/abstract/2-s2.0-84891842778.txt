The Ni-based/graphene nano sheet (GNS) materials have been prepared by using the polyol reduction process and the NiO dispersed layer was fabricated on Ni metal to form the core/shell nanocomposites. These Ni-based/GNS composite materials possess excellent electrochemical properties, and have been investigated by thermal gravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy techniques. The electrochemical performance was measured by cyclic voltammograms and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests in 1 M KOH electrolyte solution. The results show that the 60Ni-250 sample has the potential application in supercapacitors because of its good electrochemical properties. Â© 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
