Mesoporous manganese dioxide (MnO2) films have been successfully electrodeposited from hexagonal structured lyotropic liquid crystalline phases with polyoxyethnlene surfactant. The liquid crystalline templates are characterized by low-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) and polarized-light optical microscopy (POM). The mesoporous MnO2 films are characterized by low-angle XRD, wide-angle XRD, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The mesoporous MnO2 films heat-treated at 200 °C were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte for supercapacitor application. The mesoporous MnO2 films exhibit ideal capacitive behavior between -0.1 and 0.9 V, and a specific capacitance of 460 Fg-1 is obtained at the scan rate of 10 mV s-1. These results indicate that mesoporous MnO2 films electrodeposited from lyotropic liquid crystalline phases provide promising applications in supercapacitors. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
