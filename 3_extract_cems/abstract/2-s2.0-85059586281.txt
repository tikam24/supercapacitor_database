Graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) are important materials used for various applications like sensors, photo catalysis and supercapacitor. Herein, we present a facile approach for fabricating rGO-GO heterostructure freestanding films for gas sensing and capacitor applications. Taking advantage simple and fast laser irradiation reduction process and oxygen functional groups in the rGO-GO heterostructure, we fabricated free-standing and flexible room temperature ammonia sensors with a high response (18%) and wide sensing range (50–800 ppm). Interestingly, these heterostructures show high ε' (1333) in the capacitor configuration which is 24 higher than the insulating GO. Our results establish that the proposed method is a promising strategy to improve graphene-based devices like gas sensors and capacitors and also provide new insights of ultrafast laser processing of heterostructure.
