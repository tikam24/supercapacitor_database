There is an increasing demand for the use of hybrid/full electric vehicles (vehicles powered by batteries and/or fuel cells) and renewable energy (mainly wind and solar energy) to save fuel and reduce emission of carbon dioxide. The performance and cost (capital and running) of the devices for the electrochemical conversion and storage of energy are of great concern. The UltraBatteryâ„¢, developed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia, is a hybrid energy storage device that combines a supercapacitor and a lead-acid battery in a single unit; it takes the best from both technologies without the need for extra expensive electronic controls. The supercapacitor enhances the power and lifespan of the lead-acid battery as it acts as a buffer during high-rate discharge and charge. Thus, the UltraBattery in a hybrid electric vehicle enables the rapid delivery and acceptance of charge during vehicle acceleration and regenerative braking, respectively. When applied to the storage of wind energy, the UltraBattery can also absorb the noise generated by the variation in wind speed and thereby deliver a smooth power output from the turbine.
