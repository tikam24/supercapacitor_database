An improved way of measuring the specific surface area of carbon materials that is based on the adsorption of methylene blue is proposed. It is found that the proposed method is more accurate for microand mesoporous carbon materials than the one described in GOST (State Standard) 13144-79. It is shown that the method ensures good correlation with the measured specific electric capacitances of the materials and allows us to assess the geometric shape and average size of mesopores in an investigated carbon material.
