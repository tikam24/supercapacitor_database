For the fabrication of sustainable energy devices, to overcome the influence of binders and additives on the energy storage capacity of materials, and to promote portable electronic development, polypyrrole nanoarrays (PPy NAs) were prepared using a simple electrochemical deposition method. Further, oxygen and nitrogen co-doped 3D carbon nanoarrays (D-CNAs) were prepared using a carbonization method, which increased the conductivity of the materials and improved the energy storage capacity of the electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs). Moreover, the charge transfer resistance was reduced by the synergistic effect of oxygen and nitrogen co-doping and the exposure of active sites in the 3D nanostructures, which gives D-CNAs a pseudo-capacitance. Using non-polluting and resource-rich sodium chloride as the electrolyte, the D-CNAs electrode exhibited a specific capacitance of up to 480 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 with excellent rate capability, and 77.1% of its capacitance could be retained at 10 A g−1, respectively. The D-CNAs//D-CNAs supercapacitor assembled exhibited excellent cycle stability. After 10,000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g−1, the specific capacitance retention was 90%. Finally, a wireless charging integration supercapacitor was fabricated using screen printing technology and a single-chip microcomputer.
