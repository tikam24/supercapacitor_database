Nowadays, many researchers have found that the output performance of a hybrid power system is an important reason to determine fuel cell life. Therefore, the energy management strategy for a hybrid power system is the solution to guarantee the normal operation of the system. In this paper, a comparative study of the most commonly used energy management techniques in fuel-cell vehicle applications in a proposed hybrid four-wheel-drive electric vehicle, these schemes include the following: the classical PI, Fuzzy-logic, State machine and frequency decoupling schemes, to ameliorate the dynamic behaviour of the electric vehicle during transients such as the dynamic response and the electric vehicle stability, and to select the best between those techniques based on many criteria which are the hydrogen consumption, the overall efficiency, the state of charge and the stability of DC bus voltage. The general topology of the electric vehicle is composed with three distributed energy resources, the proton exchange membrane Fuel Cell as the main source and a hybrid energy storage system includes batteries and supercapacitor devices as the auxiliary source, this hybrid power sources system driven the four-wheel-drive electric vehicle composed by four induction motors controlled by a direct torque control with space vector modulation.
