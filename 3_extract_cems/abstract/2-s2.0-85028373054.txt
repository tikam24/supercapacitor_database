Gas chromatography and mass-spectrometry were used to study the process of accelerated aging of supercapacitors (SCs), followed by the gas evolution. These processes were investigated under high voltages and high temperatures for SCs with different electrolyte compositions. It has been shown that the electrolyte composition determines the direction of electrolyte destruction processes. Water plays the particular role in the SC performance deterioration as initiator of the electrolyte destruction reactions.
