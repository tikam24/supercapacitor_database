In order to explore the electrochemical performance of the composite materials, the biochar of MgAl-LDH@BC was prepared from durian shell hydrochar coupling with MgAl-LDH via hydrothermal treatment. The physicochemical characteristics and electrochemical properties of the composite biochar as electrode material were analyzed. The results show that the surface of the MgAl-LDH@BC is mainly composed of C and O elements, and the percentage of C and O atoms is 56.04% and 33.94% respectively. The composite biochar presents layered porous structure. Moreover, the MgAl-LDH@BC exhibits a BET specific surface area of 75.51 m2/g, an average pore size of 15.44 nm. In a three electrode system with 6 mol/L KOH as electrolyte, the cyclic voltammetry curve of the composite biochar prepared as working electrode is symmetrical rectangular. The galvanostatic charge-discharge curve under different current densities is approximately triangular. The specific capacitance of the hydrochar is 742.68 at 1 A/g. The electrochemical impedance curve shows a steep slope in the low frequency region. The MgAl-LDH@BC has good capacitance retention rate and chemical stability, and has the potential to become electrode materials of super capacitors.
