We report exceptional electrochemical specific capacitance (640 F g−1) for polythiophene (PTh) infiltrated into TiO2 nanotubes (TNTs) by a controlled electropolymerization route. The resulting PTh–TNTs also exhibit excellent electrochemical behavior with long-term stability. This reproducible and superior performance of PTh–TNT electrodes makes them attractive candidates for energy storage. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
