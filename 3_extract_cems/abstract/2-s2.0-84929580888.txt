Lightweight, flexible electrodes based on three-dimensional (3D) graphene have received increasing attention because of their application potential in electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Integrating 3D graphene networks with other active components endows electrodes with large capacity/capacitance, high energy and power densities, and ultrastable cycling at high rates. This review highlights the fabrication techniques for self-supported 3D porous graphene structures and their integrated electrodes with metal oxides/hydroxides for battery, supercapacitor, and oxygen reduction reaction applications. Merits and demerits of different preparation methods and the associated electrochemical properties are presented. General advantages of graphene-based integrated electrodes are discussed.
