Manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanostructures have been synthesized by hydrothermal method. The crystallographic structure, morphology, and electrochemical properties of MnO2 nanoparticles have been measured by XRD, SEM, TEM, and cyclic voltammetry (CV). It is shown that the hydrothermal temperature and reaction time have played an important role on the crystallographic structure and morphology of the MnO2 particles. And the MnO2 particles composed of hollow urchins exhibits a higher specific capacitance of 210 F/g. Â© (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
