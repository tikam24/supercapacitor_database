In this paper, we have used polymer polyethylene oxide as a host matrix and novel electrolyte ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tricyanomethanide as an dopant to increase ionic mobility. Different characterization techniques like Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, dielectric measurement, Fourier transform, X-ray diffraction, polarized optical microscopy, thermogravinometric analysis were used to identify the electrical, optical, structural and thermal properties. A laboratory scale supercapacitor has been fabricated using optimized solid polymer electrolyte film as an electrolyte and porous carbon derived from corn starch which shows a specific capacitance 13.6 F/g at 50 mV/s scan rate.
