In this work, effect of surfactant on the properties of polypyrrole thin films is studied. Films are deposited on stainless steel substrate by using galvanostatic mode of electro deposition at constant current density 4mA/cm2. The prepared films are characterizing for structural, morphological and electrical studies. X-Ray diffraction pattern depicts amorphous nature of all polypyrrole (PPy) films on stainless steel substrate. FTIR and Raman spectroscopy confirms formation of polypyrrole films on given substrate. Deposition of polypyrrole is in presence of surfactant like cetriltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), Triton-X 100 (TX-100) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) reveals changing electrical, optical and surface morphological properies. The change in electrical conductivity of PPy-NS, PPy-CTAB, PPy-TX to PPy-SDS scratched film from substrate are 10-6 to 10-4 S/cm. Surface morphologies of deposited films are characterized by using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM). It evinces the formation cauliflower, oval, rod and spherical structure in PPy-NS, PPy-CTAB, PPy-TX and PPy-SDS film. For the study X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, a full scan and narrow scan for N1s peaks for all deposited films are carried out. Attempts have been taken to study supercapacitive performance evaluation of all polypyrrole films in 1M H2SO4 solution.
