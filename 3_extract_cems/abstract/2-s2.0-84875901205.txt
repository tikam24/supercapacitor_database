Using CoCl2·6H2O and RuCl3·3H2O as raw materials, (RuO2/Co3O4)·nH2O composite film electrode material for supercapacitor was prepared by colloidal method. The phase transformation and electrochemical properties were studied by XRD and electrochemical system of CHI660C, respectively. The results show that when the molar ratio of CoCl2·6H2O and RuCl3·3H2O is 2:1, the composite film electrode prepared after heat-tread at 350°C for 2.5 h exhibites an excellent comprehensive property, and its specific capacitance is 512 F/g in 0.5 mol/L H2SO4 electrolyte, which still keeps at 96.1% after 500 charge-discharge cycles. Besides, when charge-discharge current is 0.01A, the internal resistense of (RuO2/Co3O4)·nH2O composite film electrode is 1.2 Ω.
