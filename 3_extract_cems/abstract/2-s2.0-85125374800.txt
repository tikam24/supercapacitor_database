A novel dynamic energy management for DC microgrid with battery and ultra-capacitor energy storage system is planned in this paper. Battery is designed to utilize average power requirements, where as ultracapacitor is utilized to manage the transient power requirements. Proportional integral control is proposed for energy management. In the proposed system Photovoltaic system is integrated to Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS). To maximize the power output of the PV system, MPPT controller which utilizes the Perturb and Observe Algorithm is implemented with boost converter. The power imbalances between the source and load power, DC voltage fluctuations are mitigated combining two Energy Storage devices. Battery and ultra-capacitor, together coupled to DC bus via two-way DC-DC converters. The proposed energy Management system of DC grid is implemented in MATLAB using Simulink tools and the outcomes are presented for PV generation and load variations. The proposed control strategy efficiently maintains the DC link voltage and also fulfills AC and DC load requirements.
