Carbon synthesized from corn-cob has been used as an electrode in Electrochemical Double Layer Capacitor (EDLC). Dried Corn Cobs, soaked in 1N KOH, 1N HCl or 5% ZnCl2 at 10 0°C for 24 hr, were pyrolyzed in presence of Ar using Co as catalyst at 700-900 °C having dwell time of 60-180 min. The morphology of thus obtained carbon was studied under SEM that showed it to be porous carbon. All the carbon samples synthesized using different parameters were used as electrode for EDLC. Cyclic Voltammetry was used to measure the capacitance. Carbon synthesized from corn cobs pre-treated with 5% ZnCl2 using Co as catalyst pyrolyzed at 700°C for a dwell time of 120 min gave higher Specific capacitance of 270 F/g at scan rate of 5 mV/s. Moreover, this carbon, as observed under SEM, exhibited larger pore size. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.
