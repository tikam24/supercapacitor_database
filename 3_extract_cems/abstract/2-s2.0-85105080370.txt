This paper proposes a fractional order sliding mode approach for the converters of a DFIG-based wind energy system. It aims at mitigating grid faults and improving power reliability in the presence of uncertainties and sudden load variations. Its reliance on fractional calculus results in smoother control actions and reduced chattering compared to standard SMC. It also implements a super-capacitor as energy storage for its faster response compared to a conventional battery. The proposed approach was validated using a DFIG-based wind energy system installed in a small-scale standalone power supply network. Its performance was further compared to that of a standard PI approach. The obtained results showed significant improvement in the performance of the wind energy system during grid faults.
