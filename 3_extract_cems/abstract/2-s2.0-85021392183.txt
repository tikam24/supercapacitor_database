The ultrafine Co3O4 nanoparticles are successfully prepared by a novel solvothermal–precipitation approach which exploits the supernatant liquid of Co3O4 nanoflake micropheres synthesized by solvothermal method before. Interestingly, the water is only employed to obtain the ultrafine nanoparticles in supernatant liquid which was usually thrown away before. The microstructure measurement results of the as-grown samples present the homogeneous disperse ultrafine Co3O4 nanoparticles with the size of around 5–10 nm. The corresponding synthesis mechanism of the ultrafine Co3O4 nanoparticles is proposed. More importantly, these ultrafine Co3O4 nanoparticles obtained at 250 °C show the highest specific capacitance of 523.0 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, 2.6 times that of Co3O4 nanoflake micropheres due to the quantum size effect. Meanwhile, the sample annealed under 350 °C possesses the best cycling stability with capacitance retention of 104.9% after 1500 cycles. These results unambiguously demonstrate that this work not only provides a novel, facile, and eco-friendly approach to prepare high-performance Co3O4 nanoparticles electrode materials for supercapacitors but also develops a widely used method for the preparation of other materials on a large scale.
