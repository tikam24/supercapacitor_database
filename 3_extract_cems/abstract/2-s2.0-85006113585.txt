This paper describes the characterization of a three-dimensional (3D) reduced graphene oxide (RGO)-carbon nanotube (CNT)-polyaniline (PANI) hybrid fabricated by combining electrophoretic deposition (EPD) and floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition (FCCVD), followed by in-situ anodic electrochemical polymerization (AEP). Firstly, the RGO-CNT is prepared by combining EPD of GO onto nickel foams (NF) and then growth of uniformly aligned CNT on the surface of RGO via FCCVD. Secondly, the 3D RGO-CNT-PANI hybrid is successfully fabricated by in situ AEP of aniline monomers onto the surface of the RGO-CNT. The structures and morphologies of the hybrid have been characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS). Electrochemical properties are studied by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results reveal that the as-prepared hybrid based on the two-electrode system displays very high specific capacitance of 741 F g−1 with a high energy density of 92.4 Wh kg−1 and high power density of 6.3 kW kg−1 at the scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Additionally, the hybrid shows good cycling stability with a retention ratio of 95% after 5000 cycles. These attractive results suggest that this 3D RGO-CNT-PANI hybrid has a great potential as an electrode material for high performance supercapacitors.
