In this research, a thermally reduced graphene oxide/nickel (TrGO/Ni) nanocomposite was synthesized using a thermal-assisted method, and then it was coated on nickel foam (NF) as electrode material for supercapacitor. The internal and morphology of the nanocomposite were examined by X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and thermal gravimetrical investigation. It contains specific capacity of 154.3 C g−1 at 2 mV s−1 in 1 M KOH and 90.2% capacitance retention after 2,000 cycles, the TrGO/Ni nanocomposite demonstrates superior electrochemical performance. According to electrochemical impedance and cyclic voltammetry measurements, the homogenous structure of the TrGO/Ni nanocomposite on NF, the quick ion transport across the electrode–electrolyte interface, and the low resistance contribute to the improved electrochemical efficiency. This strategy can promote the development of hybrid nanostructures and their applications in high-performance reversible supercapacitors with low cost and easy preparation procedures.
