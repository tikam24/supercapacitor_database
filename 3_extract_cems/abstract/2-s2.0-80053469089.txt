Yttrium manganite (YMnO3), a novel kind of perovskite oxide, was synthesized by stearic acid sol-gel method using stearic acid, Y2O3, and Mn(NO3)2 as raw materials. Structure and morphology of YMnO3 were characterized using X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Results show that ultrafine YMnO3 particles were fabricated at 700°C within 8 h. Electrochemical performance of YMnO3 was investigated by constant current charge-discharge technique. The as-prepared YMnO3 electrode has excellent electrochemical performance, and the specific capacitance as a single electrode is up to 164.19 F/g in 6 mol/L KOH electrolyte solution. At 5 mA/g current density, different potentials were applied to obtain the optimum cell voltage from 0.1 V to 0.3 V. Under this condition, the supercapacitor exhibits good charge-discharge capacities and equivalent series resistance is only 1.0 Ω. After 50 charge-discharge cycles, specific capacitance of YMnO3 composite is reduced within 10%, indicating that YMnO3 composite has excellent and steady electrochemical performance and is a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.
