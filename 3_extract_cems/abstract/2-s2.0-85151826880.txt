Due to their promising properties such as low corrosion resistance, excellent strength, high-temperature operation, simple formability and machining, and, most importantly, cost-effectiveness in the industry, honeycomb-based heterostructures have been widely used as energy storage and conversion systems for decades. Despite their low density, honeycomb structures also have strong out-of-plane compression and shear properties, resulting in very high unique strengths. The honeycomb-based molded structure, which was inspired by bee honeycombs and provides a material with low density and high out-of-plane compression and shear properties, has found widespread use and now plays a critical role in energy conversion and storage technologies such as lithium-ion batteries, solar cells, and supercapacitors. These materials have a lot of promise in terms of addressing and environmental concerns regarding power sources at a time when global energy demand is skyrocketing. In light of this, we contend in this research paper that complex honeycomb-based architectures outperform conventional simple 2D designs in a wide variety of technological applications. We also go into the different synthetic methods used to make honeycomb structures and look at how these novel materials may be used for long-term electrochemical energy transfer and storage. Finally, the current challenges and opportunities for the construction of honeycomb systems are discussed, as well as new research directions.
