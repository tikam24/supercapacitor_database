Supercapacitors provide us with enormous power output for energy storage. Their energy output however still remains quite low compared to other energy storage materials like the batteries. This paper reports a highly stable liquid electrolyte which is composed of mixtures of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate(EMIBF4) ionic liquid with highly stable lithium bis(oxalate)borate LiBOB/acetonitrile(ACN). The electrolytes display remarkable supercapacitive performance at a high voltage of 3 V. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy shows that EMIBF4 helps to reduce the bulk resistance and charge transfer resistance across the electrode surfaces by facilitating high ionic diffusions across the electrode/electrolyte interface. The high stability and high ionic conductivity of the electrolytes reflected in the good cycling performance tests at 2.8 V with a maximum delivery capacitance of 19.5Fg-1 after 1000cycles at a high scan rate of 200 mVs-1.
