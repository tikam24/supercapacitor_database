Hierarchical MoS2/graphene (MoS2/G) has been widely researched in energy storage via supercapacitors. The combination of MoS2 with graphene not only provides high conductivity but also enhances the structural stability, which are critical factors determining the electrochemical performance for energy storage. In this review, the recent development of various hierarchical MoS2/G nanostructures in supercapacitor applications is summarized by classifying the materials into MoS2/G nanospheres, MoS2/G nanosheets, and MoS2/G-based ternary composite. The description of the structural characteristics and electrochemical performance gives a clear and profound understanding of hierarchical MoS2/G nanostructures as a supercapacitor material. In addition, further research prospects of hierarchical MoS2/G are suggested.
