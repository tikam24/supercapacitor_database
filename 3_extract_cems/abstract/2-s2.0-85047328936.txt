This work reports the successful preparation of Poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) from monomer ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT), employing hydrothermal method. The structure of the prepared sample was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the results indicates the successful polymerization of EDOT to the formation of polymer PEDOT. The capacitive performance of the prepared sample were investigated in two-electrode assembly using aqueous solution of 6 M KOH. The assembled capacitor cell shows high rate capability which is evident from both cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies. The observed CV patterns are almost rectangular even for high scan rates (∼30 V s-1), confirming the high rate performance, while high knee frequency (∼1 kHz), and low response time (∼5.8 ms) observed by impedance analysis confirms the high rate capability of supercapacitor.
