Construction of ternary metal sulfides with hollow nanostructures as energy storage materials is very promising yet challenging. Herein, we report a Mo-doped cobalt sulfide with a unique hollow nanocage structure (Mo-doped CoS HNC) by using ZIF-67 as a single sacrificial template through a dissolution-regrowth process in the presence of Na2MoO4 with an additional sulfurization process. The obtained Mo-doped CoS HNC exhibits an enhanced specific capacitance (781.0 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1) compared with the control CoS HNC (387.1 F g-1) and CoMoO4-Co(OH)2 HNC (285.1 F g-1). Furthermore, it also shows a superior rate capacity of 52.0% under a 20-fold increase of current density (10 A g-1). An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device assembled by using the Mo-doped CoS HNC as a positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as a negative electrode displays a high energy density of 27.7 W h kg-1 at a power density of 799.9 W kg-1 with excellent cycling stability, showing that 88.0% of the initial capacitance is maintained after 10000 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance arises from the unique ternary metal sulfide hollow nanocage structure having a large surface area, facile diffusion of ions, good conductivity, and rich redox reactions as well as the synergistic effect between Mo and Co ions.
