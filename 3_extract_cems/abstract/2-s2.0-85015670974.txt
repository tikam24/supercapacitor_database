A great deal of interest has been paid to the application of carbon-based nano- and microstructured materials as electrodes due to their relatively low-cost production, abundance, large surface area, high chemical stability, wide operating temperature range, and ease of processing including many more excellent features. The nanostructured carbon materials usually offer various micro-textures due to their varying degrees of graphitisation, a rich variety in terms of dimensionality as well as morphologies, extremely large surface accessibility and high electrical conductivity, etc. The possibilities of activating them by chemical and physical methods allow these materials to be produced with further higher surface area and controlled distribution of pores from nanoscale upto macroscopic dimensions, which actually play the most crucial role towards construction of the efficient electrode/electrolyte interfaces for capacitive processes in energy storage applications. Development of new carbon materials with extremely high surface areas could exhibit significant potential in this context and motivated by this in present work, we report for the first time the utilization of ultralight and extremely porous nano-microtubular Aerographite tetrapodal network as a functional interface to probe the electrochemical properties for capacitive energy storage. A simple and robust electrode fabrication strategy based on surface functionalized Aerographite with optimum porosity leads to significantly high specific capacitance (640 F/g) with high energy (14.2 Wh/kg) and power densities (9.67Ã—103 W/kg) which has been discussed in detail.
