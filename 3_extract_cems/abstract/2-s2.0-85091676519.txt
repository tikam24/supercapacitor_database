As a biomass waste of therapy and health care discarded with millions of tons per year in Chinese people's daily life, traditional Chinese medicine dregs (MDs) are potential "zero-cost", species-rich, and green raw materials for preparation of porous carbon (PC). Herein, multiheteroatoms (O, N, P, and S) self-codoped PCs are successfully prepared from MDs with their intrinsic metals as the selflate. The porosity can be controlled by purposefully mixing different types of MDs as feedstock. Under the optimum KOH activation, the as-prepared MDPC-2 exhibits a high specific surface area up to 2871 m2 g-1, rational mesopore proportion of 47.3%, and appropriate contents of heteroatoms, which endow it with a high specific capacitance up to 486.2 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 for a three-electrode system in a 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. Most attractively, the MDPC-2-based symmetric supercapacitors deliver an energy density as high as 37.2 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 558 W kg-1 in a 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte and a stronger energy output of 112.5 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 722 W kg-1 in an EMIMBF4 ionogel electrolyte, with satisfactory rate retentions (62.3% in 1 M Na2SO4 and 64.8% in EMIMBF4 ionogel at 20 A g-1), as well as prominent cycling durabilities (98.1% and 96.9% after 10,000 cycles). The state-of-the-art electrochemical performances of MDPC-2 to date are due to the comprehensive considerations for specific surface area, pore size distribution, heteroatom effect, and effective combination of different type of MDs, which provide a meaningful protocol on scalable preparation of advanced biomass-derived PC for supercapacitors.
