This work presents the effect of electron irradiation on the full symmetric cell using the pure polymer base AC material and irradiation on the full cell was analyzed for different exposure times. An improvement of the current response and ideal EDLC behaviour of the full device was also recorded with increased exposure to electron irradiation for up to 48 h. However, after the source of irradiation was removed, the original capacitance of the device was restored. This interesting phenomenon is a novel finding which is being reported for the first time. The recovery of the material after the radiation source terminated is based on the ability of the carbon-based nanostructured material to self-heal itself in a bid to return to its original form. These results suggest that radiation can improve supercapacitor performance permanently or temporary based on the radiation source.
