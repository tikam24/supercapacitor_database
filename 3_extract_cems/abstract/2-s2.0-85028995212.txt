In the present work, zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) was synthesized via chemical routes. For improving the electrochemical performance of the conductive polymer, POAP/ /ZIF-67 composite films were fabricated by POAP electropolymerization in the presence of ZIF-67 as active electrodes for electrochemical supercapacitors. The structural and the valance states of the prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Different electrochemical methods, including galvanostatic charge discharge experiments, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, have been applied to study the system performance. The supercapacitive behavior of the composite film was attributed to the (i) high active surface area of the composite, the (ii) charge transfer along the polymer chain due to the conjugation form of the polymer, and finally, the (iii) synergism effect between the conductive polymer and ZIF-67.
