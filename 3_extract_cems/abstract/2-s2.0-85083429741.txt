Transition metal oxides possess unique properties for energy storage devices. In this study, Co-Ni-Mn ternary metal oxide (Co-Ni-Mn-O) was synthesized in a facile way. Co-Ni alloy was first prepared by chemical reduction and then oxidized by potassium permanganate. MnO2 was thus covered on the Co-Ni oxides. The Co-Ni-Mn-O has high electrochemical activity and can be used for supercapacitor electrode. The Co-Ni-Mn-O demonstrates high specific capacitance as well as excellent rate capability and stability, which is promising for energy storage applications.
