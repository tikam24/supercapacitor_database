A flexible cathode with highly electrochemical performance for bendable supercapacitors have been achieved by electrochemical depositing hierarchical nanostructured Ni3S2/Ni(OH)2 compounds on the surface of commercial conductive textile. The morphology and physical properties of as-prepared electrode are investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Based on its unique nanostructure, the obtained flexible Ni3S2/Ni(OH)2 electrode exhibits a highly electrochemical capacitance of 1800 F g−1 at 3 mA cm−2 with good rate capability, excellent stability and bendability. Ni3S2/Ni(OH)2 electrode as cathode is assembled with active carbon as anode and PVA/KOH as electrolyte into an asymmetric capacitor to evaluate its performance in a real supercapacitor. The obtained supercapacitor cell delivers a high energy density of 0.49 mWh cm−2 at 3.54 mW cm−2 and maintains the energy density at 0.38 Wh cm−2 when power density increases to 21.53 mW cm−2. When the assembled cells are connected in series, these connected cells can work safely and properly at a much higher voltage window due to their good stability and consistency. Considering its low-cost, facile fabrication and highly electrochemical performance, the obtained Ni3S2/Ni(OH)2 electrode is a promising flexible material.
