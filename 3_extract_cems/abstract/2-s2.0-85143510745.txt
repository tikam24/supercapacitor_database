Polyimide (PI) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) blend electrospun fibers are prepared by electrospinning process. PI/PVC electrospun fibers exhibit a certain degree of phase separation due to the incomplete compatibility of PI and PVC in N, N’-dimethylformamide. PI/PVC based carbon nanofibers with opening tubular structure can be obtained via thermally induced phase separation. The effect of precursor composition on the morphology and pore structure of carbon nanofibers is investigated by theoretical calculation and structural analysis. The relationship between pore structure and electrochemical performance of carbon nanofibers is studied significantly. Opening tubular structure carbon nanofibers derived from PI: PVC (mass ratio = 1: 1) electrospun fibers show suitable average pore diameter (5.12 nm), high BET specific surface area (1127.1 m2∙g−1) and large total pore capacity (0.65 cm3∙g−1). And opening tubular structure carbon fibers as electrodes in ionic liquid electrolyte exhibits a wide electrochemical stability window (3.5 V), high energy density (30.1 Wh∙kg−1), good power density (2685.5 W∙kg−1) and low internal resistance (2.1 Ω).
