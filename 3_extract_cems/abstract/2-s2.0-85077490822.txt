An effective energy management strategy based on the mine-blast optimization (MBA) technique was proposed in this paper to optimally manage the energy in a hybrid power system. The hybrid system was composed of fuel cells, batteries, and supercapacitors. Such system was employed to supply highly fluctuated load. The results of the proposed strategy were compared with previously employed strategies such as fuzzy logic control (FLC), state machine control strategy (SMCS), and equivalent fuel consumption minimization strategy (ECMS). The comparison was carried out in terms of the hydrogen fuel economy and the overall efficiency as the key factors. The resulting responses of the proposed MBA-based management strategy indicate that its performance is the best among the other strategies of SMCS, FLC, and ECMS in both the hydrogen fuel economy and overall efficiency.
