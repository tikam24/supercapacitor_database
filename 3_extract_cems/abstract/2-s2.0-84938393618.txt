We present a facile sol-gel approach for the fabrication of In2O3/3DOM carbon nanocomposites for pseudocapacitor applications. By this facile chemical method, uniform In2O3 nanoparticles can be vertically grown on the surface of 3DOM carbon. The structure and morphology of the material is characterized by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen gas sorption, scanning electron microscope, and transmission electron microscope techniques. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are used to investigate the electrochemical performance of electrodes. An In2O3/3DOM carbon electrode with 10 wt.% shows a high specific capacitance of 287 F g-1, while the capacitance of In2O3 electrode alone is 58 F g-1. Furthermore, an In2O3/3DOM carbon nanocomposite pseudocapacitor shows a stable cycle life in the potential range of 0-0.5 V and retains 86% of its initial capacitance over 5000 cycles. The high specific capacitance and excellent cycle life are due to the three-dimensionally ordered pore structure of the carbon, which favors the diffusion of the electrolyte ions and provides a conductive scaffold.
