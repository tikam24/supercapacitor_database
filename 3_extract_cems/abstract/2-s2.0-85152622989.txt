Developing and fabricating effective, affordable electrode materials for supercapacitors is still a challenge. Electrical conductivity, a large surface area, dynamic faster electron transport, and other customizable qualities are present in metal oxide materials while being inexpensive to manufacture. In this work, successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method was employed for deposition of amorphous ruthenium oxide (RuO2) thin films of different thicknesses on a stainless steel substrate. At 1.56 mg cm−2 thickness amorphous RuO2 achieved a maximum specific capacitance (Cs) of 1146 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 with 87% capacitance retention up to 5000 cycles. These findings bolster the idea of cost effective deposition of amorphous RuO2 material for supercapacitor applications.
