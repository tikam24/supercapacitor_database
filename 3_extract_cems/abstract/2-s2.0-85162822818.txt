To overcome the low-energy-density limitation of supercapacitors, we aimed to achieve a material with a high specific capacitance by manipulating the nanostructure of FeS2, which comprises the most abundant and affordable elements. In this study, nanosheet-assembled FeS2 (NSA-FeS2) was fabricated using a novel method. Sub-micron droplets of sulfur particles stabilized with polyvinylpyrrolidone were formed in silicone oil medium, and Fe(CO)5 was absorbed and reacted on the surface to form core-shell particles, ES/[Fe], with a sulfur core and an iron-containing outer shell. The high temperature treatment of ES/[Fe] produced NSA-FeS2, in which pyrite FeS2 nanosheets grew and were partially interconnected. In a three-electrode system, the as-prepared NSA-FeS2 and NSA-FeS2/polyaniline (PANI) composites exhibited specific capacitances of 763 and 976 Fg-1, respectively, at a current density of 0.5 Ag-1, with corresponding capacitance retentions of 93 and 96% after 3000 charge-discharge cycles. The capacitance retention of the NSA-FeS2/PANI composites was 49% when the current density was increased from 0.5 to 5 Ag-1. Notably, the obtained specific capacitances exhibited the highest values in pure FeS2 and FeS2-based composites, indicating the significant potential for the utilization of iron sulfide in pseudocapacitive electrode materials.
