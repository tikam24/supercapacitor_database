The pseudocapacitive effects originating from the alkali metal iodide/carbon interface have been studied in aqueous medium. Five different solutions, i.e., lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium and caesium iodides (1 mol L- 1) have been tested as electrolyte in supercapacitors. The capacitance of positive electrodes operating in these solutions reached values higher than 1000 F g- 1, depending strongly on the alkali metal ion. Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
