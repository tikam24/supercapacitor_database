Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) based carbon nanofiber (CNF) papers have unique physicochemical properties including flexibility, good electrical conductivities, and excellent mechanical properties for supercapacitor electrodes. However, their surface-to-weight ratios and density of active sites on the surface are much poorer than those of other active carbons. Herein, a simple, renewable, multifunctional, and effective way is described to fabricate three-dimensional (3D) heteroatom-enriched porous PAN-based CNF papers by adding a moderate amount of microalgae-derived oil that has a large fraction of light compounds and nitrogen- and oxygen-containing functional components. CNF papers with enhanced porosity and large specific surface area, unique pore structure, and 3D heteroatom-enriched surfaces were successfully fabricated by stabilization and carbonization of PAN nanofibers with the algae oil. The as-fabricated algal-30% CNF paper is scalable and highly flexible as a free-standing supercapacitor electrode material and can deliver a specific capacitance of 272 F/g under a scan rate of 10 mV/s with noticeably high charge-discharge cycling stability, with 94% retained even after 10,000 cycles. The fabrication mechanism and the enhancement of the electrochemical behaviors of three-dimensional, heteroatom-enriched, porous CNF papers are proposed. Our work underlines the promise of algae oil-modified PAN-based CNF papers for high-capacity supercapacitor electrode materials.
