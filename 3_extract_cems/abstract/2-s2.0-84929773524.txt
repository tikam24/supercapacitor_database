Ultracapacitors are popular as an energy storage device for the light rail regenerative power system. However, the control of the DC/DC converter is a challenging problem to meet the fast charging/discharging of ultracapacitors. In this paper, a precise discrete-time converter model and an explicit model predictive control scheme is proposed to address this issue. A converter model is presented by using a Î½-resolution method, which can capture the hybrid nature of the ultracapacitors in the form of piecewise affine. Based on this model, an optimal control problem with the constraints of the duty cycle and the system parameters is formulated. Then the control law is calculated by using multi-parameter programming. The resulting explicit solution can be easily stored and utilized in a lookup table. The proposed scheme can reduce the amount of on-line calculation and achieve the real-time control of the system. Simulation and experiment validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
