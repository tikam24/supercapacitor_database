The need to reduce CO2 emissions leads the field of research to find the most suitable solutions to combat this phenomenon. The main solution is represented by the replacement of internal combustion engine vehicles with electric ones unitedly to the realization of microgrids for the urban vehicles charging. In this paper, the energy demand of a node of the proposed Urban Charging Infrastructure (UCI) is estimated through the determination of pre-defined shuttle bus loop routes. In addition, a criterion for the sizing of Supercapacitors (SCs) bank used as on-board storage is provided. Finally, simulation and experimental results are compared.
