In this work, mesoporous NiCo2O4 nanoneedle arrays grown on a nickel foam substrate are fabricated by a facile hydrothermal route. The as-synthesized NiCo2O4 products as binder-free electrodes for supercapacitors show a superior discharge areal capacity of 0.998 C cm-2 at a current density of 2 mA cm-2, excellent rate performance (60.25% retention with current density increasing from 2 mA cm-2 to 200 mA cm-2) and outstanding cycling stability (about 19.3% loss after 12000 cycles at a current density of 20 mA cm-2). An assembled supercapacitor using a NiCo2O4 electrode as the positive electrode delivers a volumetric energy density of 0.33 mW h cm-3 at a volumetric power density of 12 mW h cm-3 and still achieves 63.6% retention with the volumetric power density increasing to 120 mW h cm-3. Surprisingly, 140.6% capacity retention is attained after 8000 cycles at 10 mA cm-2.
