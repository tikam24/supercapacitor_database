MnO nanonetwork decorated few layered graphene (FLG) composite was prepared using a completely solid state process and when tested as an electrode material in an aqueous supercapacitor it delivered an excellent specific capacitance (SC) of 778.5 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g and retained 93% of the SC even after 1000 charge-discharge cycles. Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) studies showed that the SC of the composite is the resultant of the combined electric double layer capacitance of FLG and pseudo-capacitance of MnO. The negligible change in the nature of CV curves recorded at different scan rates showed that the composite is electrochemically stable. Also, the high discharge capacitance is explained in terms of composite's porosity, which shortens the cation path into the electrode matrix.
