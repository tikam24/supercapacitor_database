It is of great significance to design electrochemical energy conversion and storage materials with excellent performance to fulfill the growing energy demand. Bimetallic cobalt/nickel-based electrode materials exhibit excellent electrical conductivity compared to mono oxides. However, their potential as electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors (SCs) is limited because of their poor cycling stability and high-capacity fading. This work demonstrates the synthesis of binder-free bimetallic NiCo2O4 nano-needles supported on CC (NCO@CC) via a facile and scalable hydrothermal process. Excellent electrical conductivity and interconnected nanostructure of NCO@CC nanoneedles provide the fast transfer of electrons with numerous channels for ion diffusion. Owing to such features, the binder-free NCO@CC electrode for SC discloses excellent specific capacitance (1476 Fg−1 at 1.5 Ag−1 ) with 94.25% capacitance retention even after 5000 cycles. From these outstanding electrochemical performances, it can be inferred that NCO@CC nano-needle array-structured electrodes may be potential candidates for SC applications.
