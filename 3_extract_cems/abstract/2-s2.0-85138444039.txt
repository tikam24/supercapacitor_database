The need to optimize the performance of energy storage systems has driven the search for new materials showing inherent properties that are favorable in enhancing energy and power outputs. Recently, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising materials because of their desirable features that include rich redox metal centers, rapid ion transport, ultrahigh and tunable porosity, and large surface areas that offer maximized electroactive sites. The electrochemical performance of MOFs depends on their architecture (0D–3D) and morphology (micro- or nanostructure), which are determined by the design and synthesis of these electrode materials. The highlight of this review is to demonstrate the outstanding findings from the literature on the use of MOFs as robust electrode materials with distinct charge storage behavior in supercapacitor applications.
