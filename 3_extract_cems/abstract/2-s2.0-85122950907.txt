Amorphous zeolitic imidazolate framework (aZIF) materials were used for N-doped porous carbon material (NPC-1000) by thermolysis process and the KOH activation process was used to obtain high surface area (APC-750). Symmetric supercapacitor devices were assembled with NPC-1000 and APC-750 as electrodes. The capacitance of the devices exhibited good specific capacitance 30.3 and 63.3 F/g, 1 V, respectively, and very high cycling performance (4000 continuous charge-discharge) with 0.13 capacitive fade. Due to the need for portable and wearable electronics in daily life, flexible or wearable energy storage devices have become the focus of attention in recent years. To demonstrate the practical application of the symmetric supercapacitors, the electrochemical properties of APC-750 were investigated and it was used for the assembling of a flexible wristband. The angle dependence of the capacity of a flexible wristband was analyzed and it is found that the best capacity was obtained for the angel of 180Â°. The results showed that activated porous carbon material (APC-750) synthesized from aZIF has a high potential for supercapacitor applications when compared the NPC-1000 in this study.
