Spherical cupric oxide (CuO) was grown on copper (Cu) foil by a facile, low-temperature chemical bath deposition (CBD) under alkaline conditions. This method enables direct contact between the active materials and the cathode which is advantageous for attaining higher capacitance. The Cu products were spherical in shape and have a uniform morphology due to self-assembly and Ostwald ripening. The fabricated CuO exhibit a specific capacitance in the range of 700â€“800 F/cm2.
