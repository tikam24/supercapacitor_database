Superstructures have attracted extensive attention because of their potential applications in materials science and biology. Herein, we fabricate the first centimeter-sized porous superstructure of carbon nanosheets (SCNS) by using metal–organic framework nanoparticles as a template and polyvinylpyrrolidone as an additional carbon source. The SCNS shows a honeycomb-like morphology with wall-sharing carbon cages, in each cavity of which a porous carbon sphere is encapsulated. A single piece of SCNS is directly used as the electrode for a two-electrode symmetrical supercapacitor cell without any binders and supports, benefiting from its advantage in ultra-large geometric size, and the Fe-immobilized SCNS exhibits excellent catalytic performances for oxygen reduction reaction and in a Zn–air battery. This synthetic strategy presents a facile approach for preparing functional SCNS at centimetric scale with controllable morphologies and compositions favoring the fabrication of energy devices.
