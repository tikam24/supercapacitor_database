Energy storage hybridization in electric vehicle drive is important as currently there is no single energy storage device which able to fully satisfy the power requirement of the drive operation. Electrical drive operation of electric vehicle requires a high energy storage device to achieve a longer distance, as well as high power capability for better acceleration and regenerative braking performance. Battery has long been used as a primary energy source in such application due to its high energy capacity but lack in term of providing high power during transient operation. Meanwhile, the supercapacitor is among the best storage device available in term of ability to disburse high power in short period and has a potential to be used with battery to complement the latterâ€™s disadvantage. The paper investigates on a newly proposed method of energy storage hybridization for quasi-Z-source inverter applied in induction motor drive. Objective of the work is to mitigate the current stress on the battery by combining it with supercapacitor to form a hybrid energy storage based on the integration of bidirectional DC/DC converter to the inverter. A 5kW induction motor drive system is designed, modelled and simulated with MATLAB/Simulink environment to evaluate the performance of the field-oriented control of the drive system of the induction motor and the newly proposed method of the hybrid energy storage system during the acceleration/regenerative braking. The results verify the benefit of the new method which effectively reducing the current stress of the battery up to approximately 50% during acceleration and regenerative braking with satisfactory performance of the speed and torque control of the motor.
