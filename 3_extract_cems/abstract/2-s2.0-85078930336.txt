The controllable construction of two-dimensional (2D) metal–organic framework (MOF) nanosheets with favorable electrochemical performances is greatly challenging for energy storage. Here, we design an in situ induced growth strategy to construct the ultrathin carboxylated carbon nanotubes (C-CNTs) interpenetrated nickel MOF (Ni-MOF/C-CNTs) nanosheets. The deliberate thickness and specific surface area of novel 2D hybrid nanosheets can be effectively tuned via finely controlling C-CNTs involvement. Due to the unique microstructure, the integrated 2D hybrid nanosheets are endowed with plentiful electroactive sites to promote the electrochemical performances greatly. The prepared Ni-MOF/C-CNTs nanosheets exhibit superior specific capacity of 680 C g−1 at 1 A g−1 and good capacity retention. The assembled hybrid device demonstrated the maximum energy density of 44.4 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 440 W kg−1. Our novel strategy to construct ultrathin 2D MOF with unique properties can be extended to synthesize various MOF-based functional materials for diverse applications.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]
