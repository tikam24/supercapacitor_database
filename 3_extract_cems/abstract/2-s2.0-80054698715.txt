MnO2-CNTs (carbon nanotubes)composite material was successfully synthesized by depositing MnO2 nanoparticle onto the surface of CNTs with chemical coprecipitation method.This composite material was characterized by XRD and SEM.The electrochemical properties of MnO2-CNTs composite material were investigated using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge.The results showed that MnO2-CNTs composite material combines the higher specific capacitance of MnO2 and the electrochemical stability of CNTs.The specific capacitance of MnO2-CNTs electrode reaches 220F/g.And a MnO2-CNTs/AC (active carbon)asymmetrical supercapacitor was assembled.It was found that, when the mass ratio of positive electrode and negative electrode was 0.75:1, the specific capacitance of the asymmetrical supercapacitor achieved the highest value of 306 F/g which was larger than that of the symmetric supercapacitor, and the asymmetrical supercapacitor has good electrochemical stability.
