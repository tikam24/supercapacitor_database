A flexible integrated supercapacitor based on three dimensional reduced graphene oxide/graphene oxide/reduced graphene oxide (RGO-GO-RGO) foam has been fabricated via a laser direct writing strategy. The supercapacitor with outstanding mechanical properties shows a high capacitance performance which can be easily regulated by controlling the compressive state of the electrodes. This work provides a new platform for potential applications in the next-generation intelligent power supply of electronics.
