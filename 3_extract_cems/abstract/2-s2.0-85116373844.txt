Graphene is a true 21st century material, and has the potential to enable revolutionary products based on its mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, transparency and other properties based on manipulation of the physics and chemistry of a sheet of carbon atoms just one layer thick. 'Nanographene' (nanoscale graphene flakes) is positioned to challenge conventional materials as well as carbon fibers and carbon nanotubes for future applications in flexible electronics, composites and energy storage due to its properties and potential manufacturing cost advantages. The uses for graphene are endless, and energy applications seem well suited to accept the physical and chemical advantages, the graphene has to offer. This article discusses the recent activity of nanographene, and how the energy landscape can accommodate this new material that is rife with potential to disrupt the status quo.
