A hydrogel electrolyte was developed, in which polyacrylamide (PAAm) chains were cross-linked to form network structure, soybean protein (SPI) nanoparticles were coagulated around the polymer chains, and phosphoric acid (H3PO4) was incorporated by displacement. The synergistic effect of SPI nanoparticles and PAAm chains makes that the hydrogel electrolyte could maintain structural integrity even after 100 compression cycles at 80% strain; a symmetric all-solid-state supercapacitor was then assembled by using the hydrogel electrolyte as solid electrolyte and two identical polypyrrole-carbon nanotubes papers (PPy-CNTs) as electrode. The assembled supercapacitor possesses excellent electrochemical performance, delivering the maximum energy density of 6.2 Wâ€¢h/kg and the maximal power density of 398.4 W/kg, which places in the region of standard supercapacitors. More importantly, the device could endure 80% compression strain without fracture or damage, and remain the high capacitance retention, showing a good capacitive stability.
