Firmly anchored Au nanoparticles onto well-defined architecture of aligned TiO2 nanotube grown on Titanium substrate leads to the improved pseudocapacitive electrochemical performance in aqueous electrolyte. The electrode architecture of Au anchored TiO2 nanotubes have been grown through anodization and thermal annealing approach. Cyclic voltammetry, charge–discharge and electrochemical impedance performed through three electrode configuration proven that the coating of Au nanoparticles onto TiO2 remarkably enhance the supercapacitive performance compared to bare one. The remarkable specific capacitance of 876 Fg−1 at 5 mVs−1 scan rate in 1 M LiClO4 electrolyte for the gold nanoparticles anchored TiO2 composite electrode.
