Transition metal nitrides and carbonitride materials were fabricated via sol-gel technology. The transition metal amides were sythesized by two methods: chemical route and electrolysis. The transition metal amides were then further polymerized, sintering to high temperature in an inert or reduced atmosphere. Transition metal nitrides and carbonitrides powders with surface area up to 160 rcf/g were obtained. The resultant electrode material showed high specific capacitance as crystalline ruthenium oxide.
