This paper proposes a control algorithm for a hybrid power electronic AC/DC converter for prosumer applications operating under deep phase current asymmetry. The proposed system allows independent control of active and reactive power for each phase of the power converter without current pulsation on the DC link connected to an energy store. The system and its algorithm are based on a three‐phase converter in four‐wire topology (AC/DC 3p‐4w) with two dual‐active bridge (DC/DC) converters, interfaced with a supercapacitor and an energy storage. The control algorithm tests were carried out in a Hardware in the Loop environment. Obtained results indicate that operation with deep unbalances and powers of opposite signs in individual phases leads to current oscillations in the DC link. This phenomenon significantly limits energy storage utilization due to safety and durability reasons. The proposed algorithm significantly reduces the level of pulsation in the DC link which increases safety and reduces strain on lithium‐ion storage technology, enabling their application in four‐wire converter applications.
