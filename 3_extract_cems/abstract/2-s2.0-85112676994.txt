Employing a one-step, less arduous and economical novel strategy, mixed Ni-Co hydroxide [Ni0.33Co0.67(OH)2(NCH) and Co0.33Ni0.67(OH)2(CNH)] floating films synthesized on the surface of a precursor solution, have been successfully transported onto a glass substrate. The as-formed NCH and CNH films yielded optical band gaps of 2.39 eV and 2.19 eV, respectively, confirming their semiconducting nature. The hierarchical porosity with pore size ranging predominantly up to 150 nm, a rarely seen feature inside the nanomaterials, has been observed. The interwoven and cross-linked 3D-nanostructures have made fascinating current channels for transporting the current carriers inside the films. The as-formed NCH and CNH films have also shown a high percentage of overall surface porosity of about 31.9% and 29.03%, respectively.
