Researchers demonstrate how highly conducting spaced TiO2 nanotubes enable defined conformal coating with nanocrystalline Nb2O5 and high performance supercapacitor applications. They grow spaced (SP) TiO2 nanotubes (NTs) by electrochemical anodization of a titanium foil in a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) electrolyte and then coat the nanotubes conformally with Nb2O5 to build this hierarchical structure. The researchers use a high temperature NH3 treatment that converts the oxides to highly conducting nitrides to overcome the intrinsic low electrical conductivity of TiO2.
