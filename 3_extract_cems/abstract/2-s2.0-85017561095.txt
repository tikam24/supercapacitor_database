A flourine doped carbon materials encapsulated MnO nano-particle was synthesized through a self-assembly method. The MnO nano-crystal covered with a thin layer of graphite were achieved. This hybrid MnO/carbon materials were employed as negative electrode in a new lithium ion hybrid supercapacitor, while the electrochemical double-layer porous carbon served as positive electrode. The electrochemical performances of this hybrid device were investigated and exhibited relative high capacity upto 40 mAh g −1 in an applied current of 200 mAh g −1 , good rate performance as well as superior cycling stability.
