Recent studies have shown that the grid connection of offshore wind farms through modular multilevel converter-high voltage direct current (MMC-HVdc) transmission system has brought low inertia issue. It is an urgent requirement for offshore wind farms to compensate for the inertia. After analysis and evaluation in this article, it is found that integrating an ultracapacitor energy storage system (UESS) into an MMC has an advantage comprehensively considering cost, size, and dynamic. Based on the evaluation, this article proposes an approach to inertial compensation of HVdc offshore wind farms by MMC-UESS integration. An ultracapacitor is selected as an energy storage element (ESE) for its high power density since the inertial response is a short-term response and it is hoped that added ESE does not significantly increase the size of an MMC submodule. Batteries with high energy density but low power density are not suitable for such applications. The optimal operating voltage of a UESS and the control scheme between MMC loops and inertial emulation are proposed in this article. Experimental results from real-time simulation and a downscaled prototype are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.
