Nanopolyaniline coated graphene (GNP) was synthesized and flexible composite paper based on as-prepared GNP composite was fabricated by rolling process. Uniform PANI nanocoating prevents the graphene sheets from re-stacking during paper fabrication under high pressure. The composite paper was directly used as the supercapacitor without adding any binder and a specific capacitance of 255 F g-1 was achieved with high rate retention.
