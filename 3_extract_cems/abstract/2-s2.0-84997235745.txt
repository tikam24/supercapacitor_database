Due to the randomness and intermittent characteristics of wind energy resources, it has a great impact on the issues like voltage, frequency, system reliability and so on by wind power paralleling in the grid directly. The novel control scheme of synchronous compensator static (STATCOM) with hybrid energy storage system (HESS) is proposed in this paper. The combination of positive-and negative-sequence independent control and harmonic feed-forward compensation control is used for STATCOM control to mitigate the voltage fluctuation, while the double-loop control is adopted for a parallel type of hybrid energy storage system based on supercapacitor and LiFePO4 lithium battery, in order to balance the fluctuating wind power. So the power quality can be improved effectively. Simulation results show that the STATCOM/HESS not only significantly reduces the voltage fluctuations, but also makes the power injected grid more smooth.
