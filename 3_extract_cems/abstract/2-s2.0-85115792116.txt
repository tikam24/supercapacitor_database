The present work addresses the modelling, control, and simulation of a microgrid integrated wind power system with Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) using a hybrid energy storage system. In order to improve the quality of the waveforms (voltages and currents) supplied to the grid, instead of a two level-inverter, the rotor of the DFIG is supplied using a three-level inverter. A new adaptive algorithm based on combined Direct Reactive Power Control (DRPC) and fuzzy logic controls techniques is applied to the proposed topology. In this work, two topologies are proposed. In the first one, the active power injected into the grid is smoothened by using an economical hybrid battery and supercapacitor energy storage system. However, in the second one, the excess wind energy is used to produce and store the hydrogen, and then a solid oxide fuel cell system (SOFC) is utilized to regenerate electricity by using the stored hydrogen when there is not enough wind energy. To avoid overcharging, deep discharging of batteries, to mitigate fluctuations due to wind speed variations, and to fulfil the requirement of the load profile, a power management algorithm is implemented. This algorithm ensures smooth output power in the first topology and service continuity in the second. The modelling and simulation results are presented and analysed using Matlab/Simulink.
