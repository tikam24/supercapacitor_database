We present the in situ oxidative synthesis and electrochemistry of novel pseudo-capacitive nanostructured composite electrode material based on multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT), manganese dioxide (MnO2) and polyaniline (PANI), namely, MWCNT-COOH/MnO2/PANI (PCNAM) for high performance supercapacitor applications. The composite shows about six-fold improvement of electrochemical response compared to MWCNT. The maximum specific capacitance, energy density, and power density of PCNAM were 517.13 ± 15.25 F/g, 71.88 ± 2.12 W h/kg and 10.08 ± 0.26 kW/kg, respectively. The high capacitance of the composite is due to the combination of the electrical double layer capacitance of MWCNT (in MWCNT-COOH) and the gradual introduction of pseudo-capacitance through the redox processes of PANI, -COOH (in MWCNT-COOH) and MnO2. We have also demonstrated the charge transfer phenomena through non-covalent supramolecular interactions (i.e., π-π, n-π, and metal-π) between the components of PANI, MWCNT-COOH, and MnO2 due to the presence of double bonds, availability of lone pair electrons, free charges on nitrogen/oxygen atoms, and vacant metal d orbitals. The existence of such non-covalent interaction was supported by data from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis.
