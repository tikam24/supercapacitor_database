Supercapacitors are promising energy storage devices that bridge the vent between batteries and conventional capacitors due to their outstanding properties. Their manufacture generally relies on the slurry casting process that aims to deposit onto a selected substrate the slurry which resulted from a mixture of active material, conductive additive, and binder into the solvent. N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) is the commonly used solvent for this purpose even though its toxicity has been reported. Studies have recently investigated the feasibility of using Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) as a safe binder solvent instead of NMP. The majority of those studies proved that NMP can be replaced by DMSO. This current work has studied and compared for the first time the effects of NMP and DMSO on the electrochemical performance of layered double hydroxides (LDH). The careful electrochemical analysis confirmed that DMSO could replace NMP. More importantly, the study revealed that DMSO improves the electrochemical properties of LDH. The specific capacitance recorded for the electrode made using DMSO was 234.3 F g−1 1 A g−1 whereas the electrode made using NMP exhibited 160.7 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. The internal resistance values were 1.5 Ω for DMSO and 2 Ω for NMP. Nevertheless, both electrodes have retained 100% of their capacitance after 2000 cycles at 5 A g−1. In addition, this study showed that the electrode fabrication stage can also be targeted to further optimize the electrochemical performance of LDH.
