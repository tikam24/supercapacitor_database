Biomass had been extensively explored and applied in many fields due to their abundance, attractive structure, low cost, renewability, and environmental friendliness. Cottonseed meal (CM), one of the by-products of cotton, consisted of much crude protein, fiber, and inorganic ions, was a potential carbon precursor. In this work, CM was used to prepare N, S, and O self-doped carbon materials by two steps (hydrothermal pre-carbonization and K2CO3 carbonization–activation) processes. The optimized material displayed high capacitive performance, which benefited from the large surface area (2361 m2/g), hierarchical porous structure and rich multi-heteroatoms doping of the prepared porous carbon. What's more, we prepared a new-type K2CO3-based deep eutectic solvent (DES) electrolyte. The assembled symmetric device using DES electrolyte displayed a superior energy density (34.4 Wh/kg) at room temperature. Furthermore, the energy density could reach 36.5 Wh/kg when the temperature rose to 50 °C. Even under extreme conditions, the device delivered a not particularly bad energy density (11.8 Wh/kg at −25 °C and 8.6 Wh/kg at 105 °C). This study provided an efficient and simple method to prepare CM-based heteroatoms self-doped porous carbon materials and uncovered a new possibility for the exploitation of carbon-based supercapacitors with high energy density.
