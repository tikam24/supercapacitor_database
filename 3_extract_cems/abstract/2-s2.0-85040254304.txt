A nitrogen-enriched active carbon fiber/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite was synthesized by electrospinning, calcination, self-assembled reduction, and post treatment nitrogen doping. The nitrogen content and C/O ratio of nitrogen-enriched active carbon fiber/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite was up to 12 at.% and 28 after post process N-doping, respectively. High specific capacitance of 208 F g−1 at 20 A g−1 and excellent rate performance was shown in 6 mol L−1 KOH. Meanwhile, a specific capacitance of 212 F g−1 was obtained at 3 A g−1 and along with 99% capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles for quasi solid state supercapacitors. The excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to unique line-plane structure between the one dimensional active carbon fiber and the two dimensional reduced graphene oxide, and incorporation of nitrogen functional groups.
