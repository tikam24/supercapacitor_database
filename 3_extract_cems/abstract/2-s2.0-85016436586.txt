A facile method has been developed to grow MnO2 nanoparticles on hybrid carbon nanofibers (MnO2/HCNFs) for flexible supercapacitors (SCs). The hybrid carbon nanofibers (HCNFs) could be serviced as a buffer layer to improve the conductivity of MnO2 and enhance the interface contact between MnO2 and carbon nanofibers. The flexible SCs based on MnO2/HCNFs hybrid structure exhibited good electrochemical performance, extraordinary flexibility and superior cycle lifetime. Specific capacitance of the flexible SCs was 803.6 mAh g−1 at the scan rate of 20 mV s−1. Maximum specific energy (power) density was 20.1 Wh/kg (230.4 W/kg).
