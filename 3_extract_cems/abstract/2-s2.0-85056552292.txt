Hybrid energy storage systems that combine the high density power of the supercapacitors with the high energy density of the Li-ion batteries have been substantially researched, with great interest. This manuscript proposes a new power management strategy implemented using the Rule based controller which considers the state of charge of the Li-ion batteries (SOC). The Li-ion batteries are used to provide a steady and constant power, function of the state of charge (SOC), enabling a higher efficiency and extending batteries lifespan. A typical standalone PV application is used to demonstrate and validate the performance of the proposed power management strategy.
