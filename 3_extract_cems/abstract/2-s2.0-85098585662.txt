Electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) has seen widespread applications in energy storage for smooth operation of power systems. However, successful integration of EDLC into energy internet requires comprehensive understanding of its electrical response under various operation conditions. This work employs molecular dynamic simulations to study the physical mechanism behind the short-Term memory effect reported in discharging process of EDLC. The physical meaning of constant phase element for EDLC is also revealed with equivalent circuit of transmission line model of resistors and capacitors.
