This design is aimed at the research of super capacitor module charging. It adopts wireless charging mode and electromagnetic induction principle to transmit electric energy through coil magnetic coupling resonance and DC-DC step-down circuit. At the same time, the single-chip microcomputer is used for real-time monitoring of its charging process. After one key self-starting, the detected voltage and current signals are processed by PID algorithm, and the constant power charging function is automatically controlled. According to the final test results, it can be concluded that the system will eventually become stable, and the charging power will be locked in the preset power. To achieve the constant power charging function. The system realizes the function of constant power charging.
