This paper intends to present a DC-coupled hybrid microgrid, including proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), battery bank, and supercapacitor, which is suitable for applications such as distributed power generation and the power system of vessels. In the proposed configuration, the PEMFC serves as the main energy source, and supercapacitor and battery bank are as energy storage systems. A comprehensive model of the 6 kW PEMFC, including the dynamic model along with the electrical model, is presented. Three DC-DC converters, consisting of an inter-leaved boost with voltage multiplier converter (IBVM) connected to the fuel cell and two bi-directional converters connected to the storage devices are employed. Additionally, an AC-DC converter is utilized to ensure stable AC voltage supply, proper power flow, and DC-link voltage control. Moreover, this paper provides a two-level power management strategy (PMS) to control and optimally distribute power between the components of the hybrid microgrid. The proposed strategy is divided into device-level and system-level controls. At the device-level control, a decentral-ized model predictive control strategy (MPC) without using any proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers is proposed to control the different modules of the hybrid microgrid. Also, at the system-level control, a rule-based strategy is developed to optimally distribute power between power sources and ensure stable operation under different operation modes. The simulation results in Matlab/Simulink environment are given to verify the effectiveness of the PEMFC model, the chosen converters, the proposed control methods, and the proposed hybrid microgrid.
