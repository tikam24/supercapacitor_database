The introduction of novel materials into industrial demonstrators is an essential step in developing unique commercial energy storage devices. However, this step is rarely considered in literature. In this study, we report on the introduction of innovative materials for high energy density electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), namely the carbide-derived carbon (CDC) “Curved Graphene” with a specific and an aerial capacitance of 114 F g−1 and 82 F cm−3, polysaccharide binders, and electrolyte based on acetonitrile (ACN) and pyrrolidinium-based salt, into a demonstrator. We show that by utilizing this innovative cell chemistry it is possible to realize an industrial demonstrator exhibiting a nominal capacitance of 5000 F, with a specific energy and energy density of up to 8.4 Wh kg−1 and 12.2 Wh L−1 as well as a remarkable lifetime with a capacitance retention of 77% after floating for almost 1400 h at 2.85 V and 65 °C. These results prove that the novel materials considered in this work can indeed be utilized for the realization of commercially available devices with improved cell performance with respect to the state-of-the-art.
