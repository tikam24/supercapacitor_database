Representative supercapacitor electrode materials: activated carbon for an electrochemical double layer capacitor, MgCo2O4 showing redox, i.e. non-pseudocapacitive, and MnO2 showing pseudocapacitive behavior have been examined and compared regarding mass utilization as a function of active layer thickness, i.e. mass loading, of rate of electrode potential change and current density. Conclusions regarding degree of utilization and rational design of active material layer thickness are highlighted, suggestions for suitable reporting of data for rational comparison of results are offered.
