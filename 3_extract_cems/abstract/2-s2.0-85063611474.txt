In the present study, the polypyrrole (PPy) composites with nano-structured CoO x , NiO x , MnO x , and FeO x were synthesized using the galvanostatic method on their own metal-intercalated graphite surfaces. The deposition and intercalation are performed in TBABF 4 /acetonitrile solution with related metal (II) tetrafluoroborate salts, pyrrole, HBF 4 , H 2 O, Triton-X 100 (TX100) and carboxymethyl cellulose (Na-CMC). For the PPy/MnO x /Na-CMC composite, the effects of intercalation and additives on the specific capacitance were examined in an H 2 SO 4 /water medium by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). Using the optimum deposition conditions determined for Mn composite (additive concentrations and galvanostatic parameters), PPy/CoO x /Na-CMC, PPy/NiO x /Na-CMC, and PPy/FeO x /Na-CMC coatings with a mass loading of 4.0 mg cm −2 were deposited on their own metal-intercalated graphite electrodes in the deposition solutions containing Co(BF 4 ) 2 , Ni(BF 4 ) 2 and Fe(BF 4 ) 2 , respectively. XRD, TEM, XPS, SEM-EDX, BET, and EIS techniques were used in characterizing the coatings. Subsequently, the capacitive properties of the composite coatings were examined by means of the galvanostatic charge-discharge test. The highest SC value is recorded for the Mn-based composite (463 F g −1 ), whereas the lowest is for Fe-based (311 F g −1 ) one. Finally, symmetric and asymmetric supercapacitor configurations incorporating two electrodes with 10 mg cm −2 active material were used in making measurements to determine the capacitive behaviors of PPy/Metal oxide composites. The symmetric supercapacitor with PPy/MnO x /Na-CMC composite providing 0.29 kW kg −1 and 15.0 Wh.kg −1 at 0.5 A g −1 maintains 62% of its power and energy densities at 2.5 A g −1 at the end of 5000 cycles at a potential range of 0.8 V.
