Term and concept of a new branch of science and technology, namely, “nanoionics”, were formulated in IMT RAS (1991-1992). It was the article "A step towards nanoionics". New area R&D devotes to nanoscale fundamentals of fast ionic transport (FIT) in solid-state materials, as well as to methods for design of FIT-nanomaterials, for description of local FIT-space-temporal processes, for creation of devices with FIT on a nanoscale ("nanoionic devices"), etc. Main achievements of IMT RAS in nanoionics are: (1) new optically-active nano-physical-chemical systems Ag(Cu)Hal -M, created in high vacuum (M are rare-earth/transition metals); (2) new classification of solid-state ionic conductors (it distinguishes for the first time a new class of solid state conductors - “advanced superionic conductors“, i.e., materials whose crystal structures are closely to optimum for FIT); (3) new scientific direction "nanoionics of advanced superionic conductors"; (4) a crystal-engineering of heteroboundaries in FIT-materials and an invention of supercapacitors with coherent polarized heterojunction and record-high frequency-capacitance characteristics ("nanoionic supercapacitors"); (5) substantiation about possibility of using of nanoionic supercapacitors in deep-sub-voltage nanoelectronics; (6) definition of ways for heterointegration in supercapacitors of advanced superionic conductors and carbon nanostructures with a high quantum capacitance; (7) theory of a dynamic response of layered nanostructures with ionic hopping transport in a non-uniform potential landscape ("structure-dynamic approach of nanoionics"); (8) new fundamentals of electrostatics related to materials with FIT; (9) proposition of a nonlinear non-local dynamics for FIT-materials. Future nanoionic researches are analyzed in terms of the dynamic theory of information.
