This paper represents Battery-Ultracapacitor combination as a energy storage for Electric Vehicle (EV). The vehicle performance is mainly depends on Energy Storage System (ESS) so more importance has been given in this paper. No Single type of energy storage element fulfils the all required characteristics. So by combining two heterogeneous energy storage elements, efficient Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) can be developed. Performance of HESS mainly govern by the charging and discharging profile of each individual element. HESS improves the overall efficiency of electric vehicle as it hides the disadvantages of individual element and considering advantages only. Basic simulations in MATLAB were conducted to investigate the charging and discharging profile of battery and ultracapacitor which is further required to evaluate the overall performance of electric vehicle.
