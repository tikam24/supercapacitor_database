This paper explains about the supercapacitor cell voltage balancing circuits by comparing different topologies with regard to parameters like cost, balancing time, weight of the components used and control of switches. The advantage of supercapacitor over battery made to overcome weight and faster responding source problems. In supercapacitor bank cell voltages differ from each other which effects the performance of the device. Passive circuits consume power from cell for balancing but active circuits consume power from source. Many topologies are considered in this paper for different ratings and with different components. Balancing circuit is selected based upon total number of components in the balancing circuit, many components make circuit less reliable, complex and also increase the cost for balancing.
