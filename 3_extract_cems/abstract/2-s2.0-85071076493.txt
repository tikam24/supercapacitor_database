In this paper, the porous carbon materials were prepared by pyrolyzing alkali lignin with sodium hydroxide according to the carbon-base ratio of 1:1,1:3,1:5 in a laboratory tube furnace. And the porous carbon material was analyzed by ESEM, particle size analyzer, organic element analyzer and infrared spectrum.Supercapacitors were prepared using alkali lignin porous carbon materials, and their electrochemical performance was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge and discharge tests. The results showed that the morphology of the alkali lignin-based porous carbon materials were spherical or hemispherical, with a large number of pore structures, and rough surface. However, as the carbon-base ratio increasing from 1:1 to 1:5, the average particle size distribution gradually decreased. When the carbon-base ratio was 1:1, the supercapacitor had the best electrical performance. As the current density increases from 0.1 A/g to 1 A/g, the specific capacitance decreased from 71 F/g to 62 F/g, which decreased about 13%. The specific capacitance was still maintained at 62 F/g when it circulated 500 times at an ultra-high current density of 1 A/g, its cycle performance was good.
