The goal of this research is to create hybrid electrode materials for use in supercapacitors. In order to increase electrochemical performance, graphene oxide (GO) is introduced into MoS2 and TiO2 to generate several hybrid electrode materials such as GO/TiO2, GO/MoS2, and GO/TiO2/MoS2. Scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive x-ray analysis, transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectra and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller technique are used to analyze the synthesized hybrid electrode materials. When compared to GO/MoS2 (840.92 mA h g−1), GO/TiO2 (638.49 mA h g−1), and GO (218.87 mA h g−1), the GO/TiO2/MoS2 hybrid electrode material has higher electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 1254.37 mA h g−1 at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. Furthermore, this GO/TiO2/MoS2 hybrid electrode has remarkable cycling stability, with 97.99% retention of capacitance at 5 A g−1 after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles. Energy and power densities of the GO/TiO2/MoS2 composites are estimated to be 759.4 Wh kg−1 and 4550.5 W kg−1, respectively. The GO/TiO2/MoS2 hybrid is shown to be a superior anode material in supercapacitors due to the perfect intercalation between GO, TiO2, MoS2 in these materials. Increased contact surface area, a short ion diffusion path, excellent charge transfer, and, most significantly, higher specific capacitance are the advantages of using GO. The newly developed GO/TiO2/MoS2 nanocomposite may therefore be employed as a possible material for energy storage applications.
