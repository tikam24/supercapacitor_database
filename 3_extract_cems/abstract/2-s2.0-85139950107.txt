Supercapacitors may be able to store more energy while maintaining fast charging times; however, they need low-cost and sophisticated electrode materials. Developing innovative and effective carbon-based electrode materials from naturally occurring chemical components is thus critical for supercapacitor development. In this context, biopolymer-derived porous carbon electrode materials for energy storage applications have gained considerable momentum due to their wide accessibility, high porosity, cost-effectiveness, low weight, biodegradability, and environmental friendliness. Moreover, the carbon structures derived from biopolymeric materials possess unique compositional, morphological, and electrochemical properties. This review aims to emphasize (i) the comprehensive concepts of biopolymers and supercapacitors to approach smart carbon-based materials for supercapacitors, (ii) synthesis strategies for biopolymer derived nanostructured carbons, (iii) recent advancements in biopolymer derived nanostructured carbons for supercapacitors, and (iv) challenges and future prospects from the viewpoint of green chemistry-based energy storage. This study is likely to be useful to the scientific community interested in the design of low-cost, efficient, and green electrode materials for supercapacitors as well as various types of electrocatalysis for energy production.
