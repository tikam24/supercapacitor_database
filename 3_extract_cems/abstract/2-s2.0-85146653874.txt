In order to respond to the national policy of energy saving and environmental protection, and to solve the purpose of automatic charging and discharging continuous work of small transport carts in digital factory assembly line, a wireless charging intelligent energy car based on electromagnetic induction principle and supercapacitor energy storage principle is designed in this paper. The design is based on TC264 as the main control chip, which mainly includes a super capacitor group energy storage module, wireless charging module, timer charging module, camera module, automatic boost power module, and motor drive module. Among them, the supercapacitor is the core control of energy storage, the wireless charging technology is used to transfer the coupling energy from the inductor coil to the super capacitor, and the stored power of the super capacitor is used as the power source to drive the car. In addition, by improving the mechanical structure, the tracking function of the trolley is realized. Finally, through simulation and physical experiment, it has been proved that the trolley can realize the function of dynamic wireless charging and regular self-starting to complete the track trajectory, which can provide a great engineering reference value for the energy cart transportation in the assembly line of a factory.
