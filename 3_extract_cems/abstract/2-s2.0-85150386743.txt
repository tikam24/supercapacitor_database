Nanocomposites containing Ni or Co or NiCo alloy and nitrogen-doped carbon with diverse ratios have been prepared and utilized as active elements in supercapacitors. The atomic contents of nitrogen, nickel, and cobalt have been adjusted by the supplement amount of Ni and Co salts. In virtue of the excellent surface groups and rich redox active sites, the NC/NiCo active materials exhibit superior electrochemical charge-storage performances. Among these as-prepared active electrode materials, the NC/NiCo1/1 electrode performs better than other bimetallic/carbon electrodes and pristine metal/carbon electrodes. Several characterization methods, kinetic analyses, and nitrogen-supplement strategies determine the specific reason for this phenomenon. As a result, the better performance can be ascribed to a combination of factors including the high surface area and nitrogen content, proper Co/Ni ratio, and relatively low average pore size. The NC/NiCo electrode delivers a maximum capacity of 300.5 C g−1 and superior capacity retention of 92.30% after 3000 unceasing charge-discharge cycles. After assembling it into the battery-supercapacitor hybrid device, a high energy density of 26.6 Wh kg−1 (at 412 W kg−1) is achieved, comparable to the recent reports. Furthermore, this device can also power four light-emitting-diode (LED) demos, suggesting the potential practicability of these N-doped carbon compositing with bimetallic materials.
