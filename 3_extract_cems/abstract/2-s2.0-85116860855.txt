Trivalent metal cations are the basic composition of Layered Double Hydroxides (LDHs), however, the effect of metal cations on the supercapacitor performance of LDHs prepared from electroplating sludge has not been reported. In the present study the acid leaching solution of electroplating sludge was used as raw material, and Cr, Fe, Al and other common metal cations were added into the precursors to investigate the effect of trivalent metal cations on the supercapacitor performance of LDHs prepared from electroplating sludge. The experimental results show that the three kinds of metal cations can inhibit the specific mass capacitance of LDHs, and the sequence of inhibition effect is Fe < Al < Cr. This experiment is expected to provide some references for the resource utilization of electroplating sludge.
