Graphene is a thin two-dimensional carbon material which has attracted more attention in the scientific community due to its exceptional property. Especially, in combination with inorganic nanoparticles, it offers great opportunities in the various fields of research including electronics, sensing, catalysis, energy storage and its conversion. Here in a microwave assisted Graphene-Manganese dioxide (GO/MnO2) nanocomposite was synthesized and characterized using XRD, SEM, EDAX and FT-IR techniques. Further, the electrochemical behavior of the metal nanocomposites was analyzed using various electro analytical techniques. The excellent pseudo capacitance and cycliability of GO/MnO2 substantiates that the synthesized nanocomposites can be used as an electrode material for electrochemical supercapacitors.
