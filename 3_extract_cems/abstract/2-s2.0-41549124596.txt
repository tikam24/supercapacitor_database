Multiport dc-dc converters are particularly interesting for sustainable energy generation systems where diverse sources and storage elements are to be integrated. This paper presents a zero-voltage switching (ZVS) three-port bidirectional dc-dc converter. A simple and effective duty ratio control method is proposed to extend the ZVS operating range when input voltages vary widely. Soft-switching conditions over the full operating range are achievable by adjusting the duty ratio of the voltage applied to the transformer winding in response to the dc voltage variations at the port. Keeping the volt-second product (half-cycle voltage-time integral) equal for all the windings leads to ZVS conditions over the entire operating range. A detailed analysis is provided for both the two-port and the three-port converters. Furthermore, for the three-port converter a dual-PI-loop based control strategy is proposed to achieve constant output voltage, power flow management, and soft-switching. The three-port converter is implemented and tested for a fuel cell and supercapacitor system. Â© 2008 IEEE.
