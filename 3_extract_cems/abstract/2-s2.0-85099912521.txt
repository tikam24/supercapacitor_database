Capacitors, the tiny solid state devices that store energy in the form of charge, have come a long way from early parallel plate air core to the current graphene-based supercapacitor. There are various electrode material and electrolytes used for making supercapacitors. Graphene, polymer, metal oxides, carbon are the materials used for making electrode of supercapacitor. Different electrolytes like Li, Na, Na2SO4, sulphuric acid and phosphoric acid used in supercapacitors. The cost of supercapacitor is higher than the present generation of batteries. In this paper, We present our study of fabrication and basic characterization of few samples of supercapacitors made up of activated charcoal and carbon as electrode material and phosphoric acid, NaOH as an electrolyte.
