We report the fabrication of flexible, printed dual cell supercapacitors (DCSCs) and their implementations in energy storage units providing peak power to portable devices. The use of organic electrolytes enhances higher capacity in both potential windows (2.5 V/cell) and the temperature ranges than the aqueous electrolytes, while propylene carbonate retains the advantages of low cost and low toxicity. The device delivered capacitance value between 3 and 4 mF, equivalent series resistance < 2 Ω, and very low leakage current of about 0.1 µA. We demonstrated the integration of an organic photovoltaic module (OPV) with an energy supply platform (ESP) and DCSCs for indoor light energy harvesting and storage. The maximum harvested energy was about 39 mJ. The energy is sufficient to provide peak power to portable devices and sensors. This was confirmed by powering an LED with our energy harvesting system. Mechanical deformation testing of DCSCs shows excellent mechanical stability, so that the device is well suited for flexible energy storage units. In a long-term cyclic stability test, the decrease in capacitance value was only 1% of the initial value after 10,000 cycles, indicating good durability and performance.
