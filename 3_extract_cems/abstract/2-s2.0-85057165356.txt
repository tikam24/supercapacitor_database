Reduced graphene oxide coated carbon cloth has been used as a substrate for the growth of ultrafine MnO2 nanowires (CC/RGO/MnO2), forming binder-free and flexible supercapacitor electrode materials. The experimental results indicate that a maximum area-specific capacitance of 506.8 mF cm-2 was gained from the CC/RGO/MnO2 electrode at the current density of 0.128 mA cm-2. Furthermore, the electrode exhibits excellent cycling stability (98.6% specific capacitance was still retained after 10000 galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) tests when the current density was 1.28 mA cm-2). What's more, the area-specific capacitance of the CC/RGO/MnO2 electrode was hardly changed, when the electrode was operated under bending mechanical conditions. In addition, the charge storage performance and mechanism of the MnO2 nanostructures was discussed.
