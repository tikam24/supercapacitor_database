Wireless power transfer (WPT) is the preferred charging method for electric vehicles (EVs) powered by battery and supercapacitor. In this paper, a novel WPT system with constant current charging capability for sightseeing car with supercapacitor storage is designed. First, an optimized magnetic coupler using ferrite cores and magnetic shielding structure is proposed to ensure stable power transfer and high efficiency. Compared with the traditional planar shape ferrite core coupler, the proposed magnetic coupler requires lesser ferrite material without degrading the performance of the WPT system. Second, the model of supercapacitor is applied to the WPT system and the relationship between equivalent load resistances of supercapacitor and charging time is analyzed in detail. Then, a Buck converter with proportional integral (PI) controller is implemented on the secondary side to maintain constant charging current for the variable load. Finally, the proposed design is verified by experiments. Constant charging current of 31.5 A across transfer distance of 15 cm is achieved. The peak transfer power and system efficiency are 2.86 kW and 88.05%, respectively.
