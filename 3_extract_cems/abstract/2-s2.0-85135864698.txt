Hybrid energy storage system (HESS) has emerged as the solution to achieve the desired performance of an electric vehicle (EV) by combining the appropriate features of different technologies. In recent years, lithium-ion battery (LIB) and a supercapacitor (SC)-based HESS (LIB-SC HESS) is gaining popularity owing to its prominent features. However, the implementation of optimal-sized HESS for EV applications is a challenging task due to the complex behavior of LIB and SC under different driving behaviors. Besides, the power electronics (PE) converter configurations and system-level optimizations, include component sizing (CS) and power-energy management strategy (PEMS), are essential for developing efficient HESS. Therefore, this paper reviews existing LIB-SC HESS, different possible combinations of CS and PEMS, generalized algorithm formulation, and algorithms used for both CS and PEMS. The current issues of LIB-SC HESS regarding the performance in EV applications, PE converters, and optimization algorithms are also analyzed. In addition, future recommendations for the development of efficient LIB-SC HESS are provided to inspire researchers for further studies. Highlights: Lithium-ion battery (LIB) and supercapacitor (SC)-based hybrid energy storage system (LIB-SC HESS) suitable for EV applications is analyzed comprehensively. LIB-SC HESS configurations and suitable power electronics converter topologies with their comparison are provided. System-level optimization of LIB-SC HESS and generalized steps involved in implementing the optimization algorithm for component sizing (CS) and power-energy management strategy (PEMS) are discussed.
