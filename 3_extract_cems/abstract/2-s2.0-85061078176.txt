The main aim of this work is to develop an energy management algorithm (EMS) that control renewable energy system that consists of PV panels, lead acid battery banks and supercapacitor. On addition to that a Graphical user interfaces is developed to control the power system. The efficiency of the controller was tested by the mean of simulation, the result assume the effectiveness of the proposed control method and the intelligent management of the power flow controller.
