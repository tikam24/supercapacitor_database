In recent years, paper-based functional materials have received extensive attention in the field of energy storage due to their advantages of rich and adjustable porous network structure and good flexibility. As an important energy storage device, paper-based supercapacitors have important application prospects in many fields and have also received extensive attention from researchers in recent years. At present, researchers have modified and regulated paper-based materials by different means such as structural design and material composition to enhance their electrochemical storage capacity. The development of paper-based supercapacitors provides an important direction for the development of green and sustainable energy. Therefore, it is of great significance to summarize the relevant work of paper-based supercapacitors for their rapid development and application. In this review, the recent research progress of paper-based supercapacitors based on cellulose was summarized in terms of various cellulose-based composites, preparation skills, and electrochemical performance. Finally, some opinions on the problems in the development of this field and the future development trend were proposed. It is hoped that this review can provide valuable references and ideas for the rapid development of paper-based energy storage devices.
