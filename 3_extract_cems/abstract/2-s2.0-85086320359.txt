A reasonable formation of an electrode material with three-dimensional (3D) microstructure for supercapacitors was proposed. Two-dimensional (2D) SnS2 nanoplates were uniformly in situ grown on 3D carbon foam (CF) through a controllable strategy. The composite displayed excellent electrochemical performance due to the synergistic effect of SnS2 and CF. The SnS2@CF-2 composite containing 23.92 wt% of SnS2 has a superior specific capacitance of 283.6 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1. Moreover, a symmetric supercapacitor based on SnS2@CF-2 composite has a capacitance of 82.5 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and a high energy density of 13.9 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 551.7 W kg−1.
