The method of forming Cu or Au buffer layer on nickel foam (NF) by magnetron sputtering technology to enhance the energy storage capacity of following prepared supercapacitor anode material of CuXCo3-XO4 was carried out in this paper, and the feasibility of surface treatment to improve the performance of supercapacitors was discussed. The buffer layer of Cu or Au can attenuate the lattice mismatch between NF and CuXCo3-XO4, and thus greatly reducing the transfer resistance and improving the electrochemical performance of the electrode material. The effect of Au is more obvious than Cu. The transfer resistance could be decreased effectively from 1.213 Ω to 0.012 Ω after Au sputtered, and the specific capacity increased spontaneously from 442.1C/g to 744.5C/g at a current density of 1A/g. The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) based on the modified anode material can achieve an energy density of 51.04Wh/kg when the power density is about 800 W/kg, and 93.9 % capacity retention rate after 4000 cycles.
