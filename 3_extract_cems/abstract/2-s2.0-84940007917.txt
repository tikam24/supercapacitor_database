Porous electrode materials with large surface area and suitable pore size, as well as short diffusion distance of electrolyte ions in pore channels are desiderated for supercapacitor applications. Herein, we reported the synthesis of mesoporous activated carbon spheres (MACSs) that were obtained by the activation of resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) resin using ZnCl2 as the activating agent. The spherical morphology of MACSs was characterized by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy observations, and the well-developed mesoporous network (∼2.73 nm), high BET specific surface area (up to 2437.1 m2 g−1), and total pore volume (1.37 cm3 g−1) were obtained by a nitrogen sorption technique. Electrochemical measurements showed the excellent capacitive performance of MACSs and small internal resistance. It presented maximum specific capacitance value of 204 F g−1 for MACS-8 in 2 M KOH aqueous solution at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and still remained 126 F g−1 at large current density as 20 A g−1, which well met the practical requirements of supercapacitors. Besides, the electrode material also demonstrated prominent long-cycling stability without any capacity loss after 5000 cycles.
