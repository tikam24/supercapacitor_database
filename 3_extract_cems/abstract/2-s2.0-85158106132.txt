This chapter discusses the role of surface morphology/architecture, different pore types, and pore size distribution on the performance of supercapacitors. A honeycomb-like structure of pores in surface morphology/architecture together with pores distributing evenly appeared to be the most beneficial morphology for the supercapacitors. Each of pore types (macropore, micropore and mesopore) contributes differently to the electrostatic double-layer capacitor, with macropore being the gateway for bulk electrolyte to enter the pore network, mesopore enhancing the diffusion of electrolyte into micropore, and micropore being the active sites for the electric double layer to interact with carbon electrode. The use of carbon black and binder when preparing electrodes can block micropores and mesopores, so this could be the reason why pore size distributions did not show a significant correlation to the supercapacitors. The chemical activation (KOH, ZnCl2, etc.) or physical activation (CO2) can be used to alter the pore structures with surface area up to 3326 m2 g−1 and total pore volume 2.372 cm3 g−1. More comprehensive analysis, focusing on morphology and macropore structure of not only biomass-derived carbon activated through chemical and physical methods but also the mixture of carbon with additives and binders in future studies, is necessary to enhance the adoption of biomass carbons in supercapacitors.
