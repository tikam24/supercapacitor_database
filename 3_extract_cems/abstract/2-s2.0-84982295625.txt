The article discusses design of mathematical model buck and boost converter and the analysis of the optimal frequency choice of the PWM signal for IGBT. The converter is dedicated for charging and discharging of hybrid car drive super-capacitor energy storage. The main role of the converter is to optimize energy content in supercapacitor storage used to acceleration and deceleration during driving period. Mathematical model of the system in MATLAB/Simulink and converter prototype with Freescale Digital Signal Processor 56F8257 were designed. Comparing of simulation results and results measured on the prototype are discussed on the end of the article.
