A new recycling way for simply recovered LiCoO2 materials from spent Li-ion batteries (LIBs) is proposed to serve as a high-performance supercapacitor material in aqueous systems for the first time. A solvent method, using inexpensive DMF to recover the waste LiCoO2 scraps, is suitable for industrial large-scale application with the prominent characteristics of low cost and simple technique. The recovered LiCoO2 sample displays the maximum capacitances of 654 F g-1 with a capacity retention rate of 86.9% after 4000 cycles at 2 A g-1. Excellent electrochemical capacitive behaviors demonstrate that the recovered LiCoO2 material is a promising candidate for pseudocapacitors, which could overcome not only the serious resource waste and environment contamination of LiCoO2 materials in spent LIBs but also the high-cost restriction of supercapacitor practical applications. So, it is hopeful for the recovered LiCoO2 material to be used in supercapacitors, which has advantages of high power density, cost-effective, environment friendly and safe.
