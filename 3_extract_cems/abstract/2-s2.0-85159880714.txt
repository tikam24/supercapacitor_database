With the emerging demand of multifunctional optoelectronic devices, the integration of electrochromism and energy storage functionalities within a single platform has become a research frontier in the electrochromic community. However, the conventional electrochromic function is inherently contradictory to the energy storage function in electrochromic devices. In this review, we firstly introduced the working principles and device configurations of the rudimentary electrochromic energy storage devices (EESDs), where the origin of the contradiction between electrochromic and energy storage functionalities is comprehensively introduced. We then reviewed the current status and applications of EESDs, where we hope to clearly reveal the developing trends of the EESDs. Finally, we proposed our perspectives on the design strategy of zinc anode-based electrochromic devices for overcoming the contradiction between electrochromism and energy storage of EESDs.
