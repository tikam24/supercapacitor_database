In this paper, doped polyaniline (abbr. PANI) was prepared by using emulsion polymerization method and using MnO2 as the oxidant, adding surfactant (SDBS, SDS, T-X100) at ambient temperature. The morphology and structure of doped PANI (PANI-SDBS, PANI-SDS, PANI-T-X100) were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Symmetric redox supercapacitor was assembled with the doped PANI as active electrode material and 1.0 mol/L H2SO4 aqueous solution as electrolyte. The electochemical performance of these supercapacitors was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedence (EIS) and galvanostatic charge-discharge. These results showed that the specific capacitance of PANI-SDBS and PANI-T-X100 was about 393 and 339F/g at the current density of 5 mA/cm2, respectively, which was higher than that of PANI (228 F/g). After 1000 charge-discharge cycles the specific capacitance of PANI-SDBS was still higher than that of PANI. Among them PANI-SDBS fiber nanomaterial had higher specific capacitance and better cycle performance.
