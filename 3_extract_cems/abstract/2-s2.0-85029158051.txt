To overcome the problem that the balancing performance of existing switched-capacitor (SC) cell balancing systems drops along with the increase in the number of series-connected battery cells, a novel SC cell balancing circuit is presented in this paper. The same as other SC balancing systems, only a pair of complementary square-wave signals is required to control the proposed circuit. With resonant SC design, all switches employed in the proposed balancing circuit operate under zero-current switching. The equivalent model is derived to reveal the balancing performance of the proposed balancing circuit. The system feasibility and theoretical analysis are verified by both of simulation and experimental results.
