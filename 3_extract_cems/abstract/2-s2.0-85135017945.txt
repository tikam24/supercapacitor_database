Transition metal chalcogenides with 1D crystal structures such as FeS2, NiS2, CoS2, and VS4 have sparked significant investigation because of their fascinating physical, chemical, and electrochemical characteristics. VS4, a quasi-1D linear chain-like structure with good electrochemical behavior, has piqued the curiosity of many researchers in recent years. The synthesis of the pristine form of VS4 as well as its electrochemical behavior for supercapacitor (SC) applications is presented here. The vanadium tetrasulfide (VS4) nanosheets are synthesized in larger quantities using a simple, template free, and scalable one-pot hydrothermal process. The physicochemical properties of the VS4 were studied using X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopic analysis. The electrochemical performance of the material is investigated as an electrode for SCs. The electrode exhibits the maximum capacitance of 215 F g−1 at the scan rate of 5 mV s−1 with the capacitance retention of 82% for 2000 cycles.
