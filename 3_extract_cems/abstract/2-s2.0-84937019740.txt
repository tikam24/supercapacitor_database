Activated carbon (AC) was prepared via carbonizing melaleuca bark in an argon atmosphere at 600°C followed with KOH activation for high-rate supercapacitors. This AC electrode has a high capacitance of 233 F g<sup>-1</sup> at a scan rate of 2 mV s<sup>-1</sup> and an excellent rate capability of ∼80% when increasing the sweep rate from 2 to 500 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. The symmetric supercapacitor assembled by the above electrode can deliver a high energy density of 4.2 Wh kg<sup>-1</sup> with a power density of 1500 W kg<sup>-1</sup> when operated in the voltage range of 0-1 V in 1 M H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> aqueous electrolyte while maintaining great cycling stability (less than 5% capacitance loss after 10 000 cycles at sweep rate of 100 mV s<sup>-1</sup>). All the outstanding electrochemical performances make this AC electrode a promising candidate for potential energy storage application.
