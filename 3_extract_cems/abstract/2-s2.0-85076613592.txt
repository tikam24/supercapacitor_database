In this study, activated biochar was produced using pilot-scale technologies of fast pyrolysis and activation to create desirable morphology, surface chemistry, and adsorptive properties for application in supercapacitors. First, residues from white birch were converted into biochar by fast pyrolysis (~ 450 °C). Then, physical (using CO2) or chemical (using KOH) activation was carried out in a homemade pilot-scale furnace at 900 °C. These synthesized materials presented distinct porosity structures: micro-/mesoporous (CO2 material) and highly microporous (KOH material), reaching surface areas of up to 1700 m2 g−1. Electrochemical results showed that KOH-activated biochar had higher specific electrical capacitance in both acidic and neutral electrolytes with a maximum specific capacitance value of 350 and 118 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, respectively; while, for CO2-activated biochar, the maximum obtained values were 204 and 14 F g−1. The greater proportion of oxygenated and nitrogenated functional groups on the surface of the KOH activated biochar, along with its high surface area (with wider porosity), improved its performance as a supercapacitor electrode. Specifically, the low proportion of ultramicropores was determinant for its better electrochemical behavior, especially in the neutral electrolyte. Indeed, these results are similar to those found in the literature on the electrical capacitance of carbonaceous materials synthesized in a small-scale furnace. Thus, the chemical-activated biochar made from wood residues in pilot-scale furnaces is a promising material for use as electrodes for supercapacitors.
