Transition metal oxide modified NiMoO4 supercapacitor electrode materials were prepared by a simple solvothermal method. The effects of MnMoO4, ZnMoO4 and CoMoO4 on the structure, morphology and electrochemical performance of NiMoO4 materials were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), Raman, laser particle size analyzer, and electrochemical measurements. The results indicate that the metal oxides have significant influence on the morphology of NiMoO4. The NiMoO4, NiMoO4/MnMoO4, NiMoO4/ZnMoO4 and NiMoO4/CoMoO4 materials present pine needle-like, micron rod-like, ramotan fruit-like and coral cluster-like can be prepared by using three different transition metal oxides with the same experimental parameters. At the current density of 1 A g−1, the discharge specific capacitance is 620, 430, 556 and 740 F g−1, respectively. After 2000 charge and discharge cycles, the capacitance retention rate is as high as 99.4, 60.1, 96.0 and 89.1% with current density of 10 A g−1, respectively. Compared with the other three morphologies, the coral cluster-like NiMoO4/CoMoO4 composite structure provides more space and redox active sites, which could improve electrolyte diffusion efficiency and enhance electron transport.
