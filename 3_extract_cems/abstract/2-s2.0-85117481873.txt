One of the important factors affecting the rapid charging of lithium-ion batteries is polarization, the current commonly used depolarization method is the positive and negative pulse method. In the charging process, the resistance discharge method is used to consume the high-energy negative pulses emitted during the charging process, but the energy utilization rate of this method is low. This article proposes a method of using super capacitors to absorb and store high-energy negative pulses, when the stored power of the super capacitor reaches the set value, the stored power will be used to charge the battery at a constant voltage. After analysis and verification, compared with the traditional positive and negative pulse method, the energy utilization rate of this method is increased by 19.3%.
