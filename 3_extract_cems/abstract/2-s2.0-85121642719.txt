Nanoporous metal oxides are appealing candidates for energy storage applications as they can interact with guest species from inner and outer surfaces, leading to improved energy and power density performance. We have synthesized VO2(B) microflowers with a stable phase and tailored porous structures utilizing block copolymers to achieve excellent supercapacitor performance.
