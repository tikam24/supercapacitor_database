A Fe2O3/reduced graphene oxide (RGO)/Fe3O4 nanocomposite in situ grown on Fe foil was synthesized via a simple one-step hydrothermal growth process, where the iron foil served as support, reductant of graphene oxide, Fe source of Fe3O4, and also the current collector of the electrode. When it directly acted as the electrode of a supercapacitor, as-synthesized Fe2O3/RGO/Fe3O4@Fe exhibited excellent electrochemical performance with a high capability of 337.5 mF/cm2 at 20 mA/cm2 and a superior cyclability with 2.3% capacity loss from the 600th to the 2000th cycle.
