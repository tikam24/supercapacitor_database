The present study reports the synthesis of OVAE, an ester of ortho-vanillin azine, and its structural characterization using spectral and single crystal-XRD studies. Intermolecular interactions of OVAE are investigated using the Hirshfield surface analysis, 3D Hirshfield surface maps, 2D fingerprint plots, and electrostatic energy frameworks. Good thermal stability in thermogravimetric analysis, irreversible redox peaks in electrochemical studies, high carrier concentration and dielectric constant in electrical measurements, uniform films observed upon surface morphology examination, fabrication of a diode, the obtained current-voltage characteristics, dielectric constant and frequency-dependent AC conductivities directed towards the use of OVAE as a potential semiconducting functional material in suitable electronic devices. Based on cyclic voltammetry and AC impedance response, the performance of OVAE as an electrode material is explored by constructing a supercapacitor, which exhibited a specific capacitance of 56 Fg−1 at 10 mV s−1.
