Two porous carbon materials were prepared from vacuum residue using the hard template method to construct high-performance dual-carbon lithium-ion capacitors. The results show that the mixture of vacuum residue for removing toluene insoluble matter and sodium citrate were subjected to aerobic rapid polycondensation, and the vacuum residue after polycondensation was heated at 700 oC to obtain ZYC-7 porous carbon with a specific surface area of about 181 m2 g-1. The ZYC-7 was further etched by KOH under 700 oC to obtain ZYCK-7 super porous carbon with a specific surface area than 997 m2 g-1. The ZYC-7 porous carbon exhibited a specific capacity of 600 and 300 mA h g-1 at a current density of 0.1 and 2.0A g-1, under 0-3 V vs. Li+/Li, while the ZYCK-7 super porous carbon revealed a specific capacity of more than 70 mA h g-1 at a current density of 1.0 A g-1 under 2.0-4.3 V vs. Li+/Li; The ZYC-7 and ZYCK-7 were assembled into a double-carbon lithium-ion capacitor with an energy density higher than 55 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 10 kW Kg-1, and its capacity retention rate was still greater than 85% after 3000 cycles of charge and discharge at a current density of 1.0 A g-1.
