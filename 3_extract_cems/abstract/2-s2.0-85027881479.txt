Supercapacitors are energy storage devices that can contribute with a fast varying current for the regulation of DC grids. However, its power electronics interface should present fast dynamic response what is not exactly the case for the conventional 2-switch buck-boost bi-directional DC-DC converter. The alternative considered in this paper is a 4-switch bi-directional DC-DC converter with an intermediate inductor, which allows the implementation of a tri-state logic that eliminates the RHP zero of the transfer function Vo/D. This paper presents a dynamic model for the 4-switch tri-state converter connected to a droop-controlled DC micro-grid, discusses the benefits of implementing the tri-state logic with different sequences, and provides simulation results showing an improved performance when compared to the conventional scheme.
