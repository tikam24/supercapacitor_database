In order to improve the dynamic performance of modular super capacitor energy storage system, in this paper, a load current feed-forward control strategy based on extended state observer (ESO) is proposed, which enables the system own the feature of 'plug-and-play'. An ESO is designed to observe the load current and details on the design of the ESO are provided, including the convergence of the observer and the design principle of the key parameters. Stability of the proposed control strategy is carried out by using root locus. At last, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified by experimental results.
