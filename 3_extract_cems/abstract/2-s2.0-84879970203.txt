Coral-like nanoporous β-nickel hydroxide nanobars are fabricated by a facile and template-free coprecipitation approach using Na2O 2 aqueous as the OH- source. The synthesis process is conducted without agitation at ambient temperature. The structural characteristic and formation mechanism of the coral-like β-Ni(OH) 2 nanomaterials are studied. The as-made β-Ni(OH)2 electrode is also characterized by FESEM and XRD. The electrochemical properties of the as-prepared β-Ni(OH)2 electrode are examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV), cyclic chronopotentiometry (CP) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 6.0 M KOH solution. A specific capacitance of 1780 F g-1 is obtained at a charge-discharge current density of 1.0 A g -1. The as-prepared β-Ni(OH)2 materials also exhibit excellent rate capability, improved energy density and power density. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
