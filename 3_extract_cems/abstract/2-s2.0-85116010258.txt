Flexible energy storage devices and supercapacitors in particular have become very attractive due to the growing demand for wearable consumer devices. To obtain supercapacitors with improved performance, it is useful to resort to hybrid electrodes, usually nanocomposites, that combine the excellent charge transport properties and high surface area of nanostructured carbon with the electrochemical activity of suitable metal oxides or conjugated polymers. In this work, electrochemically active conducting inks are developed starting from commercially available polypyrrole and graphene nanoplatelets blended with dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid. Films prepared by applying the developed inks are characterized by means of Raman measurements, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis, and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) investigations. Planar supercapacitor prototypes with an active area below ten mm2 cm×are then prepared by applying the inks onto transparency sheets, separated by an ion‐permeable nafion layer impregnated with lithium hexafluorophospate, and characterized by means of electrical measurements. According to the experimental results, the devices show both pseudocapacitive and electric double layer behavior, resulting in areal capacitance that, when obtained from about 100 mF−2 in the sample with polypyrrole‐based electrodes, increases by a factor of about 3 when using electrodes deposited from inks containing polypyrrole and graphene nanoplateles.
