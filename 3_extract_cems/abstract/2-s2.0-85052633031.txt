In this paper by a two-step method including electrodeposition and thermal treatment, flower-like arrays of NiCo2O4 were grown on electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) on nickel-nickel oxide foam (Ni–NiO foam) current collectors. The crystalline structure, morphology and the electrochemical performance of NiCo2O4 were manipulated by varying the electrodeposition current density. The results showed that the NiCo2O4 electrodeposited at a current density of −3.0 mA/cm2 had the highest surface area equivalent to 98.3 m2/g. Using the combination of smart NiCo2O4 and ERGO, the synergistic effect strategy was created. Based on the results of galvanostatic charge and discharge (GCD), an extraordinary specific capacitance of 2489 F/g was obtained at a current density of 1 A/g. Also, 94% of specific capacitance was maintained at a current density of 20 A/g after 4000 cycles. The resultant electrode provided a new insight into the development of next-generation supercapacitor with high power and energy densities.
