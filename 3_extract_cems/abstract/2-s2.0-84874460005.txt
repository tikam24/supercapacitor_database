This paper presents a power control strategy for Hybrid Diesel Generator/Fuel cell Marine Power System Combined with Energy Storage during voltage disturbance condition. For this purpose, dynamic modeling of hybrid power marine system including fuel cell power plant, supercapacitor, DC-DC converters and AC system connected inverter is constructed in the environment of Matlab software. To manage the power between dc power sources and stabilize the dc-link power during voltage disturbance, control strategy has been designed for fuel cell converter (boost) and supercapacitor converter (buck-boost converter). The hybrid system is studied under unbalanced and balanced voltage disturbance condition. Simulation results are given to show the response of whole system under voltage disturbance and illustrate the performance including active power control and voltage disturbance ride-through capability of the proposed control strategy.
