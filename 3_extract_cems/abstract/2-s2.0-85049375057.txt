PANI as one of the conductive polymers which have been widely using in electronics or storage devices such as a supercapacitor. PANI has recently become an option because of its potential for a broad area of application. Protonation or introduce a dopant can control the electrical properties of PANI. However, researcher facing a disadvantage since PANI also active in acidic conditions. To control the conductivity and the stability in an acidic environment, the researcher has introduced Ag/AgCl to PANI. We report the synthesis and analyses of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), PANI, and PANI/Ag/AgCl/ITO-PET films. PANI was synthesized by chemical polymerization, while AgNPs were synthesized via a reductive chemical method using NaBH4 as an AgNO3 reductor. The resulting PANI was characterized using FTIR to determine the functional group, while to obtain the purity of the Ag phase was checked by using XRD. The preparation of PANi/Ag/AgCl solution was carried out by mixing method with the variation of the mass of AgNO3. The precipitate was carried out by using ITOPET substrate. PANI/Ag/AgCl/ITO-PET films were characterized by using FTIR, XRD, SEMEDX, and capacitance meters. It has was found that crystallinity increases with the addition of Ag films to PANI/Ag/AgCl/ITO-PET. The crystallinity reached 29.85 %. It was also revealed that the dielectric constant decreased with increasing Ag in PANi/Ag/AgCl/ITO-PET films.
