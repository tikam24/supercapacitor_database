One-dimensional TiO2 nanotube arrays (TiO2 NTAs) fabricated by anodization of titanium have been considered as promising materials for many potential applications. However, TiO2 NTAs generally suffer from poor electrochemical properties due to limited electrical conductivity of TiO2. For this reason, various approaches to preparing nonmetal-doped and metal-doped TiO2 have been developed. Nevertheless, these reported methods were mainly appropriate for self-doping and nonmetal doping of TiO2. For the metal doping, some difficulties such as multiple steps, harsh reaction conditions, or expensive facilities were often encountered. Here, we propose a novel strategy to realize the metal doping of TiO2 NTAs by using a low boiling metal compound as a dopant source. As an example, through heating the as-anodized TiO2 NTAs together with AlCl3 in a confined space, the Al3+ ions are incorporated into the TiO2 lattice in the form of substitution of Ti4+ by Al3+. Moreover, the AlCl3 vapor treatment route can achieve adherent TiO2 NTA films on Ti substrate. The as-prepared Al-doped TiO2 NTA electrode delivers an average capacitance of 12.48 mF cm−2 at 100 mV s−1, which is ∼2.5 times higher than that of untreated TiO2 NTAs. Also, the Al-doped electrode shows an excellent rate capability and long-term cycling stability.
