Supercapacitors can harvest and return energy to power grid as elevator generator is operated with generating mode. This paper investigates energy storage technology of supercapacitors and presents a charge control strategy employing energy control regulation applied to Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) circuit. Experimental results illustrate that this strategy can fully satisfy the requirement in terms of charging supercapacitors safely, reliably and promptly. Â© (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
