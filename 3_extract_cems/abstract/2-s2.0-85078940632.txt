In this work, the lamellae-like Ni/Co metal-organic framework (Ni/Co-MOF) is synthesized via a facile one-step hydrothermal process. By combining the advantages of mixed-metallic components and unique structures, the fabricated Ni/Co-MOF electrode exhibits a superior specific capacity (568 C g−1 at 1 A g−1), good rate performance (80.1% retention at 10 A g−1) and high cycling stability (75.5% retention over 3000 charge/discharge cycles). Besides, the assembling asymmetric supercapacitor based on the Ni/Co-MOF and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) exhibits a high energy density of 42.24 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 800 W kg−1, and excellent electrochemical cycling stability of 82.6% retention of original capacitance over 6000 charge/discharge cycles.
