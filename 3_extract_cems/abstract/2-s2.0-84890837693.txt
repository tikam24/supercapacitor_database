Carbon aerogels dried at ambient pressure are synthesized by using resorcinol-formaldehyde as carbon precursor and adding P123 to strengthen their skeletons. CO2 activation is used to improve surface areas and adjust pore size distribution. Carbon aerogels are characterized by BET surface measurement, constant-current charge/discharge and cyclic voltammetry (CV). It is found that a specific capacitance of 261 F/g is obtained in 6 mol/L KOH electrolytes. With a decreasing production cost, carbon aerogels dried at ambient pressure have an ideal electrochemical performance and potential application as electrode materials.
