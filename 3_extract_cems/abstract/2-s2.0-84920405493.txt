The application of graphene in the field of electrochemical energy storage devices has been intensively investigated due to its many promising physical and chemical properties. The purpose of the current review paper is to introduce some latest advances in this area. At the beginning, the advantages of graphene as electrode materials and some existing problems will be discussed. In the following parts, we focus on three factors that can significantly influence the performance when graphene based materials are used for energy storage, including preventing the nanosheets from restacking, doping by foreign elements and compositing with other active materials. To illustrate such factors, some examples regarding the development of electrode materials for batteries and supercapacitors based on graphene have been reviewed. At the end, prospects and further developments for graphene based electrochemical energy storage will be also proposed.
