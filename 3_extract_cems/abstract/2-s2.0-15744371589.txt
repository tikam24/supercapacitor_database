The nanocomposite electrode material of amorphous MnO2 and carbon black (CB) was synthesized through chemical coprecipitation by using polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as surfactant and adding nano-carbon black with high specific surface area and high conductivity. The products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results indicate that the composite prepared is amorphous nano-scaled powder. MnO2/CB nanocomposite electrode was measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and constant current charge-discharge method using a three electrode system under the conditions of different potential windows, different scanning rates and different current charge-discharge. The amorphous nanocomposite electrode material in 1 mol/L Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte exhibits ideal capacitive behavior, high reversibility and high pulse charge-discharge property. It indicates that MnO2/CB nanocompostie electrode is a promising electrode material for supercapacitor. The specific capacitance of the composite as high as 142.02 F/g is obtained in the range of -0.2 - +0.8 V corresponded to saturated calomel electrode (SCE).
