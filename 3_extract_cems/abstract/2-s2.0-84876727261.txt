A kind of coral-like porous MnO2 nanostructure film has been formed on stainless steel using a facile ZnO-nanorod-array-mediated technique by a hydrothermal method. Thus-constructed electrode materials for supercapacitors exhibit a high specific capacitance of 221 F g-1 at 0.5 A g -1 and excellent cycle ability with 86% retention after 3000 cycles at 5 A g-1. The excellent electrochemical performance of the electrode materials is considered to be originated from the porous and hierarchical three-dimensional MnO2 nanostructure on the conductive stainless steel substrate.
