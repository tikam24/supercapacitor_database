Amorphous electrode materials can have some unique advantages for supercapacitors. Herein, P and S di-heteroatom doped heterogeneous Ni-Co hybrid nanomaterial (P-NiCoS@C) with an amorphous structure is designed and used as the positive electrode material for hybrid supercapacitor (HSC). The amorphous P-NiCoS@C nanomaterials are synthesized using amorphous P-doped NiCo-MOF as the sacrificial template, followed by a thermal treatment process to simultaneously complete carbonization and S doping. The unique nanoparticle structure provides a large specific surface area, abundant reactive sites and high redox activity. As an electrode material, P-NiCoS@C exhibits superior electrochemical performance, with a specific capacity of 1168.2 C g−1 at 1 A g−1. Moreover, the assembled P-NiCoS@C//activated carbon HSC device can output a high energy density of 55.8 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 800.0 W kg−1, and retained 75.7% of the initial performance after 10,000 cycles. This research provides a new perspective for obtaining electrode materials with high charge storage performance.
