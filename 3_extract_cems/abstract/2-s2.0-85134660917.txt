Compared with ex situ measurement, the in situ measurement is more suitable for inspecting complex electrochemical reactions and improving the intelligent energy storage management. However, most of the in situ investigation instruments are bulky and expensive. Here we demonstrate a miniaturized, portable, and low-cost fiber-optic sensing system for in situ monitoring the capacitance and temperature. It can help evaluate the self-discharge rate in supercapacitors (SCs). The fiber-optic sensing system with two probes are implanted inside the SCs to monitor the capacitance and temperature, respectively. The dual fiber-optic probes can work independently and avoid cross-interference through structure design. The fiber-optic localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) probe near the electrode surface can detect the capacitance in real-time by monitoring ion aggregation on the opposite electrode. The fiber-optic surface plasmon resonance (SPR) probe encapsulated in the thermosensitive liquid can independently detect the temperature change. The measurement uncertainties of the two sensing probes are 5.6 mF and 0.08 â„ƒ, respectively. The proposed tiny and flexible fiber-optic sensing system provides a promising method for in situ monitoring the critical parameters. It is also a powerful tool for investigating electrochemical reactions in various energy storage devices.
