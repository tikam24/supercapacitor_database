In the present work, thin films of Fe2O3 were deposited onto stainless steel substrates by electrodeposition method. All deposited electrodes were annealed for 1 h within the temperature range of 423-673 K with an interval of 50 K. These were further characterized for their structural and morphological measurements by means of X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy techniques, respectively. The supercapacitive characteristics of as-deposited and annealed electrodes were carried out in 1 M KOH electrolyte to confirm the variation in specific capacitance, specific energy, specific power and columbic efficiency, etc., with annealing temperatures.
