Using hierarchical hollow MoS 2 microspheres constructed by ultrathin nanosheets as a framework to provide large active surface area, polyaniline (PANI) nanofibers are controllably assembled on their surfaces by in-situ oxidative polymerization of different amounts of aniline monomers. The morphology and structure of these resulting composites are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy analyses. In order to assess the electrochemical performances of the composites, cyclic voltammograms (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatic charging-discharging (GCD) tests are employed. The as-prepared MoS 2 /PANI-5 composite electrode delivers an enhanced specific capacitance about 633 F g −1 at the current density of 0.5 A g −1 , as well as shows a remarkable capacitance retention of 86.0% at 10 A g −1 after 1000 cycles. In addition, the energy density reaches to 31.7 W h kg −1 when the power density is 0.3 kW kg −1 . All the electrochemical tests indicate this composite has an application prospect as an electrode material for supercapacitors.
