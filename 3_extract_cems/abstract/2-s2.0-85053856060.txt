Within the scope of the paper, an energy management strategy (EMS) for a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) is described and validated. The HESS is composed of a lithium battery pack and a supercapacitor pack. Major objectives for the designed EMS to achieve are the reduction of battery pack current rates and extending its lifetime. The operation of the HESS with the described EMS has been validated by means of simulation and experimental results in a laboratory model. The battery aging model has been developed to estimate its lifetime under power demand for both the HESS and a battery-only system. The results show a significant reduction of current rates of the battery cells, which allows for improving battery durability.
