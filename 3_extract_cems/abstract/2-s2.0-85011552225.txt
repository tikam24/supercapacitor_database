The proceedings contain 106 papers. The topics discussed include: tungsten alloyed with rhenium as an advanced material for heat-resistant silicon ICs interconnects; optical coefficients of nanometer-thick copper and gold films in microwave frequency range; effective optical constants of silver nanofilms calculated in wide frequency range; analysis of contribution from various order diffraction maxima to complex magnetooptical kerr effect from three-dimensional structures like magnetophotonic crystals; GeSi nanocrystals formed by high temperature annealing of GeO/SiO2 multilayers: structure and optical properties; some important aspects in the glass structure of chalcogenide systems; study of morphological characteristic of por-Si formed using metal-assisted chemical etching by BET-method and fractal geometry; formation of nanoporous structure in silicon substrate using two-stage annealing process; electrically stimulated high-frequency replicas of a resonant current in GaAs/AlAs resonant-tunneling double-barrier THz nanostructures; photoresponse in graphene field effect transistor under ultra-short pulsed laser irradiation; thermo injecting electrical instability in the AlxGa1-xAs/GaAs heterostructures with tunnel-nontransparent potential barriers; development of drift-diffusion numerical models of high-speed on-chip photodetectors with heterojunctions; the spatially dispersive eigenvalues of permittivity operator and frequency-dependent surface impedance for conductors without the dc dissipation; and integral planar supercapacitor with CNT-based composite electrodes for heat-sensitive MEMS and NEMS.
