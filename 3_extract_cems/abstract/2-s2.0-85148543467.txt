To obtain high energy density asymmetric supercapacitors, searching anode materials with large electrochemical properties remains a great challenge. Herein, a novel anode material composed of metal−organic framework-derived NiSe2, ZnSe, and nitrogen/carbon (NiSe2/ZnSe-NC) composites with high specific capacity has been successfully designed and synthesized via simple hydrothermal and two-step calcination-thermolysis processes. Electrochemical tests on the NiSe2/ZnSe-NC//active carbon asymmetric supercapacitor demonstrate an outstanding energy density of 45 W·h·kg–1 at a power density of 400 W·kg–1 and only lost 5.6% of specific capacity after 5000 cyclic voltammetry cycles. In addition, after fully charged, the assembled NiSe2/ZnSe-NC//active carbon asymmetric supercapacitor can easily light up a series of red light-emitting diode indicators, indicating that the NiSe2/ZnSe-NC is promising as efficient anode materials for fabrication of environment-friendly and low-cost supercapacitors.
