Metal organic frameworks are quoted as crystalline porous networks formed by the coordination bonding of metal ions and organic moieties. MOF attracted great attention in supercapacitors owing to their high specific surface area and porous structure hence emerged as a new class of material exceeds surface area much high than carbon allotropes. Recently, researchers have devoted a lot of attention to the preparation of nanomaterials from metal organic frameworks to develop next generation electrode material exceeding better electrochemical performances. Various studies show the advancement of metal organic frameworks as prominent pseudocapacitive electrode material. Here we have discussed the facile synthesis and preparation of MOF materials with their growth mechanisms and reviewed various prepared MOF nanomaterials and their derivatives for high performance supercapacitors. Finally, we have highlighted the designing criteria of MOFs and challenges and opportunities in the field of energy storage applications.
