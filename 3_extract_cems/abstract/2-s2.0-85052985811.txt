Graphene Oxide (GO)/manganese oxide(MnO2) composites with different feeding ratio are synthesized by a simple and economic soft chemical route in a water-isopropyl alcohol under different cooling method. The SEM results show that MnO2 nanoparticle with smaller size (8nm) homogeneously coats on the surfaces of graphene oxide under quick ice quenching, and the better electrochemical properties is obtained. The composites with feeding ratio 1:9 have maximum capacitance value, because of agglomerate induced by too much MnO2. The specific capacitances calculated by galvanostatic charge/discharge curve were 312.87 F/g by ice water quenching and 253.12 F/g by reflux cooling to room temperature. The GO/MnO2 electrode retained about 85.12% (with quick ice quenching) and 88.16% (with reflux cooling) of initial capacitance after 1000 cycles, respectively.
