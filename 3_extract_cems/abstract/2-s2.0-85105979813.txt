The common smoke detection terminal designed for fire detection is mainly based on wireless communication technology and sensor technology. With the development and application of 5G technology in recent years, the Internet of Everything will become a historical inevitability. Compared with the traditional wireless networking technology, the application of NB-IoT technology can greatly reduce the power consumption and cost of the equipment, and also increase the service life of the equipment. Under the background of more and more mature communication network technology in the future, how to make the equipment more durable and lower power consumption has become one of the key issues to improve the performance of the equipment. Therefore, the power equipment charging with polycrystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and storing energy with supercapacitors can supply energy for the detection equipment continuously. The photovoltaic charging circuit uses the variable step length conductance increment method to track the maximum power point to improve the utilization rate of solar energy. As a communication technology, narrow-band IoT can reduce more power consumption. The narrow-band bandwidth allows devices to be widely placed in a fixed area. Under the premise of realizing the functional requirements, the principle of hardware and software design is mainly to realize the low power consumption in all aspects, and the design of the upper computer is mainly to realize the real-time understanding of the detection equipment.
