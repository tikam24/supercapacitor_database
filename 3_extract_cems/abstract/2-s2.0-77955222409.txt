An electrochemical capacitor (EC), often called a supercapacitor or ultracapacitor, stores electrical charge in the electric double layer at an electrode-electrolyte interface, usually with high-surface-area carbon as the electrode. As a result of the high surface area and thinness of the double layer, these devices have very high mass and volumetric capacitance densities. This enables them to combine a previously unattainable capacitance density with an essentially unlimited charge/discharge cycle life. The operational voltage per cell, limited by the breakdown of the electric double layer, is usually <1 or <3 V per cell for aqueous or organic electrolytes, respectively. Â© 2006 IEEE.
