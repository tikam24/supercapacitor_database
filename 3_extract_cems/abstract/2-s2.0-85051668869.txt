For all present-day consumer electronic (CE) products, especially those operating on dc voltage or power, supercapacitors or supercapacitor modules may replace these products' batteries in the near future, eliminating batteries and all of the shortcomings associated with their technology. Because these CE products require a constant dc voltage for operation, a state-of-the art dc-dc converter module operating solely on supercapacitors without a battery is envisioned. A proposed dc-dc converter module would deliver the required constant voltage to the CE devices from the supercapacitors corresponding to the dropping or decaying voltage of the supercapacitors or supercapacitor module.
