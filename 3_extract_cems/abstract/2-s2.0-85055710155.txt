Here, we report binder-free vertical-slate-like MoS2 nanostructures on 3D-Ni-Foam (VSL-MoS2@3D-Ni foam) for low-cost high-performance solid-state symmetric supercapacitors (SSCs). The cost-effective, ecofriendly and scalable solvothermal method and its direct incorporation of VSL-MoS2@3D-Ni-foam yield SSCs with excellent electrochemical properties with a wide potential window of 1.0 V. Furthermore, high specific capacitance of 34.1 F g−1 at a current density of 1.3 A g−1, an energy density of 4.7 W h kg−1 at a high-power density of 650 W kg−1, and excellent stability with ∼82.5% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles were demonstrated even for SSCs with a binder free MoS2 electrodes on 3D-Ni-foam. These excellent features of the SSCs with VSL-MoS2@3D-Ni-foam substantiate their potential opportunity for future energy applications.
