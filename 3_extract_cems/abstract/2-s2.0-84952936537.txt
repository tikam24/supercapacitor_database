The scarcity and cost of fossil fuels combined with their greenhouse gas emissions, make the development of non-fossil fuel-based methods of transportation a high-priority task. This paper proposes the designing and sizing of an Integrated solar and wind based Hybrid Charging System (ISWHCS) along with super capacitors to be used in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) propulsion. It includes a solar cell charger, Internal Combustion Engine (ICE), wind propeller on-board sources and a combined Energy Storage System (ESS) comprising a battery stack and super capacitor. Based on the speed, load and availability of proposed sources, number of batteries and super capacitors are automatically selected for propulsion by using computer and interfacing circuits. To realize this logic, a program has been developed in 'C' language. This logic also helps in controlling the charging and discharging times of the batteries and super capacitor placed in the energy storage system.
