In this work, NiCo2O4 coral-like porous crystals, nanoparticles and submicron-sized particles have been systematically prepared via a facile sol-gel method, using citric acid as the chelating ligand and H2O (H2O-DMF) as solvent. The experimental results reveal that the initial molar concentration of reactants, reaction time and solvent species involved are crucial for preparing the target products. The as-obtained samples were characterized by means of XRPD, FESEM, HRTEM, EDS and SAED techniques. Finally, the electrochemical performances of NiCo2O 4 crystals with distinct morphologies were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, and galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling techniques. The results show that submicron-sized NiCo2O4 particles exhibit the best capacitive properties with high specific capacitance and excellent cycle stability. At a high mass loading (5.6 mg cm-2), specific capacitance value of submicron-sized NiCo2O4/Ni electrode reaches as much as 217 F g-1, and 96.3% of which can be still maintained after 600 charge-discharge cycles. Therefore, NiCo2O4 crystal is very promising for real application in supercapacitors. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
