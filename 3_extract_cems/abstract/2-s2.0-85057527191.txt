All-solid-state supercapacitors constructed with effectively composited materials are required urgently for the next generation of portable electronic devices. Herein, two dimensions of materials (carbon nanotubes and exfoliated MoS2) are used as basic building blocks for deposition of zero-dimensional birnessite-MnO2 nanoparticles. The obtained ternary hybrids with open conducting nanoarchitecture can provide multiple accessible electroactive sites to minimize the ion-diffusion distances. In a three-electrode aqueous system, the MoS2/CNTs-MnO2 exhibits high specific capacitance (365.6 F/g) and excellent rate capability (76.5% capacity retention at 8 A/g). The advantages of MoS2/CNTs-MnO2 hybrids are evaluated by investigating symmetric and asymmetric supercapacitor using PVDF-HFP/EMIMBF4/EMIMTFSI gel electrolyte. The potential window of both symmetric and asymmetric supercapacitor can be enlarged to 4 V. In particular, the asymmetric device provides a maximum energy of 124 Wh/kg at a specific power of 916 kW/kg. It is prospected that such novel hybrids can offer potential promise in energy storage device applications.
