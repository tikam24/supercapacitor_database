A pH-tailored anodic deposition strategy is reported in this work, by which the hydrous ruthenium oxide (RuO2) can be directly deposited on titanium (Ti) substrates. The prepared RuO2 electrode exhibits a well kinetic performance (the remarkably low equivalent series resistance of Res∼2 mΩ and charge transfer resistance of Rct∼0.11Ω) and a high specific capacitance of 756 F g-1 at 0.6 A g-1. More importantly, a symmetric supercapacitor based on the RuO2 electrode delivers a high specific energy of 24 Wh kg-1 at 150 W kg-1. Even at a large specific power of 26.25 kW kg-1, specific energy is still as high as 8.6 Wh kg-1, meanwhile achieving a long lifespan of 98% retention over 100,000 cycles. All of these distinguishing properties not only enable the prepared RuO2 to be an excellent electrode material for high-power output and long life supercapacitors, but also indicates that the pH-tailored anodic deposition strategy reported in this work is effective to prepare high-performance RuO2 electrode.
