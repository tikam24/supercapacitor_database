Composites based on commercially available carbon cloth Busofit T-040 and conductive polymer polyaniline are fabricated using the electrochemical polymerization of aniline on the surface of carbon-cloth fibers. The sequence of technological operations for obtaining the composite is optimized; the procedure of preliminary modification of the carbon-cloth surface by electrochemical etching is worked out; and the capacitive characteristics of the obtained composites for use as flexible supercapacitor electrodes are studied. It is found that the introduction of polyaniline into the composition of composite electrode structures leads to an increase in the capacitance by 2–2.5 times compared to the initial carbon cloth due to the pseudocapacitance of polyaniline while maintaining a high electrical conductivity and efficiency. For a composite based on etched carbon cloth, the specific capacitance is 267 F/g (8.9 F/cm2 per unit of the geometric surface of the electrode) with a charge efficiency of 97–99%. The specific surface area of the composite, determined by the BET method, is 548 m2/g.
