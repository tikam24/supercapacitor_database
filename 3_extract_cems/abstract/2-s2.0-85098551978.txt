Graphene, one of the limited constituents, has attracted attention of researchers in various industrial applications owing to its exceptional structural, thermal, electrical and biocompatibility properties. Generally, Graphene (allotrope of Carbon) forms a monolayer of atoms to exhibit a plane of sp2 hybridised carbon atoms which are covalently bonded together and organized in the hexagonal lattice. The exclusive material, Graphene is extensively used as conducting material in energy storage devices through the tough p-p bond interactions among graphene layers prime to excessive damage of the surface area of graphene electrodes and the constructed sheets of graphene stands out to be an efficient approach compared to other materials. This review paper presents an outline of recent developments of graphene composites and their applications in various energy storage devices as perceived in recent years.
