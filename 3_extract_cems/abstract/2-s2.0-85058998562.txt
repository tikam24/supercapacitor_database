Nitrogen-doped porous hollow carbon spheres were fabricated via hydrothermal pre-carbonization and pyrolysis carbonization using yeast cell templates. After that, the MnO2 nanowires were deposited by the in-situ hydrothermal reaction. By controlling the reaction concentration, various MnO2 nanostructures with different morphologies and electrochemical properties were obtained. The as-prepared sample exhibited an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 255 F g-1 at a current density 1 A g-1 in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The MnO2/HCS-30 material was used as the positive electrode, and the HCS was used as the negative electrode to assemble the asymmetric supercapacitor. The maximum energy density operating at the 2.0 V voltage window is 41.4 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 500 W kg−1 and still maintains 23.0 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 7901 W kg−1. Moreover, it displayed excellent cycle stability, retained approximately 93.9% of the capacitance after 5000 cycles. This work innovatively combines biomass and energy, provides an environmentally benign strategy and new insights for the preparation of electrode materials.
