The survey of 2D materials has triggered the energy storage and conversion research. In molybdenum-based 2D layered materials are of great significance, due to their remarkable properties. In this work, simple solid-state synthesis and formation of molybdenum boride has been explored with various characteristic techniques. The advanced characterization techniques like XRD, TEM, XPS, BET, have been used to understand the crystallinity, morphology, and surface area of the layered MoB (LMB). The electrochemical performances of LMB electrode were verified with different aqueous electrolytes. The LMB electrode has been found to store higher charge in H2SO4 than Na2SO4 electrolyte. The LMB electrode delivered a specific capacitance of 445 F g−1 in H2SO4 where 130 F g−1 in Na2SO4 at a current density of 1 A g−1. Such behavior may be due to ionic size and mobility of ions in the electrolyte. The asymmetric supercapacitors have been fabricated with LMB and activated carbon (AC) electrode then the device performance was examined in both the electrolyte. On optimization, it was found the device works well in potential window 1.4 V in H2SO4 while the potential window was extended to 1.8 V in Na2SO4 electrolyte. The device was found to deliver an energy density of 14 W h kg−1 at a power density of 16.8 kW kg−1 for H2SO4 with a better capacity retention of 98% for 2000 cycles. Thus, LMB electrode in supercapacitor application has been demonstrated for the first time, which can instigate more investigations for layered molybdenum-based electrodes for energy storage devices.
