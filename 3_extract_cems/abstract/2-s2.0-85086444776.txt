Supercapacitors are important renewable and sustainable electrochemical energy storage devices with significant advantages including rapid charge/discharge rates, long cycle lifetimes, and high power densities. Herein, to achieve high-performance supercapacitors, Ni3-xFexS2 nanosheet arrays were synthesized on Ni foam with different Ni/Fe ratios. The incorporation of Fe atoms allows the adjustment of the electron configuration of the Niâ€“Fe bimetal sulfides and thus significantly influenced their electrochemical activity in a supercapacitor system. As expected, compared with the monometal sulfide Ni3S2, the Ni2FeS2-based supercapacitor delivered a superior capacitive performance and rate capability owing to its unique nanosheet array structure and bimetallic composition.
