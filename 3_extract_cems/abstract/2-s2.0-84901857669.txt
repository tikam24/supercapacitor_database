In this article, first the design procedure of the thermal model of a EDLC type wound capacitor (Electrochemical double layer capacitor) is described, whereby the main objective of modeling is achievement of a very close accordance of simulation results compared to measurements in various operating conditions. Development process is supported by the mathematical analysis of the internal structure of EDLC. Based on the requirements on high degree of model's accuracy, three alternatives of model's complexity are shown. Instead of accuracy the proper model has to fulfill also requirement on the computation time. Next, to meet further demands of complex modeling of supercapacitor modules, mentioned abilities (accuracy of simulation results and fast computation time of solution) must be as lowest as possible. The second important aim of this paper is the description of the development procedure of thermal simulation model of EDLC module (multi-cell supercapacitor system). Consequently simplifications targeting lowest simulation time with achievement of high model's accuracy are provided. At the end of the paper, reader is able to find simulation experiments which are confirming the proposed design procedure. Â© 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.
