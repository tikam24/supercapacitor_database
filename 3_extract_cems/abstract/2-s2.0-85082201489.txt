Designing and preparation of excellent energy storage electrodes are of significance for supercapacitor. In this work, a self-supported electrode was successfully fabricated by electrodepositing MnO2 and polypyrrole (PPy) on stainless steel mesh (SSM) via amperometric measurements in different monomer solution. The electrode presented a specific capacitance of 239 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 and 86.7% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles. The in situ growth of MnO2 and PPy on SSM led to greater stability, higher conductivity and better robustness, which ensured the achievement of excellent electrochemical performance of the electrode accompanied with the synergetic effect between MnO2 and PPy to improve the electron transfer and take fully advantage of active materials.
