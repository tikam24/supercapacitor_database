Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) anchored Sn doped V2O5 (Sn-V2O5/rGO) nanocomposite materials are produced by employing the sol-gel method. The Sn-V2O5/rGO nanocomposite is composed of Sn dopant homogeneously dispersed on V2O5 nanorods and rGO nanosheets. At the time of charge/discharge process, this peculiar structure mainly reduces the amount of Na+ inflation, enhances the electrolyte insertion into the electrode and also increases the conductivity of the Sn doped V2O5 electrode. As results, the Sn-V2O5/rGO, 4%Sn-V2O5 and V2O5 electrodes exhibits excellent electrochemical performance and it provides high reversible specific capacitance of about 159.37, 139.06 and 120.10 F g−1 at 1 Ag−1. Even at this high current density, this Sn-V2O5/rGO electrode also withstands the capacitance maximum of about 73 %. Concretely, the prepared Sn-V2O5/rGO electrode material exhibits the low charge transfer resistivity than 4%Sn-V2O5 and V2O5 electrodes. Moreover, the electrode obeys the excellent capacitance retention (95 %) at 5 Ag−1 for the 1000th cycle.
