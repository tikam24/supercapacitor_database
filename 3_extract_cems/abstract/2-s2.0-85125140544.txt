The storage devices have gained lot of prominence in the recent times for the effective energy management. Hybrid energy storage devices which are also referred to as supercapattery (Supercapacitor and battery like performance) devices exhibit remarkable energy storage performance with superior power density and energy density than supercapacitors and batteries. In this paper, an attempt has been made to synthesize and characterize such a composite material to be used as electrode for supercapattery applications. Nickel phosphide nanoparticles are synthesized by hydrothermal method, while polyaniline is obtained through polymerization of aniline to obtain Nickel Phosphide-Polyaniline (PANI) composite. The composite is used as electrode material for the supercapattery device using chitosan biopolymer as electrode binder. Scanning Electron Microscopy and powder X-ray diffraction techniques are employed to characterize the synthesized nanoparticles. The electrochemical behavior of the fabricated composite is assessed. The results show comparatively higher value of specific capacity of the composite and superior electrochemical stability in three electrode assembly in contrast to polyaniline and nickel phosphide nanoparticles. Further, the supercapattery device fabricated using polyaniline and nickel phosphide nanocomposite exhibits an improved energy density of 21.9 Wh/kg, maximum power density of 2249 W/kg and an outstanding cyclic stability with the retention capacity of 89% even after continuous 4000 Galvanostatic Charge and Discharge (GCD) cycles. The results obtained by electrochemical methods for the supercapattery device are validated using electrical methods as well. The cost-effective electrode materials fabricated with ecofriendly chitosan electrode binder for supercapattery applications are expected to make such supercapattery devices frontrunners as proficient energy storage devices for the future.
