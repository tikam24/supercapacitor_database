Defects such as oxygen vacancy in the nanostructures have paramount importance in tuning the optical and electronic properties of a metal oxide. Here we report the growth of oxygen deficit tungsten oxide (W18O49) nanorods modified with ruthenium oxide (RuO2) using a simple and economical hydrothermal approach for energy storage application. In this work, a novel approach of hybridizing the W18O49 nanostructure with RuO2 to control the electrochemical performance for energy storage applications has been proposed. The result displays that the hybridization of the nanostructures plays an important role in yielding high specific capacitance of the electrode material. Due to the augmentation of W18O49 and RuO2 nanostructures, the galvanostatic charging and discharging (GCD) mechanism exhibited the transformation from the battery type characteristics of W18O49 into the typical pseudocapacitor feature of hybrid architect nanostructure due to defect creations. The electrochemical measurement of hybrid nanomaterial shows the doubling of specific capacitance to 1126 F/g and 1050 F/g in cyclic voltammetry (CV) and GCD, respectively, in comparison with W18O49 and RuO2 and earlier reports. The enhancement in the stability performance up to 3000 cycles of hybrid is indebted to the stable nature of W18O49 and the high conductivity of RuO2.
