The use of nonrenewable fossil fuels for energy has increased in recent decades, posing a serious threat to human life. As a result, it is critical to build environmentally friendly and lowcost reliable and renewable energy storage solutions. The supercapacitor is a future energy device because of its higher power density and outstanding cyclic stability with a quick charge and discharge process. Supercapacitors, on the other hand, have a lower energy density than regular batteries. It is well known that the electrochemical characteristic of supercapacitors is strongly dependent on electrode materials. The current review highlights advance in the TMOs for supercapacitor electrodes. In addition, the newly discovered hybrid/pseudo-supercapacitors have been discussed. Metal oxides that are employed as electrode materials are the focus of this study. The discovery of nanostructured electrode materials continues to be a major focus of supercapacitor research. To create high-performance electrode materials from a morphological standpoint, various efforts have been attempted. Lastly, we analyze the supercapacitorâ€™s evolving trend and our perspective for the future generations of supercapacitors.
