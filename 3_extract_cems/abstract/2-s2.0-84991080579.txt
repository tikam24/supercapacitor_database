A series of nitrogen-enriched carbon aerogels (NCA-X, X = 0.14, 0.17, 0.20, 0.25, and 0.33) were prepared by a sol-gel polymerization of MRF (melamine-resorcinol-formaldehyde) with a variation of M/R (melamine/resorcinol) molar ratio (X). For comparison and reference, melamine-free carbon aerogel was also prepared. They were then used as supercapacitor electrode materials. It was observed that textural properties of NCA-X decreased with increasing M/R molar ratio, whereas nitrogen content increased with increasing M/R molar ratio. Electrochemical properties of nitrogen-enriched carbon aerogel electrodes were measured by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. Surface properties of nitrogen-enriched carbon aerogels were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Among the samples, NCA-0.20 with the largest amount of pyridinic nitrogen showed the highest specific capacitance. Thus, an optimal M/R molar ratio (X) was required for the largest amount of pyridinic nitrogen in the nitrogen-enriched carbon aerogel, and in turn, for the highest specific capacitance of nitrogen-enriched carbon aerogel.
