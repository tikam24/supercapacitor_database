Works on creation electrolyte of two organic solvents are presented, one of which has a large ability for the dissociation of dissolved ionic compound, the second-a low viscosity. Conductivity of organic electrolytes has been studied at different concentrations of lithium salts LiClO 4, where the primary polar solvent was propylene carbonate (PC), and co-solvent improves the viscosity were successively: benzene, DEC, dioxane, DMC, DME, EC, THF in different proportions to the PC.
