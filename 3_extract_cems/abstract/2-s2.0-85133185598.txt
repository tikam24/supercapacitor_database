Nickel tungstate thin films of different thicknesses are synthesized using the binder-free successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method at ambient temperature and subsequent calcination at a temperature of 727 K. The physicochemical characterizations of NiWO4 thin films are carried out using different techniques. The electrochemical performances of NiWO4 films are evaluated in 2 m KOH electrolyte using a standard three electrode system. The specific capacitance of 1536 F g−1 at the current density of 2 A g−1 is obtained for the NiWO4 film. The film exhibits excellent electrochemical stability of 87% after 5000 galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) cycles at the current density of 3 A g−1. This study highlights use of SILAR-deposited NiWO4 thin films as a cathode in aqueous asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs). The ASC device NiWO4/KOH/Fe2O3 exhibits a specific capacitance of 115 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 and specific energy of 23Wh kg−1 at specific power of 1.2 kW kg−1. The device shows remarkable electrochemical cycling stability (78% capacitance retention after 5000 GCD cycles). The SILAR-deposited NiWO4 thin films are expected to emerge as a potential candidate for supercapacitors.
