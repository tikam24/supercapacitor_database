In the presence of graphene oxide (GO) substrate, nanostructured graphene-SnO2-polyaniline (GSP) ternary composite is synthesized via one-pot method, including that GO is reduced by Sn2+ and tiny SnO2 nanoparticles are homogeneously distributed on the graphene sheets and following that polyaniline (PANI) is in situ synthesized on the surface of graphene-SnO2 (GS) composite in order to obtain GSP ternary composite. The electrochemical results demonstrate that GSP ternary composite achieves a maximum capacitance of 913.4Fg-1 at 5mVs-1, retains 90.8% of the initial specific capacitance after 1000 cycles. The extraordinary electrochemical properties of the GSP ternary composite are attributed to good combination and the synergistic effect among the three components. Therefore, graphene based ternary composite can be a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.
