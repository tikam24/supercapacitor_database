Supercapacitors (SCs) are drawing more and more attention in energy storage applications. This paper aims to discuss the state of the art of application-oriented electrothermal modeling methods for SCs and identify the limitations and future research opportunities. Electrothermal modeling is essential to model-based design, thermal management, and reliability analysis of SCs for energy storage applications. The review provides new perspectives with respect to the existing surveys, which focus mainly on materials, cell voltage balancing, electrical equivalent circuit models, and energy management systems. It covers the main aspects of electrothermal modeling of electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and hybrid SCs, from heat generation mechanisms to different modeling and parameterization approaches. The outcome of the review is an archive of important research work in the topic area and an outlook on future efforts to be made.
