Preparation of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) from abundant and inexpensive low-grade coal is regarded as one of the most promising methods for utilizing this resource in a high-value and environmentally sustainable manner. As the main precursor for the fabrication of RGO, graphene oxide (GO) can be extracted from low-grade coal such as lignite, but its size is just in the range of tens to hundreds of nanometers, which limits its practical application. Herein, we demonstrate that large-size RGO sheets can be prepared in large quantities by the pretreatment of lignite using the high temperature–high pressure (HTHP) method. The RGO electrode after the reduction reaction by 50 mM NaBH4 at 105 °C features porosity and high conductivity, which can facilitate high electrochemical reaction efficiency. Thus, we also demonstrate the use of lignite-derived RGO for supercapacitor electrode materials with high performance. The lignite-derived RGO supercapacitor can deliver outstanding volumetric capacitance (30.6 F cm−3), high energy density (4.2 mW h cm−3), excellent flexibility (79.5% retention of the initial capacitance at 180° bending), and a long lifespan (112.3% retention of the initial capacitance after 20,000 cycles). It is believed that the proposed large-size RGO based on reasonable optimization of inferior lignite will offer a new prospect for next-generation energy storage applications.
