A series of g-C3N4/TiO2/PPy (GTP) nanocomposites were prepared after in-situ chemical polymerization of pyrrole and the optimized dosage of g-C3N4 and TiO2 was intercalated with diverse polypyrrole (PPy) to get various composites. Super-capacitive functionality of the structurally and morphologically analysed fabricated electrodes was optimized for energy storage purpose. Electrochemical studies were performed in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. Among the different compositions of synthesized composites, GTP 1.0 exhibited good specific capacitance, 1216 F/g at 2 mV/s, accord well with that of the GCD results. Excellent cyclic stability of 93% was observed after 10,000 cycles. Power density and energy density for the GTP 1.0 composite in three electrode system were found to be 249.9 W/kg and 65.6 Wh/kg respectively at 0.5 A/g, thus providing promising results for energy storage. GTP//AC (Activated Charcoal) supercapacitor device was designed owing energy density as 15.6 Wh/kg and power density as 232.3 W/kg.
