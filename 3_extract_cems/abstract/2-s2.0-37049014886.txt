As a new technology, supercapacitor can attain greater energy density than those of conventional capacitors and greater power density than those of batteries. As a result, supercapacitors may become an attractive power solution for an increasing number of applications. In this paper, after a brief introduction of supercapacitor components, a supercapacitor based ride-through system for industrial drive applications is presented. The design details are discussed and experimental results are given. Â© 2007 IEEE.
