Microporous carbon materials with specific surface area as high as 2352 m2 g-1 were synthesized by the carbonization of KOH-pretreated partially carbonized water bamboo at 800 Â°C under a N2 atmosphere for supercapacitor application. In particular, the carbon materials synthesized at a 2:1 weight ratio of KOH and pre-treated carbon exhibited excellent performance with a maximum specific capacitance of 268 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte and retained up to 222 F g-1 even at a current density of 10 A g-1. In addition, this material also showed a good capacity retention of 97.28% over 5000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g-1. The excellent electrochemical properties could be due to their high specific surface area, abundant pore volume, appropriate pore size distribution and some oxygen groups.
