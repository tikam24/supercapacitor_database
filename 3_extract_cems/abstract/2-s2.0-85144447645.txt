It is possible that controlling the lithium-ion amount may relate to the high energy and the specific capacitance of active materials into a single device. As the cathode for Li-ion capacitors (LICs) using nonaqueous electrolytes, we investigated surface functionalization of ultra-surface area-activated carbon (UAC) powder. An increase in capacitance was observed, from 1.25 × 104 to 8.10 × 104 F/g with controlling of lithium amount, as well as an increase in the area explicit capacitance per BET surface region from 657.57 to 1605.25 m2/g, which indicates that redox responses and their remarkable potential might enhance the capacitance for LICs. The pseudocapacitive redox reaction at C=O destinations is mostly attributed to capacitance enhancement. As with the improvement in capacitance, it was discovered that the arrangement of the electrolytes depends on the wetting behavior and particle size that can be adjusted. This study suggests the way for a low-cost and widely used UAC powder with controlling of lithium amount and a magnetic field for LICs. The 6LUAC samples treated with a magnetic field showed excellent specific capacity and energy density compared to samples not treated with a magnetic field under the same test conditions. Finally, we expect that this method may contribute to improvement of the electrochemical performance of materials.
