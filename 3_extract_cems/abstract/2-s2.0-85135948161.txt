Supercapacitors are gaining popularity as a component in energy storage systems due to their quick charge/discharge rates and high specific power. A facile method is introduced in this research to fabricate a novel ternary nanocomposite-based manganese oxide decorated on polyaniline/graphitic carbon nitride (PANI-GCN) nanohybrid modified graphite sheet (GC) electrode via the electrochemical deposition method. As-prepared nanocomposite modified electrode morphology, elemental analysis, surface functionalities studies, and crystalline behavior are proved using SEM, Energy Dispersive Analysis, FT-IR, and XRD techniques. The electrochemical measurements are obtained by CV, GCD, and EIS. For Bare GS, PANI, and PANI-GCN, the solution resistance (Rs) that gauges the ionic conductivity across the electrolyte, was measured to be 60.57 Ω, 7.28 Ω, and 6.19 Ω, respectively. A greater specific capacitance of 318 F/g at 1 A/g was displayed by the developed MnO2@PANI-GCN electrode and lower charge transfer resistance over the PANI and PANI-GCN electrodes. Furthermore, the proposed electrode has shown the capacitive retention of 80.62% up to 1000 cycles. These results indicate that the ternary nanocomposite MnO2@PANI-GCN shows significant electrochemical properties towards energy storage applications.
