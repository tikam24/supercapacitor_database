This study presents the findings of MnO2 tailoring in MWCNT for supercapacitor applications. Using a solvothermal method, we developed the MnO2/MWCNT nanocomposites with high energy storage capacity. The XRD peaks revealed the hexagonal structure of graphite and the tetragonal structure of birnessite type MnO2. TEM revealed that the MWCNT sidewalls were decorated with a huge number of high purity manganese nanoparticles. According to CV studies, the composite electrode's specific capacitance exceeds 314F/g. As per the researchers, the tailored MnO2/MWCNT nanocomposites should promote the best electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
