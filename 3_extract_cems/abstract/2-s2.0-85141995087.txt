The integrated photovoltaic-storage device can convert solar energy into chemical energy for direct storage to achieve the direct use of solar energy. Improving the total energy conversion efficiency is a major research focus. A low internal resistance composite material that is in-situ grown nickel hydroxide nanosheets on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was prepared for the cathode of supercapacitor and the integrated photovoltaic-storage device was assembled. The discharge specific capacitance of the composite electrode is 1586.4 F/g at 2 A/g and even 1108 F/g at 50 A/g, and the retention rate is as high as 70.0%. The discharge specific capacitance of the nickel hydroxide electrode is 622.8 F/g at 2 A/g and even 304 F/g at 50 A/g, and the retention rate is 48.8%. In addition, the coulombic efficiency of composite electrode is 96.5%, while that of nickel hydroxide electrode is only 48.4% at 2 A/g. Compared with the nickel hydroxide, the composite material has a larger electrode electrolyte interface, which is conducive to the rapid exchange of electrons and protons at the interface. Meanwhile, the electrons can be exported quickly in the charging-discharging process by rGO in electrode, which reduces the internal resistance of the device. The total energy conversion efficiency of 14.21% was obtained by using composite materials in integrated photovoltaic-storage device. It is expected to provide a new direction for the design of energy storage materials for the integrated photovoltaic-storage device.
