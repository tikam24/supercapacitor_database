Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) is a highly convenient and demonstrated industrial operation for the manufacture of surface coatings. Recent years are seeing increasing evidence in using this technique to produce energy storage electrodes (notably for lithium-ion batteries, solid-state devices, supercapacitors, and flow batteries), but their advancement for industrialisation remains unclear. Using activated carbon (AC) as an exemplary supercapacitor material, this study reports the practical aspects of porous energy storage electrodes produced by the EPD technique. Practical electrodes with commercially viable parameters are shown, specifically high density active material (in excess of 9.8 mg cm−2) and very thick coating layer (about 168 μm). Research investigations including colloidal electrolyte formulations, electrode deposition parameters and cell performance testing are reported. Materials and electrode properties were studied by various charactersisation tools. Prototype A7 sized pouch cells were assembled and tested to show evidence of practical EPD electrodes in a commercial cell format. Electrochemical performance of EPD over slurry casting is presented. In short, this research shows the successful production of practical EPD electrodes for electrochemical energy storage, which is directly relevant for scale-up industrial adoption and can be applied as a platform electrode manufacturing technology for any battery and supercapacitor materials.
