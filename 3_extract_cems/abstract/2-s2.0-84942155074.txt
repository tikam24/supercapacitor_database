NiWO4/reduced graphene oxide (NWG) nanocomposite was successfully synthesized through a facile one-pot solvothermal method for the first time. The resulting nanocomposite is composed of NiWO4 nanoparticles that are uniformly attached on graphene sheets by in situ reducing. The as-prepared NWG composite has been systematically characterized by Powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectra, Raman spectroscopy, Thermogravimetric analysis, Scanning electron microscopy, Transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectra, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis. The capacitive performances of the as-prepared NWG composite as electrode material are investigated. It is found that the NWG composite exhibits a high specific capacitance up to 1031.3 F g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1. The greatly enhanced capacitive performance of the NWG electrode can be attributed to the synergetic effect of NiWO4 nanoparticles and RGO, which provides conducting channels and active sites. The cyclic stability tests demonstrated no decreases of its initial values after 5000 cycles, suggesting that such hybrid electrode possesses a great potential application in energy-storage devices.
