With the increasing demand for portable electronic devices, renewable energy products and electronic vehicles, the interest in electrochemical energy storage (EES) devices become increasingly noticeable. When we think about the performance of an energy storage device, the first thing that comes to our mind is the electrode material. Various materials such as metal oxides, conducting polymers and carbon-based materials have been widely used as electrode materials for energy storage and conversion devices, and great achievements have been made. Due to the tremendous properties of transition metal nitrides (TMNs), like high conductivity, best electro-catalytic activity, huge volumetric energy density as well as adaptable structure, they can be used as capable electrode materials for a broad range of EES devices but the realistic implementation of TMNs is hindered due to restricted active sites, deprived synthetic flexibility and durability as well as insufficient capacitance. However, when TMNs are composited, they possess superior EES properties, due to increased active sites, enhanced electrochemical stability with high synergistic effects which improves ion and electron transport. Therefore, it is essential to methodically review the exploration and state-of-the-art modifications in TMNs-based materials, as there are not much detailed reports unifying the recent application of TMNs. In this review, we have focused on the recent trends of TMNs and their composites that affect advanced EES systems including lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), and supercapacitors (SCs).
