This research addresses the current control of an energy management system (EMS) for reused lithium-ion battery (RLIB). RLIB in parallel with an ultracapacitor (UC) is connected to the dc-link by a dc/dc boost converter. One daily energy consumption of aeration pumps in wastewater treatment plant is illustrated. Aeration pumps use most electricity in the plant. This topology is utilized to enhance the system peak power and reduce the depth of discharge (DoD) of RLIB in the acceleration/deceleration of aeration pumps. The converter used here boosts the voltage of ultracapacitor up to the same level of RLIB side so that their current can be regulated to meet the demand, particularly peak power of pump. Here, the state-space averaging method and Lyapunov stability theory are applied in EMS to manage the power flow between RLIB and UC. For alternatively managing demand load current, switch S1 and S2 is configured between the UC, RLIB and dc-link. EMS is used to carry out the current control between these two switches. A simulation is performed to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme of EMS. Besides, the comparison of topologies with and without auxiliary switch S2 based on the same load current pattern is also discussed. In conclusion, current control of EMS for RLIB is developed and used in the acceleration/deceleration process of aeration pumps in wastewater treatment.
