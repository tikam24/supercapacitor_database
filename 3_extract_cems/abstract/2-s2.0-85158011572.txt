The development of supercapacitor electrodes based on waste biomass can overcome high production costs. Biomass-based carbon electrodes rich in oxygen have wettability characteristics, which present a hydrophobic surface in an electrolyte solution system that improves the performance of supercapacitor cells. This research focuses on the conversion of sugar palm midrib (SPM) which become activated carbon (AC) through a KOH impregnation with percentages of 5%, 10%, and 15% from 30 g of carbon powder from SPM; furthermore, the AC undergoes a pyrolysis process. The resulting electrode has a cross-linked nanosphere structure with interconnected nanofibers and a high amorphous level. Furthermore, the electrode had the highest atomic and weight percentages of oxygen content of 21.91% and 19.12%, respectively, of the SPM-10 sample. Also, the measurement of the electrochemical properties of SPM obtained the highest specific capacitance of 210 Fgâˆ’1 owned by the SPM-10 sample. Therefore, the contribution of physical and electrochemical properties showed that the SPM biomass, which is rich in oxygen, improves the performance of the supercapacitor cell, which is environmentally friendly and sustainable.
