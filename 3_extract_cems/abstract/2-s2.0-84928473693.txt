We present grafting of polycarboxyphenyl polymer on the surface of multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) via a free radical polymerization and subsequent anchoring of the metal oxide nanoparticles for the evaluation of their potential applicability to supercapacitor electrodes. Here, metal oxide nanoparticles, Feand Sm were created after the oxidation of metal precursors Sm(NOand FeCl respectively, and attached on the surface of polycarboxyphenyl-grafted MWCNT (P-CNT) in aqueous medium. This approach shows a potential for enhancing the dispersion of Feand Smnanoparticles on the wall of P-CNT. The structure and morphological characteristics of the purified MWCNT, P-CNT, and metal oxide-anchored polycarboxyphenyl-grafted MWCNT (MP-CNT) nanocomposites were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The electrochemical performance of the purified MWCNT electrode, P-CNT electrode, and MP-CNT electrodes was tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge discharge in a 1.0 M HOaqueous electrolyte. The results showed that the specific capacitance of the purified MWCNT was 45.3 F/g at the scan rate of 5 mV/s and increased to 54.1 F/g after the modification with polycarboxyphenyl polymer. Further modification of P-CNT with Smand Feimproved the specific capacitance of 65.84 F/g and 173.38 F/g, respectively, at the same scan rate.
