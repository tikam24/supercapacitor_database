Supercapacitors are in great demand owing to necessity of clean and sustainable energy. Alternately, waterborne microbial infections are prime cause of diseases. So, there is demand for synthesis of novel materials with multifunctional adaptability. Herein, heterostructured TiO2–Mn3O4 composite nanorods were synthesised by two-step methods. In first step, TiO2 nanorods were prepared using electrospinning and by hydrothermal method Mn3O4 nanoparticles were attached to TiO2 surface. The composite heterostructure was described using sophisticated procedures such as X-ray diffraction, Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy, Scanning electron and Transmission electron microscopy. Antimicrobial studies were probed against Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus pathogens. The results demonstrated that TiO2–Mn3O4 composite has more heightened antimicrobial activity than pristine TiO2. Additionally, the synthesised TiO2–Mn3O4 composite was implied as an electrode for supercapacitors. The definite capacitance of TiO2–Mn3O4 nanocomposite calculated at a potential scan rate of 5 mV/s was as amplified as 470 Fg−1.
