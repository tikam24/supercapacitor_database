Sheet-like Co3S4 nanomaterial with high purity was synthesized via a facile and easily controlled one-step hydrothermal route. The structure and morphology of the as-synthesized sample was characterized by x-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and field emission scanning electron microscopy, respectively. The Co3S4 nanosheets with a mean size of 10 nm or so were used as electrode material and the supercapacitor property was determined. The results show that the specific capacitance of the Co3S4 nanosheets reaches 1037 F/g at 1 A/g. After 3000 charge-discharge recycles, the remained specific capacitance of the supercapacitor is 978 F/g, which is 94.3% of its initial value. The experiments indicate that the Co3S4 supercapacitor possesses high specific capacitance and excellent cyclic stability, which suggests its potential application in supercapacitor.
