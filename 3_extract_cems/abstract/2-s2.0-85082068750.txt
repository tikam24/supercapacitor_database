Ti3C2T x, a novel two-dimensional layer material, is widely used as electrode materials of supercapacitor due to its good metal conductivity, redox reaction active surface, and so on. However, there are many challenges to be addressed which impede Ti3C2T x obtaining the ideal specific capacitance, such as restacking, re-crushing, and oxidation of titanium. Recently, many advances have been proposed to enhance capacitance performance of Ti3C2T x. In this review, recent strategies for improving specific capacitance are summarized and compared, for example, film formation, surface modification, and composite method. Furthermore, in order to comprehend the mechanism of those efforts, this review analyzes the energy storage performance in different electrolytes and influencing factors. This review is expected to predict redouble research direction of Ti3C2T x materials in supercapacitors.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]
