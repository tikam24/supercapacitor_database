Unique nanostructures always lead to extraordinary electrochemical energy storage performance. Here, the authors report a new strategy for using Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) derived cobalt sulfide in a carbon matrix with a 3D honeycombed porous structure, resulting in a high-performance supercapacitor with unrivalled capacity of ≈1887 F g-1 at the current density of 1 A g-1. The honeycomb-like structure of Co9S8@C composite is loosely adsorbed, with plentiful surface area and high conductivity, leading to improved Faradaic processes across the interface and enhanced redox reactions at active Co9S8 sites. Therefore, the heterostructure-fabricated hybrid supercapacitor, using activated carbon as the counter electrode, demonstrates a high energy density of 58 Wh kg-1 at the power density of 1000 W kg-1. Even under an ultrahigh power density of 17 200 W kg-1, its energy density maintains ≈38 Wh kg-1. The hybrid supercapacitor also exhibits suitable cycling stability, with ≈90% capacity retention after 10 000 continuous cycles at the current density of 5 A g-1. This work presents a practical method for using MOFs as sacrificial templates to synthesize metal-sulfides for highly efficient electrochemical energy storage.
