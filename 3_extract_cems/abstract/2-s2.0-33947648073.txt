This paper presents the design, realization and power management of an Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) dedicated to vehicle applications. The proposed APU is based on a parallel arrangement of a Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell (PEFC) and a supercapacitor bank. Using such an arrangement, the PEFC provides only the mean power to a 42V DC embedded bus, whereas the supercapacitors bank is sized to respond to the electrical power requirements during transients.
