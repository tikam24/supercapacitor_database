Hierarchical ZnO@metal-organic framework @polyaniline (ZnO@MOF@PANI) core-shell nanorod arrays on carbon cloth has been fabricated by combining electrodeposition and hydrothermal method. Well-ordered ZnO nanorods not only act as a scaffold for growth of MOF/PANI shell but also as Zn source for the formation of MOF. The morphology of ZnO@MOF@PANI composite is greatly influenced by the number of PANI electrodeposition cycles. Their structural and electrochemical properties were characterized with different techniques. The results indicate that the ZnO@MOF@PANI with 13 CV cycles of PANI deposition demonstrates the maximum specific capacitance of 340.7 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1, good rate capability with 84.3% capacitance retention from 1.0 to 10 A g−1 and excellent cycling life of 82.5% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at high current density of 2.0 A g−1. This optimized core-shell nanoarchitecture endows the composite electrode with short ion diffusion pathway, rapid ion/electron transfer and high utilization of active materials, which thus result in excellent electrochemical performance of the ternary composite.
