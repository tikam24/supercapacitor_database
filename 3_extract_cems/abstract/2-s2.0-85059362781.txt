In this study, the utilization of TCL as raw material in production of carbon supercapacitor electrodes are focused on variations in carbonization temperature. Carbonization temperatures were varied by 500 °C, 600 °C, 700 °C, and 800 °C marked with the code TCL500, TCL600, TCL700 and TCL800 corresponding to the selection of carbonization temperature. All samples were activated using CO 2 gas at 850 °C for 2 hours and 30 minutes. The density of the resulting carbon electrode was 0.776 gcm -3 , 0.754 gcm -3 , 0.738 gcm -3 and 0.762 gcm -3 for electrodes TCL500, TCL600, TCL700 and TCL800, respectively. The crystalline nature of the resulting carbon sample was found to be amorphous with 2θ 23.880°, 44.192° scattering angle, and stacking high (L c ) 8.482 Å for TCL700 samples. L c data has been used to obtain a sample surface area and it was found as high as 1160.497 m 2 g -1 . The morphology of the electrode surface has been tested using a SEM instrument. The elements content of the electrode have also been analyzed based on the EDS data. The optimum specific capacitance of carbon electrodes from TCL is obtained at a carbonization temperature of 700 °C as high as 54 Fg -1 .
