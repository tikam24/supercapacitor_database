The efficient utilization of natural biomass as renewable raw materials is of importance. We herein prepared porous carbon fibers (PCFs) by activation of the extracted cellulose microfibers from the agriculture byproduct of corn straw. Different from the porous carbons (PCs) by directly activating straw, the obtained PCFs had typical one-dimensional morphology with high surface area (2013 m2 g−1) and large pore volume (1.27 cm3 g−1). The influence of the ZnCl2/cellulose mass ratio on the electrochemical performance was studied, and the optimized PCF(1:1) possessed a much higher specific capacitance than the PC(1:1) sample, which was attributed to the improved specific surface area as well as the fiber-like morphology where it had short ion diffusion route and small interfacial resistance in comparison to PCs. PCFs have a high specific capacitance of 230 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, and 183 F g−1 was retained at 20 A g−1 (79.6%), revealing an excellent rate capability. The assembled symmetrical supercapacitor exhibited a wide potential window of 1.8 V, small electrochemical impedance, and superior cycle performance. Moreover, a high energy density of 16.0 Wh kg−1 was obtained at a power density of 450.4 W kg−1, which was preserved of 6.9 Wh kg−1 at a high power density of 14,194.3 W kg−1.
