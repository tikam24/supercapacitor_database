Transition metal sulfides are ideal electrode materials for supercapacitors, which have been widely studied in the field of supercapacitors. Compare to solid structure, hollow nanospheres structures apparently have more advantages in specific surface area, high pore volume, and surface permeability. Herein, NiCo2S4 hollow nanospheres were synthesized by sacrificial template method and ion exchange method using Cu2O cubic as template. NiCo2S4 as a promising electrode for supercapacitors, benefiting from its unique morphology and structure as well as the synergistic effect of transition double metal sulfides, it exhibits a high specific capacity of 893 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, and a long cycle life is 81.49% after 2500 cycles. In addition, the fabricated NiCo2S4//activated carbon asymmetric device delivers a high energy density of 45.7 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 800.0 W kg−1, indicating that the NiCo2S4 hollow nanospheres as a promising potential in high performance supercapacitors.
