In order to prepare a high energy density supercapacitor, multi-heteroatom modified porous carbon materials derived from biomass were adopted. The fabricated supercapacitor demonstrated an excellent energy density of 35 W h kg-1 and a high operating voltage window of 1.9 V in neutral Na2SO4 solution, exhibiting performance that is among the best of the current carbon materials.
