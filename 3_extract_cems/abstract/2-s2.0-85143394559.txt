This paper illustrates characteristics comparison between lithium-ion battery and supercapacitors (SC's) with regards to their applicability as the energy source for the power management systems in portable/wearable ultra-low-power devices. The internal structure, performances, and technical features of SC's are compared with lithium-ion batteries. This comparison will address some remarkable shortcomings of lithium-ion battery systems. Furthermore, some weakness and limited performances of SC's are also identified and the solution are presented. Proposed SC-based smart watch circuit diagram is promoted as well. The purpose of this article is to propose the substitution of SC's rather than li-ion batteries in portable gadgets that do not use power continuously during the day.
