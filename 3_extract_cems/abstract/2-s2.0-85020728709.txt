In this paper, novel control strategies are proposed for a hybrid renewable energy system under a standalone environment. The wind unit, solar unit, supercapacitor (SC), and battery are connected to a DC link through power converters. Control methods are proposed to mitigate the limitations of the standalone system. The control method is proposed to maintain constant DC link voltage under different conditions without using a dummy load (i.e. an electrolyzer). The SC and battery are used as storage devices. A novel control scheme is proposed to control storage devices where the SC is used to improve the slow response of the system under battery storage. A novel optimal power point tracking control algorithm is proposed in place of maximum power point tracking to provide the demanded power without using extra components and control. Simulation results under different environmental and operating conditions are presented.
