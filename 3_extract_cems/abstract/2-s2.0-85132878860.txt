The mechanochemical synthesis of nitrogen-rich nanoporous carbon materials has been scaled up using an extruder. Lignin, urea, and K2CO3 were extruded under heat and pressure to yield nanoporous carbons with up to 3500 m2 gâˆ’1 specific surface area after pyrolysis. The route was further broadened by applying different nitrogen sources as well as sawdust as a low-cost renewable feedstock to receive carbons with a C/N ratio of up to 15 depending on nitrogen source and extrusion parameters. The texture of obtained carbons was investigated by scanning electron microscopy as well as argon and nitrogen physisorption, while the chemical structure was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The received carbon was tested as a supercapacitor electrode, showing comparable performance to similar ball-mill-synthesized materials. Lastly, the space-time yield was applied to justify the use of a continuous reactor versus the ball mill.
