The electric charge storage properties of amorphous cellulose nanofiber (ACF) supercapacitors with different metal carboxylate radicals (COOM; M: Na(I), Ca(II), Al(III)) was investigated in terms of charging/discharging behaviours, alternating current impedance analysis, and plane-wave-based first-principles density functional calculations. Na-ACF exhibited a higher storage effect than Ca- and Al-ACFs. The charge storage mechanism for an Na-ACF supercapacitor was proposed using an electric double layer model in a C12H17O11Na electrolyte with an electrical resistivity of 6.8 × 103 Ω cm, based on the migration of protonic soliton. The supercapacitor, which demonstrated fast charging upon voltage application, could illuminate a white LED for 7 s after charging with 10 mA at 18.5 V.
