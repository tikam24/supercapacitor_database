The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, the cyclic voltammetry, and the constant power discharge methods have been applied to establish the electrochemical characteristics for the electrical double-layer capacitor consisting of the 1 M (C2H5)3CH 3NBF4 electrolyte in acetonitrile. The microporous carbon was synthesised by the hydrothermal carbonization method from D-(+)-glucose and subsequent pyrolysis and carbon dioxide activation steps. The total specific surface area (SBET ≤ 1539 m2 g-1), micropore surface area (Smicro ≤ 1534 m2 g-1), total pore volume (Vtot ≤ 0.694 cm3 g-1) and the pore size distributions, obtained from the N2 sorption data and using the non-local density functional theory, have been correlated with the electrochemical characteristics for electrical double-layer capacitors as the region of ideal polarizability (ΔE ≤ 3.0 V), characteristic time constant (0.34 s) and the series capacitance (126 F g-1), dependent on the carbon activation conditions, have been calculated. © 2014 The Electrochemical Society.
