A nanocomposite electrode composed of polyaniline and graphene oxide (PANI-g-GO) was prepared by grafting polyaniline chains onto aniline-functionalized graphene oxide deposited on TiO2 nanotubes/Ti electrode. The surface morphology of the fabricated electrode was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and their electrochemical activity was investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). TEM and SEM results revealed that the PANI nanoparticles were uniformly loaded on the graphene sheets. The PANI-g-GO/TiO2 nanotubes/Ti electrodes exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 816 F g−1 at a current density of 7.0 A g−1 with 88 % capacitance retention after 2000 charge/discharge processes in 1.0 m H2SO4 solution, which is attributed to the synergistic effect of PANI/GO, good covalent bonding between PANI/GO, and a unique nanocomposite microstructure with high surface area.
