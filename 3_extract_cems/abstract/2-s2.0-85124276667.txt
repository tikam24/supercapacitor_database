Hierarchical, ultrathin, and porous NiMoO4@CoMoO4 on Co3O4 hollow bones were successfully designed and synthesized by a hydrothermal route from the Co-precursor, followed by a KOH (potassium hydroxide) activation process. The hydrothermally synthesized Co3O4 nanowires act as the scaffold for anchoring the NiMoO4@CoMoO4 units but also show more compatibility with NiMoO4, leading to high conductivity in the heterojunction. The intriguing morphological features endow the hierarchical Co3O4@NiMoO4@CoMoO4 better electrochemical performance where the capacity of the Co3O4@NiMoO4@CoMoO4 heterojunction being 272 mA·h·g-1 at 1 A·g-1 can be achieved with a superior retention of 84.5% over 1000 cycles. The enhanced utilization of single/few NiMoO4@CoMoO4 shell layers on the Co3O4 core make it easy to accept extra electrons, enhancing the adsorption of OH- at the shell surface, which contribute to the high capacity. In our work, an asymmetric supercapacitor utilizing the optimized Co3O4@NiMoO4@CoMoO4 activated carbon (AC) as electrode materials was assembled, namely, Co3O4@NiMoO4@CoMoO4//AC device, yielding a maximum high energy density of 53.9 W·h·kg-1 at 1000 W·kg-1. It can retain 25.92 W·h·kg-1 even at 8100 W·kg-1, revealing its potential and viability for applications. The good power densities are ascribed to the porous feature from the robust architecture with recreated abundant mesopores on the composite, which assure improved conductivity and enhanced diffusion of OH- and also the electron transport. The work demonstrated here holds great promise for synthesizing other heterojunction materials M3O4@MMoO4@MMoO4 (M = Fe, Ni, Sn, etc).
