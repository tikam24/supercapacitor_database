The need for materials for high energy storage has led to very significant research in supercapacitor systems. These can exhibit electrical double layer phenomena and capacitances up to hundreds of F/g. Here, we demonstrate a new supercapacitor fabrication methodology based around the microphase separation of PS-b-PMMA which has been used to prepare copper nanoelectrodes of dimension ~13 nm. These structures provide excellent capacitive performance with a maximum specific capacitance of ~836 F/g for a current density of 8.06 A/g at a discharge current as high as 75 mA. The excellent performance is due to a high surface area: volume ratio. We suggest that this highly novel, easily fabricated structure might have a number of important applications.
