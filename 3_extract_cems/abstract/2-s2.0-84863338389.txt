In this work, we prepared activated carbon-based symmetric supercapacitors using Li 2SO 4 aqueous electrolyte instead of H 2SO 4 and KOH, and obtained devices with an improved working voltage of 1.6 V from 1.0 V. Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charging/discharging measurements were used to study the electrochemical properties. The results showed that the electrode specific capacitance can reach 129 F·g -1, and the energy density can be as high as 10 Wh·kg -1 at a power density of 160 Wh·kg -1. Electrochemical impedance analysis measurements showed that the charge-transfer resistance of the capacitors decreased markedly with the increase of the concentration of Li 2SO 4, and the rate capability improved accordingly. The leakage current of the supercapacitor was 0.22 mA after constant-voltage charging at 1.6 V for 1 h, and the columbic efficiency was nearly 100%. The capacitance of the supercapacitor remained above 90% after 5000 charge-discharge cycles. Activated carbon-based supercapacitors using Li 2SO 4 aqueous electrolyte have many advantages, such as high working voltage, high energy density, and environmental compatibility, and therefore have good industrialization prospects. © Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.
