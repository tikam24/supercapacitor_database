Electrochemical supercapacitors as an energy storage device have become trademark in current electronic, medical and industrial applications, as they are sources of impressive power output. Supercapacitors supply fast power output, suitable to cover the energy demand of future electronic devices. Electrode material design is a subject of intense research in the area of energy development and advancement, due to its essential role in the electrochemical process of charge storage and the cost of capacitors. The nano-dimensions allow for more electroactive sites, different pore size distributions, and a large specific surface area, making nanostructured electrode materials more promising. Electrode materials based on metal oxides, metal nitrides, and metal carbides are considered ideal for highly efficient electrochemical supercapacitors. Recently, much effort has been devoted to metal nitride-based electrodes and their diverse compositions as they possess higher electrical conductivity and better corrosion resistance, electrochemical stability, and chemical reactivity. Among these, titanium nitride (TiN), possesses high electrochemical stability, outstanding electrical conductivity, and a unique electronic structure. Nanocomposites based on titanium nitrides are known to deliver higher electrochemical performance than pristine nanostructured TiNs due to potential synergetic effects from both the materials. In this paper, recent advancements made in the field of nanostructural TiN electrode materials for SCs are reviewed along with their challenges and future opportunities. Additionally, some of the major techniques involved in the synthesis process are discussed, along with some basic concepts.
