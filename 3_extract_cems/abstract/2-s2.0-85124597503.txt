Supercapacitor was a safe and reliable green energy storage device with high power density, fast charging and discharging speed, of which the electrode material was the key to its performance. Due to the advantages of high carbon content, wide source and low cost, renewable lignin could be used to prepare lignin-based carbon electrodes for supercapacitors by activation, template and spinning, which had a good development prospect. The lignin-based activated carbon electrode, template carbon electrode and carbon fiber electrode for supercapacitor were introduced in this paper. The research on lignin-based carbon electrode for supercapacitors was summarized and prospected, which provided reference for the structure design and preparation of new high-performance electrode materials for supercapacitors.
