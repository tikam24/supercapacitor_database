The present work highlights the effective H–π interaction between metallocenes (ferrocene; Fc) and graphene and their stabilization in the presence of polyaniline (PANI) through π–π interactions. The PANI-stabilized Fc@graphene nanocomposite (FcGA) resembled an intertwined network-like morphology with high surface area and porosity, which could make it a potential candidate for energy-storage applications. The relative interactions between the components were assessed through theoretical (DFT) calculations. The specific capacitance calculated from galvanostatic charging/discharging indicated that the PANI-stabilized ternary nanocomposite exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 960 F g− at an energy density of 85 Wh Kg−1 and a current density of 1 A g−. Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis confirmed the low internal resistance of the as-prepared nanocomposites, which showed improved charge-transfer properties of graphene after incorporation of Fc and stabilization with PANI. Additionally, all electrodes were found to be stable up to 5000 cycles with a specific capacitance retention of 86 %, thus demonstrating the good reversibility and durability of the electrode material.
