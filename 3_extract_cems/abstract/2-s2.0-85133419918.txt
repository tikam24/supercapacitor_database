Two-dimensional (2D) heterostructure electrode materials have recently attracted great interest in supercapacitors because of their unique features. Herein, we report molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) intercalated Siloxene heterostructure based all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) for an energy harvester-storage system. The interlaying spacing of the Siloxene sheets in the heterostructure is expanded due to the MoS2 intercalation and the synergistic behaviour, which are fruitful for the higher charge storage performance of the fabricated SSC device. The density functional theory calculation results prove the enhanced conductivity of the Siloxene@MoS2 heterostructure. The fabricated Siloxene@MoS2 device exhibits a device capacitance of 133.5 F g–1 with an energy density of 31.3 Wh kg–1. Besides, the supercapacitor device has excellent cyclic stability of 89.3% after 15,000 cycles. The energy stored from an inertial energy harvester is successfully utilized for real-time application, confirming the practical usage of the constructed energy harvester-storage system. The outcome of the work demonstrated that the Siloxene@MoS2 heterostructure could be a promising candidate for high-performance supercapacitors and provides a novel strategy to design Siloxene material with other pseudocapacitive for future energy storage devices.
