Composites of cobalt oxide with activated carbon (AC) and multi wall carbon nano tubes (MWCNTs) were synthesised using hydrothermal method. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has revealed the Co3O4 nano phase well embedded over the AC and MWCNTs matrices. Materials were further characterised using FTIR measurements. Cyclic voltammetry and charge discharge experiments were carried out in 1 M KOH solution. Both the materials have shown superior electrochemical properties and good long time cycle ability. The Co3O4 with MWCNTs composite (Co3O4/MWCNTs) has shown better electrochemical characteristics compared to the composite of Co3O4 with AC (Co3O4/AC) due to the symmetric entanglement of the materials all over the MWCNT surface. The discharge specific capacitance of Co3O4/AC and Co3O4/MWCNTs composites was obtained as 620 and 788 Fgâˆ’ 1 respectively. The electrochemical performance of the materials was modelled using electrochemical impedance modelling and the results revealed the presence of unsaturated surface charge over the composite electrode surface.
