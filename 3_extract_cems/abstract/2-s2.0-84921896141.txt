Distributed power generation networks and Autonomous Renewable Energy Systems (ARES) are gaining much popularity as renewable energy sources for a vital part in such systems. The reliability and the efficiency of such systems can be greatly increased by connecting energy storage devices. Supercapacitor based energy storage system is used to mitigate the power quality problems as they are capable of providing necessary energy bursts for a very short period. Sizing of supercapacitor bank is an important step towards design of such systems. This study presents a simple methodology to be adopted for sizing the supercapacitor bank based on basic parameters. Proposed method is verified by experimental results to demonstrate the use of the suggested methodology and also the use of such energy storage devices for its application in short term energy storage requirements.
