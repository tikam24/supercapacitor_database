The two-dimensional Co(OH)2 nanosheet is regarded as a potential electrode material, because of its high theoretical capacity and abundant reserves. Nevertheless, deficient electroactive sites and low intrinsic conductivity restrict its long-term development. Herein, the S-Co(OH)2@NrGO composite electrode is constructed by convenient and green sulfur control and graphene encapsulation strategies, which result in 63% improvement of electrochemical active surface area compared with pure Co(OH)2. Verifiably, the incorporation of S could transform morphology to expose more active sites and tune the electronic environment around Co to enhance intrinsic conductivity, and NrGO encapsulation could further contribute to high conductivity and maintain the stability of the material. Accordingly, the as-obtained S-Co(OH)2@NrGO provides a favorable specific capacity of 183 mAh g−1, nearly 9 times increasement compared with bare Co(OH)2, with excellent rate performance. The as-assembled S-Co(OH)2@NrGO//rGO hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) delivers an impressive energy density of 67.9 Wh kg−1 at 749.8 W kg−1 and achieves 90% capacity retention after 6000 GCD testing cycles. The coupled strategies open new channels for the preparation of advanced electrode materials.
