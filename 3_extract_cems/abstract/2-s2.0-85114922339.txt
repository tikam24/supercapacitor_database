Hollow-structured conducting polymers such as polypyrrole microspheres (PPy MSs) and polypyrrole microtubes (PPy MTs) have attracted ever-growing interests as pseudocapacitive materials for supercapacitors. However, the poor cyclic stability heavily impedes their practical applications. Herein, the rational design of hollow core-shell polypyrrole@poly(1,5-diaminoanthraquinone) composites is reported to enhance the capacitance performance of PPy microspheres and microtubes. Both PPy@PDAAQ microspheres and microtubes showed much higher specific capacitance, rate capability and cycling stability than the corresponding PPy cores. Owing to the higher aspect ratio, the PPy@PDAAQ MTs exhibited better electrochemical performance than the PPy@PDAAQ MSs, possessing specific capacitance of 533 F g−1 at the current density 1 A g−1, rate capability of 57.0% even at a high current density of 10 A g−1 and cycling stability of 107.4% after 10,000 cycles. This strategy is expected to offer valuable inspiration for the development of electrode materials with high performance.
