Abstract: Coupling the merits of transition metal-oxide with graphene for the application in energy-storage has received great attention. Herein, NiO loaded nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (NiO/N-rGO) composites were synthesized through facile and effective hydrothermal method. The as-synthesized NiO/N-rGO were designed as high effective electrode materials for the application in a supercapacitor. Electrochemical performance of the as-synthesized NiO/N-rGO composites displays that the specific capacitances reach up to 233 F g–1 at 1 A g–1 in 6 M KOH. This paper may support a facile method for the synthesis of transition metal oxide and graphene composites which may be applied as electrode materials for supercapacitors.
