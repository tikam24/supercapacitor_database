The bimetal-organic frameworks (bi-MOFs) were used as a template for preparing nanoporous carbons (NPCs) by a novel annealing strategy combing rapid heating (300 °C/min) and direct activation at CO2 atmosphere. The prepared NPC-300-900 sample with high heating rate exhibited a higher specific surface area (652.36 m2 g−1) and larger pore size (Vmeso = 0.28 cm3 g−1) than the normal annealed sample (heating rate 5 °C/min), which resulted in a higher capacitance and a superior rate capability. The results indicated that the NPC-300-900 samples showed excellent electrochemical properties in aqueous electrolyte. Its specific capacitance was 253 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1, while the value could remain 120 F g−1 even at 20.0 A g−1. Therefore, this work may shed new light on designing novel porous carbon for supercapacitor applications.
