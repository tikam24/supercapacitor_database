Newly developed functional materials for energy storage have attracted considerable attention because of rapidly increasing global energy consumption and environmental problems. In this study, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride was used as a precursor to a three-dimensional (3D) carbon sponge (CS). Subsequently, the sea urchin-like cobalt-nickel carbonate hydroxide (NiCo–CH) was anchored on CS by a hydrothermal method, using urea as a stabilizer and alkali source. The obtained CS/NiCo–CH composite demonstrated excellent electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 643 F g−1 (1 A g−1) and outstanding cycle stability (84.2% of the initial capacitance was retained after 3000 charge/discharge cycles). In addition, an asymmetric supercapacitor constructed using CS/NiCo–CH and activated carbon as positive and negative electrodes, respectively, exhibited a high specific capacitance of 131.6 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and high energy density of 38.4 Wh kg−1 at 724.1 W kg−1. The proposed CS/NiCo–CH composite may be used for electrochemical energy storage.
