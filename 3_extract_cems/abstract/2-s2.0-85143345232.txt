A hybrid supercapacitor has been developed successfully using graphene sheets/vanadium(V) oxide nanoparticles (NPs) composite as electrodes to activate maintainable electrochemical performance. Graphene nanosheets were obtained using the liquid phase exfoliation technique. The composite of graphene sheets/vanadium(V) oxide nanoparticles with different matrices were examined using field emission scanning electron microscopy. The images showed that the NPs are distributed on the entire graphene sheets making a fabulous architecture with porous sphere shapes and rough surfaces. The electrochemical measurements exhibit a high capacitance value of âˆ¼ 3515 F/g and high energy density and power density of 12.53 Wh/kg and 170 kW/kg, respectively. The stability of each sample was also reported and it was found that decreasing the amount of NPs added to the composite, led to increase the stability of the supercapacitor after 10,000 cycles. These encouraging results show great potential in developing energy storage devices with maintaining the percentage of materials in the hybrid structure in order to achieve high energy and power densities for practical applications.
