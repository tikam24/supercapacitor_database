The oxide coatings (Ir0.2Mn0.6Sn0.2O2) were prepared by thermal decomposition on Ti substrate at different temperature. The influence of the annealing temperature on capacitive performance of the Ti/Ir0.2Mn0.6Sn0.2O2 electrode was investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results are shown that: Mn3O4 could be crystallized only at 320 °C, which was lower than those of hydroxides, and hydroxyoxides or oxysalts of manganese calcined at about 1000 °C in air. The Ti/Ir0.2Mn0.6Sn0.2O2 electrode prepared at 340 °C was favor to form a certain amount of amorphous phase and nano-crystalline phase at the same time, which exhibited good electronic conductivity and proton conductivity. The maximum specific capacitance was 207 F/g, which increased about 37% than that of Ti/IrO2[sbnd]SnO2 electrode. The charge-transfer Rct of the Ir0.2Mn0.6Sn0.2O2 coatings first decreased and then increased with the increasing annealing temperatures. The excellent capacitance performance, power characteristics and the volt-ampere power could be also obtained at the same time. The homogeneously distributed conductive nanocrystalline particles in the amorphous matrix can greatly improve the electronic conductivity of the coatings, but it did not sacrifice the proton conductivity.
