Supercapacitors have attained a special stance among energy storage devices such as capacitors, batteries, fuel cell, and so forth. In this state-of-the-art overview on green synthesis approaches and green materials for supercapacitors, the cutting-edge green polymer/nanocarbon nanocomposite systems were explored by focusing on the design and related essential features. In this regard, various polymers were reconnoitered including conjugated polymers, thermosetting matrices, and green-cellulose-based matrices. Nanocarbon nanomaterials have also expanded research thoughtfulness for green-technology-based energy storage devices. Consequently, green polymer/nanocarbon nanocomposites have publicized fine electron conduction pathways to promote the charge storage, specific capacitance, energy density, and other essential features of supercapacitors. Future research directions must focus on the design of novel high performance green nanocomposites for energy storage applications.
