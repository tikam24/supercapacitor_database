Flexible supercapacitors (FSCs), as a class of flexible energy storage devices, have attracted considerable interest in recent years. Conjugated polymers are a class of promising organic electrodes for FSCs since they demonstrate high flexibility and excellent electrochemical performance. In this chapter, we will introduce the working mechanism of supercapacitors including electrical double-layer capacitor (EDLC) and pseudocapacitors firstly, as well as the electrode structures in FSCs. Chemical structures and energy storage mechanism of conjugated polymers including typical conducting polymers (CPs), emerging conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and conjugated polymers-based composites will be summarized secondly. Conjugated polymers-based FSCs with multidimensional architectures including one dimensional (1D) fiber-shaped structures, two dimensional (2D) planar structures, and three dimensional (3D) hydrogel will be reviewed. The typical fabrication process and electrochemical performance of these FSCs will be analyzed. The major challenge of conjugated polymers-based electrodes such as poor cyclic stability, relatively low device efficiency, and effective strategies for solving those problems will be finally proposed.
