We report a polyaniline-hyaluronic acid (PANI-HA) hydrogel that combines rigid conducting polymer with flexible HA. The supramolecular assembly of PANI and HA via boronic acid bonds yields PANI-HA hydrogel with unique microstructure, electrical conductivity and hydrophilicity and exhibits excellent supercapacitor performance and electrochemical sensing for immunoglobulin G (IgG). The PANI-HA hydrogel electrode shows high specific capacitance (369 F g−1, with 0.5 A g−1 current density) and good cycling stability (85% capacity retention after 1000 galvanostatic charge–discharge cycles). In addition, the PANI-HA hydrogel-based electrode can also be used as an electrochemical biosensor for IgG detection, and the presence of highly hydrophilic HA supports low-fouling target analysis. The modified electrode exhibits good sensitivity, wide detection range (0.1 ng mL−1–10 μg mL−1), and a low detection limit (0.043 ng mL−1) for IgG detection. We demonstrate a strategy to fabricate supramolecular hydrogel-modified electrodes and explore their potential applications in supercapacitors and biosensors.
