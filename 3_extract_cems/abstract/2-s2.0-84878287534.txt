Poly (3-hexylthiophene)/graphene composites are synthesized via both in-situ and ex-situ growth technique to investigate supercapacitive behavior. From the microstructural, absorption and photoluminescence spectra it is seen that in-situ growth of P3HT forms better composites with graphene. Galvanostatic charging/discharging and cyclic voltammogram are investigated and the results are compared for both ex-situ and in-situ synthesis. The values of specific capacitance at a current density of 200 mA g-1 for ex-situ and in-situ samples are found to be 244 F g-1 and 323 F g-1 respectively. It is seen that in-situ growth sample gives better results. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
