We used electrochemical exfoliation to construct graphite nanosheet (GNS) arrays, in which the varying number of nanosheet layers were parallel to each other and perpendicular to the carbon substrate. Hydrous ruthenium oxide (RuO2·xH2O) was then loaded directly on the surface of nanosheets using cathodic reduction electrodeposition, resulting in the formation of RuO2·xH2O/GNS composite array electrodes. Electrochemical measurements showed that the composite array electrodes exhibited excellent capacitive behaviors, and achieved specific capacitance values as high as 4226 F·m-2 in the potential window up to 0.9 V, with a scan rate of 5 mV·s-1 in 0.5 mol·L-1 H2SO4 solution. The RuO2·xH2O/GNS composite array electrodes showed good cycling abilities, and maintained 94.18% of their maximum performance after 20000 cycles. © Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.
