Single pot solvothermal synthetic procedure was followed for easy synthesis of n-TiO 2 /n-Gr composite for supercapacitor. FTIR, XRD, XPS and FESEM were executed to access the chemical nature, interaction, growth and morphology of the samples. In both three and two electrode arrangement, n-TiO 2 /n-Gr leads to 937.5 F/g and 633.75 F/g specific capacitance (SC) respectively. Enhanced SC may be due to facile electron carry-over in n-TiO 2 deposited n-Gr surface. This superior SC complemented with high energy density (ED) of 46.25 Wh/kg and power density (PD) 3999.51 W/kg. This composite also retains about 87% retention of SC after 5000 successive chargeâ€“discharge rounds. However, in organic electrolyte (1 M TEABF 4 in acetonitrile) with two-electrode testing configuration, the composite showed an energy density of 225.33 Wh/kg with high power density of 1599.7 W/kg. N doped in both TiO 2 and graphene enhanced the compatibility and electrochemical performances of electrode material and makes it a potential candidate for supercapacitor.
