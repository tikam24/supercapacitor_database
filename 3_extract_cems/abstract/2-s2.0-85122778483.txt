Nanostructured electrode materials for supercapacitors have attracted research interest due to their high power density and long cycle life. Herein, porous flower-like magnetite (Fe3O4) nanostructures have been synthesized using ethylene glycol mediated iron alkoxide as a precursor material. The magnetite nanostructures are prepared by heating an iron alkoxide at 450 °C for 3 h under N2 atmosphere. The prepared porous nanostructure is polycrystalline with a high surface area of 186 m2 g−1 and existence of pores with a pore volume 6.6 nm. The electrochemical capacitance performance of Fe3O4 nanostructures has been evaluated. The high discharge capacitance is 183 F g−1 at 1 A g-1 with high capacitance retention of about 65% upon charge–discharge cycling after 5000 cycles have been observed. The high discharge rate and cyclic stability are attributed to the porous nature of the Fe3O4 nanostructures. As Fe3O4 is inexpensive, relatively non-toxic, and environmental friendly nature has potential application for supercapacitors.
