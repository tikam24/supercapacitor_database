A polythiophene-aluminium oxide nanocomposite is prepared by in situ chemical polymerisation in presence of anionic surfactant camphor sulfonic acid (CSA). The characterisation of nano composite was done by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), surface morphology was studied using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). The electrochemical performance is evaluated using cyclic voltammetry in 1M H2SO4. As an electroactive material, it exhibits high specific capacitance of 654.5 and 757 F/g for PTH and PTHA nanocomposites at scan rate of 30mV s-1 respectively.
