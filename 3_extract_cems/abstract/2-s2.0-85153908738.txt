Designing materials for electrochemical energy storage with short charging times and high charge capacities is a longstanding challenge. The fundamental difficulty lies in incorporating a high density of redox couples into a stable material that can efficiently conduct both ions and electrons. We report all-organic, fused aromatic materials that store up to 310 mAh gâˆ’1 and charge in as little as 33 s. This performance stems from abundant quinone/imine functionalities that decorate an extended aromatic backbone, act as redox-active sites, engage in hydrogen bonding, and enable a delocalized high-rate energy storage with stability upon cycling. The extended conjugation and hydrogen-bonding-assisted bulk charge storage contrast with the surface-confined or hydration-dependent behavior of traditional inorganic electrodes.
