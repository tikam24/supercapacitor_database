To meet the increasing demand for electric vehicles, this paper presents a novel concept to enhance the energy generation performance of piezoelectric energy harvesters used as charging stations on roads. A lever-type piezoelectric energy harvester with a deformation-guiding mechanism was designed and fabricated to overcome the existing limitations of low electrical output and low durability of piezoelectricity under extremely low road displacement conditions of 1 mm. The proposed harvester achieved a maximum output power of 60.3 mW at a load resistance of 50 kÎ© under an input displacement of 1 mm. Thus, the module's electrical performance was significantly higher than that obtained in previous similar studies. The proposed harvester had 467% higher output power than the previously proposed vibration type road energy harvester. For the energy storage test, a 0.08 F supercapacitor was charged up to 5.09 V (1 J) in 170 min. The results prove that the energy generated by the proposed harvester can be potentially used as a power source for electric vehicles on smart roads beyond the power supply of various sensor systems on the road.
