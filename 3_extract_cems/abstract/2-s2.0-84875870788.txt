In this study, the ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetraflouroborate (EMI-BF4) was synthesized and purified using the liquid/ liquid fractional distillation method to apply a supercapacitor. EMI-BF4 was extracted with dichloromethane from the liquid/liquid extraction method in acidic, neutral, and alkali conditions for removal of impurity, and then the electrical capacities of the purified ionic liquids were measured and compared. The electrical capacities of ionic liquids under acidic condition showed higher value than those of neutral or alkali conditions. As the ratio of ionic liquid to solvent became higher, the electrical capacity value was increased.
