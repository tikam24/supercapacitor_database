The conceptualization of Electric vehicles has been significant in solving the pollution due to the transportation problem. However, its design and working has not yet been perfected and can be optimized. An effective model of the electric vehicle is the integration of batteries and supercapacitors. In this paper, the optimal sharing of energy between the battery and the supercapacitor is provided by the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The results reveal that the proposed algorithm can better share the energy between the hybrid sources. The simulations are carried out in MATLAB Simulink platform and the results obtained for ECE-15 driving cycle is presented.
