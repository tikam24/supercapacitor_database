Orthorhombic molybdenum trioxide (α-MoO<inf>3</inf>) nanowires as an electrode for electrochemical supercapacitors in ethylammonium nitrate (EAN) electrolyte exhibits a high specific capacitance of 288 Fg<sup>-1</sup>, which is 8 times higher than the specific capacitance obtained from MoO<inf>3</inf> nanowires in water based electrolyte. MoO<inf>3</inf> nanowires in EAN electrolyte exhibit energy density of 46.32 Wh kg<sup>-1</sup> at a power density of 20.3 kW kg<sup>-1</sup> with outstanding cycling stability with specific capacitance retention of 96% over 3000 cycles. We believe that the superior performance of the MoO<inf>3</inf> nanowires in EAN based electrolyte is primarily due to its relatively low viscosity (0.28 P at 25 °C), high electrical conductivity (20 mS cm<sup>-1</sup> at 25 °C) and large working voltage window. The results clearly demonstrate that EAN as electrolyte is one of the most promising electrolyte for high performance large scale energy storage devices.
