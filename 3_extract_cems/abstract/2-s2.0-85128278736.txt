Reduced Mo-doped NiCo2O4 (R-Mo-NiCo2O4) was facilely prepared through a dual-defect strategy. Mo-doped NiCo layered double hydroxide (Mo-NiCo-LDH) was used as the precursor and calcined in an air atmosphere, and the resultant Mo-doped NiCo2O4 (Mo-NiCo2O4) was further reduced by NaBH4. The number of oxygen vacancies in the obtained R-Mo-NiCo2O4 is significantly increased by both Mo doping and NaBH4 reduction, resulting in greatly enhanced electrical conductivity and facilitated charge transfer. Finally, the R-Mo-NiCo2O4 was used as the electrode material in supercapacitors, which displayed greatly improved electrochemical performance, such as higher specific capacity (285.8 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1), rate capability (86.1%) and cycling stability (87.4% retention after 5000 cycles).
