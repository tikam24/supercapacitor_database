Metal hydroxide serving as a promising electrode material for the supercapacitors, has attracted considerable interests in the area of energy storage. However, the low cycling stability and electrical conductivity restrict its further application. Here, a kind of hollow-cubic Ni(OH)2/CuS2 with excellent electrochemical performance has been prepared via a facile one-step sacrificial template method. The obtained Ni(OH)2/CuS2 shows an outstanding specific capacitance of 1174 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with 73.9% retention after 2000 charge–discharge cycles. Furthermore, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitors based on hollow-cubic Ni(OH)2/CuS2 nanocomposite and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) exhibits a high specific energy density of 27.8 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 390 W kg−1.
