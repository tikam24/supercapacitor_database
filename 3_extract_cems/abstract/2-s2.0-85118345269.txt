The rational structure design of the electrode materials is critical to achieve high-performance supercapacitors. In this contribution, a structure of carbon-coated MnCO3@MnO2 (MnCO3@MnO2@C) hierarchical hollow nanostructures is obtained through redox reaction on the basis of Kirkendall effect. The hollow structure and the coating of carbon layer provides a space and utilization rate of materials for charge storage in electrochemical energy storage. The electrode demonstrates an electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 267 F g−1 and a retention rate of 83.6% after 8000 cycles at 1A g−1. When the MnCO3@MnO2@C is used as positive electrode combined with hollow carbon sphere as the negative electrode, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor displays a power density of 3840 Wkg−1 and energy density of 21.3 Wh kg−1, 78.2% of capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 2 A g–1.
