To design and prepare novel composites with strong electrode structure and superior electrochemical performances via a facile and convenient synthesis method is a significant challenge to develop the high-performance materials for energy storage and conversion devices. Herein, we fabricated a novel hybridization of two dimensional (2D) Ti3C2-MXenes nanosheets and one dimensional (1D) nickel-cobalt sulfide (NiCo2S4) hollow nanotubes though the favorable electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged Ti3C2 and positively charged NiCo2S4 nanotubes. The electrode combined the good metallic conductivity of Ti3C2-MXenes and high pseudo-capacitance of NiCo2S4 demonstrated the outstanding electrochemical performance for supercapacitors. Herein, 2D Ti3C2-MXenes/1D NiCo2S4 hybrid electrode achieved an excellent specific capacitance of 1927 F g-1 at 2 mV s-1, long cycling stability for 4000 cycles and charming rate performances, which is mainly ascribed to the synergistic effect and interfacial interaction between two components. Particularly, the novel hybrid material with 1D and 2D hierarchical structures can provide additional electrochemical reaction sites, supply shorter paths for ions diffusion and electron transport, and effectively raise the charge transfer kinetics during the electrochemical process, which explores a new strategy aimed to develop 2D Ti3C2-MXenes energy storage devices with high electrochemical performance, and is possible potential for expansion into other application fields.
