The present study discusses the importance of catalyst selectivity for the preparation of homocoupling polymers for CO2 gas adsorption and supercapacitor applications. N, N′-bicarbazole based conjugated porous organic polymers (TGs) have been synthesized through sonogashira (TGPd/Cu), glaser (TGCuCl) and Eglington (TGCu(OAc)2) protocols. Here, TGPd/Cu acquired high specific surface area (923 m2 g−1), uniform pores (2 nm), and excellent CO2 adsorption (16.1 wt%). The synthesized TG polymers was utilized as efficient electrode for supercapacitor studies. TGPd/Cu exhibits a maximum capacitance of 248 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 current density. To enhance the electrochemical performances, the prepared TGs melded with single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) and the fabricated TGPd/Cu/SWCNT electrode demonstrates a maximum specific capacitance of 523 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 current density with an outstanding cycling stability of 98.1% after 5000 cycles in three electrode system. The fabricated TGPd/Cu/SWCNT device showed a capacitance of 129 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 with high-capacity retention of 82.5% after 5000 cycles in two electrode system. Consequently, TGPd/Cu/SWCNT appear to be promising electroactive material for use as electrode in electrochemical energy storage systems. The satisfactory electrochemical performance can be attributed to the successfully π- π stacking of the TGPd/Cu onto the nanotube surface and the synergy between TGPd/Cu and highly conductive SWCNT which significantly advanced the electron transport properties of the explored composites.
