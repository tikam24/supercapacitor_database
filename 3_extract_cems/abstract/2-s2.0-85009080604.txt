The undulate bulk Ni3S2 with porous surface was obtained on bare Ni foam after hydrothermal process, while plume-like Ni3S2 was formed on the surface of Ni foam with the thermal reduced graphene oxide (rGO) due to catalysis action of thermal rGO. The Ni3S2 on Ni foam with rGO showed better electrochemical performance than Ni3S2 on Ni foam. In addition, Ni3S2 on Ni foam with rGO also improved long-cycle stability. This made it become a good current collector in energy storage applications. The reason for the improvement of the supercapacitor performance of Ni3S2 on Ni foam with rGO was discussed.
