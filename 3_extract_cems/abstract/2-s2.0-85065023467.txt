In this work, three dimensional self-supported Co3O4@Ni3S2 nanowire arrays on nickel foam substrates are prepared by a multi-step method. The as-synthesized product harvests the advantages of the high electrical conductivity of the Co3O4 nanowire arrays, large surface area provided by the Ni3S2 nanosheets, and the efficient ion diffusion pathway offered by the self-supported structure. The sample is subsequently used as the electrode material for supercapacitors, at a current density of 2 mA cm−2 a charge storage capability of 2.41C cm−2 (5.5 F cm−2) was achieved. When the sample is charged and discharged at 50 mA cm−2 for 10000 cycles, a stable capacity of 0.86C cm−2 (1.5 F cm−2) can still be maintained at the end of the test. Such a performance is better than those values reported in the literature obtained with similar systems even at a lower current density. We also assemble an asymmetric supercapacitor by pairing the Co3O4@Ni3S2 nanoarrays with activated carbon, and it shows good cyclability over 10000 cycles. The device yields energy densities of 65 and 32.3 Wh kg−1 at power densities of 361 and 9090 W kg−1, respectively. Furthermore, it is able to light up 12 red light-emitting diodes, showing promising potential for practical applications.
