This paper describes and evaluates a hybrid propulsion system based on diesel generator and supercapacitors (SCs) as energy storage system (ESS) for a rubber tyre gantry (RTG) container crane, which currently operates within the yard of the Algeciras port terminal (Spain) powered by diesel electric generator for supplying the electric drives and motors (hoist and trolley). The SCs, which are connected to the DC bus through a bidirectional DC/DC converter, are controlled by a control strategy based on the DC-bus voltage. The SCs reference current is limited depending on their state-of-charge (SOC). All main components and control strategy of the RTG crane are modelled and simulated in SimPowerSystems. The current and hybrid configuration are simulated and compared under the real working cycle of the RTG crane. The results show the technical viability, the validity of the proposed control strategy, the improvements in the energy efficiency and diesel fuel consumption, and the economic viability of the hybrid propulsion system for the RTG crane.
