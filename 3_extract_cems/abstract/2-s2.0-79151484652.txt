In this work, we report a low-cost technique via simple rapid-mixture polymerization of aniline using graphene oxide (GO) and graphene papers as substrates, respectively, to fabricate free-standing, flexible GO-polyaniline (PANI) and graphene-PANI hybrid papers. The morphology and microstructure of the obtained papers were characterized by FESEM, FTIR, Raman, and XRD. As results, nanostructural PANI can be deposited on the surfaces of GO and graphene papers, forming thin, lightweight, and flexible paperlike hybrid papers. The hybrid papers display a remarkable combination of excellent electrochemical performances and biocompatibility, making the paperlike materials attractive for new kinds of applications in biosciences.
