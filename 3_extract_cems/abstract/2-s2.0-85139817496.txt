In this work, ternary-doped hierarchical porous carbons (HPCs) were prepared from the durian kernel (DK) via one-step KOH activation. Due to abundant heteroatoms in DK as well as KOH activation, the DK-derived activated carbons exhibit cheese-like morphology with hierarchical porous structure, large specific surface area and high N/O/S multi-doped content, triggering the excellent electrochemical performance as electrode materials in supercapacitor and lithium-ion battery. The novel N/O/S multi-doped HPC (DKAC-700) electrode, which is assembled in a symmetrical supercapacitor using 6 M KOH electrolyte, achieves a high specific capacitance of 330 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1, as well as 96.7 % capacity retention after 10,000 cycles at 2 A g−1. Additionally, the lithium-ion battery using DKAC-700 as an anode exhibits an excellent rate capability (541 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and 139 mAh g−1 at 20 A g−1) and cycling stability (capacity retention of 91.9 % after 250 cycles). This study significantly facilitates the application of biowaste-derived carbons in high-performance energy storage devices.
