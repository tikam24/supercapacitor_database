The paper presents an analytical model for supercapacitor loading when used in a power defined load scenario. The needed load power is defined as a combination of constant power and linearly increasing or decreasing segments. The analytical expression for the supercapacitor voltage and current under this scenario are presented along with some simulations and experimental results to verify the presented formulas.
