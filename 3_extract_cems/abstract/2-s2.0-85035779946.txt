Electrochemical capacitors, also called supercapacitors, due to storage by using either ion adsorption or fast surface redox reactions. They can complement or replace the batteries in electrical energy storage and harvesting applications, when high power delivery or uptake is needed. A notable improvement in performance has been achieved through recent advances in understanding charge storage mechanisms and the development of advanced nanostructured materials. BaTiO3 based ceramics attracted extensive interest in the field of supercapacitor research due to its high dielectric and ferroelectric properties such as supercapacitor. This ceramics sintered using advanced processes provides a high control of grain boundaries in bulk composites. As a result, supercapacitor behavior was evidenced which came from the balance between inner grain conductivity and grain boundary dielectric barrier. Modern semiconductor integrated circuits require low-voltage capacitors which can store high electric energy in a minimum volume. In the fast development of the power electronics, dielectric materials with high energy-storage density, low loss, and good temperature stability are eagerly desired for the potential application in advanced pulsed capacitors. In this paper, the properties of BaTiO3 based dielectric and ferroelectric ceramics for the use of energy storage devices and supercapacitors are reviewed in detail. Their advantages, disadvantages, and performance in supercapacitors are also discussed through extensive analysis of the literature, and new trends in material development.
