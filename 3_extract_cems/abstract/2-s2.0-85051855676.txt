Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–polystyrenesulfonate and manganese oxide (PEDOT:PSS/MnO 2 ) hybrids were prepared via a facile solvothermal method coupled with an oxidative polymerization route. The effects of the reaction temperature and the KMnO 4 -to-organic monomer (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene, EDOT) ratio on the morphology, structure, and electrochemical properties of the materials were investigated. The optimized composites comprised homogeneous nanorod-like structures and exhibited overwhelmingly high conductivity (36 S cm −1 ) and superior supercapacitance—more specifically, they exhibited high-rate capability. The electrochemical properties of the nanocomposites were investigated using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling. The prepared hybrids showed a high capacitance of 365.5 F g −1 at a current density of 1 A g −1 , a good rate performance of 325.4 F g −1 at 20 A g −1 (capacitance retention of 89%), and excellent cycling stability with approximately 80% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g −1 in a 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte.
