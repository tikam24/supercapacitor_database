Polymer nanocomposites has been widely applied for many applications, especially in automotive and packaging industries. Another highly potential application of polymer nanocomposites is for energy, which includes energy generation and energy storage. Among the types of mostly applied nanofiller for nanocomposites in energy application are metal oxides, nanoclays, carbon nanotubes, and graphenes. Their unique properties especially very high electrical conductivity as well as environment stability, thermal conductivity, and good mechanical strength are very desirable for improving existing energy-related devices, as well as paving ways for new generation of smart energy devices. In this chapter, recent advances in polymer nanocomposites as smart materials for energy application are discussed. Their applications are discussed into two main categories, which are energy generation and energy storage such as thermoelectric generators, solar photovoltaic cell, supercapacitor, fuel cells, and hydrogen storage. Several challenges in the development of polymer nanocomposites in energy application are also highlighted, especially in term of filler dispersion as well as its environmental impact during operation. Future direction of polymer nanocomposites as smart material for energy application is bright and is expected to become one of the important catalyst for the advancement of highly efficient and innovative energy devices.
