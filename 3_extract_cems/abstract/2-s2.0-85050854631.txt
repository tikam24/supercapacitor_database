Nowadays, Graphene is under intensive study for energy storage devices, such as battery and supercapacitors, due to its superior physical and electrochemical proprieties. The commercial methods to produce graphene are mechanical peeling, oxidation and reduction (ROX) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and so forth, but there is still a big challenge for mass production of graphene, and the restacking of graphene sheet impedes the application in preparing supercapacitors. In this paper we report a novelty method to fabricate all-solid-state supercapacitors using laser-scribed Graphene (LSG). Laser-scribed Graphene, which is directly reduced from graphene oxide (GO), seems to be a promising material for manufacturing solid-state, flexible transparent supercapacitors in large scale. In our work, PVA/LiCI-H2O system is used for solid-state electrolyte, the supercapacitor reaches an area capacity âˆ¼2. lmF/cm2 at 0.8mA/cm2 with a good reversible ability and cycling performance.
