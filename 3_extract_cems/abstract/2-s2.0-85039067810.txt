Herein, we present a large-scale growth of porous hierarchical structure of three-dimensional (3D) flower-shaped nickel cobaltite (PFNC) nanosheets on Ni foam current collector with hardy adhesion as high-performance electrode for supercapacitors via facile hydrothermal method and then post annealing treatment. The availability of porous architecture increases the electroactive cites and facilitates speedy ion and electron conduction during electrochemical reactions. The prepared material shows an excellent specific capacitance of 2100 F g−1 (4.24 F cm−2) at 5 mV s−1 scan rate by cyclic voltammetry analysis. Overall results divulge that the binder-less PFNC electrode will be a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.
