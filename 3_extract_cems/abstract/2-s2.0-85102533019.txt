This paper describes the adaptive kernel width maximum correntropy criteria (AKWMCC) based control of 3-phase 4-wire grid-tied dual-stage PV-battery-Ultra-capacitor-fuel cell system. The proposed control extends the system proficiency to perform multifunctional operations such as load, grid voltage and power balancing, reactive power compensation, and power quality enhancement during various dynamic states i.e. the PV-side, grid-side, and load-side induced disturbances. The battery energy storage system (BESS) includes the lead-acid battery, fuel cell, and ultracapacitor manages the system irregularities of sudden and sustained nature. The system is simulated in MATLAB environment and found satisfactory as per IEEE 519 standards.
