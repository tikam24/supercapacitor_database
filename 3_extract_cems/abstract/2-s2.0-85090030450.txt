Materials with high specific energy and specific power, along with chemical and structural stability, are in huge demand due to their numerous applications, including solid-state electronic devices and wearable electronics. Nanocomposites comprising of both conducting and non-conducting polymers exhibit excellent charge transfer mechanism along with high dielectric strength and structural stability, which enhances their appropriateness as efficient energy storage materials. Herein, we explore the application of Nylon-6 (PA6), polyaniline (PANI) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) in preparing ternary nanocomposite (PA6/rGO/PANI) by varying the ratio of PA6 and PANI, for a fixed amount of rGO along with binary (PA6/PANI and rGO/PANI) nanocomposites. Among them, PA6/rGO/PANI 1:2 exhibits an excellent supercapacitance performance owing to its high surface area, low charge transfer resistance, high cyclic stability, and exceptional ionic rate capability. We have observed reasonable dielectric properties (viz., dielectric permittivity and dielectric loss), which is attributed to the stacking property of rGO with PA6 and PANI chains. The in-situ polymerization of PANI ensures the formation of well-dispersed nanocomposites with the hierarchical nanostructures, as revealed by the detailed morphological study. The galvanostatic charge-discharge measurement exhibits remarkable reversibility with capacitance retention of ~ 98%. The fabricated symmetric supercapacitor device based on PA6/rGO/PANI 1:2 exhibits noteworthy specific capacitance (38 F g−1), specific energy (~ 3.66 Wh kg‒1) and specific power (~ 234.84 W kg‒1), suggesting significant charge accumulation over the electrode surfaces, which is attributed to the synergistic effect of PA6 and PANI in the presence of rGO. The excellent electrochemical properties indicate its potential applications in self-powered electronic appliances effectively.
