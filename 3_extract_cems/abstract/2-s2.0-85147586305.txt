In this study, an EDLC type supercapacitor device followed by extra pseudo-capacitance properties has been synthesized by using spruce leaf waste as 3D-porous carbon source. Consistently, we investigated the effect of chemically activating ZnCl2 at 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 M on electrochemical and material properties. Through optimized porous carbon, their surface morphology is highly porous rich in 3D followed by high amorphousness. Furthermore, the 0.3 M ZnCl2 impregnated porous carbon elicited a faradaic redox reaction of self-doping heteroatoms that could increase the electrochemical capacitance. Through symmetric-system, the highest specific capacitance reaches 187 Fg−1 at 1 Ag−1 in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte.
