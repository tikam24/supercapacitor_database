Pearl-chain-like MnO2 arrays on Ti grid have been fabricated by a facile hydrothermal approach and further investigated as the binder-free electrode for high-performance supercapacitors. This unique well-designed binder-free electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance (313.6 F g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1), good rate capability (66.8% retention), and excellent cycling stability (92.4% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles). Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor is developed using the as-prepared MnO2 arrays as the positive electrode and activated microwave exfoliated graphite oxide (MEGO) as the negative electrode. The optimized asymmetric supercapacitor displays excellent electrochemical performance with an energy density of 24.9 W h kg-1 at power density of 224.7 W kg-1. These impressive performances suggest that the pearl-chain-like MnO2 array on Ti grid is a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.
