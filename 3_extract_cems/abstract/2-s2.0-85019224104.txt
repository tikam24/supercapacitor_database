In this paper, the surface hydrophilicity of carbon paper was modified by use of Caro’s acid, and MnO2 electrodeposited on carbon paper (CP) or surface-modified carbon paper (SMCP) were prepared through an anodic electrochemical deposition method. The attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra of CP, SMCP-30, SMCP-60, and SMCP-90 indicated that the peaks at 1054, 1214, 1722, and 3426 cm−1 correspond to the stretching vibrations of C–O, C–H, C=O, and –OH. Our study results show that with the extension period of oxidation treatment time, the corresponding content of these groups C–O, C–H, C=O, and –OH increased; then, their surface hydrophilic properties enhanced; and finally, their capacitances increased. This study results indicate that introducing these groups C–O, C–H, C=O, and –OH into the surface of electrode materials is an important strategy for improving their capacitances.
