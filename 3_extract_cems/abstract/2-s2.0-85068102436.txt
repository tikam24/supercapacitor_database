Given that conventional bulky electrochemical energy storage devices are too rigid and heavy to be considered wearable, developing fully integrated power systems is expected to accelerate the successful commercialization of smart electronic textiles. Although great achievements have been made for fiber-shaped energy storage devices, there remain key challenges pertaining to their fabrication efficiency, scalability, and stability. Herein, a general and highly efficient method is developed to continuously fabricate supercapacitor fibers with lengths of kilometers at high production rate up to 118 m/h through a simple one-step wet spinning method. Beneficial from the designed unique two-circle-in-one-circle architecture, the resulting supercapacitor fibers demonstrated high electrochemical stability even after being bended for 1 Ã— 105 cycles. As a demonstration, these continuous supercapacitor fibers were further woven into a flexible power scarf for large-scale applications in wearable electronics. This simple and scalable fabrication process combined with the unique structure provides a general and effective paradigm to design other fiber-shaped devices like sensors, batteries, and solar cells.
