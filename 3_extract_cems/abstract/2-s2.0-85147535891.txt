Shuttle-like vanadium selenide was prepared via carbonizing the vanadium-based metal organic frameworks for supercapacitors. Its morphology and structure were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm. Its electrochemical performance was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge test in three electrode configurations for supercapacitor. Compared with those in pure KOH electrolyte, the supercapacitive performances can be greatly enhanced when adding a certain amount of K3Fe(CN)6 in KOH. A high specific capacitance of 512 F g−1 can be achieved at a scan rate of 0.2 mV−1 in 1 M KOH + 0.02 M K3Fe(CN)6, while only 164 F g−1 can be obtained in pure 1 KOH electrolyte. Furthermore, the VSe2 also exhibits stable long-term cycling, 84.7% capacitance retention after 6500 cycles at a current density of 2 A g−1. Those results provide a facile yet effective method for high performance energy storage devices.
