The recent rapid growth in Metal-organic Frameworks (MOFs)-based supercapacitors (SCs) has reached the level where there is a need for meet the demand of portable and wearable electronic equipment. Herein, we focus on the recent progresses toward the MOFs-based flexible solid-state supercapacitors (FSSCs). Some pristine MOFs used for the FSSCs have been reported, but it is usually restricted by its low conductivity. Now, there have the three strategies to improve the conductivity of MOFs material: exploiting new pristine conductive MOFs, developing the different multifunctional MOFs-based composite materials and obtaining the MOFs-derived materials. In this review, the classification of MOFs-based material for FSSCs electrode materials, together with the typical fabrication techniques for MOFs-based flexible devices, are totally discussed. A summary of the overall electrochemical performances and current development of the reported MOFs-based material assembled devices are presented gradually to predict the future tendency toward the actualization of an ultimate-performance MOFs-based FSSCs.
