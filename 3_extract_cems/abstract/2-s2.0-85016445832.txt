The paper presents the aspects related to the modelling of lead-acid batteries, including the description of the process of equivalent model parameter estimation. On top of this, the subject of the discussion included the issues which concern the analysis of vehicle energy consumption. The examples of calculations for the estimation of the model parameters were presented and on their basis, the detailed analysis of the batteryâ€™s behaviour while driving an electric vehicle was carried out. The tests were performed based on the recorded velocities of the vehicle moving within the built-up area in heavy traffic conditions. The behaviour of the battery was evaluated and the application of the hybrid energy storage consisting of battery and supercapacitor was proposed.
