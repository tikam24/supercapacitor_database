Cobalt-based metal-organic framework-67 (ZIF-67) represents an important metal-organic framework material that has shown promising applications in electrochemical energy storage. However, poor conductivity and the limited cycling stability restrict ZIF-67 from applications as a high-performance supercapacitor electrode. This work reports the successful growth of ZIF-67 on flexible and conductive textile carbon cloth through a facile dipping method. The ZIF-67 exhibits flake-like structure with lateral size of ∼1.5 μm and average sheet thickness varying from 115 to 300 nm. The strong integration of flake-like ZIF-67 with the highly conductive textile carbon cloth yields more than a three orders of magnitude enhancement of conductivity. As a result, the hybrid electrode composed of ZIF-67 on textile carbon cloth delivers a maximal areal capacitance of 1756 mF cm−2 in 2.0 M KOH aqueous solution, corresponding to a specific capacitance of 829 F g−1 for ZIF-67 at a mass loading of 1.9 mg cm−2. More importantly, an outstanding cycling stability with 103% capacitance retention is also achieved even after cycling the hybrid electrode at current density of 40 mA cm−2 for 15000 cycles.
