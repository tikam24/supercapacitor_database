To address the problem of DC bus voltage surge caused by load demand fluctuation in an off-grid microgrid, here, an adaptive energy optimization method based on a hybrid energy-storage system to maintain the stability of DC bus voltage is presented. The adaptive energy optimization method consists of three parts: the average filtering algorithm, extracting fluctuating power in demand load; the supercapacitor terminal voltage control, keeping the terminal voltage of the supercapacitor near reference; and the battery pack balance control, adjusting the charge/discharge to balance the state of charge for battery packs. In this proposed method, after extracting the fluctuating power by the low-pass filter when the demand load fluctuates, the battery packs release the power to offset the low-frequency fluctuation load and the supercapacitor to instantaneously compensate the high-frequency fluctuation power, to prolong the service life of batteries and maintain the stability of DC bus voltage. The effectiveness of the proposed adaptive energy optimization method is validated and is confirmed to maintain the stable operation of the off-grid microgrid, extend the cycle life of batteries in off-grid microgrid simulations and experiments.
