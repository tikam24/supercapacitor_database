In this study, graphene oxide (GO) was chemically reacted with sodium borohydride (NaBH4) to form reduced graphene oxide (rGO). rGO and rGO/Zn nanoparticle/polycarbazole (rGO/Zn/PCz) nanocomposite were synthesized by in situ chemical reactions. Nanocomposites were examined by scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDX) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy-attenuated transmission reflectance (FTIR-ATR). Supercapacitor device performances were taken as two-electrode configuration. Electrochemical measurements of supercapacitors were tested by galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). rGO/Zn/PCz nanocomposite shows increased capacitance (Csp = 33.88 F/g) compared to that of rGO (Csp = 20.78 F/g), PCz (12.57 F/g), and Zn/PCz (19.05 F/g) at the scan rate of 10 mV/s by CV method. Ragone plots were drawn to observe performances of supercapacitor devices. The enhanced capacitance results in high-power (P = 442.5 W kg−1) and energy-storage (E = 1.66 Wh kg−1) capabilities of the rGO/Zn/PCz nanocomposite material. Stability tests were examined for 1000 cycles by CV method.
