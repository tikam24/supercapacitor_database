3D printing graphene aerogel with periodic microlattices has great prospects for various practical applications due to their low density, large surface area, high porosity, excellent electrical conductivity, good elasticity, and designed lattice structures. However, the low specific capacitance limits their development in energy storage fields due to the stacking of graphene. Therefore, constructing a graphene-based 2D materials hybridization aerogel that consists of the pseduocapacitive substance and graphene material is necessary for enhancing electrochemical performance. Herein, 3D printing periodic graphene-based composite hybrid aerogel microlattices (HAMs) are reported via 3D printing direct ink writing technology. The rich porous structure, high electrical conductivity, and highly interconnected networks of the HAMs aid electron and ion transport, further enabling excellent capacitive performance for supercapacitors. An asymmetric supercapacitor device is assembled by two different 4-mm-thick electrodes, which can yield high gravimetric specific capacitance (Cg) of 149.71 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and gravimetric energy density (Eg) of 52.64 Wh kg−1, and retains a capacitance retention of 95.5% after 10 000 cycles. This work provides a general strategy for designing the graphene-based mixed-dimensional hybrid architectures, which can be utilized in energy storage fields.
