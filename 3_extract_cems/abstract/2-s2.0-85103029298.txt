Polyaniline (PANI) has been widely studied and used for the energy storage applications, especially in supercapacitors, this is due to their good pseudocapacitance properties, and it is easy for synthesis. In this study, we describe the effects of the electrodeposition applied potential on the electrochemical performance of polyaniline films. The electrodeposition of PANI films on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate is released by chronoamperometry technique using an electrolytic solution containing 0.3 M of aniline in 1 M H2SO4 at different applied potentials (i.e., + 0.8 V, + 0.9 V and + 1 V vs. SCE) for 300 sin time. All prepared films are characterized by different techniques scanning electronic microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and electrical conductivity measurement. For the application, the FTO/PANI films are used as material electrode in supercapacitor. The electrochemical performances are evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge tests, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. An important increase in specific capacitances is observed at 0.2 A g−1 from 54.8 F g−1 for FTO/PANI 0.8 film to 157.42 F g−1 for FTO/PANI 0.9 and 195.94 F g−1 for FTO/PANI 1.
