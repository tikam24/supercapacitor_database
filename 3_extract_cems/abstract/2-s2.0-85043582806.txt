In this study, tin sulfide (SnSx) thin films were prepared using a solution-based spin-coating method. The annealing temperature was observed to play a dominant role in determining the phase, crystallinity, and morphology of the SnSx thin films. The results obtained from X-ray diffraction, as well as optical and electrical measurements, revealed that the films annealed at 500 °C exhibit a pure SnS phase, with a carrier concentration and direct band gap of ∼1012 and 1.4 eV, respectively. To explore the applications of SnS in supercapacitors, electrochemical measurements were performed in a 0.2 M NaOH solution. The results indicated that films with a pure SnS phase have a high specific capacitance of 42 F g―1 at a current density of 2 A g―1. The synthesized SnS thin films demonstrate potential for applications in electrochemical capacitors and solar cells.
