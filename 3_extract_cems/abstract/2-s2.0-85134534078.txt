Promising hydrothermal synthesis and calcination strategy is used in manufacturing the 3D hierarchical MnCo2O4 @NiO nanosheets. This paper is a preliminary attempt to prepare a novel MnCo2O4 @NiO electrode through an effectual hydrothermal procedure, in which the nickel foam is used as a backbone structure. At a current density of 1 A g−1, the positive electrode material reveals a maximum specific capacitance of 1914 F g−1. The specific capacitance of MnCo2O4 @NiO remains 95.4% irrespective of 8000 cycles. The as-assembled supercapacitor (SC) exhibits an energy density of 40.04 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 770 W kg−1. The result of this research highlights the evidence of the 3D hierarchical MnCo2O4 @NiO structure for being an encouraging candidate for the forthcoming energy storage utilization.
