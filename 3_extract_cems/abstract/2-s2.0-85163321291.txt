Nickel-based metal-organic frameworks (Ni-MOFs) have attracted considerable attention as a potential electrode material for supercapacitors due to their unique structure, high specific surface area, and tuneable electronic and chemical properties. Herein, for the first time an N-trimellitylimido dicarboxylic acid linker is used to develop a novel Ni-MOF material via a simple solvothermal method. The prepared Ni-MOF nanoflakes are characterized using various techniques, including, NMR, XRD, SEM, TEM, and BET. The electrochemical performance of the Ni-MOF nanoflakes was investigated in 3M KOH aqueous electrolyte. The three-electrode measurements disclosed a specific capacity of 21 mA h at 1 A g−1. The supercapacitor achieved an energy density of 11 W h kg−1 and a power density of 6396 W kg−1, highlighting the superior energy storage capability of the Ni-MOF nanoflakes. Moreover, the supercapacitor retained nearly 89% of its capacity even after 3400 cycles, demonstrating good cycling stability and long-term durability. These results indicate that the conductive-layered Ni-MOF nanoflakes are a promising electrode material for practical applications in energy storage systems.
