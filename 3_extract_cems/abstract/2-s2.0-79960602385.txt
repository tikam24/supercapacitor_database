Polyaniline (PANI) thin films were successfully synthesized using the electrodeposition (ED) technique from a mixed solution of 0.2M aniline and 0.2M H2SO4. PANI films with thicknesses of 220 and 250 nm were synthesized. The formation of compact and amorphous PANI films was confirmed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. The electrochemical supercapacitor properties of the PANI films were examined using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements. A specific capacitance of ~473 Fg-1 at 1 mAcm-2 in a 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte was obtained for the PANI electrodes. The electrochemical stability of the PANI electrodes was investigated using cyclic voltammetry and charge-discharge measurements. Both the films were quite stable with 16% capacitance loss after a few initial charge-discharge cycles.
