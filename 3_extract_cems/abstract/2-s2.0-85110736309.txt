In this study, pristine nickel oxide (NiO) and Zn2+ doped NiO nanoparticles (NPs) are synthesised through the chemical precipitation method. Samples were analysed by TG/DTA, XRD, UV-DRS spectroscopy, FT-IR spectroscopy, SEM, EDX, TEM, SAED, VSM and CV techniques. The XRD result indicates that the obtained samples are face-centred cubic structure and hexagonal structure. SEM and TEM images established the spherical and hexagonal shape for the pristine and Zn2+ doped NiO NPs, respectively. A variation in the optical absorption and low energy bandgap was observed in pristine and Zn2+ doped NiO NPs. The NiO phase formation was confirmed by the existence of a peak at 492 cm−1 in FT-IR. The magnetic characterisation identifies the conversion of weak ferromagnetic to superparamagnetic behaviour of pristine and Zn2+ doped NiO NPs. The highest specific capacitance (Cs) of 667 Fg-1 at a 10 mV s−1 scan rate was obtained for 0.04 M, Zn2+ doped NiO NPs.
