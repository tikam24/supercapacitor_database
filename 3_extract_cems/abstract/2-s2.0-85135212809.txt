In this work, the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) devices with three different electrolytes including aqueous, organic, and gel polymer electrolytes have been fabricated to investigate and compare the potential window and the capacitive efficiency of the fabricated devices. The aqueous electrolyte includes potassium hydroxide (KOH, 6.0 M), the organic electrolyte is a solution of lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6, 1.0 M in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate (EC/DMC)), and the gel polymer electrolyte includes porous poly(acrylonitrile-polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane) membrane (P(A-POS)) moistened in 1.0 M solution of LiPF6 in EC/DMC. The positive electrode was a cobalt oxide-based electrode, i.e., Co3O4 nanoribbons (NRCo3O4), and the negative electrode was the activated carbon (AC). The specific capacitance of the supercapacitor with aqueous electrolyte (A-ASC) at the current density of 2 A g−1 is 88.0 F g−1, which has a higher specific capacitance than that of the supercapacitor with organic electrolyte (O-ASC) and the supercapacitor with gel polymer electrolyte (G-ASC). The gel polymer electrolyte for NRCo3O4//AC device shows a wide potential window of 4 V and low charge transfer resistance of 11 Ω. The specific capacitance of NRCo3O4//AC device with gel polymer electrolyte was 54.34 F g−1 at 2 A g−1, which is higher than the specific capacitance of O-ASC.
