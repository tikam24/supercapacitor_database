In this paper, we demonstrate a two-step method to transform Co-Co Prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanocubes into porous and hollow CoS 2 nanocubes. The morphology and microstructures of the synthesized CoS 2 hollow nanocubes were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and automatic micropore physisorption analyzer. Electrochemical capacitive properties of the synthesized CoS 2 hollow nanocubes were characterized by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests in alkaline aqueous solution (2 M KOH). Results show that the porous CoS 2 nanocubes have hollow and mesoporous structure with high specific surface area (113.9 m 2 g −1 ), and show a high specific capacitance of 936 F g −1 at the current density of 1 A g −1 . Also, the CoS 2 hollow nanocubes possess good power characteristics (the capacitance retention is 73.3% from 1 A g −1 to 20 A g −1 ) and good long-term cycling life with 83% specific capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 5 A g −1 . Additionally, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ACS) was assembled by using CoS 2 on carbon cloth and activated carbon (AC) on carbon cloth as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. The prepared ACS shows a high energy density of 34.68 Wh kg −1 at the power density of 356.9 W kg −1 , 25.74 Wh kg −1 remained at a power density of 7336.8 W kg −1 , and excellent rate performance (the capacitance retention is 74.2% from 0.5 to 10 A g −1 ). These indicate that the CoS 2 hollow nanocubes are good candidates for the next-generation high performance supercapacitor electrode materials.
