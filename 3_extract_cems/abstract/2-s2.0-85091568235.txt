For building an energy-saving and environmentally-friendly society, realizing sustainable development, seeking new energy development approach is becoming more and more important. P–FeS2/GNS (PFSG) has been synthesized through microwave-assisted approach and subsequently heat treatment with NaH2PO2·H2O, which is the first time applying for supercapacitor anode. As-synthesized PFSG owns high specific surface area and well electrical conductivity. When used as a battery-type anode of supercapacitor, PFSG displays a pretty high specific capacity of 246 mAh g−1 at 3 A g with a potential range of −1.1 to 0 V (vs.Hg/HgO) in 2 M KOH. Owing to the high specific capacity of the PFSG, the fabricated hybrid super capacitor PFSG//Ni(OH)2@Co9S8 shows an excellent energy density of 111 Wh kg−1 at an average power density of 1045 W kg−1. These results indicate that as-prepared PFSG is a promising candidate for energy storage in the future.
