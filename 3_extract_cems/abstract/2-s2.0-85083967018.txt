Nanoparticles of powder molybdenum sulphide (MoS2) are deposited on reduced graphene oxide-mesoporous manganese oxide nanocomposite which is represented as MoSGMn were prepared by feasible ultrasonic assisted deposition technique. The above prepared nanocomposite is further coated on Nickel foam substrate for direct application towards supercapacitor electrode fabrication. The detailed studies of thermal property and surface property such as thermal stability, surface structure and zeta potential measurements have been explained for all prepared nanocomposite samples. The thermal stability of as prepared sample stable upto 350 Â°C in oxygen atmosphere and negative zeta potential obtained for all prepared nanocomposite sample. The different amount of MoS2 nanoparticle (10mg -100 mg range) was utilized to study the effect of molybdenum sulphide addition on major mesoporous manganese oxide matrix. Increased quantity of MoS2 addition increase the electrochemical supercapacitance value of the nanocomposite coated nickel foam modified electrode.
