Cobalt oxide (Co3O4) nanoparticles (NPs) have been successfully synthesized by the hydrothermal method and the solution cast method used to prepare poly(vinyl alcohol)(PVA)/poly(vinyl pyrolidone) (PVP) with various weight percentages of Co3O4 polymer nanocomposites (PNCs). Structural and functional groups have been confirmed by powder XRD and FTIR spectral analyses. The surface morphological view of all the polymer nanocomposites has been investigated by FE-SEM analysis. The prepared PNCs have been examined by AC electrical conductivity, dielectric loss and dielectric constant studies. Also, the dielectric constant is high for PVA/PVP/1 wt% Co3O4 PNCs. Electrochemical properties have been studied for fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor (AC//PNC) device examined by using two-electrode system. The fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor device displayed an outstanding specific capacity retention of 89.75% after 5000 cycles and the Coulombic efficiency values reached over 99.45%. The prepared 1 wt% Co3O4 dispersed PVA/PVP composite has exhibited very low Rs and Rct values.
