Efficient renewable storage and replacement devices occupy an important place in the modern world in such a way the environment is unaffected. In today’s research, especially various metal oxides and nitrates are being employed in supercapacitor applications. In general, NiO, Ru2O, CoO, VO2, MnO, WO3 and its composites are used as electrode material. Transition metal oxide electrode materials having high conductivity and storage capacity are being used in supercapacitors. The co-precipitation method is used to synthesize manganese oxide nanoparticles. Tetragonal and cubic Mn3O4 and α-Mn2O3 were confirmed with crystallite size of 34.26 nm. Specific capacitance values calculated at 0.5 A/g are 184, 226 and 272 F/g. The overall capacity retention after the 2000 cycles was 71.38%. The cationic and anionic mixed surfactant-assisted manganese oxide electrode showed good 331 F/g capacitance at 10 mV/s with high conductivity and elevated charge transportation during redox reaction. The combination of surfactant-mediated nanostructures revealed that manganese oxide is an efficient electrode for energy storage compared to other surfactants.
