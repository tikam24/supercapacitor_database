FeS2 is a potential electrode material because of its abundant resources, low price and environmental protection. However, there are some problems when using FeS2 as an electrode material, such as poor reversibility and side reactions. In this study, the effects of different surfactants on the morphology and electrochemical properties of FeS2 synthesized by the hydrothermal method were discussed. Results show that FeS2 synthesized without surfactant is composed of pyrite and marcasite; FeS2 prepared by adding polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) is cubic pyrite, and PVP inhibits the formation of marcasite and promotes the crystal growth of pyrite; Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is similar to PVP, but PEG promotes crystal growth excessively and forms micron-scale flower-like spherical particles. FeS2 with hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) is cubic pyrite with the morphology of micro toothed spherical particles. CV and EIS showed that the reactions of the FeS2 electrode prepared by adding PVP, surfactant-free, CTAB and PEG were reversible, and the specific capacities were 82.20 F/g, 141.03 F/g, 191.68 F/g and 134.37 F/g at 5 mV/s, respectively. The electrochemical performance of FeS2 electrode material with CTAB was excellent, which was attributed to its lower charge transfer impedance and fast ion diffusion.
