In this work, a hybrid EPS for mini satellite is designed. It consists of solar array as a primary source and lithium-ion battery beside lithium-ion capacitor as a secondary source. The design is based on space qualified materials to provide high system efficiency and reliability. The power generation sizing is designed, the advantages of hybrid secondary source are presented. The system is presented using mathematical model on Matlab and the verification is done using Mathcad and Satellite Tool Kit (STK).
