Smart hydrogels with high electrical conductivity, which can be a real source of power while also collecting and storing the diverse sources of energy with ultrahigh stretchability, strong self-healability, low-temperature tolerance, and excellent mechanical properties, are great value for tailored wearable cloths. Considerable effort has been dedicated in both scientific and technological developments of electroconductive hydrogels for supercapacitor applications in the past few decades. The key to realize those functionalities depends on the processing of hydrogels with desirable electrochemical properties. The various hydrogel materials with such properties are now emerging and investigated by various scholars. The last decade has witnessed the development of high-performance supercapacitors using hydrogels. Here, in this review, the current status of different hydrogels for the production of flexible supercapacitors has been discussed. The electrochemical properties such as capacitance, energy density and cycling ability has been given attention. Diverse hydrogels, with their composites such as carbon-based hydrogels, cellulose-based hydrogels, conductive-polymer-based hydrogels and other hydrogels with excellent electromechanical properties are summarized. One could argue that hydrogels have played a central, starring role for the assembly of flexible supercapacitors for energy storage applications. This work stresses the importance of producing flexible supercapacitors for wearable clothing applications and the current challenges of hydrogel-based supercapacitors. The results of the review depicted that hydrogels are the next materials for the production of the flexible supercapacitor in a more sustainable way.
