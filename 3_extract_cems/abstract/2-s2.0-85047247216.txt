Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted significant attention for device applications due to their unique structural, electronic and catalytic properties. In this manuscript, worms like nanostructures of MoS2 were directly deposited in the form of thin films on a copper substrate using DC magnetron sputtering technique and further it is utilized as supercapacitor electrode without additional processing. The binder free MoS2 nanoworms symmetric supercapacitor device delivered a high capacitance (138 F/g at 1 A/g), excellent cycling ability (86% over 5000 cycles), along with high energy density (ED) and power density (PD). These observed excellent electrochemical performances of the present MoS2 nanoworms based electrodes, suggest its tremendous potential as supercapacitor electrodes in energy storage applications.
