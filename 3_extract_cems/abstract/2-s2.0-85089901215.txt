Distributed control is investigated to solve an electric vehicle switched optimal control problem faster than centralized control without significant performance change. The powertrain includes a cooling system, supercapacitor, and two switched mode components: a battery with discharging and charging modes and an electric drive with motoring and generating modes. Control-oriented component power flow models are developed with mode and temperature dependence. Component specific power and thermal management optimization problems, subject to these models, require solution for overall powertrain management. The power management problem is switched, having discrete-valued mode selection variables. Both problems are solved in a distributed manner using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). An ADMM-based algorithm to solve the switched powertrain management problem is proposed; it (i) solves the embedded version of the switched problem that relaxes discrete mode switch values to continuous values and (ii) projects embedded mode selection values onto discrete values and then solves the problem with now known mode selections. The distributed solution approach is demonstrated using a trapezoidal drive profile and three regulatory profiles. The regulatory results are compared to centralized control and the proposed algorithm achieved at least a 3.3 times improvement in solution time with comparable drive performance.
