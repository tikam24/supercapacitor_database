A novel hybrid fiber that MnO2 modified graphene sheets on graphene fiber has been fabricated by direct deposition of MnO2 onto graphene network surrounding graphene fiber (MnO2/G/GF). In this hierarchical structure, the graphene fiber with a sheath of 3D graphene network is coated with MnO2 nanoflowers. The 3D graphene on graphene fibers (G/GF) serves as highly conductive backbones with high surface area for deposition of nanostructured MnO2, which provide the high accessibility of electrolytic ions for shorten diffusion paths. An all-solid-state flexible supercapacitor based on a MnO2/G/GF hybrid fiber structure has been developed on the basis of the intrinsic mechanical flexibility of GF and the unique hierarchical structure. By combination of electric double layer capacitance of graphene network with the pseudocapacitance of MnO2 nanostructures, the all-solid-state fiber supercapacitor shows the much enhanced electrochemical capacitive behaviors with robust tolerance to mechanical deformation, promising for being woven into a textile for wearable electronics.
