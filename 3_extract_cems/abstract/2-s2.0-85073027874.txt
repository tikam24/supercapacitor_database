Bioinspired mineralization is a powerful method for designing and preparing nanomaterials. In this work, we developed a bioinspired mineralization approach under freezing conditions and fabricated methyl cellulose (MC)/NaHCO3 flake precursors with a sophisticated hierarchical structure. Based on this, amazing wing-like porous carbon sheets (WPCSs) assembled by numerous interconnected hollow carbon bubbles were obtained after carbonization and removal of inorganic crystals, which are seldom obtained by other artificial methods. Benefiting from their open framework, large surface area, and enlarged interlayer spacing of graphitized nanocrystallites, the obtained WPCSs exhibited an obvious boost in potassium storage performance. As an anode of potassium-ion batteries, they showed high reversible capacities of 347 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1 and 122 mAh g-1 at 20 A g-1 and relatively stable cyclability for 3000 cycles. The assembled WPCS//WPCS potassium-ion hybrid supercapacitor delivered a high energy density of 108 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 280 W kg-1. Given the cost effectiveness and green process, the modified bioinspired mineralization under freezing conditions would provide a facile and green way for exploring porous carbons with controlled structures and rich multifunction.
