A facile, low cost, and mass production strategy to prepare polyaniline (PANI)/molybdenum sulfide (MoSx) supercapacitor material was conducted via electrodeposition. PANI was electrodeposited on glassy carbon through chrono amperometry followed by electrodeposition of MoSx via chrono potentiometry from ammonium tetrathiomolybdate precursor. X-ray photoelectron spectrum, SEM, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopic analyses showed that PANI/MoSx had superior capacitance of 48.64 mF/cm2 at a current density of 56.62 ÂµA/cm2 and long-term stability without any degradation during the 150 cycles. The enhanced capacitance observed is attributed to the combination of electrochemical behaviors of PANI and MoSx.
