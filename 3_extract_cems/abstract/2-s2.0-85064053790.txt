Novel sandwich-like hollow nickel cobalt sulfides@carbon@nickel cobalt double hydroxides (CoNi 2 S 4 @C@NiCo-LDH) are synthesized using a facile microwave-assisted hydrothermal method and investigated as promising electrode materials for supercapacitors. The in-between highly conductive carbon layer simultaneously serves as uniform cover for CoNi 2 S 4 and large-area support for ultrathin NiCo-LDH, which can restrain the microstructure change during the cyclic charge-discharge process and enhance the transmission rate of electrons and electrolyte ions. The especially nanostructured CoNi 2 S 4 @C@NiCo-LDH nanocomposites exhibit outstanding supercapacitive performances including excellent gravimetric specific capacitance (1183 mAh g −1 at 1 A g −1 ) and high rate capability (85.8% retention rate at 20 A g −1 ). More importantly, the assembled CoNi 2 S 4 @C@NiCo-LDH//graphene asymmetric supercapacitor can deliver a superhigh specific capacitance of 550 mAh g −1 at 1 A g −1 , prominent energy density of 111.9 Wh kg −1 and long cycling stability with 93.8% of its initial capacitance after 10,000 cycles at 5 A g −1 .
