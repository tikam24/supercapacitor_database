Nanostructured V2O5/rGO nanocomposites were prepared by chemical reduction method process with different concentrations of V2O5 content to achieve electrochemical enhancement stability of supercapacitor electrode. In XRD interplanar spacing in rGO was observed at 0.34 nm and 0.21 nm, respectively, for (002) and (102) the smaller value of d spacing suggested the reduction of the oxygen functionalities bonded in rGO. The Raman parameter, ID/IG, varied from 1.08 to 1.05 indicating an unchanged carbon network as V2O5 content varied from 3 to 5 wt%. The FTIR results show the chemical bonding V–O–V, V=O, C=O, C=C and OH bonds, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry analysis reveals the maximum specific capacitance of 1052 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1. From GCD analysis achieve a high specific capacitance of 1126 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and exhibited excellent specific energy of 434 Wh kg−1 at a specific power of 50 W kg−1. Moreover, V2O5/rGO nanocomposite exhibited good cycle stability of 85.2% after 1000 charge–discharge cycles. V2O5/rGO and rGO nanocomposite are one of the best candidates for supercapacitor application.
