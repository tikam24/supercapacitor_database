Different carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt (NaCMC)-based pastes and hydrogels, both containing a salt as supporting electrolyte, have been prepared and characterized as potential solid state electrolyte (SSE) for solid electrochemical supercapacitors (ESCs).The characteristics of the NaCMC-based SSEs have been optimized by examining the influence of five different factors in the capacitive response of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) electrodes: i) the chemical nature of the salt used as supporting electrolyte; ii) the concentration of such salt; iii) the concentration of cellulose used to prepare the paste; iv) the concentration of citric acid employed during NaCMC cross-linking; and v) the treatment applied to recover the supporting electrolyte after washing the hydrogel. The specific capacitance of the device prepared using the optimized hydrogel as SSE is 81.5 and 76.8 F/g by means of cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge, respectively, these values decreasing to 60.7 and 75.5 F/g when the SSE is the paste.
