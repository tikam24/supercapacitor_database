Iron oxides are promising materials for application in supercapacitors owing to their high theoretical redox capacitance (2299 F g−1). Nevertheless, iron oxide nanostructures experience constant stress during cycling due to repeated expansion and contraction resulting in structural degradation. Such structural instability makes it challenging to develop freestanding and binder-free iron oxide-based electrodes with superior electrochemical performance. In this work, the authors report a facile way to fabricate iron-based carbon nanofibers using a simple and fast technique of electrospinning followed by an in situ electrochemical conversion. The final composite electrode consists of iron oxide embedded in carbon nanofibers which possesses a robust contact and support in addition to freestanding and binder-free nature. The electrodes exhibit a capacitance of 460 F g−1 at a galvanostatic discharge current density of 1 A g−1 and retains ∼82% of its capacitance after 5000 cycles in a wide negative potential window of 1.3 V. Extensive spectroscopic investigation is conducted to monitor phase transformation of the electrodes during oxidation and reduction to provide a understanding of the redox mechanism during electrochemical cycling.
