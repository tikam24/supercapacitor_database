Owing to both the high energy density and power density compared with traditional dielectric capacitors and batteries, supercapacitors as novel energy storage devices have attracted more and more attentions. Here, the transition metal ions were introduced by coordination of the chitin nanofibril (ChNF) with Cu2+; thus, Cu2+ was uniformly dispersed in the aerogel network constructed by chitin nanofibril, and then carbon nanofibril (CChNF)/cuprous oxide (CO) composites were prepared by carbonization. The diameter of CO with “sea urchin-like” structure in CChNF/CO was about 100 nm, uniformly distributed and wrapped by carbon nanofibrils. The as-prepared composites exhibited outstanding electrochemical performance. It delivered a maximum specific capacitance of 972.4 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, showing a promising strategy of fabricating supercapacitor materials.
