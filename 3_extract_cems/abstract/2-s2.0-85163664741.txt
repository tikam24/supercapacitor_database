This article employs the concept of regenerative braking (RB) in induction motor (IM) to extend the range of ultracapacitor (UC)driven electric vehicles (EVs). Despite its ultra-fast charge-discharge capabilities, UC-driven EV technology is stagnant due to its low energy density, which reduces its range. This article adopts RB technology to extend the range. The high power density and high calendar life of the UC allow maximum capturing of regenerative energy. The paper proposes an optimal torque algorithm to extract maximum regenerative energy from an IM. The motor torque is a function of quadrature current (Iqs). The proposed algorithm derived the optimal value of torque by extracting the maximum amount of Iqs with respect to variation of motor speed by considering inertia, damping factor, and losses. The indirect FOC control with space vector pulse width modulation and proposed RB algorithm has been utilized for the control of IM. The proposed algorithm has been simulated in MATLAB/Simulink environment and is validated in the OPAL-RT. Results show that energy delivered by the UC without and with conventional, and with the proposed RB algorithm for a 12.83 km run of Tata Nano vehicle model for a standard New York City Cycle schedule is 2077.1 Wh, 1902.5 Wh, and 1671.9 Wh, respectively. The proposed algorithm has achieved 19.5% and 12.12% energy-saving compared to without regenerative and conventional RB.
