Supercapacitors are energy storage systems appreciated as high power short duration power sources. As any electrochemical devices, supercapacitors are subject to ageing processes. Ageing is characterized by supercapacitors electrical performances loss (capacitance fades and Equivalent Series Resistance increases). In this article, we focus on capacitance fade with time for different sets of floating ageing constraints (constant temperature and voltage). This article deals with the best way for modeling capacitance fading with time for supercapacitors. Firstly, we present the approach of Eyring which predicts time for failure apparition. Then, we study two recent and uncommon ways for predicting capacitance evolution based on Langmuir isotherms and on the growth of a surface electrolyte interface. According to our study surface electrolyte interface approach appears more suitable for floating ageing modeling. Â© 2014 IEEE.
