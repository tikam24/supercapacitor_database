Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) with battery and ultra-capacitor (UC) gives good results for Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV)/Electric Vehicle (EV) application due to its inherent high energy and high power densities. High power capability of UC can be utilized during cold starting and sudden requirement of the EV. Normal power need can be supplied by the battery itself only. The main obstacle with HESS based EVs is the transition between battery and UC. The smooth transition plays a key role in improving battery life. The main aim of this work is to develop a control technique for automatic switching between energy sources corresponding to the speed of the motor. In the proposed control action, motor speed plays a major role in switch the energy sources in HESS. To attain the objective, another controller has been designed with four math functions corresponding to the speed of the motor termed as Math Function Based (MFB) controller. Thereafter the designed MFB controller combined with a conventional PI controller applied to the entire circuit at different load conditions. In the same way, MFB with PID controller also applied to the circuit. Finally, comparative analysis has been done between two hybrid controllers. The MATLAB/Simulink results of MFB with PI and MFB with PID has been attained and also compared, discussed.
