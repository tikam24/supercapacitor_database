Silver hollandite nanorectangular cuboids were synthesized via a hydrothermal route. The structural and valance state of the prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These studies confirmed the formation of tetragonal and silver hollandite crystal structures. Surface morphological studies reveal the nanorectangular cuboid structure. Silver hollandite was used as the negative electrode for an aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor device. Three electrode measurements revealed a maximum specific capacitance of 605 F g−1 at a specific current of 2 A g−1. The asymmetric device yielded a high specific cell capacitance of 157 F g−1 at a current of 1 A g−1 and a maximum energy density of 70.65 W h kg−1 at a power density of 902 W kg−1. The silver hollandite working electrode was analysed in a Li-ion capacitor half- and full-cell. The lithium-ion capacitor full-cell exhibited a specific cell capacitance of 64 F g−1 and a maximum energy density of 142 W h kg−1 at a power density of 4031.4 W kg−1. The asymmetric supercapacitor and Li-ion capacitor full-cell demonstrated higher energy density than lead-acid batteries and a comparable energy density to metal hydride batteries.
