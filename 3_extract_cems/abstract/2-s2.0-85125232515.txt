Herein, B, P co-doped porous carbon (PCBP) was prepared from K2B4O7 and phytic acid-modified cellulose via chemical activation and used as electrode materials for supercapacitors. Of which, K2B4O7 not only acts as a source of boron, but also as an activation agent in the process of activation. The electrochemical properties of porous carbon materials were significantly improved by doping P and B. Compared with the porous carbon doped by B, PCBP shows almost higher specific capacitance and better rate performance. When evaluated as supercapacitor electrode materials in 6 M KOH electrolyte under two-electrode test systems, the as-prepared PCBP exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance: a high specific capacitance of 214 F g−1 at 0.05 A g−1, a good rate capability of 142 F g−1 at 20 A g−1 and 2.7% capacitance loss after 10,000 cycles. Thus, the co-doping of B and P holds great promise for improving the specific capacitance and rate capability, which is attributed to the synergistic effect of B and P co-doped.
