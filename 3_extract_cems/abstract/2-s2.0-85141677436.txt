Carbon materials are the most popular electrode material for supercapacitors. Among carbon electrode materials, carbon aerogel is a promising candidate for flexible supercapacitors. In this work, aramid nanofiber-based nitrogen-doped carbon aerogel flexible film electrode materials were successfully prepared by hydrogelation, freeze-drying, and high-temperature carbonization. The physicochemical properties of the aramid nanofiber-based nitrogen-doped carbon aerogel flexible film electrode materials can be effectively controlled by the concentration of the aramid nanofibers. The optimum concentration of the aramid nanofibers is 0.6. At a current density of 20 μA cm−2, the area specific capacitance of the aramid nanofiber (ANF)-0.6 carbon aerogel film-based flexible solid supercapacitor is about 15.2 mF cm−2. The area specific capacitance is about 59.3% of the area specific capacitance at 20 μA cm−2 when the current density is increased by a factor of 15. The ANF-0.6 carbon aerogel film-based flexible solid supercapacitor exhibits about 72% capacitance retention after 1200 folding cycles. Graphical Abstract: The aramid nanofiber-based nitrogen-doped carbon aerogel film flexible solid supercapacitor exhibits good electrochemical and flexibility performance.
