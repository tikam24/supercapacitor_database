Borocarbonitrides, BxCyNz, constitute a new family of layered two-dimensional materials and can be considered to be derived from graphene. They can be simple composites containing graphene and BN domains or more complex materials possessing B-C and C-N bonds besides B-N and C-C bonds. Properties of these materials depend on the composition, and the method of synthesis, wherein one can traverse from the insulating end (BN) to the conducting end (graphene). In this article, we present an up-to-date review of the various aspects of borocarbonitrides including synthesis, characterization and properties. Some of the properties have potential applications, typical of them being in gas adsorption and energy devices such as supercapacitors, fuel cells and batteries. Performance of borocarbonitrides as catalysts in the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction is impressive. It is noteworthy that with certain compositions on borocarbonitrides, field-effect transistors can be fabricated.
