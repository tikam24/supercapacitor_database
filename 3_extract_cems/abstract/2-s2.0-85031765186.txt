During the operation of the satellite, the rapid adjustment of the satellite attitude is needed to monitor the hot spots. The rapid adjustment of the satellite attitude requires the rapid change of the speed of the flywheel, which demands a large instantaneous power from satellite power system. The traditional satellite power supply system is unable to meet the requirements of High Torque Flywheel due to the limited satellite space and the limited battery capacity. The character of the supercapacitor in the satellite power system is helpful to meet the demand of the large load power variation. In this paper, the traditional satellite power system model is established by Matlab/Simulink and integrated the large torque flywheel motors and supercapacitors to study the whether the traditional satellite power system can meet the demand of the acceleration of High Torque Flywheel and the bidirectional flow of braking energy. According to the simulation results, the energy distributions of lithium battery and supercapacitors are determined.
