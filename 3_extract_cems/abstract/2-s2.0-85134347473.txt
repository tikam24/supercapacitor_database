In this research article, binder-less Co3O4 thin-film electrodes were successfully fabricated on stainless steel substrate by cathodic electrodeposition technique. The effect of different precursor pH media on the formation of Co3O4 has been studied. The Structural study of the Co3O4 by X-ray diffraction indicates cubic nature with porous crosslinked nano flaky/flakes (PCNF) morphology in Scanning Electron Microscope studies. FTIR and UV-Vis study reveals the confirmation of cobalt oxide material. The prepared Co3O4 PCNF thin-film electrodes are utilized for electrochemical charge storage applications. The PCNF Co3O4 electrodes exhibit the excellent performance of specific capacitances 323.9 Fg−1 or specific capacity 187.1mAhg−1 in 1M KOH aqueous electrolyte at 5 mVs−1 scan rate. The power and energy density of the nanoflakes material is measured which indicates excellent coulombic efficiency in alkaline/Basic media. Further, a liquid-type symmetric supercapacitor device (LSSD) of Co3O4 was fabricated using PCNF cobalt oxide materials. The LSD exhibits excellent cycling stability with an enhanced specific capacitance of 107.9 Fg−1 at a 10 mVsec−1 scan rate. The maximum power and energy density delivered of the LSD are 4.33 KWKg−1and 7.90 WhKg−1 respectively. The alkaline medium of Co3O4 is more suitable for charge storage supercapacitor applications.
