A simple route for the reduction of graphene oxide (GO) to synthesize reduced GO (rGO) was developed using Cd powder as a reducing agent. The reduction of GO by Cd powder was monitored by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, and the prepared rGO was characterized with various analytical methods. The Cd powder efficiently reduced the GO and no acid was needed. The Cd2+ by-product from the reduction, was then used of to prepare CdO/rGO hybrids through a simple chemical reaction with KOH. The CdO/rGO hybrid was used as the electrode material in a supercapacitor and its electrochemical performance was determined by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge methods. The CdO/rGO hybrid exhibited better electrochemical performance than pure CdO, which suggests that the good electrical conductivity and large surface area of the rGO contribute to the excellent electrochemical properties of the CdO/rGO electrode.
