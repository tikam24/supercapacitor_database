The electrochemical energy storage devices with both high energy density and high power density can be achieved by new electrode materials with high electrochemical activity. At the material level, colloidal supercapattery can combine the merits of both battery with high energy density and supercapacitor with high power density. The colloidal system may be understood as an intermediate state between solution ions and crystalline materials, which has obvious multiscale characteristics. There are multiple interactions including van der Waals and chemical bonding in the colloidal system composed of ions, clusters, and aggregates. Therefore, the colloidal system has plenty of redox active sites. The colloidal supercapattery have demonstrated excellent electrochemical performances which may be applied as the advanced high performance energy storage devices in the future.
