Flexible supercapacitors are attractive devices for portable applications including those integrated in clothes. Highly conducting flexible electrodes can easily be fabricated by graphene powder and PE polymer foil but reliable fabrication of supercapacitor structure is still a challenge. A promising solution could be the incorporation of conducting polymer as polyaniline (PANI) intended to stabilize the mesoporous carbon and graphene plates, to form a conductive porous composite and to increase the capacitance. Low-cost aqueous electrolyte (1V) supercapacitor devices based on graphene/PANI composite were developed, tested in series configurations and compared in electrical performance. Preliminary applications in portable solar chargers are discussed.
