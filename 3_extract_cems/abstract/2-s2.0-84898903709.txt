The study on Arctic sea ice change and its influence to the global climate has become one of the most important scientific propositions. It is necessary to development the equipment with high reliability for monitoring Arctic sea ice change. In this paper, we design a low cost and long life ice buoy based on GPS and ARGOS PMT. The MCU of the system adopts low power consumption enhanced 8051 SCM (Single-Chip Microcomputer), which could collect the environmental parameters by all kinds of sensors, such as atmospheric pressure, temperature (air and sea ice), humidity, position of sea ice, and so on. Through optimizing circuit design and adopting intelligent power management method, the system could operate under very low power consumption. Meanwhile, we adopt the supercapacitor to supply the required large electric current of data transmission. By above methods, it efficiently prolongs the batteries' life so as to ensure the long life of the ice buoy. Several prototypes of the ice buoy were deployed on the Arctic sea ice one and a half years ago, and some of them have still operated normally until now. The buoy's operating status and the data validity indicate that it is an effective means to observe Arctic sea ice environment by deploying this kind of ice buoy.
