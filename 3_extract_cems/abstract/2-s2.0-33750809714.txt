The particular characteristics of the supercapacitors make them very attractive for the design of new alimentation concepts in transportation or power quality. But the low voltage of these components involves the use of series connections which are not the best solution on the reliability point of view. In this paper, a study of the voltage sharing in a supercapacitor module is proposed. This study is based on numerous experimental tests. The first part of this paper introduces the context of this work. Then, the test bench which allows us to obtain the experimental results is presented. The causes of voltage imbalances, as well as the models used to describe these phenomena, are analysed. Finally the experimental study details the test procedure and the results which are obtained.
