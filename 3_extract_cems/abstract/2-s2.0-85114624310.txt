Porous carbon materials volume densities are usually less than 0.5 g/cm3, resulting in that porous carbon materials have a low volume specific capacitance. Therefore, it is still a big challenge to improve volume specific capacitance performance of carbon materials. Herein, interconnected porous carbon nanocapsules(ICNC) were prepared by MgO template induction coupled with KOH tailoring technology using naphthalene as carbon source. The as-prepared ICNC2 has a large specific surface area(1811 m2/g), high compaction density(1.38 g/cm3) and micropore volume content(58.93%). In a symmetrical supercapacitor, the ICNC2 electrode displays a high volumetric capacitance of 420.8 F/cm3 at 0.069 A/cm3 and retains 315.1 F/cm3 at 27.6 A/cm3 with capacitance retention of 74.82%. The supercapacitor device of ICNC2 electrode displays a high volumetric energy density of 14.6 WÂ·h/L at the power density of 38 W/L. It also shows excellent cycle stability with only 1.4% decay and outstanding coulombic efficiency of 99.1% after 20000 cycles. This work provides a feasible method for production of high-performance carbon nanocapsules from small aromatic molecules for energy storage.
