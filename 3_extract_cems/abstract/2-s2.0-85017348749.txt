This study demonstrates a method for improving supercapacitive performance of electrochemically synthesized conductive polymer. In this regards, 1-Butyl-3-methyl imidazolium hexafluorophosphate (BI) as a new high efficient ionic liquid was synthesized using chemical approach and then fabricated POAP/BI films by electro-polymerization of POAP in the presence of BI to serve as the active electrode for electrochemical supercapacitor. Theoretical study (AIM) and electrochemical analysis have been used for characterization of ionic liquid and POAP/BI composite film. Different electrochemical methods including galvanostatic chargeâ€“discharge experiments, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy are carried out in order to investigate the performance of the system. This work introduces new most efficient materials for electrochemical redox capacitors with advantages including ease synthesis, high active surface area and stability in an aqueous electrolyte.
