H4SiW12O40 was used as a precursor to synthesize biimidazole-modified supramolecular hybrid under hydrothermal condition, and its chemical formula was determined to be [Co(bim)2(H2O)2][H2SiW12O40]·2H2O(1)(bim=biimidazole) by elemental composition and thermal gravity(TG) analysis. Single-crystal diffraction analysis shows that, the compound is composed of [H2SiW12O40]2-, [Co(bim)2(H2O)2]2+ and two H2O. At the same time, the components form 1D to 3D structures through hydrogen bond and supramolecular interaction. Using glassy carbon, carbon cloth and nickel foam as the current collectors, when the current density is 1 A/g, in the three-electrode system, compound 1 shows the specific capacitance(350.09, 107.02 and 186.83 F/g), better than most literature reports, and with capacitance retention of 94.5%, 92.8% and 95.1% after 5000 cycles. The kinetic analysis shows that the charge storage mechanism of the compound is dominated by surface-controlled electric charges. And simulataneously in the foamed nickel two-electrode system, the compound shows the specific capacitance 80.00 F/g at 1 A/g current density, an energy density of 9.41 W·h/kg for a power density of 130.83 W/kg in a voltage window of 0.75 V, and an outstanding cycle stability with 92.4% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles. It is shown that the synthetic hybrid is a better candidate material for supercapacitor electrodes.
