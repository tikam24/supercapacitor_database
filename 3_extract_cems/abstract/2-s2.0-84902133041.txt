The first mechanically and electrically self-healing supercapacitor has been successfully fabricated. It exhibits excellent self-healing performance with the restoration of the specific capacitance up to 85.7% of its original value even after the 5th mechanical cutting. This achievement may provide a way to expand the lifetime of future energy storage devices and endow them with desirable economic and human safety attributes, as well as promote the development of next-generation self-healing electronics.
