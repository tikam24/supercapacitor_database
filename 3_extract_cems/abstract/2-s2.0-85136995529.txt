To meet the rapid development of wearable flexible electronics, the multifunctional integrations into singe device are in extreme demand. In this paper, we developed novel self-powering multifunctional pressure sensors and supercapacitor-integrated device based on highly elastic silver nanowires@reduced graphene aerogel, being conductive to reduce integration difficulties and device size. Serving as an energy device, it behaves with a prominent specific capacitance of 146.6 F g−1, and excellent rate capability even at 500 mV s−1. The fabricated sensor demonstrates an excellent sensitivity of 2.54 kPa−1 and superior pressure-sensing stability up to 1000 compressive cycles. Piezoionization effect is suggested to reveal the sensing mechanism. Our research provides a new research direction in designing the integration of self-driving wearable electronics.
