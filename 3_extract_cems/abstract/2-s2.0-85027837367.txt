Supercapacitors fill the gap between the batteries and capacitors in the Nyquist plots, and being considered as the candidates for next generation energy storage due to the high-power density, long-term cyclability and moderate energy density. In order to fulfill the requirement for practical applications, it is necessary to further develop the current supercapacitors and enhance the energy density. Hence in this paper, we discuss the work we have done for developing high-performance supercapacitors, including synthesis of large surface area and high conductive carbonaceous materials and highly electroactive pseudocapacitive materials. Our works may pave the way for synthesis of high-performance supercapacitor electrode materials.
