Ordered anodic TiO2 nanotube arrays hold great potential as electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors. However, their poor cycle stability restricts practical applications. Here we develop a simple and successful strategy to improve their cycle stability. The TiO2 nanotube arrays are electrochemically doped in a basic solution, followed by soaking them in a hydrogen peroxide solution for a short time. The as-prepared TiO2 nanotube arrays possess a core–shell structure with an amorphous surface layer of 2–3 nm thickness. The supercapacitors made by the as-prepared TiO2 nanotube arrays exhibit an excellent cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 94.1% after 10000 cycles. The presented results make TiO2 an attractive candidate as electrode materials in high-performance supercapacitors.
