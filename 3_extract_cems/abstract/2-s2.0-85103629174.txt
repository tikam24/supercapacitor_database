The preparation of redox-active, ultrathin polymer films as the electrode materials repre-sents a major challenge for miniaturized flexible electronics. Herein, we demonstrated a liquid–liquid interfacial polymerization approach to a coordination polymer films with ultrathin thickness from tri(terpyridine)-based building block and iron atoms. The as-synthesized polymer films exhibit flexible properties, good redox-active and narrow bandgap. After directly transferred to silicon wafers, the on-chip micro-supercapacitors of TpPB-Fe-MSC achieved the high specific capacitances of 1.25 mF cm−2 at 50 mV s−1 and volumetric energy density of 5.8 mWh cm−3, which are superior to most of semiconductive polymer-based micro-supercapacitor (MSC) devices. In addition, as-fabricated on-chip MSCs exhibit typical alternating current (AC) line-filtering performance (−71.3◦ at 120 Hz) and a short resistance–capacitance (RC) time (0.06 ms) with the electrolytes of PVA/LiCl. This study provides a simple interfacial approach to redox-active polymer films for microsized energy storage devices.
