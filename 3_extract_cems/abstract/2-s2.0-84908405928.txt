Due to the defects of the way of traditional grid power supply, micro grid arises at the historic moment. The energy storage system is indispensable in the position of micro grid. Under various working conditions micro grid storage system has the corresponding operation modes and energy conversion between them. In this paper, further research and improvement have been done about the operation mode of micro grid energy storage system, a special hybrid energy storage that contains two complementary type energy storage elements-battery and super capacitor, make full use of the characteristics of large capacity of battery energy storage component and the characteristics of fast charging and discharging of super capacitor energy storage element in micro grid with reasonable energy distribution under various working conditions. Through the MATLAB/SIMULINK simulation platform, it is confirmed that the steady state and transient state conversion of different operation mode.
