The modified silica was synthesized by sol-gel method using methacryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane (MAPTMS). Composite solid polymer electrolytes, differing by the MAPTMS feed rate, were prepared. We prepared composite solid polymer electrolytes (SCPEs) composed of poly (ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether acrylate (PEGA), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate ([EMIm][OTF]) and inorganic filler. The two type of fumed silica were used. One has unmodified surface, the other has organically modified surface. The CSPEs formed by appropriately adding ionic liquids in the PEGA prior to thermal cure. The ratio between PEGA and ionic liquid was 7:3, and 5:5, respectively. The effect of silica surface properties on the characteristics of CSPEs was investigated. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry were used.
