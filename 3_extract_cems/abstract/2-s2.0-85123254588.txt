Sodium ion based supercapacitors have great potential to replace Li-ion based systems in future energy storage devices with advantages of power density, stability and cost, but with a demerit of low energy density achievable. We developed sodium ion based supercapacitor devices with high energy and power density and cyclic stability using nanomaterials for the electrodes and enhancers in the electrolyte. The cathode material was composed of NaCl salt, MWCNT (multi-walled carbon nanotubes), sulphur and cellulose, with compatible anode composition. The supercapacitor device was assembled as two electrode with collector as graphene sheet and cellulose as separator. CV (cyclic voltammetry) curves were acquired using potentiostat-galvanostat at 0.1 V/s (Model: CHN). A specific capacitance of 14.6F/g, high energy density of 117 Wh/kg, a power density of 12 kW/kg and good cyclic stability over 30 redox cycles was achieved.
