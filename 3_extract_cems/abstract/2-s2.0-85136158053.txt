In this paper a mathematical model of hybrid autonomous system is presented. The studied system consists of fuel cell, supercapacitor and photovoltaic. At the modelling are used data from the manufacturer of the different components and as well as a real load schedule is chosen to meet the needs of certain consumers. In this way, taking into account the solar radiation, the value / capacity of the supercapacitor is chosen in order to meet the needs of the load in arbitrary weather conditions. The proposed approach for modelling and management of energy flows in a system for decentralized electricity production is suitable both for training purposes and for the needs of development and implementation of green energy. The model is realized in MATLAB/Simulink environment.
