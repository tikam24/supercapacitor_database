The world is stepping forward toward the development of technologies to derive energy from sustainable resources and the technologists are thriving hard to mitigate the challenges such as shortage of fuels and clean/renewable energy due to the rapid increase in global population, energy consumption owing to lifestyle improvements, high costs for energy, global warming, and various environmental issues. In this chapter, we overview a wide range of enabling sustainable energy storage technologies, that include long-term energy storage (compressed air, battery, pumped hydroelectric, and hydrogen-based), and short-term energy storage (supercapacitor, flywheel, and superconducting magnetic) systems. We will focus on these storage technologies which form the core of the technological innovations needed to design and develop renewable energy. We have highlighted the salient features of each of these technologies and compared them in terms of their power/energy density, and cost to meet the global challenges, and their ability to manage the scarcity of existing resources and competitiveness in meeting sustainability standards.
