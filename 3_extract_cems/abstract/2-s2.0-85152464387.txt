Compact supercapacitors, a transformative energy storage technology, suffers from poor volumetric performance stemming from limited ion accessibility in thick electrode films. Compact, high-mass-loading stacking of conducting nanosheets of proper size and ion transport channels within the electrode is a promising, yet challenging solution. Here we resolve this issue using ultrasonically assisted filtration to fabricate thick MoS2 films with outstanding volumetric performance. Innovative ultrasonic-assisted nanosheet-size controlled filtration produced thick, high-mass-loading MoS2 electrodes with ultra-high volumetric capacitance. Smaller MoS2 sheets ensure strong van der Waals interactions for layer-by-layer assembly of a thick film, thus creating highly accessible nanochannels (30.5 nm) for fast ion transport, while featuring the high 1T phase content (68.1%) for effective electron transfer. The 7.6 μm and 62.3 μm MoS2 films deliver excellent volumetric capacitances of 781.1 and 496.8 F cm−3, respectively. The developed thick cell stack shows superior volumetric energy and power densities, outperforming commercial devices.
