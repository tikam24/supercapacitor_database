Despite the advantages and importance of conventional linear regulators, low efficiency of about 40% is one of the main corresponding drawbacks. Supercapacitor assisted low dropout regulator (SCALDO), a linear DC to DC technique that can be used to duplicate efficiency. Therefore, supercapacitor is playing a crucial role to maximize the efficiency as a result of nearly lossless voltage dropper element, which minimize the losses in the pass element and power semiconductors. This work represents the mathematical principles of SCALDO and a simple implementation with simple and costly effective electronic components contrary to the traditional techniques. The proposed low dropout regulator is used to convert 12V to 5V. The linear regulator based on high efficiency SCALDO technique makes it appropriate for solar cell power systems applications.
