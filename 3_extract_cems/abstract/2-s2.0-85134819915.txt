Supercapacitors have been intensively explored as one of the most promising energy storage devices, because of their unique advantages. Mixed spinel ferrites have been widely used in electrochemical (EC) devices owing to their benefits, including extraordinary chemical stability and significant surface area. Though, the EC properties of transition metals are sturdily dependent on their physicochemical properties. The properties of nanoparticles are greatly influenced by a variety of factors, including their composition and shape. The thermal stability of the Mg0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4 nanoparticles is confirmed by TGA/DTA/DSC measurements. The cyclic voltammetry measurement was done using a three-electrode system to evaluate the prepared electrode's EC properties. The EC measurement of synthesized materials was evaluated in 1 M of KOH electrolyte. At a 0.5 A/g current density, the Mg0.1Mn0.9Fe2O4 electrodes had the highest specific capacitance of 226.4 Fg-1, compared to Mg0.3Mn0.7Fe2O4, Mg0.4Mn0.6Fe2O4, and Mg0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4 electrodes. These data demonstrate that the Mg0.1Mn0.9Fe2O4 electrodes developed are excellent EC agents. Because of the crucial effect of particle sizes and surface coordinating environments, nanoscale spinel ferrite particles showed several promising uses when compared to bulk counterparts.
