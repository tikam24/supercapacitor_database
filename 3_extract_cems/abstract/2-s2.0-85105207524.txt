Metal sulfides have been recognized as promising electrodes for electrochemical energy storage owing to their remarkable electrochemical properties. Here, we demonstrate the preparation of Co9S8 nanoparticles anchored on a carbon matrix (denoted as Co9S8-X@CN (X=1, 2)) from precursor sources, two 1D infinite coordination polymers 1 and 2. The two polymers were assembled by linking Co4-TC4A secondary building blocks (SBUs) with ligands L1 and L2, respectively (H4TC4A=p-tert-butylthiacalix[4]arene, L1=1,4-bis(2H-tetrazol-5-yl)benzene, L2=1,3-bis(2H-tetrazol-5-yl)benzene). The composites obtained from 1D polymers showed different morphologies, that is, the Co9S8 nanoparticles of Co9S8-1@CN are octahedral with a size of ca. 140 nm, while the lamellar Co9S8 nanoparticles in Co9S8-2@CN possess different sizes (50–150 nm). The Co9S8-2@CN immobilized on nickel foam (Co9S8-2@CN/NF) show better supercapacitive performance than that of Co9S8-1@CN. Co9S8-2@CN showed exceptionally high activities, combining higher specific capacitances (445.2 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 and 393.9 F g−1 and 5 A g−1), rate capacity (94.5% retention at 2 A g−1), and long-term stability (79.2% retention at 5 A g−1 over 1000 cycles). The smaller size and larger BET surface area of Co9S8-2@CN nanoparticles can improve the electrical conductivity and provide facile pathways for charge transport, thus leading to conspicuous electrochemical performance of Co9S8-2@CN compared with its Co9S8-1@CN counterpart.
