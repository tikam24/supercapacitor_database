Porous carbon material, as a type of electric double-layer capacitors (EDLC), has successfully been used in the commercial supercapacitors. However, several critical factors limited its application, such as the surface hydrophobicity, large internal resistance and low capacitance. Recently, benefiting from the rapid development of supercapacitor, N-doped porous carbon materials as its electrode materials have received extensive attention of the researchers for their novel electrochemical properties. A large variety of synthetic methods have been developed to prepare nitrogen-doped porous carbons with special structures and properties. The basic forms of nitrogen in the carbon structure is introduced based on the recent researches. The doping effects on the electrochemical properties is also explained before a detailed exhibition of the preparation of nitrogen-doped porous carbon electrode. The development of the N-doped porous carbon electrode materials is presented with the promising application in the engineering supercapacitors.
