Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are two-dimensional layered materials composed of positively charged metal hydroxide laminates, negatively charged anions between the layers, and water molecules, which can store and release charge through the reversible oxidation-reduction reaction between hydroxide and oxyhydroxide. LDHs have the advantages of high theoretical capacity, adjustable morphology and composition, low cost, and easy large-scale preparation, and have become the supercapacitor electrode materials with increasing attraction in recent years. To date, the rate capacities of LDHs are far from the expectation due to the low activity associated with low intrinsic activity and small active surface area, and the slow charge transport kinetics arising from the poor intrinsic conductivity to hinder electron transfer and the narrow interlayer distance to impede ion diffusion. Various strategies have developed to increase the activity, e.g., by regulating compositions, amorphizating, nanostructuring and constructing hierarchical structures, and to facilitate the charge transport kinetics, e.g., by compositing with carbon, depositing/growing on conductive substrates, expanding interlayer distance, exfoliation-self-assembly. This review starts with the structural characteristics and energy storage mechanism of LDHs, and then summarizes the strategies for improving the rate capacities of LDHs. The up-to-date progress in achieving the high-rate capacity by matching electron transfer with ion diffusion is also included, which suggests a new avenue to explore the advanced LDHs for energy storage.
