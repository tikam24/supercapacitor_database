This paper presents a novel strategy for calculating Lead-Acid battery charging and discharging time with different cases for standalone PV-based DC microgrid systems. The strategy has been implemented for a PV module incorporating MPP tracker to control the Lead-Acid battery charging and discharging time. This technique allows for improved condition of Lead-Acid battery under charge and discharge cycles. In addition, a supercapacitor is connected to the proposed configuration. The supercapacitor charging time at constant solar irradiance is calculated and compared with Lead-Acid battery and further verified by Ragone Plot. The performance of the proposed strategy has been validated through implementation on OPAL-RT real-time simulator.
