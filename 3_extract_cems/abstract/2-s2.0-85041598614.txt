This article focuses the effect of Ce doping on the crystal structure, optical, electrochemical and magnetic properties of CuO nanostructures synthesized by microwave irradiation method. Synthesized samples were characterized by x-ray diffraction, ultraviolet-visible spectrometer, photoluminescence spectrometer, fourier transform infrared spectrometer, transmission electron microscope, cyclic voltmeter and vibrating sample magnetometer. X-ray diffraction pattern discloses that the synthesized samples have monoclinic structure without impurity. Transmission electron micrograph shows that Ce substitution induces microstructural change from spherical to rod shape. The optical bandgap calculated from UVâ€“vis absorption spectrum is found to vary between 3.63 and 3.13 eV for undoped and 7(wt%) Ce doped samples, respectively. The photoluminescence spectrum suggests that Ce doped CuO nanoparticles may be used in optoelectronic devices. The functional group analysis carried out by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed the substitution of Ce in the samples. The specific capacitance analysis confirmed that the Ce doped CuO can be used as electrode material for supercapacitor application. Magnetic properties of the synthesized samples show that ferromagnetic property of CuO increases with Ce content.
