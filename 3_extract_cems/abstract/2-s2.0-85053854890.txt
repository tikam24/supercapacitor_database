Abstract: The presence of vapor-liquid interface, and more specifically the pressure gradient across such interface at the time of drying the precursor gel may significantly alter the pore structure in dry form, and in turn the pore hierarchy in the carbonized form. Here, the pore structure of carbon powder samples is analyzed, where the precursor gel prior to carbonization was subjected to vacuum-driven or atmospheric evaporation, and also lyophilization that avoids vapor-liquid interface altogether. The mesopores, originating from the void space that was left by the solvent in precursor gel contributed significantly in providing access of micropores to the electrolyte ions. Further, the role of pore activation by surface etching or through intercalation is discussed in this context. How the chemical and physical activation play out on carbon samples with different drying histories is analyzed. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
