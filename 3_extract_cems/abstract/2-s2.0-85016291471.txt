Silver nanosticks-polyaniline (AgNS-PANI) thin films are deposited on stainless steel substrates by a dip coating technique. The surface morphology of the films is examined by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy, which revealed the presence of AgNSs on PANI background. There is decrease in the room temperature electrical resistivity observed for the sample AgNS-PANI of the order of 102. The highest specific capacitance of 628 Fg-1 at 5 mVs-1 and energy density of 76.30 Wh kg-1 at 1 mA cm-2 is observed for the AgNS-PANI indicating positive effect of AgNSs. The cyclic life of sample AgNS-PANI is measured and the specific capacitance is found to decline by about 17% after 2000 cycles.
