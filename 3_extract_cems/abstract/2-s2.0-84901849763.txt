Mn(OH)2/multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composite thin filmswere obtained by spray coating on flexible indiumtin oxide/polyethylene terephthalate substrate. The precursors for thin filmdeposition were prepared by completely mixing MWCNTs and KMnO4 in deionized water. The morphological characteristics of the films were examined by field emission scanning electronic microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Phase evolution of the thin filmswas characterized by X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. As a result of the deposition process, Mn(OH)2 did not only cover the surface of MWCNTs uniformly but also embed in MWCNTs. The capacitive properties of the thin films were investigated by electrochemical measurements and the capacitance increased as the weight ratio of KMnO 4/MWCNTs increased up to 1.6. The highest specific capacitance obtained at a scan rate of 20 mV s-1 was 297.5 F/g for the composite thin film with the weight ratio of KMnO4/MWCNTs of 1.2. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
