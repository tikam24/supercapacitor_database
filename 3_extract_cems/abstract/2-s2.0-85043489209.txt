In this work, argy wormwood-based porous carbon electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors are prepared through H 3 PO 4 solution hydrothermal carbonization and subsequent KOH activation. The obtained carbon has a specific surface area (SSA) of 927 m 2 g −1 , a total pore volume of 0.56 cm 3 g −1 , and a high oxygen (9.38%) content. In three-electrode system, it exhibits specific capacitance of 344 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 . Moreover, the symmetric supercapacitor shows an excellent rate capability of 87% retention from 1 A g −1 to 10 A g −1 , and a good cycling performance with 91.6% retention over 5000 cycles in 6 M KOH. Therefore, the sample activated by H 3 PO 4 & KOH exhibits an excellent future in energy storage.
