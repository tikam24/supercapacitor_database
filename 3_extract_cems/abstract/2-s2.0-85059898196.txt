Doping porous carbon with transition metal oxides is highly desirable for high performance supercapacitors due to their synergistic effect. Herein, a highly dispersed CoO-NiO nanoparticle doped porous carbon (CoO-NiO@ZIF-C) was prepared by pyrolysis of Ni2+ and Co2+ ions impregnated ZIF-8. The metal nanoparticles catalyze the formation of graphitic carbon, while the N-doped carbon substrate confines the nanoparticles during the process. The resulted nanocomposite demonstrates excellent capacitive performance, which delivered a specific capacitance of 552.3 F g-1 at current density of 1 A g-1. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor was successfully assembled using CoO-NiO@ZIF-C as positive electrode and reduced graphene oxide as the negative electrode. The two-electrode cell delivered a maximum energy density of 43.5 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 1892.1 W kg-1 with good stability.
