A single-phase tapped-inductor boost converter has been proposed previously. However, detailed characterization and performance analysis were not conducted. This paper presents a detailed characterization, performance analysis, and design expressions of a single-phase tapped-coupled-inductor boost converter. Expressions are derived for average and RMS input current as well as for RMS input and output capacitor current ripple. A systematic approach for sizing the tapped-coupled inductor, active switch, and output diode is presented; such approach has not been reported in related literature. This study reveals that sizing of the inductor has to be based on current ripple requirement, turns ratio, and load. Conditions that produce discontinuous inductor current are also discussed. Analysis of a non-ideal converter operating in continuous conduction mode is also conducted. The expression for the voltage ratio considering the coupling coefficient is derived. The suitability of the converter for high-voltage step-up applications is evaluated. Factors that affect the voltage boost ratio are also identified. The effects of duty ratio and load variation on the performance of the converter are also investigated. The theoretically derived characteristics are validated through simulations. Experimental results obtained at a low power level are included to validate the analytical and simulation results. A good agreement is observed among the analytical, simulation, and experimental results.
