When using railway static power conditioner to solve negative sequence problem of electric railway, a novel energy storage type of railway power conditioner is proposed based on railway static power conditioner and super capacitor energy storage, in order to enhance the regenerative braking energy utilization. The system can not only realize the bidirectional energy circulation of the two power supply arms, but also can improve the energy storage and utilization of regenerative braking through the coordinated control of the railway static power conditioner and the energy storage system. Firstly, the working principle of the system is analyzed, the equivalent circuit of regenerative braking working condition is constructed, and the expression of energy utilization ratio of regenerative braking is derived. Then the reason that the system can improve regenerative braking energy utilization is analyzed. Finally, the simulation and experimental results under diverse working conditions have verified the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed novel compensation system.
