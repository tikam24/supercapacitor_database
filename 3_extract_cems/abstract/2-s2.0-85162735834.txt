Carbon materials synthesized via a solution plasma process (SPP) have recently shown great potential for various applications. However, they mainly possess a meso-macroporous structure with a lack of micropores, which limits their applications for supercapacitors. Herein, carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) were synthesized from benzene via SPP and then subjected to thermal treatment at different temperatures (400, 600, 800, and 1000 °C) in an argon environment. The CNPs exhibited an amorphous phase and were more graphitized at high treatment temperatures. A small content of tungsten carbide particles was also observed, which were encapsulated in CNPs. An increase in treatment temperature led to an increase in the specific surface area of CNPs from 184 to 260 m2 g−1 through the development of micropores, while their meso-macropore structure remained unchanged. The oxygen content of CNPs decreased from 14.72 to 1.20 atom% as the treatment temperature increased due to the degradation of oxygen functionality. The charge storage properties of CNPs were evaluated for supercapacitor applications by electrochemical measurements using a three-electrode system in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The CNPs treated at low temperatures exhibited an electric double layer and pseudocapacitive behavior due to the presence of quinone groups on the carbon surface. With increasing treatment temperature, the electric double layer behavior became more dominant, while pseudocapacitive behavior was suppressed due to the quinone degradation. Regarding cycling stability, the CNPs treated at high temperatures (with a lack of oxygen functionality) were more stable than those treated at low temperatures. This work highlights a way of introducing micropores into CNPs derived from SPP via thermal treatment, which could be helpful for controlling and adjusting their pore structure for supercapacitor applications.
