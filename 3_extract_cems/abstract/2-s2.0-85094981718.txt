The thin-film electrode for supercapacitors has broad prospects for providing high energy storage capacity. However, the microstructure of dense film resulting in poor ion access limits its capacitance still far below the theoretical value. Here, CrN thin film electrodes with good cycle performance can be prepared by tuning the porosity of the film at the nanoscale level. The atomic diffusion process and atomic peening effect that occur during the sputtering process of chromium nitride are the pivotal parameters for generating porosity and high specific surface area. During the controlled sputtering process, an increase in the nitrogen flow rate causes an increase in the porosity in each column (intracolumnar porosity), while an increase in temperature controlling the gap between two columns (intercolumnar porosity). When the nitrogen flow rate is 10 sccm and the deposition temperature is 250 °C the CrN film has the areal capacitance of 41.7 mF cm−2, 10 mV s−1 at the thickness of 950 nm. In addition, the CrN film has good electrochemical cycling stability, the capacity retention rate is still as high as 93.2% after 20,000 cycles. Therefore, the CrN film electrode has a promising application prospects in energy storage systems such as supercapacitors.
