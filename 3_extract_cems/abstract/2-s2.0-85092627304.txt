Polyaniline (PANI) is one of the important materials in conducting polymers (CPs) for significant applications in devices due to its unique properties such as high electrical conductivity, flexibility, and economical price. In this work, novel and eco-friendly green synthesis of polyaniline Nanorod (PANI-NR) were developed by solar irradiation approach in acidic medium without the aid of any surfactant and template. As characterized by morphology studies, the average diameter of PANI-NR is approximately 200–250 nm and length is 2–2.5 µm. The elemental analysis and structural geometry of PANI-NR are examined through EDX, Mapping, and XRD studies. The electrochemical properties were investigated using CV, GCD, and EIS techniques. The electrochemical performance of Cyclic voltammetry analysis shows the redox peaks which confirms the PANI-NR has excellent electrical conductivity. A specific capacitance of 25 F/g at 10 mV/s scan rate by CV studies and 106 F/g at 1 A/g current density by GCD studies is observed for One-Dimensional (1D) PANI-NR as an electrode material for supercapacitor. Also, it shows remarkable cyclic retention and stability. These results indicate that PANI-NR is expected to have better electrochemical performance in energy storage applications.
