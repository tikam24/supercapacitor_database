Tremendous attention has been devoted for the development of highly efficient and stable electrode materials for supercapacitor applications. In this study, Sn-doped Co3O4 nanorods were prepared via solvothermal process using PVP and oxalic acid as surfactants. The phase, morphology and composition of Sn-doped Co3O4 nanorods were examined by XRD and SEM/EDX techniques. The electrochemical properties were studied via cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charging-discharging (GCD), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The CV results show that electrode based on 5 at. % Sn-doped Co3O4 (5Sn-doped Co3O4) nanorods delivered the highest specific capacitance (842.44 F/g) at 5 mV/s than that of the electrode based on pure Co3O4 (729.39 F/g). In order to further tune the performance of this electrode, the structure, morphology and electrochemical behavior of 5Sn-doped Co3O4 sample were optimized via variety of calcination temperatures ranging from 250 to 400 °C. Notably, the 5Sn-doped Co3O4 sample calcined at 350 °C exhibited higher electrochemical performance (specific capacitance ~913.10 F/g) than other samples calcined at low or high calcination temperatures. The CV curves of 5Sn-doped Co3O4/T-350 °C at scan rates of 5–35 mV/s also showed pseudocapacitor behavior and good electrochemical reversibility. Moreover, the prepared novel electrode material has also displayed good rate capability (71.77%) at current density of 1–10 A/g and long-term stability of 92.23% after 3000 cycles. These excellent electrochemical characteristics of 5Sn–Co3O4/T-350 °C nanorods verified that it will be highly suitable electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
