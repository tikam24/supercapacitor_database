Color-changing energy storage devices that can easily communicate with the user carry the potential to be integrated into smart electronics. In this work, nanocomposite electrochromic supercapacitor electrodes were fabricated with silver nanowire (Ag NW) network electrodes and a green to transmissive electrochromic polymer, PDOPEQ. High transparency and conductivity of Ag NW network current collectors allowed the fabrication of electrochromic supercapacitors and investigation of the spectroelectrochemical and electrochemical properties of the PDOPEQ. Previously reported electrochromic properties such as long term electrochromic switching stability and vibrant color change for PDOPEQ were well transferred into electrochromic capacitors. Investigated electrochromic supercapacitors changed their color from vibrant green to transparent with superior characteristics. Specific capacitance of the fabricated nanocomposite electrodes was calculated as 61.5 F g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1 and to the best of our knowledge, one of the highest capacity retention value was obtained upon 20000 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles. With these color options and electrochemical performance, investigated conducting polymer (CP) holds strong promise to be used in electrochromic supercapacitors.
