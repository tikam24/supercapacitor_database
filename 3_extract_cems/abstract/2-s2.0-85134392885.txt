A photocatalytic fuel cell has been used to convert light into electricity and photoelectrochemically produce hydrogen peroxide by reduction of atmospheric oxygen. An energy storage functionality was added to this cell by introducing a supercapacitor electrode functioning with the cell electrolyte. When the cell was operated with intermittent light supply, hydrogen peroxide production was much smaller than under continuous illumination; however in the presence of the supercapacitor, hydrogen peroxide production was substantially larger demonstrating the energy storage functionality and its importance in practical applications. The supercapacitor electrode was loaded with a biochar obtained by pyrolysis of spent malt rootlets under limited oxygen supply. The biochar was further subjected into mild treatment by boiling a biochar suspension in pure or alkaline water. Both untreated and mild-treated biochar was extensively characterized by several techniques. It was shown that even mild treatment can lead to substantial leaching of minerals and part of the organic residues giving materials with much larger specific surface resulting in higher supercapacitance values.
