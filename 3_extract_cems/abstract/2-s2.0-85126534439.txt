The ternary material CoNi-Layered Double Hydroxide (LDH)/NiCo2S4/Reduced Graphene Oxide (RGO) was successfully synthesized by simple hydrothermal deposition. NiCo2S4 nanoparticles are dispersed on the RGO sheet and uniformly covered by CoNi-LDH nanowire arrays, which creates a large number of pore structures between the nanowires to facilitate the rapid transfer of charged particles. The ternary composites are tested for physical and chemical characterization and electrochemical performance. Due to the particular structure, CoNi-LDH/NiCo2S4/RGO materials exhibit attractive specific capacitance (1846.66 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and cycle performance (93.57% retention after 5000 cycles). Furthermore, the CoNi-LDH/NiCo2S4/RGO composite electrode material is assembled in an all-solid asymmetric supercapacitor. The results show that the energy density of 28.88 Wh kg-1 and the capacity retention of 80.52% (after 10,000 cycles) are obtained for all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor CoNi-LDH/NiCo2S4/RGO//AC device, and the LED lamp can be lit, indicating CoNi-LDH/NiCo2S4/RGO ternary composite materials have excellent application prospects.
