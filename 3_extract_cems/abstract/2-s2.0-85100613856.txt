Electrochemical capacitors (ECs) have emerged as reliable and fast-charging electrochemical energy storage devices that offer high power densities. Their use is still limited, nevertheless, by their relatively low energy density. Because high specific surface area and electrical conductivity are widely seen as key metrics for improving the energy density and overall performance of ECs, materials that have excellent electrical conductivities but are otherwise nonporous, such as coordination polymers (CPs), are often overlooked. Here, we report a new nonporous CP, Ni3(benzenehexathiolate) (Ni3BHT), which exhibits high electrical conductivity of over 500 S/m. When used as an electrode, Ni3BHT delivers excellent specific capacitances of 245 F/g and 426 F/cm3 in nonaqueous electrolytes. Structural and electrochemical studies relate the favorable performance to pseudocapacitive intercalation of Li+ ions between the 2D layers of Ni3BHT, a charge-storage mechanism that has thus far been documented only in inorganic materials such as TiO2, Nb2O5, and MXenes. This first demonstration of pseudocapacitive ion intercalation in nonporous CPs, a class of materials comprising thousands of members with distinct structures and compositions, provides important motivation for exploring this vast family of materials for nontraditional, high-energy pseudocapacitors.
