In this work, we produced high yield quantized nitrogen-doped graphene nanodiscs from waste tires via a one-step process under high pressure and temperature using a homemade stainless steel reactor without using any chemical additives. Reaction temperature played a vital role in the preparation process. By increasing the temperature to a level between 600 and 1100 Â°C, the carbon atoms rearranged themselves to build a mixed graphene structure of nanodiscs and quantum dots. The obtained graphene exhibits excellent capacitance and long life cycle stability as an electrode in supercapacitor devices. The specific capacitance rose to 161.24 F/g with a high power density of 733.3 W/kg, and the energy density reached 27.1 Wh/kg. The finding of this work is not only to provide a solution to get rid of hazardous materials but also to give awareness of turning these hazardous materials into a cost-effective and economical nanomaterial; in another, this approach sheds light on the promising power uses of waste.
