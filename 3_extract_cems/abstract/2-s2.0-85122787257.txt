Graphene-based nanomaterials with remarkable properties, such as good biocompatibility, strong mechanical strength, and outstanding electrical conductivity, have dramatically shown excellent potential in various applications. Increasing surface area and porosity percentage, improvement of adsorption capacities, reduction of adsorption energy barrier, and also prevention of agglomeration of graphene layers are the main advantages of functionalized graphene nanocomposites. On the other hand, Cerium nanostructures with remarkable properties have received a great deal of attention in a wide range of fields; however, in some cases low conductivity limits their application in different applications. Therefore, the combination of cerium structures and graphene networks has been widely invesitaged to improve properties of the composite. In order to have a comprehensive information of these nanonetworks, this research reviews the recent developments in cerium functionalized graphene derivatives (graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (RGO), and graphene quantum dot (GQD) and their industrial applications. The applications of functionalized graphene derivatives have also been successfully summarized. This systematic review study of graphene networks decorated with different structure of Cerium have potential to pave the way for scientific research not only in field of material science but also in fluorescent sensing, electrochemical sensing, supercapacitors, and catalyst as a new candidate.
