A portable dc power supply based on electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC) bank was established for high-power applications. EDLC bank needs a dc-dc converter to maintain a constant output voltage and current. Especially, a low-impedance load makes the voltage of capacitors discharge faster, and their discharging time is determined by RC time constant. The proposed system is designed as a fundamental concept, and deals with some issues occurring in a large-scale system. Also, this paper provides detailed information and consideration for a real establishment. Last, we performed a full-scale experiment using basic techniques.
