Rice husk char (RHC), a carbon-based material, was obtained by thermal decomposition of rice husk (RH) biological waste. Physicochemical properties of RHC were determined using XRD, FTIR, FESEM, TGA, N2 adsorption-desorption studies and contact angle measurement. A lab-scale supercapacitor (SC) was fabricated using as-prepared RHC and its supercapacitive behaviour was investigated using techniques like CV, GCD and EIS studies. Each of RHC electrode showed a specific capacitance of 80.2 F g-1 at the constant charging/discharging current density of 0.05 A g-1. RHC exhibited 90 % retention of its initial capacitance even after 5000 GCD. The presence of amorphous SiO2 in RHC could contribute to the excellent wettability of RHC towards the water, enhancing its effective surface area by improving access of electrolyte ions into RHC. This remarkable supercapacitive performance of biological waste-derived RHC demonstrates its potential as a cost effective and environmentally benign electrode material for aqueous electrolyte-based SCs.
