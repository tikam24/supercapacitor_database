Understanding and controlling the electrical response at a complex electrode-electrolyte interface is key to the development of next-generation supercapacitors and other electrochemical devices. In this work, we apply a theoretical framework based on the effective screening medium and reference interaction site model to explore the role of electrical double-layer (EDL) formation and its interplay with quantum capacitance in graphene-based supercapacitors. In addition to pristine graphene, we investigate a novel C60-modified graphene supercapacitor material, which promises higher charge-storage capacity. Beyond the expected enhancement in the quantum capacitance, we find that the introduction of C60 molecules significantly alters the EDL response. These changes in EDL are traced to the interplay between surface morphology and charge localization character and ultimately dominate the overall capacitive improvement in the hybrid system. Our study highlights a complex interplay among surface morphology, electronic structure, and interfacial capacitance, suggesting general improvement strategies for optimizing carbon-based supercapacitor materials.
