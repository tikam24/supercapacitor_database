In this paper the simulation models by Matlab for an urban-metro railcar and some newer methods for reducing the need value of capacitance for energy storage are presented. The achievable decreasing ratio of the needed energy storage at SCAP is 25 to 40 % with this improved energy control method. It was been investigated the supercapacitor and the Li-ion battery as hybrid energy storage system and its effectiveness under operation of a suitable energy control system. Mass reduction of our hybrid storage system is significant. Â© 2013 IEEE.
