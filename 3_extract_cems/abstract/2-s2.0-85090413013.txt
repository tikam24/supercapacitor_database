For sustainable application of supercapacitor high energy density along with high power density is becoming an obvious requirement. This work is aimed at utilizing the features of 2D-layered structure and high surface area of MoS2 as electrode for supercapacitor to achieve high energy density and capacitance retention. One step hydrothermal technique is used to synthesize MoS2 layered structure and its performance is studied through electrochemical analysis. The electrochemical performance of MoS2 electrode is tested in a full cell module and a specific capacitance of 255 F.g-1 at 0.25 A.g-1 with energy density of 35.5 W.kg-1 is achieved.
