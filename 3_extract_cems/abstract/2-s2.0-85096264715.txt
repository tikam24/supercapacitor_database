Transition Metal oxalate is one of the pragmaticmaterial forcatalytic, sensor, battery and SCs application due to its low cost, environmental friendliness, and good chemical stability. In this regard a lot of research work has recently focused on implementation of it as potential electrode materials for enhanced energy storage. Owing to their unique property to act as a carbon sink further establishes them as sustainable and green materials for energy storage, thus strengthening their stand among varietyof materials available for possible commercialization. This progress report presents the various known transition metal oxalates, their synthetic analogues, thermal and magnetic behaviour, the reaction pathways, particularly for energy materials such as Li ion, supercapacitor and redox flow battery systems. Finally, the challenges of these materials in these energy storge systems for high power and energy output are outlined.
