The synthesis of pepper shell activated carbon-based supercapacitor electrodes to determine the effect of particle size on electrode performance has been done. The pepper shell activated carbon was synthesized using HCl activator with a ratio of 1: 4 (W/V) and then activated physically in an inert condition at 6000C. The characteristics of activated carbon samples were carried out using SEM and BET. SEM results show that carbon has a porous morphology with radius size of absorption pores of 130.0 nm and 121.9 nm respectively for particle size samples of 74 microns and 149 microns. The results of cyclic voltammetry (CV) to find out the value of specific capacitance at a scan rate of 50 mV/s showed an amount of 0.037 F/g and 0.0075 F/g for samples 74 and 149 microns. The results showed the influence of particle size on the performance of supercapacitor electrodes.
