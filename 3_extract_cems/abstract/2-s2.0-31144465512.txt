Ti1-xVxO2 was prepared by a sol-gel method. The structure, composition, surface area, and specific capacitance (μF cm-2) was characterized by X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, N2 adsorption/desorption measurements, and cyclic voltammetry. These analyses suggested that high specific capacitance could be attained with rutile type Ti1-xVxO2 with high vanadium content. A maximum specific capacitance of 330 μF cm2- at 1 mV s -1 was achieved, which is almost 1.5 times larger than that of nanocrystalline ruthenium oxide.
