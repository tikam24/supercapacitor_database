In order to improve the compactness of film electrode for the MEMS supercapacitor, modified PPy film is deposited uniformly on the three-dimensional MEMS surpercapacitors structure by adding quantitative benzenesulfonate (BSNa) and graphene oxide (GO) into the electrolyte. The electrochemical performances of the modified samples are tested and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy(EIS) and constant current charge-discharge test (CP). The results show that the uniform and dense modified PPy film can be fabricated by the cyclic voltammetry in the voltage range of -0.4 ~ 1.0 V, with the scan rate of 100 mV /s and the scan lap of 56, when the ratio of Py to BSNa is 0.5 and the content of GO is 0.4wt%. It is observed by SEM that modification can reduce the agglomeration of PPy particles largely, so that PPy molecular chain arranged closely after polymerization to form a regular three-dimensional mesh structure. The capacitance of the samples is up to 13.3 mF/cm2 at a discharge current of 2 mA by the constant current charge-discharge test and the electrochemical properties of MEMS surpercapacitors is obviously improved.
