Porous CoSe2 nanosheets prepared via a one-step microwave method can be considered an excellent electrode material and the associated electrochemical properties were evaluated. The porous CoSe2 nanosheets revealed admirable electrochemical properties in terms of high specific capacitance (333 F g-1 when the current density is 1 A g-1) and excellent enduring stability (100.97% of the initial specific capacity over 25000 cycles at 5 A g-1). An asymmetric supercapacitor (CoSe2-anode, AC-cathode) was assembled, offering good properties accompanied by an energy density of 18.9 W h kg-1 when the power density reached 387 W kg-1. These impressive results are obtained largely on account of the porous structure of CoSe2, which provides a path for ion transport, and the introduction of Se into CoSe2, which offers high electrical conductivity, further enhancing the electrochemical performance.
