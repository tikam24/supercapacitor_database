The reduced graphene oxide (RGO)/bisphenol A (BPA) composites were prepared by an adsorption-reduction method. The composites are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-vis, thermogravimetric (TG) analysis, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results confirm that BPA is adsorbed on the basal plane of RGO by ?-? stacking interaction. Furthermore, the electrochemical behaviors were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge techniques and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results show that the RGO/BPA nanocomposites exhibit ultrahigh specific capacitance of 466 F路g?1 at a current density of 1 A路g?1, excellent rate capability (more than 81% retention at 10 A路g?1 relative to 1 A路g?1) and superior cycling stability (90% capacitance decay after 4000 cycles). Consequently, the RGO/BPA nanocomposites can be regarded as promising electrode materials for supercapacitor applications.
