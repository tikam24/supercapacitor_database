Co3P2O8·8H2O particles are successfully synthesized as a high performance electrode material of supercapacitor via a facile chemical precipitation method. The prepared Co3P2O8·8H2O exhibits outstanding capacitive properties. A specific capacitance of 446.25 F g-1 is obtained at a current density of 0.5 A g-1 and 100% of the specific capacitance is retained after 1000 cycles. An asymmetric supercapacitor using Co3P2O8·8H2O as the positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as the negative electrode yielded an energy density of 11.9 Wh kg-1 and a maximum power density of 3.59 kW kg-1. Moreover, it delivers a good rate capability and long-term stability. These excellent electrochemistry performances indicate that this novel material is promising for potential application in supercapacitors.
