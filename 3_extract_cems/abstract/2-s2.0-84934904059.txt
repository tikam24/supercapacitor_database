The two-dimensional single-layer and few-layered graphene exhibit many attractive properties such as large specific surface area and high charge carrier mobility. However, graphene sheets tend to stack together and form aggregates, which do not possess the desirable properties associated with graphene. Herein, we report a method to fabricate three-dimensional (3D), bicontinuous graphene monolith through a versatile hollow nickel (Ni) template derived from polymer blends. The poly(styrene)/poly(ethylene oxide) were used to fabricate a bicontinuous gyroid template using controlled phase separation. The Ni template was formed by electroless metal depositing on the polymer followed by removing the polymer phase. The resulting hollow Ni structure was highly porous (95.2%). Graphene was then synthesized from this hollow Ni template using chemical vapor deposition and the free-standing bicontinuous graphene monolith was obtained in high-throughput process. Finally, the bicontinuous graphene monolith was used directly as binder-free electrode in supercapacitor applications. The supercapacitor devices exhibited excellent stability.
