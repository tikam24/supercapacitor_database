A novel asymmetric supercapacitor device in an aqueous electrolyte is fabricated using a vanadyl phosphate/carbon nanocomposite as the positive electrode and a polypyrrole-derived carbon nanowire as the negative electrode. The vanadyl phosphate/carbon nanocomposites are synthesized by a simple two-step approach in which layered VOPO4Â·2H2O is first intercalated by dodecylamine and then annealed at high temperature, leading to the in situ carbonization of the intercalated dodecylamine. It is found that the sample in which the incorporated carbon with a high degree of graphitization exhibits a high specific capacitance of 469 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 and excellent rate performance (retained 77% capacitance at 10 A g-1). A polypyrrole-derived carbon nanowire is synthesized by the direct carbonization of nanowire-shaped polypyrrole, revealing a rough surface of nanowire-like frameworks and good electrochemical behavior. Taking advantage of both positive and negative materials, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor device exhibits a high energy density of 30.6 W h kg-1 at a high power density of 813 W kg-1 in a wide voltage region of 0-1.6 V, as well as a good electrochemical stability (84.3% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles). The present work can shed light on the fabrication of novel asymmetric supercapacitors with high-performance.
