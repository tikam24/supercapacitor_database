Aerogels, novel materials, have three-dimensional (3D) porous nanostructure. They exhibit high porosity, high pore volume, high specific surface area, and low density. They also have appealing properties such as high-temperature resistance, low thermal conductivity, and low refractive index. These advantages lead to aerogels' wide applications such as thermal insulation, adsorption and separation, photoelectricity catalysis, energy storage and transformation, sound absorption, as well as sound insulation. Among the aerogels, graphene-based aerogels (GBAs) have attracted much attention in recent years. They inherit comprehensive advantages of graphene and aerogels. Therefore, the preparation strategies of GBAs materials were systematically introduced. Compared with the traditional aerogels, GBAs have superior mechanical properties such as high mechanical strength and high elasticity, as well as enhanced electrical properties such as high conductivity and high specific capacitance. Next, the applications of GBAs in energy and environmental fields were introduced. The unique characteristics of GBAs helped the further development of electrochemistry and chemisorption. Specifically, the deficiencies of GBAs were pointed out, and a bold vision for the future developments of GBAs was provided. Although the properties of GBAs are significantly improved, their functions and industrial scale are still insufficient. Future research on GBAs could expand GBAs' application fields and aim at the large-scale production of GBAs.
