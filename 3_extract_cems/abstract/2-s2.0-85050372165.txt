Along with the quick development of flexible and wearable electronic devices, there is an ever-growing demand for light-weight, flexible, and wearable power sources. Because of the high power density, excellent cycling stability and easy fabrication, flexible supercapacitors are widely studied for this purpose. Graphene-based nanomaterials are attractive electrode materials for flexible and wearable supercapacitors owing to their high surface area, good mechanical and electrical properties, and excellent electrochemical stability. The 2D structure and high aspect ratio of graphene nanosheets make them easy to assemble into films or fibers with good mechanical properties. In recent years, enormous progress has been made in developing flexible and wearable graphene-based supercapacitors. Here, the material and structure design strategies for developing film-shaped and emerging fiber-shaped flexible supercapacitors based on graphene nanomaterials are summarized.
