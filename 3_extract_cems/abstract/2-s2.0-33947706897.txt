Temporary coverage of high peak power consumption requires a high power delivery rate also at low average power consumption. Consequently peak load coverage becomes economically expensive for the user. Using supercapacitors as energy storage can help to reduce the power delivery rate. The capability of storing energy can even substitute UPS for safety relevant systems. Two examples, an electrodynamic rail brake and a charging station for AutoTram, demonstrate applications of temporary high power requirement. By using supercapacitors the required power delivery rate could be reduced significantly. Applications in the field of low power networks have become feasible through the capability of parametrisation of the power consumption. The examples focus on the characteristic of the capacitors and the interaction with the power electronic and the load.
