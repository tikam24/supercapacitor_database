Ordered hierarchical NiCo2O4/Bi2MoO6 nanorod arrays directly grown on Ti foil are fabricated by a facile two-step hydrothermal reaction. The heterostructured electrode enables synergistic effect for excellent electrochemical properties. Moreover, this unique three-dimensional nanostructure not only promotes the electron transfer and ion diffusion but also provides good structure stability. As the binder-free electrode, hierarchical NiCo2O4/Bi2MoO6 nanorods show high capacitance (0.94 F cm−2 at 5 mA cm−2) and good cycling stability (capacitance retention of 96.3%).
