Irradiance variability and its impact on the power grid is an important consideration at high PV penetration levels. Ramp-rate control using energy storage has been proposed to smooth the power output from PV installations caused by irradiance variations. As distributed module-based micro-inverters/converters are becoming more common, they opens up possibilities for integrated module level storage for ramp-rate control. We examine using supercapacitor storage, integrated into a distributed micro-inverter, for regulating the ramp-rate. Experiments show that very modest amounts of storage are able to be used, reducing the ramp-rate to acceptable levels.
