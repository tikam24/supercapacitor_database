Permittivity is a very important quantity often used to quantify the behavior of a system under given electric field distribution in space. The dielectric polarization and related losses are two main associated effects, which are connected through the complex permittivity via its real and imaginary parts respectively. The quantitative measure of permittivity is essential for predicting response of a system e.g., charge storage characteristics of capacitor/supercapacitor; flux through a charge carrying closed surface, exciton binding energy in soar cells/LEDs, properties of liquid crystals and LCDs, relaxation of dielectrics, microwave absorption effectiveness of shielding materials, response of antenna systems, governing phase velocity of electromagnetic radiation through given medium, designing of metamaterials etc. This chapter begins with the definition & significance of permittivity, its real and imaginary parts, absolute and relative values etc. In the next section, various models for permittivity & governing equations; relevance of permittivity in energy storage, energy harvesting, energy conversion, energy transmission, dissipation & stealth; and literature account of the same is discussed. Finally, at the end, summary, challenges and prospects are outlined.
