Titanate nanotubes (TNTs) were prepared by a hydrothermal method and loaded with different silver (Ag) nanoparticle contents at 0, 1, 5 and 10 wt%. Phase composition and surface morphology were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis) were used to study element composition and optical properties, respectively. Electrochemical properties of Ag-TNTs electrodes were examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) with a potential sweep from -0.2 V to 0.45 V at scan rates 1-200 mVs-1. Specific capacitance was calculated from the galvanostatic charge-discharge (G-CD). Ag-TNTs samples showed increased oxidation and reduction peaks and specific capacitance from discharge time of Ag-TNTs electrode materials with increasing Ag nanoparticle content loading.
