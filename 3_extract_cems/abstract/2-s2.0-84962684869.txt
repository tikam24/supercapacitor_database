A facile sonochemical route has been proposed in which liquid phase exfoliation of graphite into single and multi-layer graphene is obtained. An organic solvent ortho-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) is used for the graphene exfoliation and the effect of addition of organic salts in ODCB solvent is investigated. The characterization of the as prepared graphene is done using SEM, TEM and UV-Visible spectroscopy. The graphene film was prepared using vacuum filtration method and resistivity measurement was done using Four-Probe method. The application of graphene film in making flexible paper supercapacitor is demonstrated. It is observed that the concentration of graphene synthesized by liquid phase exfoliation method has been found to enhance appreciably with addition of EDTA disodium salt.
