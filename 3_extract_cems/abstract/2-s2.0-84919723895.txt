Nanofibers of graphene-oxide/polyaniline/polyvinylidene fluoride (GO/PANI/PVDF) and pure PANI have been produced by electrospinning process. The morphology of obtained nanofibers was characterized by scanning electron microscope. GO/PANI/PVDF nanofibers exhibited better fiber morphology than PANI/PVDF and pure PANI. Electrochemical study of nanofibers was done by using cyclic voltammetry. From the charge-discharge analysis, the specific capacitance of 170.63 F/g was obtained for GO/PANI/PVDF nanofibers, which evidently shows a new pathway for the development of these nanofibers for futuristic supercapacitor applications.
