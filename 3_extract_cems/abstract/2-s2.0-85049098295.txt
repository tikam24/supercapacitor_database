Graphene oxide-oxynitride hybrid nanoscrolls (GOXNs) were synthesized by embedding oxynitride molecules onto the graphene oxide (GO) sheets through a simple solution-based reduction of GO. The synthesized GOXNs exhibit good structural stability and high specific capacitance when they are used as supercapacitor electrodes. All the films were prepared via spin coating, and the post deposition annealing of the films transformed GO sheets into nanoscrolls. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses of the hybrid film reveal that GO sheets are transformed to nanoscrolls by Câ€“N bonding and various nitrogen based functional groups are attached to the GO sheets. The electrochemical performance of GOXNs is much better than that of pristine GO. The high specific capacitance and energy density of 260 F/g and 36.2 Wh/kg, respectively, were exhibited by GOXNs, whereas the pristine GO exhibited specific capacitance and energy density of 215 F/g and 29.86 Wh/kg, respectively, at a current density of 2 A/g. The GOXNs show good cyclic stability for more than 2000 cycles at a current density of 5 A/g. The observed high specific capacitance of GOXNs is due to the pseudo-capacitive contribution of the nitrogen functional groups along with quinone oxygen (residual oxygen functional groups) that accelerates the faradaic reactions and facilitates faster wetting. The results suggest that GOXNs are a promising electrode material for supercapacitors and batteries.
