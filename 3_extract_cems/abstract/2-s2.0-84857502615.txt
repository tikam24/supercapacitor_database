In the present study, we report, for the first time, the synthesis of cobalt oxyhydroxide thin films on inexpensive stainless steel substrate using potentiodynamic electrodeposition method. These films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. The orthorhombic crystal structure was revealed by the X-ray diffraction study. The FT-IR spectrum confirmed the formation of cobalt oxyhydroxide. The SEM studies showed the nanoflakes-like morphology with an average thickness of 100 nm. The cyclic voltammetry study of the cobalt oxyhydroxide films in 1 M KOH showed maximum specific capacitance of 449 F g -1 at scan rate of 5 mV s -1. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
