The proceedings contain 36 papers. The topics discussed include: gas sensing performance of hydrothermally synthesized indium oxide microbricks; studies on air exposure effect on polythiophene thin films; characterization and holographic study of nanostructure copper selenide thin films grown at room temperature; an eco-friendly synthesis, characterization and antibacterial applications of gellan gum based silver nanocomposite hydrogel; property enhancement of carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites prepared by fused deposition modeling; modeling and simulation of zinc oxide anode based organic light emitting diode; dielectric and emissive properties of sorghum (jowar) vegetation at C-band microwave frequency; and galvanostatically deposited polypyrrole thin films for supercapacitor application: effect of surfactant.
