The polyaniline bonding with nitrogen doped MoS2 (MoSxNy@PANI) was fabricated by hydrothermal vulcanization, nitrogen doping and electropolymerization process, which was designed as the stable structured supercapacitor electrode. The interface bonding interaction between conductive PANI and conductive MoSxNy is proposed to prove the feasibility of the coordination bond enforced hybrid electrode material by using experimental measurement and density functional theory simulation calculation. The MoSxNy involves an intermediate energy level to improve its electrical conductivity by lowering band gap from 1.45 to 0.65 eV. MoSxNy@PANI involves the interface Mo-N coordination bond between N atom of terminal amino group of PANI and the exposed Mo atom of MoSxNy. MoSxNy@PANI shows lower energy barrier (5.07 eV) and lower interface energy (1.41 eV) than MoS2@PANI (5.31 eV, 1.86 eV) due to interface Mo-N bonding, contributing to its highly improved structure stability. MoSxNy@PANI exhibits higher pseudocapacitive contribution (61.4%) than MoSxNy (47.4%) and MoS2 (41.9%), indicating the Mo-N coordination-induced activation of PANI. MoSxNy@PANI electrode achieves high specific capacitance of 577 F g−1 and impressive capacitance retention of 85.3% after 3000 cycles even at high current density of 5 A g−1. Interface Mo-N coordination bonding MoSxNy@PANI with high electrochemical stability and capacitance performance exhibits the promising application as stable energy storage devices.
