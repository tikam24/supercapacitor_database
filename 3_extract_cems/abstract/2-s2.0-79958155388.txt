Highly ordered α-Fe2O3 nanotube arrays have been fabricated by a simple and cost-effective anodization method on iron foils. The α-Fe2O3 nanotube arrays exhibit high specific capacitance (138 F•g- 1 at 1.3 A•g- 1), remarkable rate capability (91 F•g- 1 at 12.8 A•g - 1) and good cycling stability (the capacitance retention close to 89% after 500 cycles), due to the unique nanostructures of the α-Fe 2O3 nanotube arrays, which providing high surface area, fast ion transport pathways and robust structures. These features made the α-Fe2O3 nanotube array electrode very attractive for supercapacitor applications. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All Rights Reserved.
