In this paper, a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) and its control strategy are designed and analyzed for a dc grid. HESS is used to maintain the constant dc grid voltage due to the changing power surges. The batteries' storage system and super-capacitor (SC) are used to balance the slow-changing surges and fast-changing surges. A decrease in conventional energy sources has led to cost-effective renewable power sources. The utilization of these resources reduces the fuel cost to a great extent. In remote areas where the primary utility grid is not feasible, the standalone renewable generation can offer more benefits. Due to the varying nature of the load, demand can control the hybrid renewable energy system is required. To maintain the stability, power flow control, and power-sharing between the battery and SC requires the energy management system. Currently, the battery storage system seems to solve the load demand and power generation fluctuations in real-time power systems. The paper proposes a Modern Predictive Controller (MPC) for a hybrid energy system. It is based on the decoupling of different frequency components and utilized error signals of battery current to control the SC and faster voltage regulation and reduced current stress on the battery.
