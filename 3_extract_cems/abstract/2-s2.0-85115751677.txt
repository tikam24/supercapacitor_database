High-performance electrochemical energy storage device is an important means to solve the energy problem. As one of the next-generation energy storage components, supercapacitor has received more and more attention in recent years. In this study, MoS2/N-CNTs nanocomposites were synthesized using MoO3 as the template. The ultra-thin MoS2 nanosheets were modified on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes. The nanocomposites showed rapid electron transfer efficiency, increased charge storage, and good cycle stability. When the current density is 1 A g−1, the specific capacitance of the composite is about 225 F g−1. In the two-electrode system, the energy density is 9.89 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 699.3 W·kg−1. At a high current density of 10 A g−1, the initial capacitance of the composite material maintained 87% even after 10,000 cycles.
