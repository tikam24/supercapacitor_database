Supercapacitors are a member of the energy storage family with a superior power density and longer cyclic life. In fact, activated carbon is utilized in many such devices owing to its higher specific surface area to attain high specific capacitance and enhanced electrochemical performance. Activated carbon's intrinsic properties, such as pore size, surface area, and surface chemistry, can be tuned through pretreatment and then utilized for optimum supercapacitor performance. Pre-treatment is a key step in converting complex carbohydrate structures to fuels efficiently. Much research has been devoted to the activation and pre-treatment methods to enhance the quality of yielded activated carbon that is to be utilized in supercapacitors. Activated carbon is an excellent absorbent and is therefore utilized in various applications such as filtration, gas purification, energy storage (supercapacitor), and metal extraction. Therefore, producing high-quality activated carbon is the key to achieving the highest yield for supercapacitor devices. In this chapter we summarize methods of pretreatment techniques adopted to produce high-quality activated carbon for supercapacitor devices. To date, the pretreatment techniques that have been reported to convert complex structured lignocellulose to activated carbon efficiently are physical pre-treatment, chemical pretreatment, and biological pretreatment, which will be explained with their pros and cons. Finally, a performance-based comparison has been made on the pre-treated activated carbon obtained through different precursors in terms of its specific capacitance and surface area values.
