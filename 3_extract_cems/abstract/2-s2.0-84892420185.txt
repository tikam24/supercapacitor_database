Very less attention has been paid recently to the electrochemical properties of graphene films with intrinsic flat structure prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In this work, button supercapacitors were fabricated using ionic liquid as electrolytes and layer-by-layer graphene structures as electrodes. The specific capacitances of the supercapacitors increased with the increase of layer number. The areal specific capacitance of ten-layer graphene supercapacitor was 0.29 mF/cm2 at the scan rate of 50 mV/s, which was about three times of that of monolayer graphene supercapacitor (0.1 mF/cm 2). The sandwiched multi-layer structures with oxide deposition further improved the device performance. However, the polycrystalline nature of CVD-grown graphene films introduced structural instability during charge-discharge process, resulting in degraded capacitive performance and cycling stability. Our results suggest that graphene films with intrinsic in-plane structure might not be ideal candidates for electrode materials. Â© 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.
