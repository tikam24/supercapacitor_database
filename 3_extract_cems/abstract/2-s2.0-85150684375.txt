In a smart-grid system, several circuits and energy storage systems are used. Using supercapacitors are commonly found in such applications due to their excellent properties. However, since its rated voltage is relatively low, it must be connected in series, and also step-up bidirectional voltage converters are commonly utilized. This work proposes a three-level boost converter as a core element connecting in a modular manner. If non-ideal devices are used and/or asymmetrical switching signals for the switches are applied, the voltage across the output capacitors might be different. It can lead to a failed operation. An equalized voltage control method with the current loop control is proposed to ensure similar capacitor voltages. The energy control is applied for the output voltage. The proposed controllers are validated using MATLAB/Simulink and then implemented in dSPACE DS1202. The experiment results show that the supercapacitors can exchange power bi-directionally with load through the proposed converter.
