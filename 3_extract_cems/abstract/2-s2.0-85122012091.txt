In this study, electrodeposition combined with anodization was employed to prepare a nanoporous tin oxide film on a pure copper substrate. It was found that annealing temperature played a critically significant role in regulating the crystallinity, pore size, and contents of different oxidation states of the anodized tin oxide film to affect the electrochemical performance. The study verified that SnOx films treated by optimized annealing at 500 Â°C with precisely controlling the nanoporous morphology and crystallinity displayed competitive specific capacitance at an appropriate ratio of Sn4+ to Sn2+. A maximum specific capacitance of 86.2 mF/cm2 could be achieved at this temperature, and the capacitance retention rate still exceeded 90% even after 8000 charge-discharge cycles. With properly designed annealing treatment, we implemented tin film anodization to obtain an optimized electrode with significantly enhanced electrochemical performance, which shows a promising application in the electrochemical field to prepare electrodes.
