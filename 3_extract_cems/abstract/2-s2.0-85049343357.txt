Transition metal oxides with three-dimensional architectures have attracted great interest as high-performance supercapacitor electrodes. In this work, tube-like yolk-shell Co3O4@NiMoO4 composite were prepared via a two-step synthesis for the first time. Ultrathin NiMoO4 nanosheets arrayed randomly to form porous shell, which fully covered around Co3O4 fibers with interspaces between core and shell. Benefitting from unique structure and chemical composition, the Co3O4@NiMoO4 composite as supercapacitor electrodes exhibited enhanced specific capacitance of 913.25 F g−1 at high current density of 10 A g−1 and large capacitance retention of 88% with current density increased from 0.5 to 20 A g−1 as well as remarkable cycling stability. In addition, NiCo2O4@NiMoO4 and NiFe2O4@NiMoO4 composites with similar morphologies were obtained. Namely, this work exhibits a general approach to reasonable construct and preparation hierarchical structure for high performance supercapacitor electrodes.
