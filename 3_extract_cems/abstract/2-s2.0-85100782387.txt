Pseudocapacitances are being increasingly explored due to their potential applications to achieve higher capacitance and energy density than the traditional electric double-layer capacitances. It is one of the urgent challenges to realize the simple, fast, and good process compatibility manufacturing of pseudocapacitance for its wide industrial applications. A one-step laser-induced plasma-assisted ablation-based deposition (LIPAA-based deposition) method for fabrication of embedded planar pseudocapacitive supercapacitors on the ITO glass surface was proposed. The surface morphology and structural characteristics of the designed pseudocapacitance interdigital electrode surfaces were investigated using the XRD, SEM, and XPS. The cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) were used to analyze the electrochemical properties of the prepared glass-based planar pseudocapacitances, which achieved a potential range of − 0.5 to 0.4 V in the PVA/H2SO4 gel electrolyte due to the reaction induced by ions in the electrolyte intercalation/deintercalation process on the electrode surface. A maximum areal capacitance of 238.57 μF cm−2 was achieved by the manufactured capacitor and ~ 80.022% initial capacitance retention after 2000 cycles. The one-step preparation of planar supercapacitors with ITO conductive glass surfaces as electrodes is of great significance for the commercial development of pseudocapacitors in the field of electrochemical energy storage.
