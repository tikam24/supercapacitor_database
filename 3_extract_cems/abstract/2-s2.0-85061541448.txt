In this paper a combination of isolated DC-DC resonant converters is proposed to interface an electrical hybrid system composed of a battery bank as the main energy source and a bank of supercapacitors (SC) as the auxiliary power source. The battery bank is connected to a DC-bus via an isolated LLC resonant converter, while the SC bank is coupled to the DC-bus through a symmetrical bidirectional CLLC resonant converter. This allows soft switching and enables high switching frequency operations, and then guarantee high power density and high efficiency. An energy management strategy for the proposed structure is studied and implemented. The proposed approach relies on the energetic behavior of the sources to share the required power. The simulation results prove the efficiency of the proposed energy management strategy as well as the performance of the resonant converters.
