Supercapacitors (electrochemical double layer capacitors) are energy storage devices, akin to batteries, but with different energy storage mechanisms. They demonstrate fast charging, reliability, and large number of recharge cycles (>100,000). They also have the ability to deliver much more power than batteries and store more energy than traditional solid state capacitors. With novel materials being available and their energy storage mechanisms being better understood, they may well find themselves positioned as the key energy storage technology of tomorrow. In supercapacitors, positive and negative electrodes are typically made from high surface area carbon immersed in an electrolyte solution. By either increasing the size of the electrode/electrolyte interface (increasing the surface area of the electrodes) or decreasing the separation between the ions and electrode the capacitance stored increases. High-performance activated carbons are currently used in commercial supercapacitors. However, the question remains - which material can provide the highest performance? To answer this, it is necessary to understand how different active material factors (pore size, surface area, surface chemistry, graphitization, etc.) affect performance. Capacitance increases with increasing accessible surface area, so research is largely aimed at maximizing this area. In a given volume, decreasing the pore size has the direct effect of increasing the surface area, so finding an optimal pore size has been the goal of most researchers. Finding a low-cost but high-performing porous carbon material is seen as optimal. Carbon nanotubes are also being widely studied. These and other materials used in supercapacitor electrodes will be reviewed in the presentation.
