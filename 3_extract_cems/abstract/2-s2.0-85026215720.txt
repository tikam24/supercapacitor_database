Binder-free, low cost poly(o-toluidine) (POT) has been synthesized by emulsion polymerization method. The synthesized POT salt has been tested for supercapacitor application through cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge discharge analysis. The POT salt exhibits a specific capacitance value of 301 F/g. The synthesized material was further characterized by FTIR, UV-visible spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis.
