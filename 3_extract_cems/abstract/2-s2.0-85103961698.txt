The energy storage prospects of organic molecule has recently rendered them as promising candidates for supercapacitors (SCs) applications. Herein, we report an investigation into the electrochemical and energy storage capability of two carbazole based monomer and dimer moieties, connected through mono (CBZ-1) and diacetylene (CBZ-2)-based linkages. Synthesized intermediates and final compounds were experimentally and theoretically characterized via spectral, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations respectively. Excellent electrochemical properties were observed in an organic pseudo-capacitive-supercapacitor (SC) based on the carbazole derivatives, with the dimer (CBZ-2) functionalized with diacetylene showing a comparatively better capacitive and improved electrochemical characteristics (398F.g−1 at a current density of 1 A.g−1) than the mono (CBZ-1) derivative.
