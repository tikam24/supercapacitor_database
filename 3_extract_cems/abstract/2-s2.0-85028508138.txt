This article describes a method for the long-Term testing of storage batteries and high-capacity ion sources, implemented using National Instruments technologies. A test stand was developed using DAQ NI USB-6001. A brief description of the program implemented in NI LabVIEW is given. The part of the program code is opened-the block diagram of correction of temperature coefficients. The interface of a virtual device for monitoring charge and discharge is shown. In the course of the test, on the test bed, the degradation of the capacity of the charge was proved. The test results showed that the ionistor capacitance dropped from 50 kF to 3.3 kF for two weeks of testing and continued to decrease with each charge and discharge cycle.
