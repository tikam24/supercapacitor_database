In this paper, the supercapacitor based Multiple Independent Sources Input and Output-Series (MISIOS) DC-DC module has been presented. The MISIOS DC-DC module consists of several DC-DC converters. Each input of DC-DC converter connects a supercapacitor stack; outputs of the DC-DC converters are connected in series to meet the high terminal voltage. The topology of MISIOS and its control scheme are proposed. The control scheme can not only make the total output voltage of the MISIOS meet the terminal voltage, but also balance the output voltages of the DC-DC converters. The control scheme consisting of an output voltage loop, individual inner current loops, and individual output voltage loops. The output voltage loop provides the basic reference for inner current loops, which is modified by the respective output voltage loops. The simulation result and the experiment result verify that the proposed control scheme can eliminate the difference of the each output voltage and also can improve the stability of the DC bus voltage.
