A technical software platform with friendly interface specialized for the simulation of the hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) with synergic electric power supply (SEPS) system was established by redevelopment of HEV simulation software based on Advisor. The redeveloped software overcame the shortcoming of the Advisor which can not simulate the performance of the HEV with SEPS system composed of storage batteries and supercapacitors. The performance simulation was performed for the HEV with SEPS system and the simulated results were compared with those of the HEV with electrically supplied only by batteries or supercapacitors. Results showed that both the dynamic performance and the fuel economy of the HEV with SEPS system are improved.
