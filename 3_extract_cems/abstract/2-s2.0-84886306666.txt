Birnessite MnO2 nanosheets were synthesized by self-limiting deposition of KMnO4 in a facile low-temperature hydrothermal process. The MnO2 electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 169 F g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1, good rate capability with a capacitance of 96 F g-1 even at a high current density of 5 A g-1, as well as excellent cycle stability with capacitance retention of 94% at 1 A g-1 after 1,000 cycles.
