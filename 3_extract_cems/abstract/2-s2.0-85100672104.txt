We proposed a facile strategy to synthesize porous zinc-doped copper sulfide (Zn–CuS) nanoflowers using a cationic surfactant (CTAB) by hydrothermal route. The end product is used as electrode material in supercapacitor in KOH as electrolyte. Initially it is found that inorganic dopant (Zn2+) plays a vital role in controlling or modifying the morphology of CuS which has resulted in the newer materials exhibiting multi-functional, high-performance stabilizer character further than what traditional single nanomaterials possess. Morphological analysis illustrates flower-like structures that the size of Zn–CuS nanostructure is about 14–20 nm. When utilized as an electroactive material for electrochemical capacitors, the Zn–CuS electrode delivers a specific capacitance (Cs) 826.31 Fg−1 at 5mAcm−2, which is higher than the CuS electrode 328.26 Fg−1 at 5mAcm−2. The outstanding electrochemical behavior is essentially by reason of the porous nature of synthesized nanostructures, which gives quick diffusion pathway to electronic and ionic transport on electrode and electrolyte interfaces. This exploration work affirms that the Zn–CuS electrode can serve as more attractive material for supercapacitive applications.
