Suspensions of Ag and MnO2 nanoparticles in n-butanol were prepared by synthesis in aqueous solutions and liquid-liquid extraction to the n-butanol phase. Lauryl gallate (LG) was used as a reducing agent for the fabrication of Ag nanoparticles from AgNO3 solutions. MnO2 nanoparticles were prepared by the reduction of KMnO4 with n-butanol. LG showed strong adsorption on Ag and MnO2 particles allowing for their liquid-liquid extraction. The adsorption mechanism involved complexation of metal atoms on the particle surface with phenolic OH group of LG. The synthesis and liquid-liquid extraction method offers benefits for nanotechnology, which were demonstrated by the fabrication of advanced supercapacitor electrodes and devices. LG allowed co-dispersion of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and MnO2 in the n-butanol phase. In this strategy as-synthesized MnO2 nanoparticles were mixed directly with MWCNT. This avoided the difficulties associated with extracting particles from aqueous suspensions and subsequent particle agglomeration during the drying stage. The MnO2-MWCNT nanocomposite electrodes showed an exceptionally high capacitance of 8.0 F cm-2 at a scan rate of 2 mV s-1 and significant improvement in capacitance retention at high charge-discharge rates. Excellent capacitive performance was achieved at high active mass loading and a large ratio of active material to current collector mass. It was found that such capacitive behavior resulted from improved co-dispersion and mixing of MnO2 and MWCNT. The composite MnO2-MWCNT electrodes were used for the fabrication of asymmetric supercapacitor devices, which showed good electrochemical performance in a voltage window of 1.6 V. The proposed method can be used for other applications of nanoparticles of metals and oxides in nanotechnology.
