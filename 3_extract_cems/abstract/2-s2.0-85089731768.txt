In this article, we demonstrated the fabrication of micro-supercapacitors by photolithography technology and liquid-air interface self-assembly method. A large-area uniform film with a thickness of 18 nm was fabricated by the modified liquid-air interface self-assembly, and a narrow finger gap, which was 30 μm, was manufactured by photolithography. In addition, the electrode width and the interdigital gap ratio were 3:1. The power density and energy density of the fabricated device were 1.21 W cm−3 and 2.93 mWh cm−3. There was an extremely short time constant of the fabricated device, which is 0.38 ms. All of these leaded to higher conductivity, shorter ion transmission distance and faster charge and discharge rates. In addition, 87.2% of the capacitance was retained after 10000 cycles.
