Designing a reasonable structure for electrode materials is critical to increase the performance of supercapacitor. Herein, the 3D hierarchical structure composite materials contained carbon cloth, cobalt carbonate hydroxide nanorod and metal-organic frameworks derived layered double hydroxide cage hybrid arrays (CC@CCH-MOF-LDH HAs) are designed. This unique hierarchical structure and the synergistic effect of the bimetallic system improve the electrical conductivity of the material, provide more active sites and shorten the ion transport path, which are beneficial to increase the electrochemical performance of the composite material. Electrochemical measurements show that CC@CCH-MOF-LDH HAs have high specific capacitance of 1700 F g −1 at current density of 2 A g −1 , superior rate capability (even the current density was increased to 50 A g −1 , the capacitance retention rate reached 78.2%) and good cycling stability, which indicate that the CC@CCH-MOF-LDH HAs with 3D hierarchical structure is a very promising supercapacitor electrode material.
