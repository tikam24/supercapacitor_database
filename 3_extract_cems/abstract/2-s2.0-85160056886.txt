The study of preparing cocoa pods activated carbon which will be used as supercapacitor electrodes has been successfully made with Potassium hydroxide (KOH) 0.3 and 0.4 mol/L activators at 700oC. Electrodes of activated carbon are made by a combination of chemical and activation methods. Physical properties were analyzed by measuring the density and dimensional, diffraction of X-Ray (XRD), and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The technique of preparing carbon electrodes started from pre-carbonization, milling, chemical activation, pellet making, carbonization, and physical activation. Analysis of dimensions, and density in the manufacture of carbon electrodes showed the diameter (d), mass (m), density (ρ), and thickness (t) of the electrodes decreased along with the addition of Potassium hydroxide concentration from 0.3 to 0.4 mol/L. XRD measurement data obtaining the values of 2θ in the range of 23.569o-24.747o for the reflection plane 002, and 44.634o-44.781o for the reflection plane 100. Diffraction X-ray curve analysis indicate that the sample 0.4 mol/L 700oC has a smaller microcrystalline dimension height (Lc) measure and distance of lattice than the 0.3 mol/L 700oC sample, so it can be showed that the area of surface of the 0.4 mol/L700oC is bigger sample than the 0.3 mol/L 700oC. With an increase in the sample surface area, there is an indication that the activated carbon of cocoa pods can be used as a supercapacitor electrode as a renewable energy source.
