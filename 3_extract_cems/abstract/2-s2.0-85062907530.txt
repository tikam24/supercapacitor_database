Home-to-Vehicle (H2V) appears as an interesting research area due to its public services that incorporates new technologies and new devices for better life quality. The objective is to study and analyze house energy needs to optimize more efficiently the energy production for an optimal economy. In this context, hydrogen-based hybrid electric stand-alone systems are considered as a promising option to ensure efficient power generation without interruption and to meet fuel vehicles requirements. To perform this, a specific H2V simulation system is developed incorporating electrolyzer technology, solar energy and a Supercapacitor. Thus, to maintain the energy balance between demand and production, the excess electrical energy will be stored under different forms (electrical or chemical (H 2 gas)) according to system constrains. Therefore, the produced hydrogen through the excess will fueled the vehicle after the analysis of its state need. In fact, the flows exchange will be performed between the home and the PEMFC hybrid electric vehicle while supplying the appropriate amount H 2 . Therefore, it is necessary to develop an intelligent energy management (IEM) for the H2V system. The proposed IEM processes user preferences and manages the energy production and storage. The results obtained are discussed and tested using MATLAB/Simulink software.
