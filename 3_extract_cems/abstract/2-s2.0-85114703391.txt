In the present work, we report the synthesis of low-cost mesoporous biomass carbon (BC) from waste radish leaves for the first time with a specific surface area of 703.99 m2gâˆ’1 and was employed as support in the preparation of palladium-based (BC-TPEA@Pd) heterogeneous catalyst. The prepared BC-TPEA@Pd heterogeneous catalyst was fully characterized by numerous analytical techniques. Moreover, we have developed a greener reaction protocol for Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions using the basic extract of radish leaves with base/ligand/promoter/additives free reaction conditions. The newly developed reaction protocol offers greener reaction conditions, efficient, economical and highly recyclable methodology for the synthesis of substituted biaryls for commercial applications. Additionally, BC-TPEA@Pd catalyst shows high performance as supercapacitor electrode material in an aqueous electrolyte- based two electrode cell with a specific capacitance of 129.36F/g at a current density of 0.25 A/g and a 96.14 % of original capacitance retention after 2500 GCD cycles.
