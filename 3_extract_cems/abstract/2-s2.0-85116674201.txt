Vehicle to grid (V2G) is a technology in which all electric vehicles take the electric power and store it in rechargeable battery. Electric vehicles are considerably increasing the penetration of demand on the grid, and this is observed even more in residential applications. The purpose of this study is to introduce the use of smart solutions for monitoring and managing electrical power based on SOC especially when it is linked to recharging PEV batteries. Grid during off load demand V2G controller takes the power and charge the battery. During peak load demand, excess power of battery will be supplied to grid. Simulation of bidirectional AC/DC and DC/DC controller and their control circuit is analyzed by using Matlab Simulink software. The suggested controller architecture is for transferring power in vehicle-to-grid (V2G), where the AC/DC converter-1 functions as a single phase regulated rectifier or inverter, while the DC/DC converter-2 is a Buck/Boost converter with an Arduino-controlled firing angle This converter-1 and converter-2 are coupled by DC-link and follow the smart charging or discharging process. Thus, the resource to non-conventional energy and other alternatives is essential. Super capacitors are used in rapid charge/discharge cycles, where they are utilized for short-term energy storage. When it is produced, it is sent to the electricity system during peak demand.
