Due to their non-toxic and semi-conducting nature, metal sulfides have been widely applied in energy storage devices. Hydrothermally synthesized nickel manganese sulfide (NiMnS) was blended with chemically synthesized polyaniline (PANI) using different weight ratios. The elemental, structural, and morphological characteristics were analyzed using different characterization techniques (XPS, XRD, and SEM). Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were also carried out to investigate the influence of PANI in NiMnS. The electrochemical response of the NiMnS-PANI electrode was tested using a 1 M KOH electrolyte. NiMnS-PANI exhibits a remarkable specific capacity of 976 C/g in a three-cell setup. The supercapattery (NiMnS-PANI/||AC) was also developed, showing 160 C/g capacity through GCD measurements. The energy and power density for the NiMnS-PANI||AC device was 35.73 Wh/kg and 850 W/kg at 7 A/g. The NiMnS-PANI||AC device retained 98% capacity after 10,000 cycles. These electrochemical results showed that the constructed NiMnS-PANI AC device has a promising future in energy storage applications.
