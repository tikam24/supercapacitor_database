A galvanostatic anodization is used to prepare long TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTAs). TNTAs of over 100 Î¼m in length, with similar nanotube size and structural regularity to the classic TNTAs made from potentiostatic mode, are achieved at 10 mA cm-2. After a post-anodization in a H3PO4-based electrolyte, the TNTAs with long nanotubes exhibit good adhesion to Ti substrate. The as-prepared long TNTAs yield a larger areal capacitance of 128.4 mF cm-2. Further, the long TNTAs possess a higher surface area, making them suitable as support templates for other active materials.
