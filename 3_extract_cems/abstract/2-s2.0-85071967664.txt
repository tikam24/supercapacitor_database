Designing porous structure and surface properties of carbon electrodes is the key premise for efficient electron/ion transfer, which is crucial for improving electrochemical performance of supercapacitors in practical applications. Herein, N-doped activated carbon aerogel (NACA) with hierarchical porous structure and N, O-rich functionalities has been prepared from polyimide gel by activation and carbonization process. The NACA exhibits a high surface area of 1410 m2 g−1 with hierarchical porous structures, with both high micropore volume (0.481 cc g−1) and mesopore volume (0.566 cc g−1) as well as high heteroatom content, which is favorable for charge storage, ion transfer and electrolyte penetration. As a result, the NACA2-11 can deliver a high capacitance of 386 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in a three-electrode system and outstanding rate performance with the capacitance retaining 150 F g−1 at 100 A g−1 in aqueous electrolyte. Furthermore, the practical two-electrode device exhibits a high areal specific capacitance of 1584 mF cm−2 under the commercial level mass loading of 10 mg cm−2, and it stays a good cycling stability of 93% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles at 5 A g−1. This study paves the way for improving electrochemical performance of carbon-based supercapacitor under high mass loadings.
