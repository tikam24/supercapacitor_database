Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) show promise and potential in energy storage but have limited applications due to their poor conductivity. In this work, a flexible fabric electrode is constructed with a sphere-flake-sphere structure formed by a nick-metal-framework (Ni-MOF) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO). The sphere-flake-sphere structure improves the conductivity and enhances the electrochemical performance of flexible RGO/Ni-MOF/metallic fabric electrodes (RNMEs). The areal capacitance of the RNME samples can reach 260 mF/cm2 at a current density of 4 mA/cm2. The areal capacitance of RNME samples shows a good cycle stability after undergoing 2000 charging/discharging cycles. The all-solid-state asymmetric fabric supercapacitor (AAFSC) based on this hybrid and PPy fabric electrode shows excellent electrochemical energy-storage performance, with an areal capacitance of 95 mF/cm2, a power density of 3.07 mW/cm2, and an energy density of 7.72 Î¼Wh/cm2. The areal capacitance of AAFSC can keep over 70% of original areal capacitance after 1500 charging/discharging cycles. This flexible AAFSC shows a promise and potential for wearable textile electronics.
