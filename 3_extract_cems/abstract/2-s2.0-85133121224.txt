The reasonable design of electrode materials is crucial for tuning the electrochemical performances of advanced energy storage systems. Co-Ni-Se nanosheets uniformly growing on a butterfly-wing-derived carbon framework (Co-Ni-Se/BWCF) with strong anchoring are devised and prepared by a microwave treatment-ion exchange-chemical etching-hydrothermal selenization technique. Benefiting from its multi-components and unique structure, Co-Ni-Se/BWCF-160 exhibits excellent supercapacitor and sodium storage performances as self-supporting electrodes. When Co-Ni-Se/BWCF-160 is used as a supercapacitor electrode, its capacity is as high as 3050 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 and maintained 1006 F g−1 at 20.0 A g−1. The asymmetric supercapacitor based on Co-Ni-Se/BWCF-160 and a-BWC achieved a high energy density of 49.7 W h kg−1 at 1052 W kg−1, and the capacity retention reaches 93.3% at 10 A g−1 after 5000 cycles. Evaluated as a sodium ion battery self-supporting anode, the initial discharge specific capacity is up to 703 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, and retains 403 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. More importantly, it still achieves 211 mA h g−1 at 1.0 A g−1. The overall outstanding electrochemical performances can be explained in that the Co-Ni-Se nanosheets expose more active sites, and the ordered hole arrays ensure sufficient wetting between the electrolyte and electrode materials. Additionally, this unique structure enables more efficient ion/electron transfer and diffusion between the BWCF and Ni-Co-Se, effectively accelerating the electrochemical reaction kinetics.
