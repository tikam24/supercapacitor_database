Hybrid capacitors have been developed to bridge the gap between batteries and ultracapacitors. These devices combine a capacitive electrode and a battery-like material to achieve high energy-density high power-density devices with good cycling stability. In the quest of improved electrochemical responses, several hybrid devices have been proposed. However, they are usually limited to bench-scale prototypes that would likely face severe challenges during a scaling up process. The present case study reports the production of a hybrid prototype consisting of commercial activated carbon and nickel-cobalt hydroxide, obtained by chemical co-precipitation, separated by means of polyolefin-based paper. Developed to power a 12 W LED light, these materials were assembled and characterized in a coin-cell configuration and stacked to increase device voltage. All the processes have been adapted and constrained to scalable conditions to ensure reliable production of a pre-commercial device. Important challenges and limitations of this process, from geometrical constraints to increased resistance, are reported alongside their impact and optimization on the final performance, stability, and metrics of the assembled prototype.
