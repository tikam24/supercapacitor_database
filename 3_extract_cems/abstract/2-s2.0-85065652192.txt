Filter cake (or Blotong) is a dirt sugarcane sediment (DSS) obtained from refining sugarcane. Organic Supercapacitors is a new technology combined battery and capacitor for advanced energy storage. The elements and compound containing in the DSS have potential be used as an electrode for supercapacitor. Firstly we prepared three different samples, i.e., heating at 100 °C for an hour, and addition method with H2SO4, and carbonation method at high temperatures. To control the specific capacitance, BaTiO3 nanoparticles fraction was added. It has been successfully fabricated with a structure of DSS/BaTiO3/aluminum films. This supercapacitor produces an average grain size of 31.81 ± 0.29 nm and porosity of 0.63. The capacitance and specific capacitance respectively reaches to 2.44 × 106 pF and 1100 × 106 pF/g.
