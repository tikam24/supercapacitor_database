Coin-like nickel hydroxide nanoplates are synthesized via a simple coordination homogeneous precipitation method. The structure and morphology of as-prepared products are characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. It is demonstrated that the products are typical β-nickel hydroxide with bunches coin-like nanoplates morphology. The electrochemical properties of coin-like β-Ni(OH)2 are examined by cyclic voltammetric, chronopotentiometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscope. Cyclic voltammetric studies show that the electrodes have good reversibility. A specific capacitance of 1532 F g-1 is obtained at a charge/discharge current density of 0.2 A g-1. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
