Unique structural characteristics of graphene woven structures afford additional internal surface between the electrode material and the polymer gel electrolyte, which provides abundant active surface for the absorption and desorption of electrolyte ions, eventually improving the electrochemical performance of devices. Highly flexible and adaptable, all-solid-state supercapacitors based on graphene woven-fabric films are demonstrated. Â© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
