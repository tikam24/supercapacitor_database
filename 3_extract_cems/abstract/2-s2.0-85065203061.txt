Nitrogen and oxygen co-doped glucose-based porous carbon materials were successfully synthesized using ethylenediamine as nitrogen source through hydrothermal treatment and KOH activation. The activation has an obvious impact on the porosity and porous structure, which leads to remarkable increasement in the specific surface area from 99.63 to 1105.58 m2 g−1 and high nitrogen content of 1.727% and oxygen content of 8.000%. The specific capacitance of the nitrogen and oxygen co-doped glucose-based active electrode material at appropriate weight ratio (carbon material/KOH) of 1:1 was up to 324 F g−1 at a current density of 1.0 A g−1. Moreover, the specific capacitance remains 172 F g−1 and the specific capacitance retention is 101.2% after 5000 charge-discharge cycles at 10 A g−1, indicating its good rate capability and excellent electrochemical stability. These results indicate that nitrogen and oxygen co-doped glucose-based porous carbon material is a promising electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.
