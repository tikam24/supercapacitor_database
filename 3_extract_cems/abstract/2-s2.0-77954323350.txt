Carbon electrode materials for electric double-layer supercapacltors have been Investigated. A technology of atmospheric plasma torch In the mixture of C2H2+Ar gases was used for the deposition of 200-300 Î¼m thick coatings of activated carbon with a high effective surface area on the surface of stainless steel 1X18H9T substrates. The ratio of Ar/C 2H2 was verified in the range 15-55. The electrical characteristics of supercapacitors were correlated with the properties of carbon coatings registered by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and Raman scattering spectroscopy analysis techniques.
