Supercapacitors are new energy storage materials. Graphene/metal oxide composites are excellent supercapacitor electrode material. The pleated structure of graphene facilitates the rapid transport of ionic electrons promotes sufficient contact between the electrolyte and the electrode material, the metal oxide has a high theoretical specific capacitance and can undergo rapid reversible redox reaction. It not only improves the specific power and specific energy of the material, but also improves the cycle stability of the material. The research status of graphene/metal oxide composites in the field of supercapacitors is synthesized and the development trend of composite materials in the future is prospected.
