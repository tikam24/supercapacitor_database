In the present work, Lead Oxide (PbO) nanoparticles and the composite form of PbO with CdO and ZnO were prepared by the wet chemical method. The crystal structure, optical absorption and functional groups of the prepared materials were studied. The electrochemical studies indicate that PbO-ZnO nanocomposites possess the highest specific capacitance of 408F/g compared with that of PbO nanoparticles and the PbO-CdO nanocomposites. With promising structural, optical and electrochemical properties, these nanocomposites can be effectively used for as double layer capacitors for energy storage applications.
