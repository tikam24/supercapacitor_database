In ship electric propulsion and other energy storage applications, in order to ensure continuous and smooth output of energy, we often use two kinds of energy storage device mixed. In this paper, we use batteries and super capacitor device as mixed energy storage system. This paper focuses on the super capacitor and battery energy storage control strategy, so that the super capacitor and battery terminal voltage tends to balance and stability in a relatively short period of time. At the same time, the change of the load condition will cause large fluctuation of the DC bus voltage of the ship electric propulsion system. the simulation results show that the design of energy storage system can improve the voltage stability of DC bus obviously.
