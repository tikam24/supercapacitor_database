Mn3O4/Ni foam composites were synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal method in an aqueous solution containing only Mn(NO3)2 and C6H12N4. It was found that Mn3O4 nanorods with lengths of 2 to 3 μm and diameters of 100 nm distributed on Ni foam homogeneously. Detailed reaction time-dependent morphological and component evolution was studied to understand the growth process of Mn3O4 nanorods. As cathode material for supercapacitors, Mn3O4 nanorods/composite exhibited superior supercapacitor performances with high specific capacitance (263 F · g-1 at 1A · g-1), which was more than 10 times higher than that of the Mn3O4/Ni plate. The enhanced supercapacitor performance was due to the porous architecture of the Ni foam which provides fast ion and electron transfer, large reaction surface area, and good conductivity. © 2013 Li et al.; licensee Springer.
