We report the direct synthesis of 3D sponge-like nanoporous carbons via carbonization of tartrate salt, including potassium tartrate and sodium tartrate, in inert atmosphere without any activation. The carbonization temperature is a very important parameter that ensures formation of the desired carbon structures and enhances their electrochemical performance in supercapacitors. Given that alkali metal is present in the selected carbon precursor, higherature activation causes reaming of carbon-K-800-1 to achieve a high specific surface area of 1018 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, thereby rendering the material suitable for use as an electrode for supercapacitors. All of the aqueous measurements were performed in a three-electrode system with 6 M KOH as the electrolyte. Carbon-K-800-1 can deliver a high specific capacitance of 296 F g<sup>-1</sup> (29.1 μF cm<sup>-2</sup>) at a constant charge-discharge current of 0.7 A g<sup>-1</sup>; this capacitance may be maintained at 213 F g<sup>-1</sup> (20.9 μF cm<sup>-2</sup>) at 20 A g<sup>-1</sup>. A long cycle stability of 95.1% capacitance retention was observed after 5000 charge-discharge cycles at a current density of 3 A g<sup>-1</sup>.
