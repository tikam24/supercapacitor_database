Binary transition metal oxides have achieved tremendous attention owing to their intrinsic physicochemical properties. In this work, we construct a sensitive electrocatalyst manganese vanadate (MnV2O6) that was synthesized hydrothermally and used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst. Various analytical and microscopic techniques were used to confirm the crystalline structure, phase purity, morphology, chemical composition and surface area of the as-prepared MnV2O6. Additionally, voltammetric techniques were used to investigate the detection of Trichlorophenol (TCP) and supercapacitor applications through the modification of MnV2O6 over SPCE and NF electrodes. The DPV results of MnV2O6/SPCE show a wide linear response range (0.01–1340 μM), a low detection limit (9 nM), and superior sensitivity of (1.77 μA μM−1 cm−2) towards TCP. Moreover, MnV2O6/NF responds to an outstanding specific capacitance (1067 F g−1) and cyclic stability (87.6 %). Remarkably, the proposed electrocatalyst provides excellent sensing and supercapacitor performance which reveals that the MnV2O6 has the potential to be used in energy storage devices and clinical analysis.
