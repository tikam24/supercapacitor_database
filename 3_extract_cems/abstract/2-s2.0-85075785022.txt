In the current paper a model of bidirectional DC/DC multi quadrant converter is developed. The proposed model is composed by a separately excited DC motor, a buck-boost converter and a proportional-integral (PI) regulator. The solution is described with the aid of system of differentials equations and realized in the visual environment MATLAB/Simulink. Two operation modes are studied: acceleration mode and braking (regenerative) mode. From the presented and discussed results it is observed that the proposed solution is suitable for hybrid electric vehicles applications with multiple energy source such as battery and supercapacitor.
