Present work demonstrates enhanced supercapacitive performance of CoO-rGO electrode using redox electrolyte. The long range electrostatic force developed during deposition of CoO-rGO composite thin film orient the molecules into the hexagonal crystal structure. The incorporated CoO particles into rGO nano-sheets make the structure more porous for the intercalation of the electrolyte ions through the electrode material. Additionally, 0.025 M K3[Fe(CN)6] + 0.025 M K4[Fe(CN)6] redox couple into KOH electrolyte enhances the supercapacitive performance than bare KOH electrolyte. The maximum specific capacitance of 1005 F g−1 is observed due to the combined effect of K3[Fe(CN)6] and K4[Fe(CN)6] redox couple into KOH electrolyte. Also, energy density of 86.74 Wh kg−1 at power density of 3.54 kW kg−1 suggest potential application of CoO-rGO composite thin film in the development of high energy density supercapacitor based on redox active electrolyte.
