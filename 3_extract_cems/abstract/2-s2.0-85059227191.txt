Supercapacitors (SCs) are promising devices for meeting the future demand of sustainable energy conversion and storage. Here, cellulose nanofibers (CNFs), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), polyaniline (PANI) and carbon cloth (CC) were used to fabricate SCs electrodes. CNFs and CNTs were constructed into networks and served as the skeleton for depositing polyaniline nanowires (PANI-NWs). The vacuum filtration method contributed to the construction of a three-dimensional network structure for CNFs and CNTs. CC was used as a flexible current collector in the electrode. In-situ polymerization was performed to polymerize PANI on the surface of CNFs, CNTs and CC to form a three-dimensional porous film-current collector structure (CCPC electrodes). Electrochemical measurements showed that the CCPC electrode exhibited a low charge transfer resistance of 1.50 Î©, as well as excellent specific capacitance of 318 F g-1 at a scan rate of 10 mA s-1. In addition, it exhibited 72.09% retention of the initial value after 1000 cycles of testing. Overall, this work provides a strategy for the fabrication of a porous network film-soft current collector electrode for supercapacitors.
