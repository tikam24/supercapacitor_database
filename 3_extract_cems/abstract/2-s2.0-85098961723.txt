Two-dimensional molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets have attracted great attention for electrochemical storage and conversion, but the scalable preparation of highly conductive and stable MoS2 nanosheets with a porous structure is challenging. Here, an efficient and high-throughput fluid dynamics process is presented for high-yield exfoliation of MoS2 with a phase transformation of 2H into 1T phase and basal activation of MoS2, resulting in ultrathin nanoporous nanosheets of MoS2 with a high-content 1T phase. The metallic and tailored porous structure in holey MoS2 nanosheets ensures a large ion-accessible area and rapid and efficient charge transport properties. The resulting MoS2 electrodes show an outstanding gravimetric capacitance of 572.6 F g-1 at 2 mV s-1, an impressive high capacitance retention of 71% measured in the 2-1000 mV s-1 range, and a good long-term stability with a capacitance retention of 96% over 10,000 cycles.
