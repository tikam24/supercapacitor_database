Preparation of porous carbon from biomass materials shows great potential in the field of supercapacitor. Porous carbon obtained by KOH activation (up to 2000 m2 g−1) shows excellent gravimetric capacitance up to 300 F g−1. Nevertheless, the volumetric performances of these porous carbons are rather poor (60–130 Fcm−3) owing to the high porosity and low density. Herein, we develop a facile method to prepare nitrogen and sulfur co-doped hierarchical porous carbon (NSPC) derived from foxtail grass seeds using NaHCO3/KHCO3 as activation agent. Benefiting from the suitable specific surface area (819 m2 g−1), interconnected porous structure and rich heteroatoms, the as-prepared NSPC-600 displays high gravimetric capacitance (358.0 F g−1) and volumetric capacitance (243.4 F cm−1) at 0.5 A g−1 and impressive cycling durability. Besides, the as-fabricated symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) displays an energy density of 18.2 Wh L−1, which is higher than the reported porous carbon-based SSCs. These excellent characteristics provide a facile, eco-friendly strategy to prepare porous carbon with high gravimetric and volumetric capacitances for supercapacitors.
