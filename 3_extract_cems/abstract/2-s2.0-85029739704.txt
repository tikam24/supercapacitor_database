Supercapacitor (SC) current collectors with electrodes made of graphite oxide reduced during microwave exfoliation are produced from a commercial filament with a graphene component via layer-by-layer fusing with a 3D printer. The separator is made of a graphene oxide film. The current collectors are investigated by means of IR spectroscopy. Electrochemical tests are performed for the assembled SC that include tests of its cyclic stability up to 1000 cycles.
