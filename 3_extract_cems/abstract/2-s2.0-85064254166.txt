Rational design and synthesis of electrode materials containing uniformly stacked lamella structures with high surface areas are attractive for efficient storage of electrochemical energy. In this work, Co 9 S 8 clusters with a uniformly stacked lamella structure was directly anchored onto carbon cloth (CC) by an easy-to-implement chemical solution processing method, which involves the homogeneous growth of the CoCO 3 precursor, promoting the formation of nanosheets during the subsequent sulfurization process. Due to the conductive substrate (CC) and special multi-layer micro/nanostructure (Co 9 S 8 ), the flexible Co 9 S 8 /CC electrode, which can be tailored, bent and twisted arbitrarily without affecting its electrochemical properties, also exhibits excellent electrochemical properties with a high specific capacitance (1475.4 F g -1 at 1 A g -1 ), a good rate capacity (80.2% retention at 20 A g -1 ) and excellent cycling stability (92.9% retention over 5000 cycles). In addition, the assembled solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor device containing the fabricated Co 9 S 8 as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode, also exhibits a high energy density of 20.3 W h kg -1 at a power density of 22796.1 W kg -1 and a high energy density of 33.2 W h kg -1 at a power density of 817.9 W kg -1 . Because of its good electrochemical properties and flexibility, the flexible Co 9 S 8 /CC electrode material is very promising to be used in flexible supercapacitors and wearable electronic technology.
