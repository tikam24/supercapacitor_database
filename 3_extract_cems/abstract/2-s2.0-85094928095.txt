We investigated the electrochemical performance of single-walled carbon nanohorns (SWCNHs) for use as supercapacitor electrodes. For the first time, we used acid-treatment for oxidation of SWCNHs and hole creation in their structure. A detailed study was performed on the correlation between the oxidation of SWCNHs via acid treatment and variable acid treatment times, the structural properties of the oxidized carbon nanostructures, and the specific capacitance of the SWCNH electrodes. We showed that simple functionalization of carbon nanostructures under controlled conditions leads to an almost 3-fold increase in their specific capacitance (from 65 to 180 F g-1 in 0.1 MH2SO4). This phenomenon indicates higher accessibility of the surface area ofthe electrodes by electrolyte ions as a result of gradual opening of the SWCNH internal channels.
