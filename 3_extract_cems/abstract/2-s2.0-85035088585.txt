A novel optimal power and energy management (OPEM) for centralized hybrid energy storage systems (HESS) in microgrids is presented in this paper. The proposed OPEM aims at providing multiple grid services by suitably exploiting the different power/energy features of electrochemical batteries (B) and supercapacitors (S). The first part of the paper focuses on the design and analysis of the proposed OPEM, by highlighting the advantages of employing hand-designed solutions based on Pontryagin's minimum principle rather than resorting to pre-defined optimization tools. Particularly, the B power profile is synthesized optimally over a given time horizon in order to provide both peak shaving and reduced grid energy buffering, while S is employed in order to compensate for short-term forecasting errors and to prevent B from handling sudden and high-frequency power fluctuations. Both the B and S power profiles are computed in real-time in order to benefit from more accurate forecasting, as well as to support each other. Then, the effectiveness of the proposed OPEM is tested through numerical simulations, which have been carried out based on real data from the German island of Borkum. Particularly, an extensive and detailed performance analysis is performed by comparing OPEM with a frequency-based management strategy (FBM) in order to highlight the superior performance achievable by the proposed OPEM in terms of both power and energy management and HESS exploitation.
