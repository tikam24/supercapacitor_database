This paper constitutes a solid connection between theory and practice for electrical quantities for the design of supercapacitor buffering in regulated DC-bus systems. Transparently validated theory is proposed to be used for decision making that bases on estimates of sensitivity indices, expanded uncertainty intervals, and the Monte-Carlo method. This approach can be used for engineering of various DC-power distribution systems that are increasingly applied in hybrid powertrains of electric vehicles and DC microgrids. Results conclude a clear connection between theory and practice, and a well established approach with examples of its usage can be easily adopted.
