Energy storage is usually equipped in Microgrid (MG) to provide the unbalanced power and to improve system reliability. This paper establishes the small-signal model of the supercapacitor energy storage (SES) and presents the control strategies in a typical MG including synchronous generator and asynchronous wind turbine. Simulation proves that the proposed control strategies can improve both the MG dynamic and transient voltage stability effectively in the condition of wind disturbance, load change and line fault.
