NiO spheres were obtained by hydrothermal process. The structure and morphology were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Electrochemical properties of NiO electrode were preformed by cyclic voltammogram and galvanostatic discharge measurements with the potential range from -0.1 to 0.5 V (vs. SCE) in 6mol/L KOH electrolyte. The results demonstrated that the NiO microspheres obtained at 300Â°C had a good stability and cyclic performance. Its specific capacitance as single electrode was up to 830 F/g.
