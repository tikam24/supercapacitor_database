Herein, we report the formation of novel metal oxide nanostructures of copper and iron on Philippine natural zeolite (PNZ) matrix and their application as an electrode for supercapacitors for the first time. Flake-like and aggregated protruding nanoarchitectures were generated after calcination process of Cu- and Fe-exchanged PNZ samples, respectively. The successful inclusion of Cu and Fe were verified through comprehensive characterizations such as SEM-EDX, XRF, XRD, FTIR and XPS analyses. XRD and XPS analyses confirmed the presence of metal oxides species on the PNZ matrix. Electrochemical characterizations revealed the pseudocapacitance behaviour of both samples. These results highlight the potential of metal oxide/PNZ composites as novel electrodes for energy storage devices.
