Nickel foam-supported CuO@NiCo2O4 nanoforests with a mesoporous hierarchical core/shell structure are prepared by combining a facile, scalable, and cost-effective thermal oxidation method with a simple hydrothermal method followed by a calcination procedure. The smart hybridization of CuO nanowires and NiCo2O4 nanosheets into a hierarchical core/shell array configuration results in remarkably enhanced electrochemical performances with high specific capacitance, excellent rate capability and good cycle performance compared with pure nickel foam-supported NiCo2O4 nanosheets. A high specific capacitance of 1298.8 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 has been exhibited and excellent rate capability of about 96.3% capacitance retention at 5 A g-1 can be obtained. The CuO@NiCo2O4-based supercapacitor exhibits a very long cycle life with only 2.1% capacitance loss after 2000 cycles and the coulombic efficiency remains about 100% during the cycling. In addition, the assembled CuO@NiCo2O4//AC ASC device delivers an energy density of 27.9 W h kg-1 at a power density of 749.6 W kg-1, and the energy density is as much as 17.7 W h kg-1 even at a high power density of 7496.5 W kg-1. These excellent electrochemical performances demonstrate that the nickel foam-supported hierarchical core/shell CuO@NiCo2O4 nanowire heterostructure array electrodes are highly desirable for application as advanced supercapacitor electrodes.
