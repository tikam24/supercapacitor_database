This paper presents a new energy and power management control strategy for battery electric vehicle (BEV) with supercapacitors (SCs) based on speed command and acceleration estimation. The purpose of the control strategy is to increase the capability of regenerative braking energy capturing and to improve DC bus voltage regulation. The control strategy uses cascade voltage and current control of SCs. The voltage and current references are calculated based on the speed command and acceleration including the power losses of the system. The whole electrical drive system is mathematically modelled and the core features of the control strategy are presented. Numerical simulation demonstrates the benefits of the proposed control strategy in term of energy saving and DC bus voltage regulation improvement compared to the BEV without SCs.
