Polyaniline/Ferric oxide (PANI/α-Fe2O3) nanocomposites were synthesized via a simple precipitation of FeCl3 using NH4OH as the precipitating agent, followed by in situ polymerization of aniline. PXRD pattern of as-synthesized nanocomposites showed characteristic peaks of α-Fe2O3 in the PANI matrix. Structural and morphological characterization confirmed the encapsulation of α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles in PANI matrix to form PANI/α-Fe2O3 nanostructures. PANI/α-Fe2O3 as an electrode material for supercapacitor exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 974 Fg−1 at a scan rate of 2 mVs−1 using CV and Csp of 857 Fg−1 at a current density of 0.2 Ag−1 using CP. Further, the material also exhibited a high energy density of 118 Wh kg−1 with a maximum power density of 9.8 kW kg−1 and an excellent cyclic stability with capacitance retention of about 94% after 2000 cycles. These superior electrochemical results over bare PANI and α-Fe2O3 shows the PANI/α-Fe2O3 nanocomposites to be promising electrode material for high performance energy storage systems.
