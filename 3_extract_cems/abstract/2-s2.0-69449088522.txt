A novel activated mesocarbon microbead(aMCMB)/Mn3O4 composite is successfully prepared for electrochemical capacitors. The morphology and crystal structure of the composite are investigated by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The electrochemical studies indicate that the aMCMB/Mn3O4 composite has ideal capacitive performance in 1.0 mol L-1 LiPF6(EC + DMC). A maximum specific capacitance of 178 F g-1 is obtained for the composite via galvanostatic charge-discharge at a current density of 330 mA g-1, and the specific capacitance of Mn3O4 is estimated to be as high as 445 F g-1. The aMCMB/Mn3O4 composite material exhibits ideal capacitive behavior indicating a promising electrode material for electrochemical supercapacitors. Â© 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
