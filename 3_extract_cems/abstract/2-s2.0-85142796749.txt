The effects of the precursor solution concentration on the physical and electrochemical characteristics of NiFe2O4 films were studied. XRD patterns confirmed the formation of a spinel cubic crystal structure. FE-SEM images showed a mesoporous morphology. EDAX analysis confirmed a nearly stoichiometric deposition. Optical absorption studies confirmed the direct bandgap energies in the range 2.00–2.27 eV. The films deposited with a 0.25 M solution concentration had the minimum room-temperature electrical resistivity (3.39 × 103 Ωcm). Films deposited with a 0.15 M solution had the maximum specific capacitance values, 591 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 (CV) and 632 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 (GCD). NiFe2O4 films exhibited specific energy and specific power values of 15.22 W h kg−1 and 225 W kg−1, respectively, at a current density of 1 A g−1. Further, these films retained 92.97% of their specific capacitance after 1000 continuous cycles. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
