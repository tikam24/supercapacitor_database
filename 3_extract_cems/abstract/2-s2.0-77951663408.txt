Ordered microporous carbon molecular sieves with high specific area and well-dispersed Pt nanoparticles have been prepared by chemical vapour deposition method. Electrochemical properties were measured, showing the nitrogen-doped carbons exhibited excellent performance as an electrochemical supercapacitor. Â©2010 IEEE.
