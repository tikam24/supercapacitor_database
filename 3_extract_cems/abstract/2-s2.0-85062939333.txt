Li-ion capacitors (LICs) have demonstrated great potential for bridging the gap between lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors in electrochemical energy storage area. The main challenge for current LICs (contain a battery-type anode as well as a capacitor-type cathode) lies in circumventing the mismatched electrode kinetics and cycle degradation. Herein, a mesh-like nitrogen (N)-doped carbon nanosheets with multiscale pore structure is adopted as both cathode and anode for a dual-carbon type of symmetric LICs to alleviate the above mentioned problems via a facile and green synthesis approach. With rational design, this dual-carbon LICs exhibits a broad high working voltage window (0–4.5 V), an ultrahigh energy density of 218.4 Whkg –1 electrodes (229.8 WhL –1 electrodes ), the highest power density of 22.5kWkg –1 electrodes (23.7 kWL –1 electrodes ) even under an ultrahigh energy density of 22.5kWkg –1 electrodes (23.7 kWL –1 electrodes ), as well as reasonably good cycling stability with capacity retention of 84.5% (only 0.0016% capacity loss per cycle) within 10 000 cycles under a high current density of 5 A g −1 . This study provides an efficient method and option for the development of high performance LIC devices.
