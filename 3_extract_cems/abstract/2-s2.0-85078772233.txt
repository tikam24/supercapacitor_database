Standardized driving cycles are used by research departments of automotive companies in order to assess performance of thermal vehicles in term of fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. In a Li-ion battery/Supercapacitors Hybrid Electric Vehicle, driving cycles are used for sizing the energy sources. They are then determinant in the number of cells of the battery and the supercapacitor and therefore in the weight, volume and cost of the overall energy storage system. For a same management strategy based on supercapacitor energy supervision, a comparison has been made between multiple standardized driving cycles (NEDC, ARTEMIS, FTP-75 and WLTP), in terms of size, performance and cost of the hybrid source.
