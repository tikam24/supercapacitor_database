The limited number of edge nitrogen atoms and low intrinsic electrical conductivity hinder the supercapacitive energy storage applications of the nitrogen-rich graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4). In this study, a novel graphitic carbon nitride/NiCo-layered double hydroxide (CNLDH), a two-dimensional nanohybrid, is prepared by a simple hydrothermal synthesis. The homogeneous interpolation of g-C3N4 nanosheets into NiCo LDH stacked nanosheets effectively increases the overall performances of the g-C3N4/NiCo LDH nanohybrid. The improved morphology of the nanohybrid electrode upon the addition of g-C3N4 to the NiCo LDH yields a specific capacity of 183.43 mA h g-1 in 6 M KOH at 1 A g-1, higher than those of bare g-C3N4 (20.89 mA h g-1) and NiCo LDH (95.92 mA h g-1) electrodes. The excellent supercapacitive performance of the CNLDH nanohybrid is complemented by its low internal resistance, excellent rate capability, and large cycling lifetime. Furthermore, the hybrid supercapacitor is assembled using CNLDH 0.1 as a positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as a negative electrode. The hybrid supercapacitor device of CNLDH 0.1//AC shows the maximum specific capacity of 37.44 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 with remarkable energy density, power density and good cycling performance. This confirms that the CNLDH 0.1 nanohybrid is an excellent electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
