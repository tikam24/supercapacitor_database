We present high quality WX2 (X = S, Se) single crystals synthesized via an improved chemical vapor transport technique. Morphological and structural characteristics of the as-grown layered single crystals were analyzed using SEM, TEM, XPS, Raman spectroscopy, XRD and UV visible spectroscopy characterization techniques. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and charge-discharge analysis reveal the insights for WX2 single crystals to be used an as excellent material for electrochemical supercapacitors. Notably the obtained supercapacitor electrodes show excellent cycle stability and high capacitance retention of 80 and 99% for WS2 and WSe2 respectively after 20,000 cycles, suggesting their high potential in electrochemical energy storage applications.
