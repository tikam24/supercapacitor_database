This paper reports the fabrication method and characteristics of a three dimensional micro interdigital structured supercapacitor. The proposed capacitor was fabricated by using two porous Cu/Ni electrodes with ultra-high surface area. The porous electrodes were formed by using a negative photoresist KMPR for high aspect ratio structure and electroplating technique. The electrochemical performances of the fabricated supercapacitor were examined in 1M KOH solution by using the cyclic voltammetric (CV), chronopotentiometric (CP), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) techniques. It demonstrated the pseudocapacitive and stable charge/discharge behavior. A high specific capacitance of 201 mF/cm2, a power density of 5.06 mW/cm2, and low series resistance of 2.5 were obtained.
