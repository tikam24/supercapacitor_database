The surface activation of alloys favors their electrochemical interactions, ion diffusivity, and the rapid kinetics of ions and electrons, leading to the formation of self-supported layered double hydroxides (LDHs) in them. However, the formation of LDHs at different depths in the alloy upon activation, their electronic/atomic structures, and their electrochemical charge storage mechanism, have not been thoroughly explored. Herein, Ni ion-substituted CoAl alloys are prepared by arc melting and activated by KOH electrolyte, which is responsible for the modulation of the atomic configuration as confirmed by XRD. Raman depth mapping demonstrates how the LDHs vary with depth upon activation and that the octahedral and tetrahedral symmetry sites of CoO and Co3O4 are responsible for the formation of the layered structures of CoOOH and Co(OH)2, respectively. The activated Ni10Co85Al5 has a superior volumetric capacitance of 4.15 F/cm3 at 0.5 mA/g, which is 38.6 times that of an unactivated one, and excellent cyclic stability up to 5000 cycles, and a voltage of 0.54 V generated from a fabricated supercapacitor cell. X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) analysis indicates greater charge transfer by Co than by Ni and the modulation of the local atomic structures facilitates electrochemical charge storage in Ni10Co85Al5. This work presents an easy route for the development of advanced LDHs, and the mechanism of electrochemical charge storage in them.
