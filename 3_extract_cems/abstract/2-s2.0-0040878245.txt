A laminated solid-state redox supercapacitor based on an electronically conducting p-doped poly(pyrrole) as the electrode material and an ionically conducting membrane as the electrolyte material is described. The preliminary results reported here suggest that the performance of this new type of electric storage device is enhanced by maintaining a residual charge in the electrodes during the full charge-discharge cycle and by selecting electrodes doped with large anions.
