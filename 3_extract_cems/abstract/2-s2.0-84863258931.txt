A series of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) based on 1,3,5- benzenetricarboxylic (BTC) acid and M(II) acetate hydrate (M=Co, Ni, and Zn) were successfully synthesized and named as M3(BTC) 2•12H2O. These compounds were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. Electrochemical properties of the materials were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 6 M KOH aqueous solutions. The maximum specific capacitance of Ni3(BTC)2•12H2O is found to be 429 F g-1 at 5 mV s-1 and 154 F g-1 at 200 mV s-1 scan rate. © J. New Mat. Electrochem. Systems.
