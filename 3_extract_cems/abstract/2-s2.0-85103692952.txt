Although the resource utilization of organic solid waste from biomass (OSWB) has been investigated, it is difficult to completely utilize such resources using the existing methods. Therefore, the development of a comprehensive application method would be very significant. Here, a simple process using chemical oxidation of H2O2 was initially developed to prepare potassium humate (HA-K) from cotton stalk peels. Subsequently, we obtained three-dimensional hierarchical porous carbon (3D-HPC) materials by carbonizing and activating the residue after HA-K extraction. Chemical oxidation achieved the effect of “killing two birds with one stone” because it increased the HA-K yield by 40% and the capacitance of the electrode based on 3D-HPC (3OCA-500-650). Compared with the electrode without chemical oxidation, the obtained 3OCA-500-650 exhibited higher specific capacitance (420 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1), enhanced an energy density (58 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 1300 W kg−1). This work provides a green, facile technology to achieve full utilization of OSWB, which is expected to be effective and scalable for preparing HA-K and electrochemical energy storage materials exhibiting excellent performance.
