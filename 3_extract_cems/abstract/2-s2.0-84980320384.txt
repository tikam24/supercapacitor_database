The proceedings contain 26 papers. The special focus in this conference is on Materials Processing Technologies, Ceramics, Glasses, Technologies for Electronic and Technologies for Environmental Engineering. The topics include: Wettability of TiAl alloy on calcia-stabilized zirconia; microstructures and mechanical properties of Ti-Nb alloy at different composition of NB produced via powder metallurgy route; microstructural and mechanical characterization of artificially-aged power plant steel; failure analysis of an additive manufactured porous titanium structure for orthopedic implant applications; friction and wear of commercially pure titanium with different microstructure from the view point of thermodynamic analysis; down milling cutting parameters optimization utilizing the two level full factorial design approach; elastic properties of thulium doped zinc borotellurite glass; nanostructured ceramic-polymer coatings for face seals; green and facile synthesis of molybdenum oxide-graphene composite electrodes for supercapacitor application; inhibition of silver electrolytic migration in Ag-alloy bonding wires; electroplating of ZnO influenced by the concentration of aluminum nitrate in the bath; study on the shrinkable behavior of PETG/pet blending shrink film; adsorption of humic acid from aqueous solution onto PVDF nanofiber; effect of various amounts of hydrazine and graphene oxide on the photocatalytic performances of the ZNSE/graphene nanocomposites; effective extraction of vanadium and chromium from high chromium content vanadium slag by sodium roasting and water leaching; formation and transport mechanism of hydrogen sulfide in coal seam and integration of different sintering temperature of hydroxyapatite and polyethersulfone membrane for fouling mitigation.
