With the purpose to turn wastes into wealth and develop renewable energy, much effort has been focused on converting biowastes into porous carbons and exploring their application for supercapacitors. In this study, inspired by natural porous structure of biomass and small size of Sn nanoparticles, a one-step strategy was developed to convert waste wolfberry fruits into porous carbons by SnCl2. The as-fabricated carbon exhibited large specific surface area of 1423 m2 g−1 and hierarchical porosity with total pore volume of 1.36 cm3 g−1. Meanwhile, the newly produced SnCl2 with more than 95% recovery rate was reused as catalyst. Moreover, the porous carbon was applied for supercapacitive electrode. In three-electrode 6 M KOH system, it displayed outstanding capacitance of 365 F/g at 0.2 A g−1, good rate capability of 75% capacitance retention at 20 A g−1 and excellent cycling stability of 96.4% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles. In two-electrode 1 M Li2SO4 system, its energy density reached 23.2 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 225 W kg−1. The current work provided a facile and low-cost method to recycle renewable biowastes into high-valued carbon material, and further expanded its application for high-performance energy storage devices.
