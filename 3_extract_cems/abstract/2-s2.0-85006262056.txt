This paper deals with the modeling of electric vehicles using hybrid power source: fuel cell/supercapacitor. The fuel cell is connected to the direct current (DC) Bus via a boost converter and satisfies the load average power requirements. The supercapacitor is linked to the DC-Bus through a buck-boost converter and ensures the transient power requirements. A permanent-magnet synchronous motor is used as traction motor and connected to the DC-Bus through a 3-phase inverter. We propose an energy management technique, based on the urban driving cycle (ECE-15 driving cycle) and the extraurban driving cycle, with the use of conventional proportional-integral (PI) controllers. The main goals are as follows: first, to avoid fast operation of the fuel cell current so as to ensure optimal operation of the fuel cell system, and second, the supercapacitor allows a satisfactory dynamic of the DC-Bus so as to provide the required energy for the car transients so as to meet both urban and extraurban driving cycles. The performances of the proposed strategy are evaluated through some simulations dedicated to electric vehicle applications.
