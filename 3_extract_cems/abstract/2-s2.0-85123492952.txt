Highly conductive and stable solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) will make a dramatic impact on electrochemical applications. This paper reports the electron beam (EB) induced modifications of structural, electrical and electrochemical properties of poly (ethylene oxide)-based SPEs. FT-IR and SEM characterizations confirm the structural rearrangements and crystallinity reduction in irradiated films due to degradation effects. The electrical and dielectric studies imply that dielectric permittivity (ε), and conductivity values increased after irradiation. The intensity of the well-defined relaxation peaks (tanδ) increased and also, the peak position is shifted toward the higher frequency with dose is attributed to increase in mobile charge carriers density or dipolar molecules formed in the irradiated films. The amorphocity of the films increases with radiation dose due to scissoring and cross-linking of polymer chains. At room temperature, the ionic conductivity of the non-irradiated sample is ~ 1.55310−5 Scm−1 and increases with dose, reaching a maximum value of ~ 3.4 × 10−4 Scm−1 for 100 kGy. The Cyclic Voltammetry study confirms that the modified polymer electrolyte film shows the ideal capacitive behavior and specific capacitance values significantly improved after EB irradiation due to a high-surface-area and increase in the charge carrier concentration. Hence, these modified polymer electrolyte films are a promising material for battery, supercapacitor, and fuel cell applications.
