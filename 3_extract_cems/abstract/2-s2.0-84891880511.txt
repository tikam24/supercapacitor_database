A nitrogen-rich carbon nanotubes/amorphous carbon (CNT/C) composite was prepared by carbonising a CNT/polyaniline (PANI) composite, and characterised. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed that the composite retained a mesoporous CNT structure as its backbone, whilst the nitrogen-rich PANI-derived carbon formed a thin amorphous coating on the CNT surface. Electrochemical characterisation of the CNT/C composite indicated that it had nearly double the reversible Li+ intercalation capacity (390 vs. 219 mAh g-1) and 39 % less irreversible capacity (622 vs. 1,015 mAh g-1) than the pristine CNT. The CNT/C composite showed exceptionally high rate capability with a de-intercalation capacity of 81 mAh g-1 at a very high charge/discharge rate of 60 C (time taken for charge or discharge is 1 min) (1 C = 1 h charge or discharge), whereas the pristine CNT delivered 53 mAh g-1 at this C-rate. By comparison, the rate capabilities of conventional graphite (N3 and SLP30) were very poor above 5 C (~17 mAh g-1 at 5 C). Both the pristine CNT and CNT/C composite showed an excellent cyclability at 1 C charge/discharge over 600 cycles. The CNT/C composite maintained a fairly stable capacity of ~200 mAh g-1 after 600 cycles, whilst the commercial graphite showed a steady and significant decrease in de-intercalation capacity; reaching <70 mAh g-1 after 600 cycles.
