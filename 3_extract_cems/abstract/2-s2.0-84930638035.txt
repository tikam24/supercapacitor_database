Three-dimensional (3D) flower-like Co(OH)microspheres based on nanoflakes/nanorods are successfully assembled on nickel foam by a one-step hydrothermal method. The as-obtained Co(OH)Ni foam composites exhibit multidirectional structures with tertiary nanorods (0.5-1.2 μm in length, 25-40 nm in diameter) growing on the secondary nanoflakes (10 μm in diameter) and forming a highly dense film on the Ni foam. The composites display superior supercapacitor performance with high specific capacitance (1350 F g<sup>-1</sup> and 10.4 F cm<sup>-2</sup> at 30 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) and excellent rate capability, suggesting its promising application as an efficient electrode for electrochemical capacitors.
