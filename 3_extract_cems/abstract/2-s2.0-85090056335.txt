In this paper, a new control strategy for a fuel cell supercapacitor tramway is tested on a real drive cycle. The control algorithm is based on the equivalent consumption minimization strategy, weighted for the vehicle passenger number. Its implementation is presented by highlighting the customization for a specific drive cycle, located in Reggio Calabria, one of the main cities of southern Italy. The heart of the paper concerns the fuel cell hybrid powertrain, where energy source and DC/DC converter models are formalized and numerically designed; in addition, all the drivetrain components are taken into account through appropriate relations. By means of the drive cycle characteristics, in terms of morphology, vehicle features, and speed, the main components are properly selected, with the aim of avoiding under- and over-sizing issues. A specific case study is analyzed, considering the passenger variation at each tramway stop. Satisfying results are achieved in the simulation campaign: 2.9 kg of hydrogen is consumed for a round trip, with a quasi-constant fuel cell efficiency of more than 50%, while the supercapacitor SOC ranges in a wide interval, between 35% and 95%.
