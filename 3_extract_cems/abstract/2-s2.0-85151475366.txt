Abstract: Herein, the electrochemical properties of ternary composite (GO/PPy/ZnO) was investigated and reported as electrode material for supercapacitor. By embedding zinc oxide (ZnO) on graphene oxide (GO)/polypyrrole (PPy) composite the electrochemical performance of binary composite was improved. The elemental, structural and morphological nature of the ternary composite is evaluated by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopic (FTIR) analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis. Similarly, electrochemical properties are obtained from cyclic voltammetric (CV) analysis, galvanostatic charge and discharge (GCD) method and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) analysis. When compared to carbon content of GO alone, rich carbon content is observed in both the binary composite and ternary composite. Higher power density is observed for both the binary composite (9554.1 W kg–1) and ternary composite (5901.4 W kg–1 at the energy density of 16.16 W h kg–1). Extremely lower equivalent series resistance is observed for the ternary composite. Finally, the ternary composite had optimized electrochemical performance than binary composite and GO alone. This material is suited for high power density supercapacitor applications.
