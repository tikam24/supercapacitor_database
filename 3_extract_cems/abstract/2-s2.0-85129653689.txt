The advance of carbon derivatives enhanced the performance of recently fabricated electrodes for energy storage devices. GO/Co3O4/NiO conductive single and composite electrodes were fabricated using hydrothermal technique and employed as electrodes for supercapacitor using three-electrode systems. The GO/Co3O4/NiO composite electrode demonstrates greater rate capability and excellent lasting stability. It also exhibits high energy density at comparatively high power density. The results presented a specific capacitance of the GO/Co3O4/NiO composite electrode of 1612 F/g at 1.0 A/g current density. GO/Co3O4/NiO composite electrode exhibited cycling stability of 88.6%. after 10, 000 cycles. Results indicate that the composites' electrode achieves improved specific capacitance than solitary metal oxide electrode and the addition of graphene oxide enhanced the performance. The results of the three samples were compared, the performance of the GO/Co3O4/NiO electrode enriched better than GO/Co3O4 and GO/NiO, which can be attributed to the synergistic effect of Co3O4, NiO, and GO.
