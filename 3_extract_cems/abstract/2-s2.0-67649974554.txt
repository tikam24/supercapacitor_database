Electrochemical properties of carbon cryogel electrode for the application of composite electrode materials mixed with metal oxide in supercapacitor have been studied. Carbon cryogels were synthesized by sol-gel polycondensation of resorcinol with formaldehyde, followed by a freeze drying, and then pyrolysis in an inert atmosphere. Physical properties of carbon cryogel were characterized by BET, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It is found that carbon cryogel is amorphous material. The electrochemical properties of carbon cryogel were measured by cyclic voltammetry as a function of concentration of liquid electrolyte, galvanostatic charge-discharge with different scan rates and electrochemical impedance measurements. The result of cyclic voltammetry indicated that the specific capacitance value of a carbon cryogel electrode was approximately 150.2 F/g (at 5 mV/s in 6 M KOH electrolyte).
