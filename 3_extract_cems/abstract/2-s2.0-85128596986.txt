The advancement of materials and technology has changed our lives and living standards and demand for the future. Smart, portable, thin, and flexible electronic devices such as roll-up displays, touch screens, smart electronics, and wearable sensors have been indispensable components of our modern daily lives, and energy storage has become a burning issue. Supercapacitors are appealing as energy storage devices to simplify this expanding electrical need. In comparison to Li-ion batteries, supercapacitors have a superior power density, a faster charge-discharge cycle, and a higher energy storage capacity. To fabricate flexible supercapacitors conducting polymers based on conjugated polymers are one of the most promising candidates compared to other materials in terms of their flexibility, high redox-active specific capacitance, and essential elastic nature. In this chapter, we discussed conducting polymer-based supercapacitors of different kinds and compared and contrasted various features, and addressed the needs for future research to realize high-performance supercapacitor electrodes.
