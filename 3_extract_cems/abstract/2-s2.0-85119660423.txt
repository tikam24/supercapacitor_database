This manuscript presents an optimal control system for energy management of the hybrid energy storage system (HESS) as battery and super capacitor (SC) on electric vehicles (EVs). The proposed system is parallel execution of levy flight with Tunicate swarm optimization. The proposed method is improved by levy flight distribution; hence, it is named Improved Tunicate swarm optimization (ITSA). Here, the HESS method calculates the super capacitor reference voltage in terms of load dynamics and improves the power. At first, compute the super capacitor reference voltage assuming real-time load dynamics. Furthermore, diminish the range of battery power magnitude and power loss concurrently. In the proposed system, the Improved Tunicate swarm optimization is merged for generating the probable HESS control signal data set. Furthermore, the proposed method gains the super capacitor voltage, amount of battery current, variation of battery current. Through the proposed method, the hybrid energy storage system parameters are enhanced, and the proposed system gives a reliable solution. The proposed method is performed on the MATLAB/Simulink work platform. The quality of a hybrid energy storage system is compared with that of other methods.
