Conducting polymers (CPs) are conductive materials composed of organic polymers. CPs have excellent properties such as easy synthesis and effortless fabrication, tunable electrical property, high environmental stability, high mechanical and optical properties. These unique properties have attracted researchers to discover a wide variety of uses, such as batteries, solar cells, sensors, supercapacitors, electrochromic devices, and biochemical applications. Although CPs have many limitations in their pristine form, hybridization with other materials overcomes these limitations. Here in this review article, we discuss different CPs based chemosensors for colorimetric and fluorimetric detection and determination of noble metal ions (Ag+, Pd2+, Pt2+/4+, and Au3+) in different environmental, agricultural, and biological samples. Further, the sensing performances of these chemosensors have been compared and discussed. We hope this article will help the readers with the future design of CPs based optical sensor (colorimetric and fluorescent) for detecting noble metal cations.
