Supercapacitors have received considerable attention owing to high power density, high safety and great cycling performance. Great efforts have been devoted to hunting new materials for supercapacitor applications. In this work, we report a novel nanomaterial of LaB6 nanowires (NWs) on carbon fiber cloth serving as active electrochemical materials for supercapacitors. The LaB6-carbon fiber cloth electrodes could work in two different electrolytes including 1 M Na2SO4 and 1M H2SO4. The as-prepared LaB6 NWs electrode delivered a significant areal capacitance as high as 17.34 mF cm−2 in 1.0 M Na2SO4 solution at a current density of 0.1 mA cm−2. Moreover, the LaB6 NWs electrode displayed outstanding cycling stability after 10,000 charging/discharging cycles. The electrochemical charge/discharge mechanism in 1M Na2SO4 was studied. This work lay the foundations for developing LaB6 NWs as supercapacitor electrode and open the door to the design of boride nanomaterials for energy storage applications.
