The integration of pseudocapacitive metal oxides with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) is considered an innovative chemical strategy to resolve both bottlenecks of pseudocapacitor and electrical double-layer capacitor for high performance supercapacitors. Herein, we report a facile synthesis method of highly porous three-dimensional (3D) CoO/RGO nanocomposite via ozone treatment, ice templating, and thermal annealing. The ozonized RGO surface provides a favorable interaction with cobalt precursor for a stable and uniform deposition of well-defined CoO nanoparticles. The morphology, structure, and chemistry of the resulting CoO/RGO nanocomposites are comprehensively characterized by spectroscopic methods. The CoO/RGO nanocomposites show fast and reversible pseudocapacitance due to a large accessible area, rapid ion transport, and low charge transfer resistance arising from 3D internetworked macroporosity. Thus, the nanocomposites achieve high specific capacitance up to 239.4 F g-1 (volumetric capacitance = 12.04 F cm-3), excellent rate capability of 79.1%, and ultralong cyclic stabilities (of 93.2% at 10 A g-1 even up to 10,000 cycles) in 6 M KOH electrolyte. This simple synthesis method offers a promising solution for the design of high performance hybrid energy storage materials consisting of high capacity metal oxides and conductive graphene networks.
