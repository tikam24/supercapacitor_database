Designing new energy storage system is necessary for renewable energy development. With the large surface area and appropriate pore structure for good electrolyte wetting and rapid ionic motion, electric double layer capacitors (EDLC), as an ultracapacitor, have the potential to meet this challenge. As the constructing materials for EDLC, the prepration of ordered mesoporous materials, including silica-based mesoporous materials, carbon nitride, ordered mesoporous carbons as well as metal oxides, are summarized. Further researches on pore size control and morphology control of mesoporous materials have also been reviewed. These mesoporous materials, with high surface area, narrow distribution of pore size, good corrosion resistance, high stability, and tunable pore structure and easy surface modification, are widely used as electrocatalyst support and electrode in EDLC. The large surface area and small pore diameter can improve the specific capacitance. The tunable pore structure and surface functionalization are beneficial for capacitance improvement.
