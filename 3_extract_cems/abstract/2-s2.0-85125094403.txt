Co-doped Mo1-xCoxS2(x=0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5) nanoparticles with varying amounts of Co were compounded by hydrothermal channel. The microstructures of the samples were characterized. All the samples showed hexagonal structure, good crystallization, flower shape microspheres and agglomeration to a certain extent. Furthermore, the influence of Co doping on the electrochemical properties was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), cycle stability and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). CV curves present quasi-triangular shapes with good symmetry, doped Mo1-xCoxS2 nanoparticles exhibit better specific capacitance and excellent cyclic stability than that of MoS2 samples. The capacity ratios of MCS-3 electrodes maintains 96 % of its premier capacitance after 3000 cycles. The remarkable electrochemical properties embodied in CV proof were proved via the GCD measurements. Nyquist spectra of doped Mo1-xCoxS2 electrodes reveal lower resistance and perfect conductivity. This work reveals that Co doping can further effectively the electrochemical properties of MoS2 nanomaterials.
