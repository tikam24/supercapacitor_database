Preparation of supercapacitor (SC) material of RuO2 · 0.93H2O at a large scale and its electrode is presented in this paper. This material is derived by a modified neutralization reaction and subsequently annealing process. The material exhibits a loosening and fluffy morphology in deep black color and has a specific area of 223m2/g and 0.93 mole chemical water pre mole of RuO2 · xH2O. The material is featured with good specific capacitance (988F/g at 1mV/s) and excellent electrochemical rate performances when high H+ conductivity of Nafion™ dispersion is used as its electrode binder and the carbon fiber paper plate as its current collector respectively. Additional EIS experiments also suggest the prepared electrode loading with the active material has lower ESR (~ 30 mΩ) and show an ideal capacitor behavior in OCP condition. The large-scale prepared material to be used for supercapacitor both in civilian and defensive fields may be expected.
