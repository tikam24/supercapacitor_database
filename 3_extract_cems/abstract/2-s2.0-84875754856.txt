Novel ordered mesoporous carbon/MoO2 nanocomposites were prepared using one-step tri-constituent co-assembly method. From various structural and physical analysis, ordered mesoporous structure with homogeneous dispersion of MoO2 in nanoscale was observed in as-prepared composites containing from 9 to 38 wt% MoO2, while gradual collapse of ordered structure appeared in higher MoO2 fraction. When the prepared materials were applied into supercapacitor electrodes, the composite electrode with 33 wt% MoO2 exhibited a high capacity from MoO2 itself (395 F g?1) and a very stable cycle performance of negligible capacity loss even after 500 cycles under strong acid electrolyte.
