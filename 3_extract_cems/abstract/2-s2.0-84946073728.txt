Few layer graphene (FLG)/Fe3O4 nanohybrid has been successfully synthesized by an one-step chemical strategy, consisting in the thermolysis of a suitable magnetite precursor in organic solvent in the presence of surfactants and FLG. This way provides experimental easiness and potential low-cost production. Raman spectroscopy, Transmission electron microscopy-Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (TEM-EDS), thermogravimetric analysis coupled with mass spectromery (TG-DTG-MS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were employed for characterization. The nanoparticles with a size of 5 nm, are monodispersed on FLG. The FLGFe3O4 hybrid supercapacitor has good electrochemical capacitance performance within potential range from 0 to 1.0 V. The resulting composite exhibited high specific capacitances of 227 F/g and good cyclability in a three-electrode electrochemical cell. The excellent electrochemical performances can be attributed to the high conductivity of FLG as well as to the uniform nano-size of iron oxide dispersed on the support.
