Nowadays, Smartphone plays a vital role in human life. Power consumption by smartphone is a big issue faced by the people. Everyday depending upon the usage of smartphone multiple times charging is needed which requires power source wherever go. In this paper, proposed a new model for charging the smartphone automatically using waste resources which are generated by itself. Charging of smartphone can be achieved mainly by two techniques. First one is by converting heat generated from smartphone into electricity using seebeck effect and the second source can be by converting the illumination generated form smartphone into electricity using a solar panel. As a result, smartphone gets charged automatically when resources are generated the threshold value is set to charge the smartphone automatically if the power reaches a threshold value.
