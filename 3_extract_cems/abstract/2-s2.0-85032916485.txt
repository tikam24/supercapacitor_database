Graphene fibers (GFs) are attractive materials for wearable electronics because of their lightness, superior flexibility, and electrical conductivity. However, the hydrophobic nature and highly stacked structure endow GFs similar characteristics in nature to solid carbon fibers. Therefore, the interior functionalization of GFs so as to achieve synergistic interaction between graphene nanosheets and active materials thus enhance the performance of hybrid fibers remains a challenge. Herein, a general metal-ion mediated strategy is developed to functionalize GFs and nanoparticles of Cu, Fe2O3, NiO, and CoO are successfully incorporated into GFs, respectively. As proof-of-concept applications, the obtained functionalized GFs are used as electrodes for electrochemical sensors and supercapacitors. The performances of thus-devised fiber sensor and supercapacitor are greatly improved.
