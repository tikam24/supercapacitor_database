This paper reports ecofriendly synthesis of mesoporous cobalt hydroxide using carboxymethyl cellulose as carbon source. Different analytical investigations on this material indicate the formation of mesoporous flakes. This kind of morphology is highly favorable for energy storage applications. The electrochemical performance of the electrode material is evaluated for supercapacitor, in an alkaline electrolyte; it shows high specific capacitance and good rate capacity. In addition, it retains 93% of initial capacitance after 3000 repeated charge–discharge cycles. This attractive nanocomposite shows very low value of charge transfer resistance (1 Ω). We design an asymmetric supercapacitor device using β-Co (OH) 2 /C and activated carbon as electrode. This device exhibits a specific capacitance of 102 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 . The outcomes of these studies suggest its usefulness in supercapacitor devices.
