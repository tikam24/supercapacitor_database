Porous organic polymers (POPs) have been received considerable attention due to their advantages of large surface areas, good stability and functionalities, which are considered an ideal electrode material for the energy storage device that has been developed and applied in lithium batteries, zinc ion batteries and supercapacitors. Here we describe the synthesis of four kinds of redox-active 2D POPs via solvothermal Schiff base condensation using aniline oligomers with different chain lengths as building units that exhibit reversible electrochemical processes. Among them, the Tp-AT-POP based on 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol (Tp) and aniline trimer (AT) deliver high electrochemical performance mainly contributed by redox units exhibiting high specific capacitance up to 348.3 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g and possessing excellent cycling stability of 71% after 5000 cycles. In addition, the Tp-AT-POP is developed to assemble a symmetric supercapacitor with specific capacitances of 167 F/g at 0.3 A/g and good cycling stability. This work provides an efficient strategy for developing the redox-active 2D POPs with aniline oligomer structure for the next-generation advanced high-performance energy storage device.
