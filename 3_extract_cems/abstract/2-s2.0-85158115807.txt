Toxic environmental pollutants include chemical contaminants such as heavy metals and pesticides. Moreover, pesticides are used for modern extensive agricultural practices, affecting human health badly. Meanwhile, pharmaceutical and industrial wastes, personal care products, and endocrine disruptors can be cited as chemical pollutants. Environmental monitoring has been important in providing better safety measures in various sectors of life. Fabricating a new sensing platform with high selectivity and sensitivity is the most needed environmental detection tool. Electrochemical sensors draw attention to on-site environmental analysis. They are selective and sensitive toward electroactive compounds, fast, moveable, and cheap. Due to its important properties, many researchers use two-dimensional metalâ€“organic frameworks (2D MOFs). The applications of 2D MOFs are broad ranges, including sensors, catalysis, gas adsorption, gas separation, supercapacitor, and so on. 2D MOFs are based on the coordination of unique metal ions and organic ligands, including two-dimensional layered structures. The typical 2D materials consist of transition metal carbonitrides (Mxenes), graphene, transition metal disulfide compounds (TMDC), silene and carbon nitride, and hexagonal boron nitride. The chapter focused on 2D MOFs materials, sensor design strategies, and environmental application. Moreover, this chapter summarizes and evaluates recent advances in the development and application of 2D MOFs-based sensors for determining toxic environmental pollutants.
