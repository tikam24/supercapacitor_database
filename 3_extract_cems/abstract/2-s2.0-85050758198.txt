Portable fiber supercapacitors with high-energy storage capacity are in great demand to cater for the rapid development of flexible and deformable electronic devices. Hence, we employed a 3D cellular copper foam (CF) combined with the graphene sheets (GSs) as the support matrix to bridge the active material with nickel fiber (NF) current collector, significantly increasing surface area and decreasing the interface resistance. In comparison to the active material directly growing onto the NF in the absence of CF and GSs, our rationally designed architecture achieved a joint improvement in both capacity (0.217 mAh cm-2/1729.413 mF cm-2, 1200% enhancement) and rate capability (87.1% from 1 to 20 mA cm-2, 286% improvement), which has never been achieved before with other fiber supercapacitors. The in situ scanning electron microscope (SEM) microcompression test demonstrated its superior mechanical recoverability for the first time. Importantly, the assembled flexible and wearable device presented a superior energy density of 109.6 μWh cm-2 at a power density of 749.5 μW cm-2, and the device successfully coupled with a flexible strain sensor, solar cell, and nanogenerator. This rational design should shed light on the manufacturing of 3D cellular architectures as microcurrent collectors to realize high energy density for fiber-based energy storage devices.
