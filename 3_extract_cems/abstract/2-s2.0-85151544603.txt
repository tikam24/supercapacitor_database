The primary purpose of this study was to produce an ore-based high-capacity supercapacitor electrode. For this, chalcopyrite ore was first leached with nitric acid, and then metal oxide synthesis was carried out immediately on nickel foam using a hydrothermal technique from the solution. Cauliflower-patterned CuFe2O4 with a wall thickness of about 23 nm was synthesized on the Ni foam surface, characterized by XRD, FTIR, XPS, SEM, and TEM investigations. The produced electrode also displayed a feature of a battery-like charge storage mechanism with a specific capacity of 525 mF cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2 current density, energy of 8.9 mWh cm−2, and a power density of 233 mW cm−2. Additionally, even after 1350 cycles, this electrode still performed at 109% of its original capacity. The performance of this finding is 255% higher than that of the CuFe2O4 in our earlier investigation; despite being pure, it performs far better than some of its equivalents in the literature. Obtaining such performance from an electrode made from ore indicates that the use of ore has a lot of potential for supercapacitor production and property improvement.
