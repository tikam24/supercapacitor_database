This paper reports the fabrication of MnO2–CuO nanocomposite by a hydrothermal approach for supercapacitor applications. The crystal nature, morphology and chemical states of synthesized MnO2–CuO nanocomposite were examined by powder XRD, FT-IR, HRSEM, TEM, EDX, XPS and its electrochemical performance of as prepared nanocomposite materials as supercapacitor electrodes is measured by CV, GCD and EIS, The MnO2–CuO nanocomposite shows a higher specific capacitance (279.12 Fg−1) than individual compounds of MnO2 (175.51 Fg−1) and CuO (191.06 Fg−1) at a current density of 0.5 Ag−1. The cycle life of the composite was also excellent. After 10,000 cycles, it maintained 91.26% of its beginning capacitance. The electrochemical results showed that the MnO2–CuO nanocomposite is a suitable material for electrode fabrication of a supercapacitor.
