Hollow SnO2 nanospheres have been successfully fabricated through a simple hydrothermal method by using carbon spheres as template. Microstructure observation showed that the hollow SnO2 had uniform nanoscale size and single-shelled structure assembled by individual nanocrystallines. Being employed as the supercapacitor electrode materials, the resultant hollow SnO2 nanospheres displayed a considerable specific capacitance of 332.7 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g, much higher than the pristine SnO2 particles (143.5 F/g). The hollow SnO2 also exhibited good rate capability remained relatively high capacitance of 174.9 F/g at a large current density of 20 A/g, as well as excellent cycling properties without capacitance degradation over 2000 charging/discharging cycles. Such excellent electrochemical performance of the hollow SnO2 nanosphere can be attributed to its unique nanosized and single-shelled hollow structure which greatly increases the available surface area and providing hierarchical porosity for the electrode materials.
