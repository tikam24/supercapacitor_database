ZnCo 2 O 4 nanomaterial was synthesized using hydrothermal method by varying three different surfactants like ethylene glycol (EG), ammonium fluoride (NHF) and oxalic acid (OA). Crystalline structure of the materials was confirmed using XRD pattern. SEM images show nanosheets, cactus like and nanorod like morphology of the materials. Electrochemical studies of the material were tested using three electrode system. Storage capacitance of these materials was examined using cyclic voltammetric studies and charge discharge studies with the potential range of 0.0–0.45 V. The highest specific capacitance is 276.4 F g −1 at a scan rate of 2 mV s −1 and 290.5 F g −1 at a current density of 0.5 A g −1 for the ethylene glycol surfactant assisted material. EIS studies gives the value of charge transfer resistance of the nanomaterial which explains the conductivity nature of the electrode in the 2 M KOH electrolyte medium. ZCO-EG symmetric two electrode device exhibits the highest capacitance of 16.7 F g −1 at a current density of 0.025 A g −1 .
