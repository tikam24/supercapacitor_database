The present communication reports on the first electrodeposition of Ni(OH)2on ZnO array supportedon Ni foam. When applied as a binder-free electrode material for pseudocapacitive energy storage, theresulting ZnO@Ni(OH)2array exhibits a high specific capacitance of 2028 F g-1at a current density of10 A g-1with good cycling stability. Meanwhile, the array exhibits a superb rate capability. Even at anextremely high current density of 100 A g-1, the array still shows a very high specific capacitance of1059 F g-1.
