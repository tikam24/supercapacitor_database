It is vital to improve the electrochemical performance of negative materials for energy storage devices. The synergistic effect between the composites can improve the total performance. In this work, we prepare α-Fe2 O3 @MnO2 on carbon cloth through hydrothermal strategies and subsequent electrochemical deposition. The α-Fe2 O3 @MnO2 hybrid structure benefits electron transfer efficiency and avoids the rapid decay of capacitance caused by volume expansion. The specific capacitance of the as-obtained product is 615 mF cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2. Moreover, a flexible supercapacitor presents an energy density of 0.102 mWh cm−3 at 4.2 W cm−2. Bending tests of the device at different angles show excellent mechanical flexibility.
