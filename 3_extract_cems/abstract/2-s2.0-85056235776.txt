This contribution outlines the design of electric vehicle direct-current (DC) bus control system supplied by a battery/ultracapacitor hybrid energy storage system, and its coordination with the fully electrified vehicle driveline control system. The control strategy features an upper-level DC bus voltage feedback controller and a direct load compensator for stiff tracking of variable (speed-dependent) voltage target. The inner control level, comprising dedicated battery and ultracapacitor current controllers, is commanded by an intermediate-level control scheme which dynamically distributes the upper-level current command between the ultracapacitor and the battery energy storage systems. The feedback control system is designed and analytical expressions for feedback controller parameters are obtained by using the damping optimum criterion. The proposed methodology is verified by means of simulations and experimentally for different realistic operating regimes, including electric vehicle DC bus load step change, hybrid energy storage system charging/discharging, and electric vehicle driveline subject to New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), Urban Driving Dynamometer Schedule (UDDS), New York Certification Cycle (NYCC) and California Unified Cycle (LA92), as well as for abrupt acceleration/deceleration regimes.
