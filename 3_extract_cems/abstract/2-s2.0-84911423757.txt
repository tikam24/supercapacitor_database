Global warming and fuel depletion issues demand for more sustainable means of transportation, where the electric vehicles are gaining prominence on the transportation market perspectives. Fast development of power electronics and electric vehicles suitable energy storage systems allows the production of high efficiency electric vehicles. In this paper are discussed the advantages and drawbacks of three different arrangements for two considered energy sources, batteries and supercapacitors, using a bidirectional DC-DC converter. Two different control solutions based on proportional-integral controllers and a low-pass filter are also discussed. The global system performance from the energy storage system perspective is presented. The presented results were preformed using a 410 seconds sample of the Artemis drive cycle and Matlab/Simulink environment for the simulations.
