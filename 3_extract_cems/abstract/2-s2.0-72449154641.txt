Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are attractive electrode material for supercapacitors due to their characteristics of narrow pore size distribution, large electrochemically accessible surface area, high electronic conductivity, good mechanical properties, excellent chemical stability, high thermal stability and low cost. Based on the advantages of double - layer capacitance of carbon materials and pseudo - capacitance of metal oxide or conducting polymer, the progress of modification and preparation technologies for CNTs/metal oxide, CNTs/conducting polymer composites and in situ - growth of CNTs were discussed in the paper. It was concluded that the electrochemical properties of CNTs can be significantly improved by modification technology and believed that carbon nanotubes composites are the potential electrode materials for the application of supercapacitor.
