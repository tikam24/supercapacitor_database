Herein, we report the silicon micro-particles for supercapacitor application. Electrochemical properties of silicon particles were studied in the present work. Firstly, the microstructure of the silicon particles was studied by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Scanning electron microscopy was used to study the surface morphology of the sample. The electrochemical properties of the prepared electrode were investigated in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry, constant current changing/discharging and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were chosen to evaluate electrochemical properties of the electrode. The as-fabricated electrode of silicon particles exhibited a specific capacitance of 0.58 mF/cm2 at a scan rate of 10 mV/sec.
