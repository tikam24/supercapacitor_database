We synthesized graphene nanosheets (GNs)/cobalt aluminum (CoAl) double hydroxide composites through a layer-by-layer deposition process while varying the concentration of the graphene precursor used. The CoAl layered double hydroxide particles were uniformly distributed on the surfaces of the graphene layers and effectively prevented the agglomeration of the GNs, resulting in a higher reactive surface area and easier ion transport. We employed X-ray diffraction analysis, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, and field-emission transmission electron microscopy to investigate the microstructures and morphologies of the composites. In addition, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements were performed to analyze the electrochemical behaviors of the composites. The as-prepared composites showed desirable electrochemical characteristics, including high specific capacitances, low resistances, and high cycling stabilities. In particular, the composite formed by optimizing the GNs/CoAl ratio (the electrolyte used was a 6 M aqueous KOH solution) exhibited the maximum specific capacitance, which was 974 F g-1.
