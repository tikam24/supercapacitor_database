An ultracapacitorâ€“battery hybrid power system for city bus has been studied for hybrid power system and this can make the best of the characteristics of high energy density of battery and long cycle life of ultracapacitor. Subcomponents of battery pack, ultracapacitor, and DC/DC converter are modeled and a simulation system is developed. Real time simulation system is designed with veristand environment. A rule-based control strategy is designed and tested through off-line and real-time simulation. The simulation results under China city bus driving cycle show that hybrid power system has better power performance, fuel economy performance, and lower battery discharging current than battery only system.
