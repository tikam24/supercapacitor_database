Herein, we report on rutile TiO2 decorated hierarchical Li4Ti5O12 nanosheet arrays for lithium ion hybrid supercapacitor application for the first time. It is noted that the self-supported arrays manifest impressive rate capability and cycling stability, showing a reversible specific capacity of 142.9 mA h g-1, and retaining 92.3% of their initial capacity over 3000 cycles at a rate of 30C. The lithium ion hybrid supercapacitor, constructed with Li4Ti5O12 nanosheet arrays and nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs), exhibits an ultrahigh energy density of 74.85 W h kg-1 at a power density of 300 W kg-1. The hierarchical 3D interconnected nanostructure of the self-supported Li4Ti5O12-rutile TiO2 nanosheet arrays, as well as the efficient lithium diffusion along the [011] direction for Li4Ti5O12 and [001] for rutile TiO2, play an important role in the outstanding energy storage performance.
