Nitrogen doping of carbon materials can enhance the electrical conductivity, surface wettability, and introduce pseudocapacitance to improve the performance of supercapacitors. We propose a cost-effective and eco-friendly one-pot strategy to prepare high nitrogen-containing carbon aerogels from biomass, with soybean protein isolate as a nitrogen source, sodium lignin sulfonate as a carbon source, and carrageenan with thermal reversible gel properties as a gel skeleton. The surface morphology and porous structure of the carbon aerogel are analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and nitrogen adsorptionâ€“desorption, which indicates the macro-, meso-, and microporous structure (hierarchical porous structure) of carbon aerogel. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy are used to analyze the functional groups and degree of graphitization of the material with a nitrogen content of 6.18 at.% from pyrrole, pyridine and graphite nitrogen. The specific capacitance of the carbon aerogel is up to 231.75 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g, and the capacitance retention reaches 85.7 % after 5000 cycles. This work provides a novel strategy to prepare high nitrogen-containing carbon aerogels from biomass for high-performance supercapacitors with the concept of utilizing renewable biomass efficiently and sustainably.
