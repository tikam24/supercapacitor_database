The bifunctional electrode materials for supercapacitors and non-enzymatic glucose sensors have attracted the researchers’ great interest due to their excellent electrochemical performance. In this work, three-dimensional self-supporting multistage structure CC@MOF-74(NiO)@NiCo LDH electrode has been successfully prepared through a facile hydrothermal and electrochemical deposition method. Benefiting from the unique three-dimensional flower-like multistage structure, the optimized CC@MOF-74(NiO)@NiCo LDH electrode exhibits an excellent specific capacitance of 9.73 F cm−2 and a superior rate capability of 77.65% at a high current density of 50 mA cm−2. Besides, the material has a superior capacitance retention rate of 84.09% after 5000 cycles. Furthermore, the fabricated CC@MOF-74(NiO)@NiCo LDH//CC@NiCo2O4 @NiFe LDH ASC device exhibits a high energy density of 22.85 Wh kg−1 and the power density of 1750 W kg−1 at the current density of 10 mA cm−2. Moreover, the as-prepared CC@MOF-74(NiO)@NiCo LDH shows an outstanding electrocatalytic performance in glucose detection, including a high sensitivity of 1699 μA mM−1 cm−2, a low detection limit of 278 nM (S/N = 3) and a wide linear range of 10 μM–1.1 mM and 1.5–9 mM. The electrode also has good long-term stability and remains 93.29% of the original current density after 35 days. The unique three-dimensional flower-like structure of MOF-74 and two-dimensional layered double hydroxides (LDHs) nanosheets structure provide a larger specific surface area and improve the conductivity of the MOF-74(NiO). Furthermore, the synergistic effect of the bimetal Ni-Co provides more active sites for electrochemical reactions and shortens the ion transport path. Accordingly, the fabricated CC@MOF-74(NiO)@NiCo LDH has great potential application prospects in the field of supercapacitors and non-enzymatic glucose sensors.
