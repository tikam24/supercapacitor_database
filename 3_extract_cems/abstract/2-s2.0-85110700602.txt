Unique nanostructures can provide better electrochemical performance for supercapacitors. The unique network structure is formed by coating MoS2 nanospheres on ZnCo2O4 nanosheets, which has good synergistic effect. In this paper, the MoS2/ZnCo2O4 heterostructures were prepared by two-step hydrothermal method. MoS2/ZnCo2O4 was verified by XRD test, and the microstructure of MoS2/ZnCo2O4 was studied by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Electrochemical tests show that the heterostructure has a larger specific surface area and more electroactive centers than single ZnCo2O4 or MoS2 nanospheres. Using 1 M KOH as electrolyte, the maximum specific capacitance of the heterostructure nanocomposite electrode is 2705.2 F/g at a current density of 15 A/g. After 2000 cycles at a current density 50 A/g, the initial capacitance remains at 88.2%. A symmetric supercapacitor device with MoS2/ZnCo2O4 as positive and negative electrodes was assembled, which has good electrochemical performance, high capacity of 147 C/g, and good cycling stability of 90.3%.
