The synergy between two redox materials, the high electrical conductivity and the chemically robust durable structure of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxypyrrole) (PEDOP) combined with the high theoretical capacities, cost-effectiveness and abundance of M3O4 (M: Fe or Co) type oxides is exploited. Hybrid films of PEDOP@Co3O4 nanorods (NRs) and PEDOP@Fe3O4 nanostructures (NSs) are fabricated over flexible carbon (C)-fabric substrates for the very first time. A symmetric supercapacitor cell based on the PEDOP@Fe3O4 NSs hybrid outperforms the remaining cells based on pristine oxides, polymer and even PEDOP@Co3O4 NRs. The PEDOP@Fe3O4 NSs hybrid based cell delivers a high specific capacitance of 673 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with 83% retention after 5000 cycles. Additionally, it exhibits a wide voltage window of 1 V and an extraordinarily high energy density of 93 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 0.5 kW kg−1. Conducting atomic force microscopy studies reveal that the nanoscale (high) current flowing domains are uniform and almost seamless across the film of PEDOP@Fe3O4 NSs. In contrast, the insulating or low current flowing domains predominate the surfaces of PEDOP and PEDOP@Co3O4 NRs. The nano-level electrical conductivity for the PEDOP@Fe3O4 NSs film is also seven-fold times higher than that of PEDOP and PEDOP@Co3O4 NRs films. The reasons for enhanced electrochemical responses of the hybrids compared to the pristine oxides are explained. The porous morphology, enhanced electrical conduction, and lower ion-diffusion resistance offered by the PEDOP@Fe3O4 NSs film enables improved charge transfer and transport, thus manifesting in a good rate response, high energy density, and acceptable endurance parameters. A real time application of an illumination of green light emitting diode with three such cells also highlights the practical viability of this hybrid.
