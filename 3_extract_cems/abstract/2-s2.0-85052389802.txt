Polypyrrole-Ag nanoparticles composite film was prepared based on flexible carbon cloth as substrate using silver nitrate as oxidizing agent through simple one-pot chemical synthesis method. The composite sample was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge techniques. The electrochemical measurements showed such an electrode had a specific capacitance of 257 F g-1 and good cycle stability at a discharge current density of 1 A g-1. The composite electrode also had a wide working potential window, which can be applied in the field of power energy storage devices.
