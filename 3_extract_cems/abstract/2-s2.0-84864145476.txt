This paper describes the dynamics modelling of a practical and cost-effective DC/DC converter, DC/AC inverter and AC/DC rectifier for an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system with backup proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and battery. Furthermore, a dynamics modelling and intelligent comprehensive controller for the PEMFC is designed according to the change of the load, while the energy storage elements, such as battery and supercapacitor, are chosen to compensate the slow dynamic response of PEMFC and to meet the sudden peak load energy demand. The power converters based on dynamic modelling and controllers designed by feedback control theory can supply high quality power with flexible conversion functions, leading to the establishment of reliable power management for UPS applications. Finally, a suitable control strategy and technique, capable of coping with the change of the load for PEMFC and realising the energy management strategy of hybrid UPS system, is implemented. The performances of the proposed power converters and PEMFC generating system are evaluated by experimental results, showing that the developed hybrid UPS system with backup PEMFC and battery power sources is suitable for industry applications.
