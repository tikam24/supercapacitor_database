Far field radio frequency (RF) harvesting technique have become popular method to power wireless sensor network (WSN) recently. However, due to the low efficiency of RF energy harvester, RF powered WSN is unable to perform dynamic network allocation. Accordingly, the functionality of WSN is limited. This paper presents a practical RF powered wireless sensor node design that could dynamic join the network and unicast data packet. A non-ideal supercapacitor storage estimate model is proposed. Test result indicated the proposed model can accurate estimate the storage state, the RF energy harvesting node could dynamically join network as far as 10 meter.
