In this paper we present some models for supercapacitors. The supercapacitors are used more and more in high level industries such as: traction systems, automotive industry, aerospace industry, telecommunications etc. Undestanding supercapacitors operation mode is necessary so we can be able to determine the applications which require these components, and to be able to choose between supercapacitors and other energy storage devices. In this paper were used some models for the implementation of supercapacitors, and the simulations made in Orcad 9.2 to determine their operation, are in time and frequency domain. Also, the models were implemented in Simulink 7.5 and the simulation results prove the models accuracy. Two test measurements on the ECOND Pscap350 supercapacitor were realized and using the measurement data, two methods to compute the parameters are presented. Â©2009 IEEE.
