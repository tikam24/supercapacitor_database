Commercial supercapacitors need a high mass loading of more than 10 mg cm-2 and a high working potential window to resolve the low energy density concern. Herein, we have demonstrated a thick, ultrahigh mass loading (35 mg cm-2) and wide cell voltage electrochemically reduced layer-by-layer three-dimensional carbon nanofiber network (LBL 3D-CNF) electrode via electrospinning, sodium borohydride treatment, carbonization, and electro-reduction techniques. During the electro-reduction technique, Na+ is adsorbed onto the various defect sites of LBL 3D-CNFs, which properly inhibits the formation of the intermediate HER (hydrogen evolution reaction) product, leading to a wide cell voltage, whereas the LBL 3D-CNF network evokes an opportunity for storing a greater number of charges, resulting in excellent electrochemical performances. A symmetric supercapacitor with a reproducible and stable cell voltage of 2.0 V is constructed and demonstrated. The as-constructed device can deliver an areal energy output of 1922 Î¼W h cm-2 at a power density of 3979 W kg-1 equal to a gravimetric energy density of 27 W h kg-1, and an outstanding cyclic durability of 97.4% after 20 000 GCD cycles. These record-breaking performances would make our device one of the most promising candidates from an industrial point of view.
