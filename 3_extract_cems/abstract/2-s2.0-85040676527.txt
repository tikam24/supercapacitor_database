Over the last decade, significant efforts have been made to develop electrode architectures of the electrochemical energy storage (EES) devices. The involvement of electrostatic field, magnetic field, and electromagnetic field for electrode fabrication plays a vital role to enhance performance of supercapacitors in comparison with conventional roots. Electromagnetic techniques are advantageous over others because of several reasons including material's interactions at molecular level, noncontact energy, and chemical transportations to extract physical phase changings, and large-scale production with a cost-effective way. Recently, these techniques became a powerful tool for constructing hierarchical and well-ordered nanostructured electrodes. Their novel mechanisms and forms show high efficiency with numerous advantages such as green, simple, and mild reaction conditions. Herein, recent progress involving electromagnetic techniques for supercapacitor is reviewed; their potential future applications are also highlighted. The present review aims to serve as a guideline for fabrication techniques of next generation supercapacitor electrodes.
