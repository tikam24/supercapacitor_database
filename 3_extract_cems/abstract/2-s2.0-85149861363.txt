Graphene-based supercapacitors are powerful devices for supporting smart wearable electronics. However, the properties of the as-prepared graphene and its analogues differ from the expected characteristics, which hinder the development of graphene-based energy storage devices. Herein, we demonstrated the fabrication of planar supercapacitors based on laser-induced electrostatic self-assembled graphene oxide-MXene (GO-M) composites. Owing to the synergetic effect of the laser-matter interaction and electrostatic self-assembly, the as-prepared reduced GO-M (R-GO-M) showed good conductivity and a better layered micro-/nanostructure than reduced graphene oxide (RGO). Moreover, in this laser-induced process, MXene was introduced in R-GO-M, which offered more active sites. Therefore, the supercapacitor based on R-GO-M exhibited noticeable capacity enhancement, five times more than the value of the RGO-based supercapacitor. Furthermore, after comprehensive electrochemical performance analysis, the proper electrostatic self-assembly ratio was confirmed to be 10:1. We believe that the laser fabrication technique combined with a simple electrostatic self-assembly mechanism will promote the development of graphene-based energy storage devices using a simple but effective method.
