Carbonaceous materials with nanoframeworks are vital for advanced nanotechnologies and devices in the area of sustainable energy. Various carbonaceous materials have been explored as main electrode composites, efficient adsorbents, and for hydrogen storage. Because atomic boron is an electron deficient element, the boronated carbons demonstrated unusual properties for a number of applications. This chapter summarizes advanced progress in carbonaceous and related boraneous materials for use in energy and hydrogen storage as well as in oil spilling cleanup. Thus, the chapter provides the fundamental insight and offers important guidelines for the future design of carbonaceous materials in energy applications.
