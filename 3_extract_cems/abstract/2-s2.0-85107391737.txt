In this study, we report a simple, rapid, and efficient strategy for the fabrication of 3 D porous graphene fibrous materials(EGF) via open flame thermal expansion of RGO fiber(GF), which was prepared via chemical reduction and self-assembly of graphene oxide in our previous work. The 3 D EGF possesses high specific surface area and capacitance up to 1674.66 m2/g and 110 F/g, good electrical conductivity and excellent mechanical properties. Furthermore, SEM, TEM, XRD, FT-IR etc. were used to characterize and analyze the properties of EGF.
