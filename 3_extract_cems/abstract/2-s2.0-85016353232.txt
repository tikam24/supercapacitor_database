Supercapacitors have attracted intense research interest due to their high power density and long operation lifetime. Graphene has excellent electric conductivity and high chemical stability which make researchers to consider using graphene materials in electrodes for supercapacitors. Various strategies have been developed to process graphene-based or graphene-derived materials for achieving improved performance of graphene electrodes. Among the graphene materials investigated, activated graphene prepared by chemically activating platelet-like graphene materials has been explored with attempt to higher surface areas and/or optimized pore structures. In this short review, recent progress about the preparation of activated graphene and its composites and their use in supercapacitor electrodes are summarized. Specifically, the factors influencing the performance of activated graphene such as the effects of quantum capacitance and nitrogen doping have been discussed toward novel carbon materials for high performance supercapacitor electrodes.
