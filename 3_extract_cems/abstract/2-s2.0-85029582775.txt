In this study, we have fabricated a novel β-Ni(OH)2 hierarchical nanostructures (HNs) ∥ γ-Fe2O3 nanohexagons (NHs) and investigated their potential as electrode material for high-performance asymmetric supercapacitor. The X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy analyses confirmed the presence of β-Ni(OH)2 and γ-Fe2O3 in the obtained products. The electrochemical performance of single electrodes containing β-Ni(OH)2 HNs and γ-Fe2O3 NHs supported on the nickel foam exhibited high specific capacitances of 3232.08 and 1800.06 F g−1 at the current densities of 3 and 13 mA cm−2, respectively. As a result, we have fabricated an asymmetric supercapacitor device using β-Ni(OH)2 HN ∥ γ-Fe2O3 NH electrodes which exhibited high energy density of 99.28 W h kg−1 at a power density of 1599.85 W kg−1, with excellent cycling stability of 89.3% after 5000 cycles. Our results demonstrated that the β-Ni(OH)2 HN ∥ γ-Fe2O3 NH electrode material could serve as a potential candidate for energy storage applications.
