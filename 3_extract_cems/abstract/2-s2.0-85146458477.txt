In this paper, we fabricated three different MOFs samples including Ni,Co-MOF, Ni-MOF, Co-MOF by a facile electrochemical deposition onto the nickel foam at room temperature and their performances as supercapacitor electrode materials were evaluated and compared. The results of structural analyses proved the formation of MOFs production. Ni-, Co-, and Ni,Co-MOF/NF electrode showed specific capacities of 246 C/g, 74.25 C/g and 329 C/g at the applied current load of 2 A/g, respectively. The results of GCD cycling tests declared that the fabricated bimetal Ni,Co-MOF could show better cycle life as compared with its single-metal ion MOFs (i.e. Ni-MOF, Co-MOF) and reaches 306 C/g at 9000th cycles of the cycling test with the current load of 2 A/g, and also 92.1% capacity retention was observed for bimetal-MOF/NF.
