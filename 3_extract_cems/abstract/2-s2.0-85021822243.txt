Ionic liquids (ILs) - salts that are liquid at temperatures below 100Â°C - have gained big popularity over the past years and have become products of industrial interest, instead of just being lab curiosities. They show interesting combination of physical and chemical properties. A tunable viscosity and conductivity, chemical and thermal stability as well as large electrochemical windows and incombustibility at temperatures below their decomposition point makes them promising components for safe electrolytes in batteries, supercapacitors and other energy devices. In this talk we will present our latest results and developments in the field of ionic liquid based electrolytes for batteries and supercapacitors. In the latter cycling stability over 8 000 000 cycles has been achieved. The use of mixtures of ionic liquids and suitable additives in order to enhance performance and safety of zinc-air, aluminum-air and silicon-air batteries will also be discussed.
