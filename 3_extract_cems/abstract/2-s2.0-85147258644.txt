We report on antimony (Sb) and silicon (Si) based microstructured composite based lithiated anodes and their performance in battery-type hybrid supercapacitor devices. Ketjen-black carbon - 600 (or C-600) was used as capacitor-type cathode. For synthesis of materials, we employed a two-step process, viz., high probe sonication of the precursor materials followed by annealing at 700 °C for 1 h. The materials, namely, pure bulk Sb; Sb@C and Sb@Si/C were analyzed for phase, surface microstructure, and chemical states using X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE SEM)/energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. The as-synthesized alloy composites were pre-lithiated employing Li-ion battery (LIB) half-cell system via electrochemical pre-lithiation process in a fixed voltage range of 0.01–1.5 V for 8–10 charge-discharge cycles. Additionally, LISC devices, consisting of lithiated alloy-based anodes, and fresh C-600 carbon cathode, were successfully tested by electrochemical measurements, viz., Cyclic voltammetry (CV) electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) techniques. The full-cell hybrid LISC devices were characterized at 1.5–4.0 V. The specific capacitances calculated for Sb//C-600, Sb@C//C-600, and Sb@Si/C//C-600 are 81.07 F/g, 153.96 F/g and 188.27 F/g, respectively, at a current density of 3 mA/g. The Sb@Si/C//C-600 LICS device delivered a maximum specific energy density of 163.42 Wh/kg, capacitive retention of 68.95 % for consecutive 10,000 cycles at 10 mA/g and an excellent cyclic stability conducive for the development of energy storage devices.
