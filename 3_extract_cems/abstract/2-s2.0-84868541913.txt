This article aims to assess the benefits of investing in supercapacitor-based energy storage solutions for the Brussels (Belgium) public transport operator in order to reduce the energy consumption of the metro network. Different energy storage systems (ESS) configurations were designed for the metro trains to be placed at the substation level. The investigation consists in defining the required specifications of the supercapacitor modules in terms of energy capacity and power. In view of the identified systems, potential energy savings will be estimated and, based on a well-to-wheel approach, the reduction in emissions will be measured and monetarily valuated. To conclude, a cost-benefit analysis will be carried out to determine whether the benefits exceed the estimated costs on a life cycle basis. This approach is innovative in the sense that few studies analyse in-depth the economic and environmental benefits of energy storage applications for mass transport networks.
