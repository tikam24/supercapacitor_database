In this paper, a strategy of synergistic activation and nitrogen-doping is proposed to synthesize the wooden block gasified carbon-based nitrogen-doped porous carbon (WNPC). KOH and melamine are used as activating agent and nitrogen dopant, respectively. The wooden block (from poplar) gasified carbon retains the natural vascular bundle structure, which is conducive to pore-forming on the wall surface of the bundles. The response surface methodology is used to optimize the experimental conditions, the optimal product (WNPC-18) with high proportion of mesopores has a specific surface area of 2065 m2 g−1. N-5 and N-Q with a balanced proportion effectively improves the wettability and conductivity of porous carbon. WNPC-18 electrode shows excellent electric double-layer capacitance (501 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) in a three-electrode system (6 M KOH as electrolyte), and great cycle performance (Retention of the supercapacitor assembled by WNPC-18 is 96.67% after 5000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g−1). The dual function of potassium vapor in synthesizing WNPCs is explored in detail, which provides a new example for the study of the nitrogen-doped porous carbon.
