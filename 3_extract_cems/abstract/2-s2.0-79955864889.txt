This paper presents a new equivalent circuit model of hybrid supercapacitor with aqueous electrolyte which can describe its dynamic characteristic during the process of charging and discharging. Firstly, each component of hybrid supercapacitor with aqueous electrolyte was modeled separately. Then the whole equivalent circuit model was built by combining each component's model. Subsequently the least squares algorithm was adopted to identify the parameters of the model with the real experiment data, which can overcome the drawbacks of existing methods. Finally the equivalent circuit model was simulated with the help of Matlab/Simulink. The result proves the high precision and validity of the new model. Â© 2011 IEEE.
