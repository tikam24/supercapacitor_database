Energy is a major requirement in everyday life. The harvesting energy, as well as the storing energy, are crucial to being developed. Many individual types of research of DSSC or other solar cells systems, as well as the energy storage systems, have greatly improved. Many disadvantages are arising for a separated device e.g. loss of converted energy from solar cell, or need other expensive devices for unused converted energy. To overcome the problem, It is necessary to combine the solar cells and their storage in one integrated system. In this report, we show the charging performance of electrical energy from DSSC into a supercapacitor section. In this study, we simply describe the synthesis of various photoanodes of SnO2:TiO2 composite nanoparticles for a various fraction of wt% TiO2 i.e. 0, 9, 18, 27, 36, and 100%. The films have been prepared using the screen-printing method followed by blending with dye Î²-carotene and combined an additional layer of ZnO symmetric supercapacitor to build a solar-supercapacitor. It is found that TiO2 and SnO2 particles were successfully synthesized with the grain size ranged from 8.9 nm to 26 nm. The gap energy produced by SnO2/TiO2 composite nanoparticles is 3.07 to 3.15 eV. The addition of TiO2 nanoparticles increases the efficiency of solar cells. The performance of optimum solar cell SnO2:TiO2 composite nanoparticle showed by 36 wt% TiO2 device with Jsc, Voc, Fill Factor, and the efficiency of 0.388 mA, 0.806 V, 0.452, and 0.819% respectively. The charging from DSSC into supercapacitor was measured to btain their capacitance. It is shown that the supercapacitor section can store the energy produced by the conversion of light into electricity in the solar cell section.
