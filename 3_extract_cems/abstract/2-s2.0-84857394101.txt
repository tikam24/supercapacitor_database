In this work, a flexible and freestanding Carbon Nanofiber/Cobalt hydroxide (CNFCo(OH) 2) composite paper is prepared via electrospinning followed by a simple chemical precipitation method. The structure characterizations show that Co(OH) 2 particles are well dispersed on the surface of the CNF, forming a thin and flexible composite paper. Due to the reinforcing effects coming from the double layer capacitance of CNF and the pseudo-capacitance of Co(OH) 2, the supercapacitive performance of pure CNF and pure Co(OH) 2 are mutually improved significantly after combination. The CNFCo(OH) 2 paper exhibits the largest specific capacitance in the potential range of -1-0 V, about 24 higher than that of pure CNF paper; while the specific capacitance of the Co(OH) 2 can increase by 30 in the potential range of -0.2-0.35 V after precipitated on the CNF. Our work probably gives a new insight for designing and synthesizing electrode materials of supercapacitor and other energy-storage devices. Â© 2012 The Electrochemical Society.
