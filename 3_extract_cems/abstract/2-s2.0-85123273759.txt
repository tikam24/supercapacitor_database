Public electric transport like trolleybus, if equipped with regenerative traction drive, generates additional electrical energy during braking mode. The installation of onboard mobile supercapacitor energy storage systems provides an opportunity to store this recovered energy and use it during the next acceleration, thus reducing the energy consumption of the power supply substation but the capacity of supercapacitors decreases over their exploitation time. This paper presents a method for predicting the financial yield of such energy storage systems during their entire operation and service life. The financial yield of a mobile energy storage system is influenced by such variable parameters as the purchase and installation costs of the system itself and the price of electricity.
