Graphene is a type of promising electrode material for high-energy and high-power density supercapacitors, but its electrochemical performance is greatly limited by the restacking problem. In this work, we reported a facile approach to synthesis graphene with chemically bonded vanadium oxide (VOx) nanoparticles and demonstrated that chemically-bonded VOx nanoparticles can effectively prevent the graphene sheets from restacking and hence improve the electrochemical performance. The capacitance of VOx-bonded graphene increases to 272 F/g compared to 183 F/g of pristine graphene in 1 M H3PO4 aqueous electrolyte at 2 A/g. The VOx-bonded graphene also showed improved rate capability in both H3PO4 and ionic liquid electrolytes. The capacitance retention increases to 54.5% from 28.5% at 100 A/g (compare to 2 A/g) in H3PO4 and increases to 65.1% from 46.3% at 2 A/g (compare to 0.2 A/g) in neat ionic liquid. A high energy density of 84.4 Wh/kg is obtained within the voltage window of 4 V in ionic liquid. Even at a high-power density of 1000 W/kg, the VOx-bonded graphene shows a high energy density of 47.3 Wh/kg.
