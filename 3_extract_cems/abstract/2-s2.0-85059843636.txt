The major key component for developing a high-efficiency supercapacitor device is electrode and electrolyte material. This research paper demonstrates the structural modification of Co3O4 nanorod and the electrochemical behavior of Co3O4 nanorod in different aqueous electrolytes such as KOH, PVA/KOH, NaOH, KCl, and Na2SO4. The pseudocapacitive behavior of Co3O4 is varying in the order of KOH > NaOH > PVA/KOH > Na2SO4 > KCl. The storage capability of MCo2O4 (where M=Mn, Ni, Cu, and Zn) nanorods has been compared with Co3O4 nanorod in the KOH electrolyte environment. The material in the form of nanorods is beneficial for an efficient pathway to penetrate an OH− ion into the electroactive material. Among other cobaltite (MCo2O4), NiCo2O4 nanorod exhibits the outstanding capacitance value of 2041.7 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. NiCo2O4 || NiCo2O4 symmetric supercapacitor system delivers the maximum energy density of 25.42 W h kg−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1.
