A novel three-dimensional hierarchical porous carbon material was in the process of cleaning, activating and carbonizating of fresh dandelion pappus collected in Dalian area. Their physical properties, microstructures and electrochemcial properties were characterized by thermogravimetric analyzer, X-ray diffraction(XRD) analyzer, scanning electron microscope(SEM), Raman spectrometer and electrochemical workstation. The effects of activation temperature and ratio of activator on the electrochemical properties of carbon materials were studied. As the result, the activated carbon electrode had the best performance at 800â„ƒ and 2:1 ratio of activator, the specific capacitance of the electrode was 163 F/g at a current density of 5 A/g with no capacitance loss after 10 000 cycles, showing excellent stability. This could be attributed to its unique three-dimensional interoperable porous network architecture, which was conducive to the electrolyte into the internal space of activated carbon, thereby maximizing the contact area between the material and the electrolyte, which increased the charge density of double-layer storage and improved the electrochemical performance of activated carbon.
