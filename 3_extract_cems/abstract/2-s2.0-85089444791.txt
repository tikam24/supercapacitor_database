Research on wearable sensing technologies has been gaining considerable attention in the development of portable bio-monitoring devices for personal health. However, traditional energy storage systems with defined size and shape have inherent limitations in satisfying the performance requirements for flexible electronics. To overcome this constraint, three different configurations of flexible asymmetric supercapacitor (FASC) are fabricated on polyester/cellulose blend (PCB) cloth substrate using Ti3C2 nanosheet (NS) and 1T WS2 NS as electrodes, and aqueous pluronic gel as an electrolyte. Benefiting from the 2D material electrodes, the interdigitated FASC configuration exhibits excellent performance, flexibility, cyclic stability, wearability and can be configured into multiple units and shapes, which far exceed that exhibited by the textile-based FASC. Furthermore, the arbitrary (“AFN”) and sandwich (“FLOWER”) configurations Ti3C2 NS/1T WS2 NS FASC can be assembled directly on a PCB cloth substrate, thereby offering good structural integrity coupled with ease of assembly into integrated circuits of different shapes. More specifically, a lightweight, flexible, and wearable bio-monitoring system is developed by integrating force sensing device with interdigitated FASC, which can be used to monitor the physical status of human body during various activities. A potential application of this system in healthcare is successfully demonstrated and discussed.
