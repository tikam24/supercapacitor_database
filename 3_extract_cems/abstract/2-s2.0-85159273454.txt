Facile synthesis of Ni/Co-based zeolitic-imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) with interconnected rod-shape like particles was successfully achieved using a simple co-precipitation approach. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to characterise the studied materials. The formation of the NiCo-ZIF bimetallic sample was confirmed by XRD and FTIR studies. The electrochemical behaviour of bimetallic electrode materials was assessed using cyclic voltammetry, constant-current charge/discharge cycling and electrochemical impedance measurements. The specific capacitance of the Ni/Co-ZIF reached 358 C g−1 at a current density of 0.50 A g−1 and cycling stability of 96.5% after 2500 cycles in a three-electrode system. The two-electrode setup for asymmetrical cell for Ni/Co-ZIF//KOH//AC obtained an energy density of 16 Wh kg−1 and power output of 457 W kg−1 with an excellent stability performance (capacity retention of 106% after 2500 cycles). Findings demonstrate that bimetallic Ni/Co-ZIF produced by a room-temperature one-step co-precipitation method could offer great potential for high-performance supercapacitors.
