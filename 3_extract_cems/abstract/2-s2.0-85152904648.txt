Energy depository devices control energy utilization in diverse applications like transportation and electronic devices. Materials like batteries and supercapacitors empower and control the efficiency and life span of the devices. Therefore, the selection of materials for batteries and supercapacitors is an important requirement to enhance their energy storage capability. Even though conventional materials displayed good performance characteristics, they faced significant environmental issues regarding processing, synthesis, usage, and disposal management. The waste management of most conventional materials is a significant concern due to harmful environmental effects. Recently, there has been rising research interest in developing biobased polymers to overcome the issues created by conventional materials, and this has led to a switch towards eco-friendly materials and gadgets. Biopolymer fabrication is either chemically/fermentation sourced from biological resources or genetically altered microorganisms. Biopolymer composites with exceptional dielectric properties displayed immense potential as an energy repository dielectric layer in high-performing batteries and supercapacitor applications. This review aims to comprehensively review various biopolymer development techniques, novel advancements, and additive roles in biobased polymer composites for energy repository applications. Additionally, we discuss the future outlook of biobased polymer composites in solving environmental issues and energy depository applications.
