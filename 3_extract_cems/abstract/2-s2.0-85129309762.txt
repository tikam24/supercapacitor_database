The nickel-cobalt double hydroxide hybrid materials induced by biomass-derived carbon quantum dots (CQDs) have a three-dimensional network structure of cross-linked nanorods. The results demonstrate that the functional groups on the CQDs derived from pomelo peel promoted the nucleation and confined the growth of nickel-cobalt double hydroxide. The as-synthesized NiCo-LDH-CQDs-20 exhibits the high specific capacitance of 1814 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. When the current density is increased to 15 A g−1, the specific capacitance value remains 75.5 % of the initial one, which indicates that NiCo-LDH-CQDs-20 has an extremely high-rate performance. Furthermore, the asymmetric supercapacitor NiCo-LDH-CQDs-20//AC provides a high energy density of 46.47 Wh kg−1 in 2 M KOH solution with a power density of 800 W kg−1 and maintains an initial specific capacitance of 82.7 % after 2000 cycles. Therefore, this study provides a promising approach for the development of anode active materials in supercapacitor energy storage devices.
