In this paper we present a flexible super capacitor which has huge scope towards wearable electronic devices as power supplies. A simple, low-cost, flexible and high-performance supercapacitor consisting of Reduced Graphene Oxide (RGO)/Manganese dioxide (MnO2) hybrid electrodes have been developed. The as-synthesized self-supporting Reduced Graphene Oxide(RGO)/Manganese dioxide(MnO2) hybrid electrodes are assembled in the form of solid-state Super capacitor devices with phosphoric acid-polyvinyl alcohol(H3PO4-PVA)as separator.The resultant product are characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR),Scanning electron microcopy (SEM), and Electrochemical Measurements. The average crystalline size of MnO2 particles is about 25nm.MnO2 nanoparticles on RGO uniformly deposited on RGO sheets.
