A layered Ni(OH)2/graphene composite was firstly prepared by electrochemical deposition of nickel nanoparticles between layers of expanded graphite in Ni2+ containing solution, and then the deposited nickel nanoparticles were converted into Ni(OH)2 via cyclic voltammetry in 6 M KOH electrolyte. Images of transmission electron microscopy show that Ni(OH)2 particles are uniformly distributed on graphene sheets with an average diameter of 6 nm. The Ni(OH)2/graphene composite with an areal loading of 5 mg cm-2 demonstrates a maximum specific capacitance of 856 F g-1 at 1 A g-1, and 79 % of the specific capacitance can be retained after 2000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g-1. Commercial expanded graphite is much cheaper than activated carbon and considerably much cheaper than graphene, therefore this technique is very promising for mass production of supercapacitor electrodes.
