The development of energy storage technology depends on the ability to produce high performance electrode and electrolyte materials for electrical energy storage devices. Electrochemical double-layer capacitor (EDLC), such as electric double-layer capacitors and supercapacitors, are emerging technologies that have attracted considerable attention. This chapter provides an overview of EDLCs and electrode materials, as well as the comparisons between different electrode materials and their capacities. The electrochemical performances of some electrode materials in electrochemical cells are also discussed. Obviously, many alternative materials have been synthesized and proposed in the past few decades. This method has opened up a new paradigm for the development of high-performance energy storage materials and high-power energy devices. This chapter aims to provide some strategies for designing advanced energy storage devices with high energy density.
