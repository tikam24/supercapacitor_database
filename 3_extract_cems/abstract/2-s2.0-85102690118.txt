The application of multi-energy systems in urban rail vehicles have attracted increasing attention. However, the existing studies were mainly focused on high-voltage systems, but rarely on low-voltage multi-energy systems. Based on the world's first hybrid fuel cell / supercapacitor 100%-low-floor tram, a model of vehicle-mounted PV / energy storage low-voltage DC micro-grid is proposed for the train's 24V DC loads. Moreover, an energy management strategy based on Fuzzy control is proposed to achieve the sufficient consumption of PV power and the reasonable SOC distribution of the battery. The calculation results show that the proposed low-voltage multi-energy system can meet the load demand and the battery constraints, and the PV utilization rate is as high as 99.8%.
