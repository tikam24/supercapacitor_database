The electrochemical performance of NiCo2O4 currently still faces inherently limited active sites and less available surface areas, hindering its application as the pseudocapacitive electrode in supercapacitors. Accordingly, the cross-linked NiCo2O4 nanosheets with low crystallinity and rich oxygen vacancies on nickel foam (Pd–NCO/NF) by introducing noble metal palladium (Pd2+) has been fabricated. The results show that the lattice orientation of NiCo2O4 nanoparticles is disordered by Pd doping, leading to a decrease in crystallinity. In addition, low crystallinity with a large number of lattice boundaries results in the high electrochemical activity with 2484.4 F g−1. At high current density of 10 A g−1, the capacitance retention could remain 95% after 8000 cycles. An asymmetric supercapacitor of Pd–NCO/NF//activated polyaniline derived carbon (APDC) demonstrates high energy density of 47.5 W h kg−1 at 425.4 W kg−1 and promotes excellent cycle stability, with a capacity retention rate of 86% after 10,000 cycles.
