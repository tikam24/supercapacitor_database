The electrochemically synthesized polypyrrole and lead-lead sulfate is examined as a potential electrodes for battery-type hybrid supercapacitors in acidic solution. The device exhibits battery-type behavior at low discharge rate, e.g. <0.5 A g-1, and supercapacitors-type behavior at a higher discharge rate. Discharge in the specific current range of âˆ¼0.6-2.27 A g-1 based on the active masses, can deliver capacity of 90-72 Ah kg-1, energy of 58-40 Wh kg-1 and power of 40-1350 W kg-1, with the specific capacitance of the cell in the range of 300-250 F g-1. The experimentally obtained values are compared with theoretical.
