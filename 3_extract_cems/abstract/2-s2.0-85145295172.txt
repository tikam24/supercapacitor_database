Herein, we report porous polymers electrolytes (PPEs), composed of a biodegradable polymer poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL), activated with organic liquid electrolyte (ethylene carbonate (EC)/propylene carbonate (PC)/NaClO4) and an ionic liquid (IL)-incorporated electrolyte (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethane-sulfonate (EMITf)/Na-trifluoromethane sulfonate (NaTf). The porous polymeric membranes are prepared via a simple, one step immersion precipitation method, which provide channels for ionic transport. Morphological/structural, thermal and electrochemical studies on PPEs exhibit excellent flexibility, good porosity (∼80%), high (∼90%) liquid electrolyte uptake and high room temperature ionic conductivity (1.8–1.9 × 10−3 Scm−1) with wide electrochemical stability window (>5.0 V). Quasi-solid-state carbon supercapacitors/electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) are fabricated from symmetrical activated carbon (AC) electrodes (derived from a waste-biomass, sugarcane bagasse), separated by PPE-films. The supercapacitor based on IL-incorporated PPE exhibits higher specific capacitance (∼170 F g−1) and specific energy (∼34 Wh kg−1) compared to the device based on organic solvents-based PPEs (∼130 F g−1 and ∼24 Wh kg−1, respectively). Substantial energy storage in supercapacitor is evident from the glow of LED (35–50 mW) for longer duration. The device demonstrates stable performance up to ∼10,000 charge-discharge cycles with ∼15% initial capacitance fading and ∼100% Coulombic efficiency.
