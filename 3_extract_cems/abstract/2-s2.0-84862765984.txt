Crystalline hausmannite nanocrystals/reduced graphene oxide composites (denoted as Mn 3O 4/RGO) are synthesized by means of the microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis (MAHS) route for the application of symmetric and asymmetric supercapacitors. Effects of the Mn 3O 4 content on the microstructure and electrochemical performances of nanocomposites are systematically investigated. The morphology and crystalline structure of composites are examined by scanning electron microscopic (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is used to determine the mass content of RGO in the Mn 3O 4/RGO composites. The results indicate that the composite with about 82.4 weight percents (wt%) Mn 3O 4 (denoted as GMn80) shows the largest total specific capacitance (∼193 F g -1), which is employed for the tests of supercapacitors of both symmetric and asymmetric types. An aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor, consisting of a GMn80 cathode and an N-doped RGO anode (reduced from a GO-NH 4OH solution through the MAHS method), with a cell voltage of 2 V is demonstrated in this work, which shows the device energy and power densities of 11.11 Wh kg -1 and 23.5 kW kg -1, respectively. Highlights: Mn 3O 4/RGO composites with controllable composition are fabricated by a MAHS method. Mn 3O 4/RGO composites show 81% C S,T retention by varying the scan rate from 0.025 to 1 V s -1. A Mn 3O 4/RGO/N-doped GS asymmetric EC shows 11 Wh kg -1 and 24 kW kg -1 at 24 A g -1. The aqueous asymmetric EC shows capacitor behavior with a cell voltage of 2 V. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.
