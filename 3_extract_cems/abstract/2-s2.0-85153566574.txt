As energy demand is escalating day by day due to population growth, economic and technical advancement, drawing more power from the non-renewable energy sources means running towards inadequate energy. Fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gases release large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (GHG), which deplete the ozone layer and result in acid rain. Despite the availability of various renewable energy sources, only solar power has been considered as the mainstream renewable energy (RE) source in Bangladesh. Other sources, such as wind, hydro, bio-gas etc haven't been explored thoroughly. Even if implemented, the unpredictability of renewable energy generation, oscillating power profiles, and efficient energy storage and management would be the major challenges. Therefore, in this paper, a small scale hybrid solar-wind-hydro power generation scheme with a smart hybrid energy storage system (HESS) is presented which can withstand intermittent and unstable renewable sources and also supply load instantly during short-term load shedding. The experimental results were obtained and compared with simulation results of MATLAB/Simulink. The proposed small-scale generation combined with the storage system ensures the stability and reliability of environmentally friendly renewable sources while meeting demand with greater efficiency and compatibility.
