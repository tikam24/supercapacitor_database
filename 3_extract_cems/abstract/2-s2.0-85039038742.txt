In this work, we have synthesized the ZnCo2O4 electrode by a facial one-step hydrothermal method on a carbon cloth for the supercapacitor application. The structural and phase purity of the prepared electrode material was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. The surface morphology and elemental stoichiometry were studied using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The FE-SEM micrograph illustrates that the ZnCo2O4 material is composed of microstrips with a ∼0.5 μm width and length in micron uniformly covered the carbon cloth surface. The ZnCo2O4 electrode material further investigated for electrochemical analyses. The cyclic voltammetry results showed that the ZnCo2O4 microstrips electrode exhibited the highest specific capacitance of 1084 F/g at 2 mV/s scan rate. Remarkably, a maximum energy density of 12.5 Wh/kg was attained at a current density of 2 mA/cm2 with the power density of 3.6 kW/kg for the ZnCo2O4 microstrips electrode. Furthermore, the 96.2 % capacitive retention is obtained at a higher scan rate of 100 mV/s after 1000 CV cycles, indicating excellent cycling stability of the ZnCo2O4 microstrips electrode. The frequency-dependent rate capability and an ideal capacitive behaviour of the ZnCo2O4 microstrips electrode were analyzed using impedance analyses; a representing the ion diffusion structure of the material. These results show that the ZnCo2O4 microstrips electrode could be a promising material for supercapacitor application.
