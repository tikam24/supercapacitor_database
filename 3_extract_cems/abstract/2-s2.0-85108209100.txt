Free-standing flexible supercapacitive electrodes have practical application for wearable energy storage devices. In this paper, graphene paper (GP), a flexible electrode substrate, was prepared by one-step reduction of graphene oxide (GO) using HI solution. GP can be used independently as a flexible electrode with specific capacitance of 227 F/g. In order to make up for the shortage of GP specific capacitance storage, polyaniline (PANI) with high specific capacitance and good electrical conductivity was selected to composite with GP by electrochemical polymerization approach. This method to fabricate electrode material by direct electrochemical polymerization avoids the use of conductive binder and organic solvent. Owing to the specific capacitance contribution of PANI and GP, the PANI/GP composites exhibit higher specific capacitance when the polymerization time is 30 s and the polymerization voltage is 0.8 V. At 1 A/g current density, the specific capacitance of composite is up to 759 F/g, which is 3.34 times of neat GP.
