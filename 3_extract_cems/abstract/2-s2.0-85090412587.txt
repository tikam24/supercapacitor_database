The renewable energy sources are operated at Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) mode to extract maximum energy. The integration of renewable energy sources to the grid is a challenging task. During the integration of the renewable energy sources to the grid, the DC bus voltage should be regulated and maintained constant. As these sources are highly variable and unpredictable in nature, requires a storage devices to maintain the DC bus voltage constant. The designed controller stabilizes the DC bus voltage. The controller regulates the DC bus voltage with changes in wind velocity, solar irradiation and load. The system maintains the Point of Common Coupling (PCC) voltage under variable load condition. The grid voltage and currents harmonic distortion are within the acceptable limits. The system is tested in two modes using MATLAB-Simulink.
