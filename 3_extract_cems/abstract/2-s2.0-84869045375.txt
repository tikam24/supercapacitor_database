Electrochemical characteristics of copper sulfides are of importance because of their possible application as an active material in solar cells. Also, investigation of behavior of copper sulfide minerals during their anodic polarization and modeling of these reactions suggest that the equivalent electrical circuit must contain very high capacitances, indicating a possibility of using copper sulfide minerals for electrochemical supercapacitor electrodes.
