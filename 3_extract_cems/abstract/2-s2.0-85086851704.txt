The high-performance electrode materials is a major issue in the development of large-scale supercapacitors. Here, we prepared a high capacity supercapacitor electrode material MnO2/ZSM-5-CO2 by CO2 activated the support of molecular sieve (ZSM-5). The results show that the MnO2/ZSM-5-CO2 particles have obvious leafy structure, and uniform dispersed on the surface of the ZSM-5-CO2. The specific capacitance of the MnO2/ZSM-5-CO2 materials is calculated to be 650.62 F g-1 higher than that of the ZSM-5-CO2, MnO2/ZSM-5-N2. The MnO2/ZSM-5-CO2 electrode material, and also displayed great reversibility and stability long-term cycle life in repetitive charge-discharge cycling.
