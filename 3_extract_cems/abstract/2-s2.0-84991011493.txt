Stretchable all-solid supercapacitors based on aerosol synthesized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have been successfully fabricated and tested. High quality SWCNT films with excellent optoelectrical and mechanical properties were used as the current collectors and active electrodes of the stretchable supercapacitors. A transmittance of up to 75% was achieved for supercapacitors made from the assembly of two PDMS/SWCNT electrodes and a gel electrolyte in between. The transparent supercapacitor has a specific capacitance of 17.5 F g-1 and can be stretched up to 120% with practically no variation in the electrochemical performance after 1000 stretching cycles and 1000 charging-discharging cycles.
