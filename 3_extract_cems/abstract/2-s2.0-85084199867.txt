In this study, CoOOH/Co(OH)2 and CoOOH/Co(OH)2/graphite nanocomposites were obtained using a one-step microwave method. The morphologies of nanocomposites changed intensively by adding trace graphite, thereby affecting the electrochemical properties. The optimum capacitance of the electrode material can reach 402Fg-1 at 2Ag-1 and could be increased by 172% (692Fg-1) until 2200 cycles when the graphite content is 10mg. An excellent cycling stability of 86.2% capacitance retention of the highest value was attained after 10,000 cycles, which is higher than those of the CoOOH/Co(OH)2 electrode. The proposed provides a simple means to improve the electrochemical properties by changing the morphology of electrode material in supercapacitors.
