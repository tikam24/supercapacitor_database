This paper presents the supercapacitor parameters variations due to state of charge (SOC), the number of cycle (NbCy) and frequency of DC-current in ambient temperature tests conditions. The goal of this study consists to show the parameters evolution which can serve to determine the lifetime of supercapacitor for different conditions of use. The contribution of the paper is focused on the impacts of DC-current frequency coupled to number of cycle on supercapacitor resistance and capacitance. The proposed method uses several DC-current profiles based on fluctuations and no fluctuations consideration. To do the supercapacitors characterization, the experimental tests based on charge and discharge operations with dynamic (fluctuating) DC-current are done. The experimental tests results are presented and the impacts of state of charge, the number of cycle and frequency of DC-current are analyzed.
