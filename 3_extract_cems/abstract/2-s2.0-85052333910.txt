In this work, a double-layer nitrogen-doped microporous hollow carbon@MoS2/MoO2 nanosphere (NCs@MoS2/MoO2) is prepared via a facile method utilizing Mo-mediated in situ growth on polyaniline-coated polystyrene spheres and carbonization process. Because of its unique structure, the as-obtained NCs@MoS2/MoO2 exhibits a high specific capacitance (569 F g-1 at 1 A g-1) and excellent rate performance (54.8% capacitance retention) from 1 A g-1 (569 F g-1) to 20 A g-1 (312 F g-1) when directly used as a supercapacitor electrode. In a two-electrode system, it exhibits 81% capacitance retention and 91.4% Coulombic efficiency even after 5000 cycles at 5 A g-1. Therefore, the prepared NCs@MoS2/MoO2 shows to be an outstanding material for supercapacitor electrodes.
