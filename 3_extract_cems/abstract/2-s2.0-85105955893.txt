Hybrid electrodes containing cobalt oxides (Co3O4)/ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) decorated on graphene oxide surface materials for electrochemical supercapacitor applications. The 3D porous and nanocrystalline structured Co3O4@RuO2/NGO composite was prepared by hydrothermal reaction process. The structural and morphological behaviors of the composite were examined by analytical characterization and electrode material studied via three-electrode configuration of cyclic voltammetry. The Co3O4@RuO2/NGO composite electrode accomplished of ~472 F gâˆ’1 (0.5 A/g) and showed increasing stability capable of 5000 cycles with 97.1% retention.
