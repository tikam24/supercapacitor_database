The demand for electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) has recently increased, especially for regenerative braking systems in electric or hybrid vehicles. However, using EDLCs under high temperature often enhances their degradation. Continuously monitoring EDLC degradation is important to prevent sudden malfunction and rapid drops in efficiency. Therefore, it is useful to diagnose the degradation at a lower frequency than that used in charge/discharge. Unused and degraded EDLCs were analyzed using the alternating current impedance method for measurements over a wide frequency range. Each result had a different spectrum up to 1 kHz. In addition, we show the basic inside condition of EDLCs with equivalent circuit analysis. This paper explores the possibility of degradation diagnosis at a high frequency and the basic physical mechanism.
