Graphene nanosheets dispersed with porous nickel bundled Silicon nanowires (SiNWs) supporter was investigated as an electrode material for supercapacitor. The electrochemical exfoliation approach was used to prepare the graphene nanosheets. The direct and close contact between graphene and Ni-SiNWs is beneficial to the enhanced conductivity of the electrode, as well as hindered the aggregation of graphene during applications. Additionally, the graphene obtained by electrochemical exfoliation possesses a large amount of oxygen-containing groups that can provide high pseudocapacitance. Electrochemical performance of the composite electrode was investigated using cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry. All results indicate that the composite may be a promising candidate for high-performance supercapacitors. In particular, since the fabrication process is compatible with conventional silicon technology, the structure has immense potential as integrated supercapacitors.
