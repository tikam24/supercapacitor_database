The field of 2-dimensional (2D) materials has witnessed a sharp growth since its inception and can majorly be attributed to the substantial technical and scientific developments, leading to significant improvements in their syntheses, characterization and applications. In the list of 2D materials, the relatively newer addition is phosphorene, which ideally consists of a single layer of black phosphorous. Keeping in mind the past, and ongoing research activities, this short account offers a brief overview of the present status and the associated challenges in the field of phosphorene-related research, with special emphasis on their syntheses, properties, applications and future opportunities.
