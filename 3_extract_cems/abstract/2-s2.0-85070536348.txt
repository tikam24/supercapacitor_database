Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) hold great potential in the development of electrode materials for next-generation supercapacitors because of their versatile porous architectures. Here we report our finding in synthesis and characterization of electrode materials derived from a pillared MOF, Ni2(ADC)2(DABCO) for a high-performance hybrid supercapacitor, where ADC represents 9,10-anthracenedicarboxylate and DABCO corresponds to 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. The positive electrode is derived from a single MOF and graphene oxide (GO) composite, consisting of a highly functionalized nickel hydroxide coupled with graphene, ADC, and DABCO groups. A hierarchically porous nitrogen-rich carbon, derived from the same MOF/GO composite, is used as the negative electrode. The resulting hybrid supercapacitor demonstrates high energy and power density (59 and 48 Wh kg-1 at 0.9 and 15.5 kW kg-1, respectively), good rate capability (19% capacity loss from 1 to 20 A g-1), and exceptional cycling stability (95% capacity retention over 10000 cycles at 20 A g-1). These findings imply that the combination of pillared MOFs and rGO significantly enhances the electrochemical performance of the resulting electrode materials. In addition, this study also provides a new material preparation strategy (MOFs-rGO-derived materials) for synthesis of high-performance electrode materials for other energy storage devices.
