Lithium batteries, as the energy source of robots, suffer from the problem of insufficient instantaneous maximum power and battery degradation due to prolonged high power output. Li-battery-supercapacitor composite power supply is a better solution, and the authors propose a hardware control circuit to limit the maximum power, which can switch the output mode automatically. Depending on the load power state, the power margin in addition to the power required by the load is dynamically allocated to the control strategy for charging the supercapacitor. The remaining power is used to charge the supercapacitor, which not only achieves full utilization of the battery energy, but also protects the power supply from damage due to overcurrent output and ensures that the supercapacitor has enough energy for long-time motion. The feasibility of the constant power battery protection and dynamic power distribution control strategy is verified through physical prototype testing, and the strategy improves the power performance of the robot.
