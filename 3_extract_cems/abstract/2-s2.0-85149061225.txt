Designing freestanding electrodes for supercapacitors has attracted tremendous attention since avoiding the use of inactive additives is cost-effective and process-efficient for the industrialization and commercialization of supercapacitors. To accommodate the vigorous electrochemical process and facilitate charge transfer, robust and conductive backbones are required to fabricate freestanding electrodes. Herein, a carbon black (CB)-functionalized electrospun carbon nanofiber (CNF) backbone is fabricated for growing redox-active dense polyaniline (PANI) nanoarrays to construct hierarchical carbon black/carbon nanofiber/PANI nanocomposites (CCNFP) as freestanding supercapacitor electrodes. The CB particles act as nanofillers to functionalize the CNF backbone, not only providing additional conductive networks and pores inside each nanofiber but also increasing the surface roughness to facilitate PANI deposition; whereas PANI nanoarrays offer pseudocapacitive properties and improve the wettability of the electrodes. The synthesized CCNF7P24 electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 1062.7 F g−1 and excellent retention of 72.2 % at current densities of 1 and 20 A g−1, respectively. A symmetric supercapacitor constructed from two freestanding CCNF7P24 electrodes delivered a maximum energy density of 54.3 Wh kg−1, benefiting from the excellent electrochemical performance of the electrodes. This work provides a reliable approach to fabricating nanofiber-based hierarchical composites for freestanding electrodes.
