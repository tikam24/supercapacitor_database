Mesoporous ternary zinc manganese oxides on the Ti sheet substrate are prepared by easy and fast hydrothermal method for the first time. The obtained ZnMn 2 O 4 materials with homogenously distributed pores have been characterized by XRD, SEM and Raman spectra, which show the good crystal phase and particles for improving supercapacitive performance. XRD and SEM images show that the as-prepared samples have good crystallinity, and ZnMn 2 O 4 microsphere has an average diameter of 10 Î¼m. In addition, ZnMn 2 O 4 are also characterized in 2 M KOH solution using three-electrode system. In the work, we study that different substrates (Ti, carbon and nickel foam) have an important effect on the electrochemical performance of the samples. The research of cyclic voltammogram (CV) indicates that the obtained specific capacitance (155 F g -1 ) values on nickel foam substrate for the ZnMn 2 O 4 microspheres are higher than the values reported for some inexpensive oxides. However, the specific capacitance of all ZnMn 2 O 4 samples has almost no change at two different scan rates which shows good long-term cycling stability. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy with a small resistance reveals that the as-synthesized samples have good frequency response characteristics. These results indicate that the unique ZnMn 2 O 4 electrode would be a promising electrode for high-performance supercapacitor applications.
