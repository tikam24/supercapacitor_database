In microgrid systems, a high power density storage unit is needed in order to take quick bursts of power provided by the renewable sources. A supercapacitor (SC) is ideal for this purpose therefore a charge/discharge regulation is needed for the energy management system. This paper presents a novel nonlinear droop control strategy used for this purpose. Usually, droop control is implemented as a load sharing scheme, but in this case it will be used to do the opposite and it will command the charge/discharge of the SC only when it is required by the grid. Also, the converter-supercapacitor unit (CSU) will have the advantage of being independently controlled therefore the autonomous characteristic of the microgrid is preserved. The converter used for this task is a bi-directional hybrid DC-DC topology (HBDC) with a high voltage conversion ratio, which connects the SC to a DC microgrid. The converter high voltage conversion ratio is helpful in order to use an extended range of the SC energy storage capacity.
