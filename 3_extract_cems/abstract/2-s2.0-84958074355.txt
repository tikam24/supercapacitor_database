We discovered an organic weak acid, 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic acid (PTCA), confined on the electrode surface, revealing a reversible and ultrafast protonation/deprotonation non-Faradaic process but exhibiting analogous voltammetric peaks (capacitive peaks). A further synthesized PTCA-graphene supramolecular nanocomplex discloses a wide voltage window (1.2 V) and ultrahigh specific capacitance up to 143 F g-1 at an ultrafast charge-discharge density of 1000 A g-1 (at least 1 order of magnitude faster than present speeds). The capacitance retention maintained at 73% after 5000 cycles. This unique capacitive voltammetric behavior suggests a new type of charge-storage modes, which may offer a way for overcoming the present difficulties of supercapacitors.
