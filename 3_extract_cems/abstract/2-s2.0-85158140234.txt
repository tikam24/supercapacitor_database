As sustainability practices and Green Chemistryâ€™s principles gathered attention, the use of renewable sources became an urgent topic to be addressed by the scientific community. In that way, biomass has become pivotal in a more sustainable future, especially for energy applications. Compared to the conventional carbon nanostructures obtained from non-renewable sources, biomass has a great potential for their replacement and to furnish similar materials for carbon-based supercapacitors. However, to accomplish that biomass has to overcome a large variety of drawbacks as suitable methods for increased porosity (hierarchical pore sizes and high surface areas), reduced tortuosity, reduction of the number of some oxygenated functional groups (avoiding secondary reactions that induce charge loss), and increased wettability. The structure of carbon-based materials can directly influence their electrical properties and thus affect their resistivity/conductivity, which is related to the activation or preparation procedure employed to produce them from biomass. Despite the efforts made on lignocellulosic-based supercapacitors, structural uniformity continues to be a fundamental challenge for the field. Even the slightest change in any treatment parameter causes critical differences in the final physicochemical supercapacitor. In addition, it should also be mentioned that biomass source implies the transformation of the electrochemical activities, needing to establish a comparison between them. Also, biomass cultivation and the circular economy might represent a vital bottleneck to be overcome. Despite these issues mentioned above, it is worth noting that biomass efforts for replacing non-renewable sources of carbon-based supercapacitors are essential to devote great attention to overcoming them to achieve a more sustainable future for energy purposes.
