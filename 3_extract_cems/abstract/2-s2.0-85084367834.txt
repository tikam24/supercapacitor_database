Electric Vehicle Dynamic Wireless Power Transfer is the messing key towards total EV's market penetration. In-motion charging would enhance sustainable mobility by reducing storage system weight since vehicles proceed to opportunist charging occupationally. However, such application require high power rates since the energy transfer must be achieved quickly and shall match different vehicles power requirements. This tender impact multiple levels of transportation starting with the vehicle design, road infrastructure and electrical grid network. The need for power-flow smoothing is eminent to reduce pulsations caused by the vehicle motion, in addition to power peaks during seconds caused by the WPT as a part of the Electrified Road System which effects the entire electrical load. Ultracapacitors integration, as Local Power Caches, is a promising solution to answer the demand on the WPT side and step up the power rates within consideration of the electrical grid limitations.
