A set of analytical equations for the calculation of the temperature in supercapacitors operating in constant-power applications is presented in this paper. Although the main operation modes of supercapacitors are constant-current and constant-power charge and discharge, this study was focused on the latter, since both sources and loads act as constant-power systems in a wide range of power conversion facilities. The starting point of this study is the classical supercapacitor model based on electrical and thermal parameters provided by manufacturers or also obtained by experimental means. The proposed mathematical analysis is based on the so-called incomplete gamma function that presents two major advantages over previously existing methods. Firstly, it is not necessary to solve any differential equations system by means of numerical methods, which reduces the required computational effort. Secondly, no simplifications to relief the calculations are made in the computation of any variable. The new formulation renders valid solutions even for high-power demand situations. Moreover, the temperature of the supercapacitor can be expressed as a function of time or any other electrical variable in the charging and discharging processes. There-fore, the proposed formulas are especially remarkable for the electrical and thermal dimensioning of supercapacitors.
