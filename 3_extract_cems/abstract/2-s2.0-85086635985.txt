Owing to larger surface area and high porosity of 3-D hierarchical nanostructures, it developed the intensive research interests of material scientists. Mesoporous 3-D hierarchical ZnS nanostructures have been synthesised using Hydro/solvothermal route. Using different precursors and chemical compositions different morphologies (Raspberry-like, Nanoballs, Nanoflowers) with different defect states are obtained. It has been seen that cationic and anionic vacancies can be controlled and confirmed by EDX and XPS study. Based on the various surface characteristics studies, it is proved that the solvent assisted 3-D ZnS hierarchical nanostructures have good photocatalytic and electrochemical performance. All samples possess best photocatalytic efficiency for the degradation of Eosin Y (EY) dye i.e., more than 94%. Among three samples Raspberry-like (ZA1) and Nanoflowers (ZA3) exhibit highest photodegradation efficiency due to larger specific surface area than sample Ball-like (ZA2). High specific capacitance value of 494.80, 725.40 and 625.54 F/g (from the CV curves) at scan rates of 5 mV/s and 362.40, 442.40 and 408.00 F/g (from charge-discharge curves) at current density 2 mA/cm2 for ZA1, ZA2 and ZA3 respectively were obtained. Sample ZA2 and ZA3 possess best supercapacitor characteristics i.e. highest specific capacitance as it has smallest crystallite size, maximum pore diameter and high diffusion coefficient among present samples.
