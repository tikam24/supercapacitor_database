The new porous polymer TPDA-1 has been synthesized via solvothermal Schiff base condensation reaction between two organic monomers, i.e., 2,4,6-trihydroxyisophthalaldehyde and 1,3,5-tris(4-aminophenyl)triazine. The TPDA-1 material showed a very high specific capacitance of 469.4 F g-1, at 2 mV s-1 scan rate, together with a high specific surface area of 545 m2 g-1. It also exhibited excellent cyclic stability with 95% retention of its initial specific capacitance after 1000 cycles at 5 A g-1, suggesting its potential as a high performance supercapacitor. Extended Ï€-conjugation and ion conduction inside the micropores throughout the whole polymeric matrix and high BET surface area could be responsible for this high supercapacitor performance in energy storage device. TPDA-1 has been characterized thoroughly by various electrochemical techniques such as cyclic voltammetry, galvanic charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Our experimental results suggested a high potential of this porous polymer in energy storage devices for future generation.
