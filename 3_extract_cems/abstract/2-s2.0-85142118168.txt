This chapter deals with electrodes, the most important part of electrical circuits. With the need of emerging technologies, the upgrading of electrodes are mostly needed which in turn leads us from the ancient electrodes toward the advanced metal oxide electrodes. In this chapter, we will discuss the need, advantages, and classifications of metal oxide electrodes and focused on the crisis, which society will face due to use of fossil fuel electrodes. Recent progress in the field of mesoporous carbon incorporated metal oxide nanomaterials, especially metal oxide nanoparticles confined in ordered mesoporous carbon and 1D metal oxides coated with a layer of mesoporous carbon for high-performance supercapacitor applications, has been presented, not only for technological applications but also for academic interest.
