MOF (metal-organic framework) is an ideal precursor for the synthesis of metal oxides owing to the high porosity and provision of redox sites. This study focused on the formation of NiCo2O4 rod-like nanostructure from Co-MOF by a simple hydrothermal method to overcome disadvantages of MOF such as low electrical conductivity and stability. Noticeably, NiCo2O4 with unique nanostructure could be obtained when the template removed after calcination. It was observed by SEM and TEM, the morphology of NiCo2O4 nanorods with a diameter was about 100 nm. Moreover, the morphology of Co3O4, which converted from MOF after calcination at 350 Â°C was similar to hexahedron. The synthesized rod-like NiCo2O4 electrode delivered specific capacitance of 1376 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g, indicating the excellent charge transfer ability in 6 M KOH solution. Therefore, this study presents a hydrothermal method to prepare the electrode materials based on MOF for supercapacitors effectively.
