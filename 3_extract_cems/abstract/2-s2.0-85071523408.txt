The activated carbon prepared from gasified rice husk carbon by gasification power generation (or RHAC), has been researched as a promising electrode materials for supercapacitors. In this work, we show a simple one-step solvothermal synthesis of flower-like RHAC/NiCo2S4 composite nanomaterials by an in-situ growth. Moreover, the RHAC/NiCo2S4 electrode demonstrates a capacitance of 1680 Fg-1 and 1118.4 Fg-1 at current densities of 1 A g−1 and 12 A g−1, respectively, which has excellent Rate performance. In order to improve the energy density of the supercapacitor, the asymmetric supercapacitors were assembled by a RHAC/NiCo2S4 electrode and RHAC electrode. The asymmetric supercapacitor delivers super great properties with a specific capacitance of 133.3 F g−1 at the current density of 0.2 A g−1 and the energy density of 41.6 Wh Kg−1 at the power density is 150 W kg−1. Furthermore, the energy density was maintained 29.2 Wh Kg−1 at a high power density of 1500 W kg−1, demonstrating superior rate capability. Additionally, the asymmetric supercapacitor also exhibits better cycling stability with 86% capacitance retention at current density of 1 A g−1 after 5000 cycles. In view of environment-friendly and well capacitance, such RHAC/NiCo2S4 electrode would hold a promising application as candidate materials in next-generation high-performance supercapacitor.
