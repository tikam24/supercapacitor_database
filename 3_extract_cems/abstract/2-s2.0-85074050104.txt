Ternary nickel cobaltite(NiCo2O4), as a promising electrode material for supercapacitors, has attracted increasing attention for its excellent electrochemical properties. In this study, novel NiCo2O4 nanosheets were rationally designed and prepared using dealloying process, followed by an oxidation treatment. The as-prepared sample was characterized by microstructural and electrochemical techniques in view of its possible application in supercapacitors. The as-prepared sample exhibited high specific capacitance and excellent durability. The specific capacitance reached 663 F/g at 1 A/g and the rate capacitance high up to 73.6% when the current density increased from 1 A/g to 20 A/g. After 5000 cycles of galvanostatic charge-discharge durability test at 4 A/g, the capacity retention rate was 82.1%. The results indicate that versatile dealloying can be used to prepare robust electrode for supercapacitor application.
