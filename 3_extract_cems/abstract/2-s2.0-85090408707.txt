Mesoporous carbon (N-CMK3) decorated with different amounts of SnO2 nanoparticles was prepared in a controllable manner by using an incipient wetness impregnation technique, followed by a chemical reduction process, for application as a supercapacitor. The results of the analysis demonstrated that the surface area and pore volume of N-CMK3 decorated with SnO2 continued to decrease after impregnation with increasing amounts of SnO2. The results of the electrochemical measurement proved that decoration of N-CMK3 with a suitable amount of SnO2 enhanced the specific capacitance of the electrodes. Among the SnO2@N-CMK3 (SNC) samples under investigation, 15-SNC with 15 wt% SnO2 delivered outstanding electrochemical performance with respect to specific capacitance and cycling stability. At a scan rate of 5 mV s-1, 15-SNC exhibited superspecific capacitance up to 344 F g-1 and long-term cyclability at a scan rate of 50 mV s-1 with 92.4% retention of its initial specific capacitance of 161 F g-1 after 5000 cycles.
