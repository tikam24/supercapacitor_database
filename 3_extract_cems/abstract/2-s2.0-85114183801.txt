Exploring porous electrode materials with designed micro/nano-structures is an effective way to realize high-performance supercapacitors (SCs). A metal-organic framework (MOF) is a porous crystalline material with a periodic structure formed by coordination of metal ions/clusters and organic ligands. Due to the excellent properties (e.g., large specific surface area, high porosity and tailorable structure), MOFs have been widely used in diverse applications. This Frontier article highlights the recent progress in the synthesis of MOF-based micro/nano-structured electrode materials including pristine MOFs, MOF composites and MOF derivatives, and their application in SCs. Furthermore, the challenges of MOF-based electrode materials and possible solutions are also discussed.
