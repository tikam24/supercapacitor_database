A novel acid-resistant gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) is fabricated for improving the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors (SCs) using lignocellulose (LC) membrane as polymer matrices and H2SO4 solution as both plasticizer and conductive ions, in which the LC membrane with a stress of 10.1 MPa and an electrolyte uptake of 1300% is prepared from LC biomass. The prepared GPE (LC-H2SO4) has no obvious change after immersion in 3 m H2SO4 solution for 30 days. The SC assembled with LC-H2SO4 containing 1 m H2SO4 and activated carbon electrodes shows a rate capability of ≈90% retention of initial capacitance when the current density increases from 0.5 to 5 A g−1 and long cycling life of 20 000 cycles with 115% capacitance retention, which is attributed to hemicellulose dissolving in the electrolyte improving interfacial compatibility, and these oxygen-containing functional groups provide partial faradic pseudocapacitance. Furthermore, the flat SC assembled with LC-H2SO4 containing 3 m H2SO4 demonstrates better electrochemical performance than that of flat SCs based on LC-H2SO4 containing 0.5 and 1 m H2SO4. The assembled flat SC can be bent to 180° without affecting its electrochemical performance. Hence, LC-H2SO4 containing higher H2SO4 concentration is a candidate for assembly flexible SCs with excellent electrochemical performance.
