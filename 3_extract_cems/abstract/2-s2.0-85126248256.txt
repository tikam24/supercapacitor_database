Aiming at the problems of negative sequence control and regenerative braking energy recovery of electrified railway, an optimization strategy of negative sequence compensation based on railway power conditioner (RPC) and super-capacitor (SC) system is proposed. The system topology and basic working principle of RPC-SC are introduced. The negative sequence compensation optimization method considering the power flow of energy storage system is analyzed and built. Based on this method, the specific control strategy of RPC-SC is designed. The final test results show that the proposed strategy not only can effectively recover regenerative braking energy, but also have good ability of negative sequence compensation and power factor compensation.
