Human civilization has been relentlessly inspired by the nurturing lessons; nature is teaching us. From birds to airplanes and bullet trains, nature gave us a lot of perspective in aiding the progress and development of countless industries, inventions, transportation, and many more. Not only that nature inspired us in such technological advances but also, nature stimulated the advancement of micro- and nanostructures. Nature-inspired nanoarchitectures have been considered a favorable structure in electrode materials for a wide range of applications. It offers various positive attributes, especially in energy storage applications, such as the formation of hierarchical two-dimensional and three-dimensional interconnected networked structures that benefit the electrodes in terms of high surface area, high porosity and rich surface textural features, and eventually, delivering high capacity and outstanding overall material stability. In this review, we comprehensively assessed and compiled the recent advances in various nature-inspired based on animal- and human-inspired nanostructures used for supercapacitors. This comprehensive review will help researchers to accommodate nature-inspired nanostructures in industrializing energy storage and many other applications. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
