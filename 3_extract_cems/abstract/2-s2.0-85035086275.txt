This paper presents a novel power distribution system (PDS) algorithm to be employed in a hybrid energy storage system (HESS). PDS is responsible for sharing the demand power between energy storage modules, which are battery and ultracapacitor (UC) in this study. The challenge in designing PDS is in assigning the power-share between these modules. A state of available power technique is proposed based on the prediction of the power limitations for a predefined time frame in the future. Another PDS based on the UC state of charge is developed. Various design variables are defined that affect the performance of the PDS. The genetic algorithm optimization technique is employed to determine the design variables. The proposed PDS techniques along with an energy storage system (ESS) consisting of a single battery and a basic PDS system is studied on a 12-kW electric motorcycle during the standard FTP and the New York City Cycle (NYCC) driving cycles. Battery lifetime, vehicle range, and regenerative braking energy recovery functions for the proposed methods compared with the ESS are improved by 2.6 times, 25%, and 29%, respectively. The results suggest that employing the proposed novel PDSs improves the performance of the HESS significantly.
