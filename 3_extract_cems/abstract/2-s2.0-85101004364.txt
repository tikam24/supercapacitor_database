Electrochemical cell for energy storage such as battery and supercapacitor are developing rapidly in recent years. Battery has high specific energy but moderate to low cyclic rate and long recharge time. On the other hand, electrostatic double-layered capacitors (EDLC) is characterized by their extremely fast charge and discharge capability, high power density but relative low energy density. The limitation can be mitigated by having a hybrid of theses energy storage system which is synchronized in accordance to the application. In this work, the characteristics of a EDLC and lead acid battery are characterized and modelled using MATLABÂ®. Subsequently, a hybrid energy system consists of a combination of (EDLC) and battery is studied. From the model, an energy management scheme is implemented by using an embedded system to manage the charge-discharge rate, to ensure it operate within the safety envelope and maximised operation lifespan.
