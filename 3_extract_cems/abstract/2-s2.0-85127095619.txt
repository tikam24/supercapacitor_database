Exploring faster, safer, and more efficient energy storage devices will motivate scientists to develop novel energy storage products with high performance. Herein, we report porous NiO nanoparticles have been prepared by a simple hydrothermal method with CTAB and laboratory tissue paper as a template followed by calcination at three different temperatures (300, 500, and 700◦C). The electrochemical characteristics of the prepared materials were examined in a three-electrode cell configuration using aqueous potassium hydroxide (2.0 M KOH) electrolyte. The NiO-300 electrode displayed the supreme capacitance of 568.7 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. The fascinating NiO morphology demonstrates a crucial part in offering simple ion transport, shortening electron, and ion passage channels and rich energetic spots for electrochemical reactions. Finally, the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC), NiO//AC was constructed using positive and negative electrode materials of NiO-300 and activated carbon (AC), respectively. The assembled ASC displayed excellent supercapacitive performance with a high specific energy (52.4 Wh kg−1 ), specific power (800 W kg−1), and remark-able cycle life. After quick charging (25 s), such supercapacitors in the series will illuminate the light emitting diode for an extended time, suggesting improvements in energy storage, scalable integrated applications, and ensuring business efficacy. This work will lead to a new generation of high-performance ASCs to portable electronic displays and electric automobiles.
