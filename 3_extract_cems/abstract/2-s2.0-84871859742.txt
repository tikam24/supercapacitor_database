Coal-based activated carbon(AC) was prepared from Indonesia lignite by KOH as activator. In order to improve electrochemical properties of AC, the AC was modified by means of soaking in copper nitrate solution and subsequent pyrolysis. The specific surface area and pore distribution of activated carbons before and after modification were studied by nitrogen adsorption at 77 K, the crystallite structure and surface morphology of activated carbons were characterized by SEM and XRD. Moreover, the wettability and electrochemical performance of activated carbon electrodes were researched by contact angle and constant current charge-discharge, cyclic voltammograms, alternating current impedance, respectively. The results indicate that the portion pores of modified AC, especially the micropores, are blocked by the oxides produced from the Cu(NO3)2 decomposition, the specific surface and total pore volume decrease, the rate of mesopores increases. Meanwhile, the oxides loaded on AC by copper nitrate modification not only improves the wettability of AC to electrolyte, but also produces an obvious pseudo-capacitance effect, the specific capacitance of modified AC can be enhanced. Based on this study, the optimum concentration of Cu(NO3)2 solution was 2%, the specific capacitance of modified AC electrode can be reached up to 322 F/g, and the electrochemical performance can be improved.
