Ternary transition metal oxides are promising advanced materials for use as electrode components in electrochemical energy storage systems. However, low electronic/ionic conductivity hinder practical applications. In this study, ternary Mn−Ni−Co oxide nanoparticles were encapsulated in carbon nanosheets, to improve the electrical conductivity and surface area. When tested as supercapacitor electrodes, the materials exhibited specific capacity of 91.2 mAh g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 in 2 M KOH. Moreover, after 3000 cycles the composite achieved a specific capacity of 74.6 mAh g−1 at a current density of 6 A g−1 and high capacitance retention of 96.4 %.
