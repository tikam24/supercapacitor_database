Here, the core-core-shell architectural hybrid electrodes were successfully fabricated by coating of NiO nanosheets on Cu2O nanorod arrays with the help of carbon layers (NiO@C@Cu2O NAs), which was directly grown on Cu foam as battery-like electrode for supercapacitor. Starting from commercial Cu foam, the whole synthesis process mainly involved sequential solution immersion, a carbonization treatment and hydrothermal reaction, all of which were simple and potentially scalable. This core-core-shell hierarchical architecture can not only shorten ion diffusion path and optimize charge transport, but also enhance contact surface area. In addition, the carbon layer as an intermediate layer can shorten the charge transfer distance and protect the structural stability of Cu2O. Moreover, ultrathin nanosheet-like NiO coated on the C@Cu2O backbones can provide more contact area with the electrolyte, which is beneficial for the improvement of areal specific capacitance. Serving as the supercapacitor electrodes, the resulting NiO@C@Cu2O NAs hybrid electrodes exhibited excellent performance, e.g. high specific capacitances of 2.18 F cmâˆ’2, and a superior long-cycle lifetime and high cycling stability (91.5% after 10,000 cycles). Such enhanced NiO@C@Cu2O NAs with core-core-shell hybrid structure are promising battery-like electrode for supercapacitors in future applications.
