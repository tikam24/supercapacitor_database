The Li4Ti5O12 of anode material for the hybrid capacitor was coated using CePO4, M3(PO4)2 (M=Mg, Zn). The capacitance of phosphate coated Li4Ti5O12 was found to be lower than that of Li4Ti5O12, whereas the equivalent series resistance was higher than that of Li4Ti5O12. With an increase in cycle number, the base of cylindrical cell exhibited swelling due to gas generated from the reaction between Li4Ti5O12 and electrolyte. The swelling cycle number of phosphate coated Li4Ti5O12 was higher than that of Li4Ti5O12due to improvement in electrochemical stability. Based on the results, it is proposed that phosphate coating can be employed as a barrier layer to control the gassing reaction by isolating the Li4Ti5O12 particle from electrolyte solution.
