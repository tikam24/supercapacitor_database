The flexible nanocomposite membranes were developed by incorporating the multiwalled carbon nanotubes-silver nanoparticle-sulfonated polyaniline (MWCNTs−Ag-SPANI) nanocomposite in TEOS crosslinked PVA matrix. The physicochemical properties of the resulting ternary nanocomposite membranes were investigated systematically by different techniques. The electrochemical performance of all the nanocomposites was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The nanocomposite containing 1 : 1 weight ratios exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 572.8 F g−1 with energy density of 79.5 Wh kg−1 and power density of 9.9 kW kg−1. A remarkable electrochemical performance of ternary nanocomposite was associated due to the synergistic effect of MWCNTs, SPANI and Ag nanoparticles. Around 83.5 % capacitance retention was found even after 2500 cycles, revealing that nanocomposite exhibited an excellent stability. Considering these superior performances, a micro-supercapacitor device was fabricated from the developed nanocomposite membrane and evaluated its electrochemical performance. The fabricated micro-supercapacitor device showed specific capacitance of 60.95 F g−1, energy density of 7.46 Wh kg−1 and power density of 67.81 W kg−1 at a current density of 5.0 mA g−1. Furthermore, the fabrication method adopted here could be easily applied to large-scale fabrication of flexible light-weight micro-supercapacitor devices.
