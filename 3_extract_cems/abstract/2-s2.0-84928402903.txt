Co(OH)2-graphene composite was prepared through a simultaneous hydrotherma! method. The structure, morphology and electrochemical performance of the obtained samples were systematically investigated by means of X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, cyclic voltammetry measurements showed that the Co(OH)2-graphene electrode material had an excellent electrochemical capacitance.
