In the present study, a novel N-doped carbon nanograss (N[sbnd]CNG) were synthesized from the used baby-diaper absorbent via carbonization under the argon atmosphere and has been applied as an electroactive material for flexible supercapacitor. The synthesized N[sbnd]CNG display a grass-like morphology with an acceptable degree of graphitization. The surface areas and average pore size of N[sbnd]CNG were 183 m2 g−1 and 3.3 nm, respectively. On the basis of good structural ordering with reasonable surface area, the N[sbnd]CNG was coated on a carbon cloth and studied their electrochemical performance toward the supercapacitors. The obtained quasi-rectangular shaped cyclic voltammetry curves indicate good capacitive behavior of the N[sbnd]CNG. The galvanostatic charge-discharge experimental results showed that the specific capacitance of N[sbnd]CNG was 81 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 with capacitance retention of 95% after 10,000 cycles of charge-discharge. The slow decrements of specific capacitance with the increment of current density indicate superior rate capability of synthesized N[sbnd]CNG. These excellent electrochemical performances of the synthesized N[sbnd]CNG from used (waste) baby-diaper extend their potential applications in various nanoelectronics field. To the best of authors knowledge, first time the N[sbnd]CNG synthesized from the garbage-waste and can extend their synthesis in large-scale.
