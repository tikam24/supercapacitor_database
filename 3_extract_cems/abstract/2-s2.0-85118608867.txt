Metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) of silicon is used in this study to fabricate silicon nanowire arrays (SiNWs) of different length. This method was modeled using gene expression programming (GEP), and GEP was optimized using genetic algorithms (GA). The length of SiNWs has been predicted as a function of parameters like Ag nucleation on Si and etching solution parameters. The SiNWs in the experimental test have a minimum length of 1 Î¼m. According to FE-SEM images, SiNWs are uniformly shaped. It could be used to fabricate electrode materials for micro-supercapacitor.
