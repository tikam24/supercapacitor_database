Super-hydrophilic flexible MnOx/carbon nanofibers(MnOx/CNFs) composites were fabricated by electrospinning technique. The nanostructures of MnOx/CNFs were proved by XRD, SEM and TEM measurements. The results confirmed that the composites possessed higher electrochemical capacitance than each individual component as supercapacitor electrode materials. The hybrid nanofibrous electrodes with 40%(mass fraction) manganese acetate(MC-4) exhibits extremely high specific capacitance of 1112.5 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g and superior cycling stability such as high capacitance retention of 93.4% at a current density of 10 A/g over 3000 charge-discharge cycles in a 2 mol/L KOH electrolyte. The enhanced electrochemical performance of the composite electrode originates from the combined effects of the two components as follows: (1) 3D superhydrophilic MnOx/CNFs network over a relatively larger surface area reduces the difusion resistance of the electrolyte into the electrode matrix; (2) the synergistic effect between carbon and MnOx. Carbon layer wrapped around MnOx particles can prevent structural damage to the MnOx during charge/discharge processes and contribute to an increased capacitance of the composite.
