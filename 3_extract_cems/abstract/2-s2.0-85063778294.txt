Here we proposed novel CoMoO4 nanosheets on nickel foam that used as a superior electrode for supercapacitors, with an excellent pseudocapacitive performance. The CoMoO4 nanosheets based electrode provide high values of specific capacitance of 1.12 F/cm2 corresponding to the current densities of 4 mA/cm2. It exhibited good cycling life that the specific capacitance maintained with no decrease during 3000 cycles. Our work can be applied in mass applications of high-capacitance energy-storage supercapacitors.
