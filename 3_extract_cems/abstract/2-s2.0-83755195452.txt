In this work, activated carbon was modified by ammonia water. Cyclic voltammetry and constant current charge-discharge were used to characterize the electrochemical performance of the samples in 1.0 mol/L Et 4NBF 4-PC solution. As a result, optimal conditions for surface modification of activated carbon have been examined as an ammonia solution concentration of 5wt.%. Specific capacitance can be improved significantly by surface modification of carbon materials. The specific capacitance of the carbon modified with 5.0wt.% ammonia water reached 114 F/g at a current density of 3.0 mA/cm 2, which is 14% higher than that of untreated sample. In addition, the modified carbon materials possess excellent power performance.
