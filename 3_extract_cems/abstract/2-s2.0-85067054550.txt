Constructing on-chip microsupercapacitors (MSCs) with an asymmetric structure is the predominant choice for applications in miniaturized electronic devices. However, the complex fabrication methods of electrodes and the assembling process of devices restrict the development of on-chip MSCs. Herein, a planar asymmetric MSC with MnxCo1-x(OH)2 nanosheet arrays as the cathode and Fe3O4 nanoparticles as the anode is fabricated via a facile one-step electrodeposition method combined with microfabrication technology. The planar asymmetric MSC exhibits a wider operation voltage window (up to 1.65 V), a higher capacitance (32 mC cm-2), and a higher energy density (7.78 Î¼W h cm-2) than those of previously reported MSCs with an alkaline aqueous electrolyte. This work demonstrates a model of the excellent combination of material synthesis and device fabrication towards large-scale manufacture of on-chip microdevices.
