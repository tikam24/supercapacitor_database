N-doped hierarchical carbon spheres have been synthesized via a soft template and hydrothermal method using melamine as a nitrogen source. The obtained carbon spheres possess a high nitrogen content and well-developed porosity. These carbon spheres are examined as absorbents for CO2 capture and as electrode materials for supercapacitors. Due to the high nitrogen content and hierarchical pore size distribution, the carbons show high CO2 uptakes of 2.2-4.4 mmol g-1 at 298 K and 1 bar. Furthermore, we observe that the carbon spheres exhibit excellent performance as supercapacitor electrodes with a high specific capacitance of 356 F g-1 at a current density of 0.2 A g-1. These carbon spheres as promising materials will exhibit excellent performance in various fields.
