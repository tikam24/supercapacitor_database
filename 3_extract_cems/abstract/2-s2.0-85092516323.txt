Technical development in electronic devices is frequently stifled by their insufficient capacity and cyclic stability of energy-storage devices. The nano-structured materials have sensational importance for providing novel and optimized combination to overcome exiting boundaries and provide efficient energy storage systems. Metal hydroxide materials with high capacity for pseudo-capacitance properties have grabbed special attention. Lately, the blend of nickel and cobalt hydroxides has been considered as a favorable class of metallic hydroxide materials owing to their comparatively high capacitance and exceptional redox reversibility. The sulfonated carbon nanotube fluid (SCNTF) was prepared by the ion exchange method to be utilized as the exceptional templates due to astonishing specific surface area, ensuring the maximum utilization of the active material. The CoNi-layered double hydroxides (LDHs)/SCNTF core-shell nanocomposite was prepared by the simple solvothermal method. Structural analysis showed that the composite material had the high conductance of carbon materials, the pseudo-capacitance characteristics of metal hydroxides, and porous structure, which facilitates the ion shuttle when the electrolyte reacts with the active material. Electrochemical analysis results showed that CoNi-LDHs/SCNTF had excellent rate performance, reversible charge-discharge properties and cycle stability. It exhibited an extreme specific capacity of 1190.5 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1; whereas specific capacity remained 953.7 F g−1 at the current density was 10 A g−1. In addition, the capacity retention rate after 5000 charge-discharge cycles at a current density of 20 A g−1 was 81.0%. The results indicated that the CoNi-LDHs/SCNTF core-shell nanocomposite material is cost efficient and an effective substitute in energy storage applications.
