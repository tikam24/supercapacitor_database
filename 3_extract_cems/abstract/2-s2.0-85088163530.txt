Performance of electrical energy storage system and life expectancy of components of storage system plays vital role in performance of electric vehicle. Based on desirable electrical characteristics compared to Li ion batteries, Supercapacitor Energy storage system (SCESS) is nowadays involved as basic element in energy storage system of electric vehicle. Among various factors that decide life expectancy of supercapacitors, major attention is gained by voltage imbalance during charging of array of supercapacitors. Various techniques of active voltage balancing are already introduced and implemented in practical applications. To overcome disadvantages and improve efficiency of these techniques, modifications are done in traditional balancing circuits and also new techniques are introduced by researchers in recent years. This paper reviews about recent active voltage balancing techniques for array of supercapacitor energy storage system for various applications.
