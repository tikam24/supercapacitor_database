Mesoporous-Li2MnSiO4 (LMS) having a surface area of 35 (±2) m2 g-1 is produced using a very simple, fast and cost effective urea combustion method for the first time and characterized by X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and surface area analysis. Li2MnSiO4 is crystallized in the orthorhombic phase with space group-Pmn21. The lattice parameters: a = 6.317(10) Å, b = 5.385(9) Å, c = 4.988(8) Å are calculated by the Rietveld method. The urea combustion derived LMS is found to be thermally stable till 600 °C in air and thereafter disintegrates into Li2SiO3 (orthorhombic) and MnO2 (cubic). The presence of a homogeneous mesoporous (<20 nm) framework with a high surface area shows orthorhombic Li2MnSiO4 to be promising as a novel supercapacitor electrode as it delivers a specific capacitance of 175 (±5) F g-1 at 3 mV s-1 in 2 M KOH solution. The supercapacitive performance was further examined by galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling and complimented by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. This journal is
