This paper looks at the performance of interface of multi-cell photovoltaic sources with maximum power point tracking and storage-units. The problems of renewable sources of all powers may be concerned with operating efficiencies and problems of power-storage when produce-power is higher then load-power. This paper proposes concepts of small photovoltaic source to achieve the maximum efficiency and maximum of power yield of photovoltaic modules with using power-buffer units. Various topologies of photovoltaic source with power-buffer are presented, compared, and evaluated. In this paper, will be discussed possibility of using supercapacitors as power-buffer for photovoltaic applications.
