Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) added into polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) films have been used as substrates for successive electrodeposition of MnO2 and carbon nanotube (CNT) layers, forming flexible CNTs-MnO2/rGO-PVDF hybrid films that are suitable for use as supercapacitor electrodes. The hybrid films maintained the high conductivity of rGO nanosheets, high surface-to-volume ratio of CNTs, and large pseudo-capacitance of MnO2 nanosheets, and demonstrated their potential in all-solid-flexible supercapacitors by significantly improving the capacitive behavior of the supercapacitor when assembled into supercapacitor devices. Asymmetric supercapacitors comprised of the CNTs-MnO2/graphene-PVDF hybrid film electrode, Pt sheet electrode, and a 6 M NaOH electrolyte exhibited a working voltage as high as 1.8 V and a high energy density of 49.1 W h kg-1 at a power density of 4.83 kW kg-1. Moreover, the supercapacitors exhibited a specific capacitance of 276.3 F g-1 at a discharge current density of 0.08 A g-1.
