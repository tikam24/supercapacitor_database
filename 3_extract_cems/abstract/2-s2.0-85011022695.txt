In this paper an optimal energy management strategy (EMS) for a hybrid electric bus (HEB) with a dual energy storage systems (ESS) combining batteries (BT) and supercapacitors (SC) is presented. The scenario considers the hybrid operation (engine+ESS), as well as the full electric operation (only ESS). Optimal targets for the proposed EMS are obtained by an optimization process with a multi-objective genetic algorithm (GA). The fitness functions are expressed in economic terms, and the aim is to minimize the daily operating cost of the HEB taking into account the BT and SC degradation approach and the performance fulfillment during bus operation in the zero-emission zone (full electric).
