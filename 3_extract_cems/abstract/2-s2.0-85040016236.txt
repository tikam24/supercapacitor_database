Flexible Cu–O thin films were grown on different metal coated non rigid polyimide substrates by the RF-magnetron sputtering and their microstructure and supercapacitive properties were studied. The Raman and XRD studies confirms the formation of a single Cu2O phase with predominant (111) orientation. Surface topography observations revealed that as the percentage of lattice mismatch of Cu2O lattice and substrate lattice is greater the average grain size tends to decrease. The Cu2O films deposited on Ti-Kapton, Ni-Kapton and Pt-Kapton substrates exhibited maximum specific capacitances of 255, 273 and 350 F g−1 correspondingly at a constant current density of 1 A g−1. The observed maximum specific capacitance for CuxO thin films deposited on Pt-Kapton substrates is due to the lower lattice mismatch, high work function of the metal, availability of (111) planes and highly available active area.
