Recent increase in the growth of devices that store energy, keeping in mind the scarcity of fossil fuels, has facilitated in focusing our attention on rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors. In this regard, the metal vanadium oxides and vanadates have emerged as a promising electrode material. These materials enjoy the possession of high theoretical capacitance, coupled with the existence of multiple redox states, which help in decreasing the activation energy for redox reactions. A detailed investigation and analyses regarding the influence of morphology, which gets formed at the time of synthesis of these materials, on the electrochemical characteristics of the electrode has been presented here. In addition, the prospects and challenges associated with the commercialization of metal vanadium oxides and vanadates have also been discussed.
