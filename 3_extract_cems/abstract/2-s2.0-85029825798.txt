This paper discusses the effect of current collector (stainless steel 316L) corrosion on the performance of electrochemical capacitors operated in aqueous electrolytes. This topic seems to be often neglected in scientific research. The studied electrolytes were 1 M H2SO4, 1 M KI, 1 M Na2SO4, 1 M KOH and 6 M KOH. The corrosion process was investigated by means of selected direct and alternating current techniques. The surface of the current collectors as well as the corrosion products were characterised using scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. Stainless steel 316L in alkaline solutions is characterised by the lowest values of corrosion potentials whereas the potentials in acidic media become the most noble. Our studies show that corrosion potentials increase with decreasing pH value. This phenomenon can be explained with the formation of passive oxide films on the stainless steel current collectors. The passive oxide films are usually thicker and more porous in alkaline solutions than that in the other electrolytes. The processes occurring at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces strongly influence the working parameters of electrochemical capacitors such as voltage, working potentials of single electrodes, self-discharge as well as the internal resistance and cycling stability.
