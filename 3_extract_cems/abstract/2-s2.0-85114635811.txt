Herein, the synergistic effects of hollow nanoarchitecture and high specific surface area of hollow activated carbons (HACs) are reported with the superior supercapacitor (SC) and capacitive deionization (CDI) performance. The center of zeolite imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) is selectively etched to create a hollow cavity as a macropore, and the resulting hollow ZIF-8 (HZIF-8) is carbonized to obtain hollow carbon (HC). The distribution of nanopores is, subsequently, optimized by KOH activation to create more nanopores and significantly increase specific surface area. Indeed, as-prepared hollow activated carbons (HACs) show significant improvement not only in the maximum specific capacitance and desalination capacity but also capacitance retention and mean desalination rates in SC and CDI, respectively. As a result, it is confirmed that well-designed nanoarchitecture and porosity are required to allow efficient diffusion and maximum electrosorption of electrolyte ions.
