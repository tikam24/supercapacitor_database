In this paper, facile and scalable single-walled carbon nanotubes with manganese oxide (SWNT/MnO 2) hybrid films are presented and systematically studied. The hybrid films are synthesized by a modified chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, followed by one-step simple precipitation process and then characterized in 1M tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEABF 4)/propylene carbonate (PC) organic electrolyte. The electrochemical behavior of the SWNT/MnO 2 hybrid films is discussed with regards to specific capacitance, energy density, power capability and cycle life, by means of cyclic voltammetry measurements, electrochemical impedance analysis and galvanostatic charge/discharge analysis. The SWNT/MnO 2 hybrid electrode delivers highest specific capacitance of 150Fg -1, energy density of 70Whkg -1, and power density of 79kWkg -1. It exhibits excellent stability of 98.5% retention at current densities of 50Ag -1 and 2Ag -1, after 15,000 cycles and 1000 cycles, respectively. It also shows ultra-high frequency response with a knee frequency of 2043Hz. The hybrid films are binder-free, robust, with pre-formed electrical pathways and excellent electrode structures for supercapacitor applications. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
