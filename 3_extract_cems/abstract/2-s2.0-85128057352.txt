In this report, structural and electrochemical studies on exfoliated graphite (EG) as electrode material for electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) application are presented. The EG is obtained by activating the milled graphite powder using different wt.% of NaOH followed by thermal activation. The influence of activating agent NaOH on the structural, morphology and electrochemical performance of the EG has been investigated. The exfoliation inculcates more ordered graphitic structure and oxygen-functional groups, which play an important role in the porosity development in the EG. The activating agent NaOH reduces the crystallite size of EG from ∼ 16.50 nm to ∼ 16 nm on increasing its concentration (in wt.%) during activation process. A comparative study of the electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) utilizing the electrodes of synthesized EGs and a liquid electrolyte of NaPF6 has also been demonstrated. The maximum specific capacitanceis obtained as ∼ 4.22F g−1 at 0.5 mA cm−2 current. The work suggests that the EG obtained by this low-cost synthesis method can be a suitable electrode material for EDLC.
