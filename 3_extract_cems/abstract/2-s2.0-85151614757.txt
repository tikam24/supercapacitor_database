Stretchable and wearable energy storage devices are the new era of electronic devices. Stretchable energy storage devices especially supercapacitors have gained widespread attention in the electrochemical research community with the possibilities of biomedical medical monitoring devices, smart textiles, and self-powered electronics for implantable. Moreover, stretchable supercapacitors possess unique properties of low cost, high power density, portability, long-term stability, stretchability, and flexibility developments that have been achieved in the field of wearable and flexible energy storage devices with better performance. This chapter explains the overview of the stretchable supercapacitor, material synthesis, characterization, stretchable working electrode structures, and their combination with polymers, metals, and carbon-based materials and finally highlights the electrochemical performance of stretchable supercapacitors. This chapter concludes by raising the challenges and opportunities as a new development in the supercapacitors so as mark headway toward the stretchable developed supercapacitor conclusions.
