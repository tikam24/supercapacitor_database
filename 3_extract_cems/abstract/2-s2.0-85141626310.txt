In a battery storage based standalone PV system, lifespan of battery is usually short due to irregular charging pattern and frequent deep charging cycles. This project proposes a rule-based control strategy with mean-average filter for standalone LAB and SC. Also, the battery lifetime is estimated using rain-flow counting battery lifetime model to calculate life-cycle cost of proposed HESS included initial cost and replacement cost of LAB and SC. The results highlights that the proposed system effectively extend lead-acid battery lifetime by 14.8% from 3.25 years to 3.73 years. However, this study also reveals that the proposed HESS is 5.36% more expensive than the conventional standalone system lead-acid battery in term of life-cycle cost.
