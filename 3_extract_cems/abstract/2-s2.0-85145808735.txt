Solid electrolytes with a large number of pores can replace liquid electrolytes to effectively avoid liquid leakage as well as undertake electrochemical-mechanical functions. However, the influences of pore structure inside solid electrolytes on load transfer and capacitive nature of corresponding structural supercapacitors are usually contradictory. Here, electrochemical modulation is firstly applied to tune the pore structure of polyacrylic acid (PAA) cement electrolyte to solve the trade-off. Hierarchical network pore structure inside PAA cement electrolyte optimizes to an ideal state with an electrochemical modulation operation voltage of 1 V, achieving synchronous improvements in capacitance (increasing by 90%) and compressive strength (increasing by 20%) of corresponding structural supercapacitor. The important contribution of pore structure inside PAA cement electrolyte to capacitive nature of corresponding structural supercapacitor is introduced through experiments and molecular dynamics simulations. As the porosity, specific surface area and average pore size of pore structure inside PAA cement electrolyte increase to critical values, the capacitance of corresponding structural supercapacitor enhances to the maximum value. These surprising results provide a blueprint for optimizing pore structure inside structural supercapacitor solid electrolyte via electrochemical modulation.
