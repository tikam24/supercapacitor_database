Three dimensional (3D) graphene-based hybrid materials are currently arousing much interest and have found many potential applications in wide fields. 3D graphene can not only provide the framework or the skeleton for immobilization of other nanoscale functional materials, but also facilitate both electron and mass transport during the chemical reactions due to its high electrical conductivity and unique porous structure. Metal, metal oxide and conducting polymer-decorated 3D graphene hybrids with controllable structures exhibit promising performance as electrode materials. Here, various synthesis methods including chemical vapor deposition (CVD), hydrothermal or solvothermal, freeze-drying and self-assembly have been introduced for the fabrication of 3D graphene hybrid materials. The morphology of these hybrids and intensive applications in lithium battery, supercapacitor, catalyst, electromagnetic interference shielding, solar desalination and strain sensors are reviewed. Although great progresses have been made, challenges and future prospects for the development of 3D graphene hybrid are also discussed in the review.
