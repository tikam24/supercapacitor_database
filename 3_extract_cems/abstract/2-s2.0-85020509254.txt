Nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) co-doped carbonaceous materials have been extensively applied in electrocatalysis, fluorescence sensing, and supercapacitor owing to their high conductivity, large surface areas, adjustable porous structures, and fast electron transport. Herein, a N,S co-doped porous honeycomb carbon (N,S-PHCC) with tunable size was successfully synthesized with control over the particle size through the use of a silica template and high-temperature pyrolysis. The obtained material exhibited a large surface area of 880 m2 g−1, and high N, S contents of 11.5 at.% and 3.9 at.%, respectively. The optimized 200-N,S-PHCC-900 system was used as an electrode material for an electrochemical sensor for Pb(II), based on a differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry method. Improved electrical conductivity, excellent sensitivity, a wide linear range (0.75–120 μg L−1), and a low detection limit (0.064 μg L−1, S/N = 3) were observed. The as-fabricated electrochemical sensor could also be used for determination of Pb(II) in tap water, suggesting it has a great promising in practical electroanalysis.
