TiOX-polyaniline (PANI) nano-composite thin films are synthesized using an electrochemical deposition technique for supercapacitor applications. The PANI-TiOXcomposite films show granular porous morphologies along with PANI nanofibers. The electrochemical supercapacitor properties of the PANI and the composite PANI-TiOX films are examined in a 0.5-M LiClO4 electrolyte. The pure PANI film shows a comparatively higher specific capacitance whereas the PANI-TiOX composite films are more stable with high power and energy densities. Negligible capacitance loss is obtained for the PANI-TiOX composite films over 1000 charge-discharge cycles. The composite films show considerably improved power-density and energy-density values of ~31.2 kW/kg and ~35.2 Wh/kg, respectively. Â© 2014 The Korean Physical Society.
