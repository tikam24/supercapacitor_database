Tactile sensors that can simultaneously detect temperature and force are highly desirable for applications in health monitoring and human-machine interface. Rendering such devices the ability to harness energy from ambient environment would make them more sustainable, wearable, and even implantable. Herein, a self-powered flexible tactile sensor is developed on the base of piezoelectrically active solid supercapacitors. By conformally intercalating solid electrolyte into the piezoelectric separator, the as-designed flexible piezoelectrical supercapacitor can not only convert environmental mechanical energy into electricity and charge itself, but also detect static pressure, dynamic pressure, acceleration and even temperature with high sensitivity and wide linear range. These concomitant intelligences make the piezoelectric supercapacitor ideal platform for developing self-powered multifunctional wearable devices.
