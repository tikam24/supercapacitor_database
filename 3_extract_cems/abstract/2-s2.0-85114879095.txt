High electroactivity and good mechanical robustness of electrode materials are essential to deliver excellent electrochemical energy storage performance. Herein, metal–organic frameworks (MOF) derived mixed metal oxides (MMO, ZnO@NiO and Co3O4@NiO) are prepared by a two-step annealing process in air. Zinc-based MOF (ZIF-8) and cobalt-based MOF (ZIF-67) were employed, respectively, as hard templates for the chemical encapsulation of Ni(OH)2 nanostructures by hydrothermal synthesis. The as-prepared ZIF-8@Ni(OH)2 and ZIF-67@Ni(OH)2 were then converted to corresponding MMO through annealing in air. Meanwhile, MOF-derived carbon was preserved in the as-fabricated MMO structure, thus improving the electronic conductivity as well as the mechanical stability of the materials. In virtue of these features, high specific capacitance of 1017 and 744 F·g−1 can be delivered at a current density of 1 A·g−1 for the Co3O4@NiO and ZnO@NiO samples, respectively. In addition, both of the samples have shown excellent cycling performance, which exhibited excellent capacitance retentions of 90.1% and 93.0% after 10,000 cycles for the Co3O4@NiO and ZnO@NiO samples, respectively, demonstrating their very promising use in next-generation pseudocapacitors.
