We report on the development of a facile and rational template-free method to engineer three-dimensional (3D) intact hybrid electrodes for high-performance pseudocapacitance supercapacitor (SC) applications. A unique half-cell scheme with ceria nanoparticles embedded in nickel oxide (i.e., NiO@CeO2) electrode is developed via an in situ solvothermal and annealed methodology. Owing to the hierarchical structure nature of NiO@CeO2 and the conductive 3D foamed nickel (FN) substrate characteristics, the resultant of 3D NiO@CeO2 hybrid electrodes exhibits excellent capacity performance (1250.44 F g-1 at 1 A g-1) with a maximal energy density of 203 W h kg-1 at 2.21 kW kg-1. The enhanced specific capacitance is attributed to the coexisting oxygen vacancies and the nanoscale effect in the developed 3D NiO@CeO2 architecture, facilitating the charge transfer rate between electrodes and electrolyte interfaces with elaborating high electrical conductivity. Moreover, in the 2000 cycles evaluation process, a high-power specific capacitance is demonstrated in the first few cycles of charge and discharge processes with 88% capacitive retention rate, illustrating that the developed electrodes could be considered a primary promising candidate for sustainable energy storage and conversion supercapacitor applications.
