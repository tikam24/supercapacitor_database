A core-shell structure composite, zeolitic imidazolate framework @ cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (ZIF-8@CTAB) was synthesized by CTAB micelle controlling the growth of ZIF-8 in aqueous systems. Direct carbonization of ZIF-8@CTAB at a high temperature produced the nitrogen-doped hierarchically porous carbon (named as PC1000@C). In comparison with the carbonization product of pure ZIF-8 (named as PC1000), PC1000@C possesses the higher specific surface area and two-times larger total pore volume. The results from elemental analysis shows the higher N content in PC1000 sample, while X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy curve-fitting shows the higher quaternary-N content in PC1000@C sample. The hierarchical microporous/mesoporous structure, high surface area and favorable N species in PC1000@C play an active role in catalyzing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The specific capacitance of porous carbon was calculated from the galvanostatic-discharge curve. PC1000@C exhibits a large specific capacitance of 225 F g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1 and still retains 92% of initial capacitance after 1000 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles.
