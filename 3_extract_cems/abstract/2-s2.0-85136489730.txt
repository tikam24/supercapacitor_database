To construct high–energy-density supercapacitors, an electrode material with high conductivity needs to be compounded with an electrode material with high capacitive properties. Herein, NiCo2S4-β-cyclodextrin graphene (CDG) composite material formed by growing NiCo2S4 nanoparticles on graphene oxide (GO) modified with β-Cyclodextrin (β-CD) is reported. The modification of β-CD can tackle the problem of agglomeration of GO and acts as a bridge to increase the binding force between NiCo2S4 nanoparticles and substrates. Combining the benefits of the modified GO and NiCo2S4, the synthesized composite electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical properties of 1325.9 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and rate capability of 55.5% as current density increases from 1 to 7 A g−1. Moreover, the asymmetric device, fabricated with NiCo2S4-β-CDG as the positive electrode and active carbon as the negative electrode, exhibits a maximum energy of 30.72 Wh kg−1 at 1.28 kW kg−1 power density.
