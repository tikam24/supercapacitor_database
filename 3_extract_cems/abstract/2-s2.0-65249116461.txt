Association of wind power producing units, microhydro power plants and energy storage systems can ensure the stability of an islanded week power grid or can increase the penetration of these renewable energy sources into the large power networks. Experimental results presented in the paper demonstrate the effectiveness of this association. The microhydro power plant consists of a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) linked mechanically and electrically (through back-to-back power electronic converters in the rotor circuit) to a permanent-magnet synchronous machine (PMSM). The energy storage device considered is a supercapacitor connected trough a bidirectional DC-DC converter to the DC-link of the hydropower station. This system is associated to a fixed-speed wind generator driven by a squirrel-cage induction machine. Â© 2008 IEEE.
