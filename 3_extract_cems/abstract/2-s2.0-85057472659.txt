Supercapacitors are capable to store relatively high amount of energy comparing to its mass. Growing number of these devices applications requires development of new testing methods. Standard methods of evaluation of supercapacitor parameters, as cycling voltammetry, CV, galvanostatic cycling with potential limitation, GCPL, impedance measurements, require equipment of high cost as potentiostat/galvanostat with high current efficiency. We propose a use of a power amplifier in the circuit of voltage to current converter (current driver) for supercapacitor charging/discharging in controlled conditions. The current driver is controlled by DAC output of DAQ board and voltage of DUT is measured and a control loop is realized by software. In the circuit the DC current method of evaluation of capacitance and equivalent series resistance is used. The DUT is charged and discharged with constant current and capacitance C and equivalent serial resistance ESR are calculated from voltage curves. For test purpose commercially available supercapacitors were measured with different current values. The designed test circuit is a low-cost alternative for professional and semi-professional systems. It gives several advantages as easy control of charging current and possibility of applying various current patterns.
