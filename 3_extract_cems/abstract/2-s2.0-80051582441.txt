Graphene nanoplate-MnO2 composites have been synthesized by oxidising part of the carbon atoms in the framework of graphene nanoplates at ambient temperature. The composites were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). It was found that the oxidation extent of the carbon atoms in the graphene framework in these composites was dependent on the reaction time, which also influenced their microstructure, morphology and electrochemical properties. Compared with MnO2 nanolamellas, the nanocomposite prepared with a reaction time of 3 h reveals better electrochemical properties as a supercapacitor electrode material.
