MoS2 has attracted great attentions as a transition metal sulfide due to its excellent electrical, chemical, mechanical and thermal properties, which has the similar structure of graphite. However, the synthesis of high-qualityMoS2 is still a challenge. MoS2 with specific morphology, a few layers, high active edges and single phase can be prepared by a space-confined method as a novel synthetic strategy. This review summarized the synthesis of MoS2 by different dimensional space-confined methods, In addition, research progress on lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors, photoelectrocatalysis, etc. and future development were also prospected.
