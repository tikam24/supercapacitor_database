Energy storage technologies are developing rapidly, and their application in different industrial sectors is increasing considerably. Electric rail transit systems use energy storage for different applications, including peak demand reduction, voltage regulation, and energy saving through recuperating regenerative braking energy. In this paper, a comprehensive review of supercapacitors and flywheels is presented. Both are compared based on their general characteristics and performances, with a focus on their roles in electric transit systems when used for energy saving, peak demand reduction, and voltage regulation. A cost analysis is also included to provide initial guidelines on the selection of the appropriate technology for a given transit system.
