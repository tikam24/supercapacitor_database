A novel hybrid Barium–Iron sulphide combined with graphene oxide (Ba4Fe2S6-GO) thin film was prepared. The newly synthesized bi-metal composite was synthesized in situ by diethyldithiocarbamate ligand. Deposition of pure BaFe–S and hybrid [BaFe]S-GO on FTO substrate was performed through electron-beam deposition system. The hybrid thin films exhibited enhanced electrical and photocatalytic properties. Characterization was performed by UV–vis spectrophotometry, FTIR, XRD, XPS, SEM-EDX. Direct band gaps 5.48 and 5.8 eV were observed for Ba4Fe2S6-GO and Ba4Fe2S6, respectively, calculated through Tauc's plot. X-ray diffraction revealed anorthic crystal arrangement possessing crystal lattices 9 (a), 6.7 (b) and 24.6 (c) Å. SEM displayed a cloud-like spherical morphology. The energy storage potential of thin film was explored by cyclic voltammetric and linear sweep voltammetric techniques. A specific capacitance of 248 F g−1 presented it as a potential energy storage supercapacitor electrode material. Redox reaction displayed by Ba4Fe2S6-GO electrode exhibited that it is electrochemically active. Thin films were also investigated for their potentiality to remove organic contaminants. Ba4Fe2S6-GO thin films clearly displayed an enhanced photocatalytic activity for the removal of toxic pollutants owing to the presence GO in its structure. The use of films for decontamination presents it to be utilized as a remediation tool.
