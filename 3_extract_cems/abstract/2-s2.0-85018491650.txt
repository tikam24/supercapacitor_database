This paper will present the regenerative braking quantification, design control, and simulation of a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) for an electric vehicle (EV) in extreme conditions. The EV is driven by two 30-kW permanent magnet synchronous motors. The HESS contains a Li-Ion battery and ultracapacitor (UC) storage element sources as well as a dissipative resistor. The UC will be mainly involved in braking and traction modes. The role of the resistor is to protect the dc bus and the battery according to the voltage and current constraints. The sizing of the elements takes into consideration the extreme braking conditions of the vehicle while respecting the Economic Commission for Europe Regulation No. 13 Harmonized. Controllers are being used in order to regulate the various electrical variables of the overall system. A sequential logic controller is also being introduced. The role of the sequential logic controller is to activate the different existing regulation controllers and to ensure the switching between the storage elements depending on the system states. Simulation tests will be performed covering a wide operation range for variable braking load, according to vehicle speed and road type, and extreme braking conditions.
