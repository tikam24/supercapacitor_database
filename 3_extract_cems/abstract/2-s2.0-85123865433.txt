The aqueous zinc-ion capacitors (ZICs) have the special superiority that the conventional lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and supercapacitors cannot compare. Herein, we use biomass hyacinth bean to be carbon source to obtain 3D porous structure material CHB by a facile way. The so-obtained CHB is used as the cathode to assemble to ZICs, which exhibits good electrochemical performances with the specific capacity of 85.3 mAh g−1 and energy density of 76.8 Wh kg−1, as well as good stability. The as-prepared ZICs have the potential to be applied in energy storage for safety transportation.
