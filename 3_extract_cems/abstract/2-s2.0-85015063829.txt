A simple and facile silver mirror reaction is introduced to wrap MoS2 nanosheets with highly conductive Ag. With the assistance of Ag, the electron transfer ability of the MoS2 matrix is enhanced, leading to outstanding electrochemical storage ability. The influence of Ag content is also investigated. It is found that the optimized mole ratio of Ag: MoS2 is 1: 8, resulting in the maximal specific capacitance of 980 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. Moreover, the cycling stability is also very good with a high retention of 97% for 5000 cycles. Therefore, the obtained Ag@MoS2 hybrid shows potential applications in the supercapacitors. The current strategy also paves a way for the design and optimization of MoS2-based materials for other applications in lithium battery, electrochemical and photo-electrochemical catalysts.
