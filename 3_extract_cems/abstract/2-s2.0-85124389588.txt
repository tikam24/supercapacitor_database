Nanostructured hybrids of Co9S8 and polypyrrole (PPy) were grown on carbon cloth (CC) for battery-type supercapacitor electrode. Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) was first self-assembled on CC, which was further hydrothermally converted to Co9S8. After electrodeposition of PPy on the surface of CC/Co9S8, the electrochemical performances of the CC/Co9S8/PPy were greatly enhanced. After 2500 cycles of charge/discharge, the capacity retention can remain 83.5%. The high cyclic stability of the CC/Co9S8/PPy might be due to the buffered volume change of Co9S8 during the redox process by the introduction of PPy shell.
