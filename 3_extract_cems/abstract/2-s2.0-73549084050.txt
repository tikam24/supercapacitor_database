An electrosynthesis process of hydrophilic polyaniline nanofiber electrode for electrochemical supercapacitor is described. The TGA-DTA study showed polyaniline thermally stable up to 323 K. Polyaniline nanofibers exhibit amorphous nature as confirmed from XRD study. Smooth interconnected fibers having diameter between 120-125 nm and length typically ranges between 400-500 nm observed from SEM and TEM analysis. Contact angle measurement indicated hydrophilic nature of polyaniline fibers. Optical study revealed the presence of direct band gap with energy 2.52 eV. The Hall effect measurement showed room temperature resistivity ∼3 × 10-4 Ω cm and Hall mobility 549.35 cm-2V-1 s-1. The supercapacitive performance of nanofibrous polyaniline film tested in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte and showed highest specific capacitance of 861 F g-1 at the voltage scan rate of 10 mV/s. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.
