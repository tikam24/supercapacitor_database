The fractional derivative method is considered as a possible formalism for the non-destructive insulation diagnosis by polarization and depolarization current measurements. The underlying motive is based on non-Debye relaxation processes clearly observed in long-time relaxation experiments with oil-paper, electrolytic and ultra-capacitors, transformers and other systems. Modes of relaxation at different time scales depend on charging prehistory and are sensitive to the state of a system. Fractional formalism provides useful parameters characterizing the state of the insulation system, which can be extracted from polarization-depolarization current measurements. Adequacy of the technique is examined by comparison of theoretical and experimental results for oil-paper, and ultra-capacitors.
