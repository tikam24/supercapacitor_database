Flexible energy storage devices are becoming significantly important to power wearable and portable devices that monitor physiological parameters for many biomedical applications. Many hybrid nanomaterials based on 2D materials are used in order to improve the performance of flexible energy storage devices. Here, a hybrid nanocomposite is synthesized through in situ polymerization of aniline in the presence of black phosphorus (BP) nanoflakes. This nanocomposite, polyaniline (PANI)@BP, is employed to fabricate flexible supercapacitor (FSC) electrodes. PANI@BP FSCs can provide a power source for biometric devices. The generated signal can be transmitted to a smartphone in real time via wireless communication. Such a compact and lightweight integrated device has been used to track a human heart beat while powered by PANI@BP FSC. These findings are providing a promising example of a flexible energy storage device that can be integrated with different real-time health monitoring devices.
