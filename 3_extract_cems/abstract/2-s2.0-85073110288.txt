This paper presents a health prognosis model for supercapacitors considering the aging conditions. The proposed model uses the particle filter to predict the posterior values of the aging indicators, i.e., capacitance and resistance. Unlike other prognosis methods, the proposed model predicts the RUL considering the aging conditions such as temperature and voltage. In order to validate the proposed method, experiments have been carried out under different aging conditions. Results highlight the effectiveness of the approach in predicting capacitance and resistance, and the RUL for different initial conditions.
