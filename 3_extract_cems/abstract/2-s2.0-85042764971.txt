Polyaniline (PANI) and polypyrrole (PPy) are conducting polymers used widely in Supercapacitor applications because of their facile synthesis, low cost, and good pseudo-capacitive performance. In this study, PANI and PPy were combined with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) to form a new 3D hybrid aerogel, poly(aniline‑co‑pyrrole)/graphene aerogel (PGA), which was assessed as a promising material for supercapacitor electrodes. A one-step hydrothermal co-assembly method was adopted to synthesize the active electrode materials. The PGA exhibited a high specific capacitance of 675 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g with excellent cycling stability (97.5% capacitance retention and near 100% coulombic efficiency after 1000 charge/discharge cycles).
