Patterning of metals, alloys, and conducting oxides is vitally important for many industrial applications pertaining to many technological devices. In this report, we have used the metal anion alkyl ammonium complex (M-TOABr) as a single-source precursor to obtain thin films as well as micro (μ)-patterns of bimetals (Au-Pd, Au-Pt, Au-Cu, and Pt-Pd) and conducting oxides (ITO). This complex can be easily filled inside the soft mold and converted to the desired material in a single step known as direct patterning. The as-obtained μ-pattern comprises a well-connected network of nanocrystals giving rise to metallic conductivity. These periodically aligned bimetals and transparent conducting oxide (TCO) microwires could effectively serve as electrodes as well as an electrocatalyst with the prudence of providing passage for light transmission for many functional photoelectrochemical devices. In addition, the electrochemical stability of the bimetallic film was examined by fabricating a supercapacitor device and by studying its performance.
