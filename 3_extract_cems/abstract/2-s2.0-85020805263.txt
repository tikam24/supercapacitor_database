A new type of atom-thin carbon nanomesh clusters (CMCs) is prepared through a self-sacrificial and morphology-reserved thermal transformation of electrodeposited zinc coordination polymer (Zn-CP). Such a unique structure can effectively inhibit the sheet stacking due to the self-formed cluster morphology of Zn-CP. The clusters are composed of nitrogen-doped, continuous, interconnected, one-/two-atom-thick carbon nanosheets, which not only effectively inhibit the sheet stacking but also significantly benefit ion transport. As a result, as active electrode material of supercapacitor in aqueous electrolytes, the resultant nitrogen-doped CMC (N-CMC) yields a capacitance of up to 984 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and excellent cycling stability with 137% of its initial capacitance after 40 000 cycles, both higher than most of reported graphene-based and carbon-based electrode materials. On the other hand, the final N-doped CMC also exhibits superior electrocatalytic activities for oxygen reduction reaction.
