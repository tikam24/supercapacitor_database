Coordination Supramolecular Networks (CSNs) is attracting more and more attention in the energy storage field because of its numerous merits such as dynamic structural reversibility and porosity. In this work, a binder-free electrode of CSN (copper hexacyanoferrate, CuHCF) nanosheet array on carbon cloth (CC@CuHCF) has been fabricated by in-situ conversion strategy. The initial CuO nanosheets can be converted to CuHCF hierarchical structure by competitive coordination reactions between the [Fe(CN)6]−3 and 1,3,5-Benzenetricarboxylic acid (H3BTC). Benefitting from the good dynamic structural reversibility of CSNs, large ionic channels in the CuHCF lattice and hierarchical structure of CC@CuHCF, the electrode delivers a high areal capacitance/capacity of 1441.4 mF cm−2/1441.4 mC cm−2, superior rate capability (∼75% of its initial capacitance/capacity when the current densities increased from 2 to 30 mA cm−2) and good cycling performance (∼87% retention after 2000 cycles at 30 mA cm−2). An asymmetric supercapacitor assembled with CC@CuHCF as positive electrode and activated carbon as negative electrode (CC@CuHCF//AC) exhibits a high energy density of 78.8 μW h cm−2, further demonstrating its application potential. This nanosheet's strategy may provide a guideline for fabricating high active electrodes of energy storage from traditional bulk coordination supramolecular networks.
