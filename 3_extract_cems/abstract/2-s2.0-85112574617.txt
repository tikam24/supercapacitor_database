As the demand for alternative energy sources grows, new electrode materials for electrochemical supercapacitors are being developed. Heteroatom doped rGO sheets have attracted much attention in recent time. S and N doped rGO was prepared at various temperatures by a simple and low cost hydrothermal method in the present work. The successful formation of S and N doped rGO sheets is confirmed by structural characterization of prepared samples. The EDX and BET surface analysis shows the optimum doping of S and N and the highest surface area in SNrGO-140 sample, respectively. The electrochemical profile study shows that the SNrGO-140 has the maximum specific capacitance value of 332.5 F/g at a scan rate of 10 mV/s. The result observed suggested that S and N doped rGO prepared at 140 Â°C is the suitable electrode material to be used in high energy electrochemical supercapacitors.
