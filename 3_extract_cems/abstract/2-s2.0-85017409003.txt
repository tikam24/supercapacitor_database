The ionic conductive polymer electrolytes are composed of polymer and organic or inorganic salts. The polymeric property of polymer electrolytes gives it advantages over liquid electrolytes in terms of being leak-proof and having size and shape flexibility and processability. Polymer electrolytes are substi tuted for the liquid ele ctrolytes in new generation energy devices such as batteries, fuel cells and super capacitors. Biopolymers have become important in studies on polymer electrolytes. Among the biopolymers, polysaccharides have good potential as hosts for ionic conduction since they can be found in abundance, are cheap and eco-friendly. Chitosan and cellulose are examples. Conductivities of 10-4 to 10-3 Scm-1 could be achieved in chitosan- and cellulose-based electrolytes. This chapter reviews the state-of-the-art application of chitosan, cellulose and their derivatives in lithium batteries, supercapacitors, fuel cells and dye- sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). A lithium ion cell employing hexanoyl chitosan is found to have a nominal voltage of 3.69 V and a discharge capacity of 108.8 mAhg-1 at 2 mA discharge current. The use of chitosan incorporated with 1-ethyl-3- methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMImBF4) ionic liquid in a supercapacitor has shown enhanced discharge capacitance of 130 F g-1 and better rate performance compared to that using only liquid EMImBF4. Current density of 20-400 mA cm-2 and power density of 4-200 mW cm-2 are reported for chitosan-based fuel cells. The use of phthaloyl chitosan in DSSCs resulted in short circuit current, JSC, between 9 and 13 mA cm-2, open circuit voltage, VOC, between 0.5 and 0.6 V and energy conversion efficiency, n, as high as 5%. The performances of the devices employing biopolymers and their derivatives are quite encouraging. Further studies are needed to improve electrolytic performance and thus device performance.
