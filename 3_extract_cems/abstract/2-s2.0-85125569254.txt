Harvesting heat from the low-grade heat (below 100 °C) into electricity has the signification to enhance the utilization of energy and lower carbon emissions by a simple device. Herein we demonstrate a thermally chargeable ammonium ion capacitor (TAIC) by employing graphene-polyimide (rGO-PI) synthesized through polycondensation of 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride and ethylenediamine as cold electrode, N-doped hollow carbon nanofibers as hot electrode to directly convert waste heat into electricity. Combining thermodiffusion effect of electrolyte with thermogalvanic effect of a redox couple (−C=O/−C−O−NH4+), as-assembled TAIC can deliver a high output voltage of 624 mV, power density of 82 μW cm−2 and average Seebeck coefficient of 9.07 mV K−1 at temperature difference of 45 K. Meanwhile, with the introduction of polyacrylamide-polyacrylic acid-based gel electrolyte, the assembled flexible device can well serve in various bending states, and the power density can attain a satisfying value of 1.92 μW cm−2. This quasi-solid-state TAIC shows great potential as one promising candidate for high value-added conversion from low-grade heat into electricity as well as wearable applications.
