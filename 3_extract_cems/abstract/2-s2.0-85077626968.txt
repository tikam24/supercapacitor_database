In this work, core-shell NiMoO4@MoS2 nanorods were successfully fabricated via a facile two-step hydrothermal method. By inheriting the merits of high electrical conductivity from MoS2 nanosheets and high pseudocapacitive activity from NiMoO4 nanorods, the hierarchical NiMoO4@MoS2 nanocomposite was endowed with improved electrical conductivity, enlarged specific surface area and enriched porosity, consequently enabling fast ion/electron transport and rapid Faradaic reactivity. Benefited from the synergism of NiMoO4 and MoS2, the NiMoO4@MoS2 electrode was superior to the NiMoO4 and MoS2 electrode, achieving specific capacitance of 2246.7 F g−1, as well as showing good rate performance and improved cyclic stability (88.4% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles). The asymmetric supercapacitor device composed of the NiMoO4@MoS2 nanorods and hierarchical porous carbon exhibited a high energy density of 47.5 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 0.44 kW kg−1. The device also showed superior long-term cycling stability, retaining 80.2% of initial capacitance after 10 000 cycles. This work provides a simple strategy for scalable synthesis of integrated nanostructures, which holds great promise for the development of advanced supercapacitors.
