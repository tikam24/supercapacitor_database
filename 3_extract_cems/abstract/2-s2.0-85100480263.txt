In this study, BiPO4 nanostructures were synthesized at 200 C via a simple hydrothermal technique. The structure and morphology of the synthesized sample were studied using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM), respectively. FTIR and Raman spectroscopy also confirmed the pure phase formation of a synthesized sample. FESEM analysis reveals the morphology of the synthesized samples is like rectangular nanoplatelets and also confirms that the synthesize sample is in the nanometer range. EDAX and elemental mapping was also performed of the synthesized sample. The electrochemical properties of the as-prepared sample were studied by galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement in three-electrode system with 4 M KOH solution as an electrolyte. The investigation revealed that assynthesized BiPO4 nanostructures can be utilized as an electrode material for supercapacitor applications, providing sustainable and economic benefits.
