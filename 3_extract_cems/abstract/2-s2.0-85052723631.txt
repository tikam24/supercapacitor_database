Bimetallic carbides with high activity and stability are promising potential materials for energy-storage application. However, the researches about Fe2MoC as electrode material on supercapacitors are comparatively weak, and the processing methods of Fe2MoC were also relatively few. Herein, a simple hydrothermal method, combining with carbothermic treatment at 900 Â°C, is explored to fabricate molybdenum iron carbon (Fe2MoC) successfully. Chitosan is not only a carbon source, but also a chelating agent to form bimetallic carbide rather than two separated monometallic carbide during the high-temperature treatment. Fe2MoC nanoparticles possessing large specific surface, high activity, stability and small resistance were the promising candidate for electrode material. Systematic electrochemical characterizations have verified the Fe2MoC (chitosan as carbon source) possesses a specific capacitance (97.7 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g), high rate capability (97.0% capacitance retention from 0.5 to 10 A/g) and cycling stability (83.9% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles) in 1 M KOH. In addition, it offers the energy density of 6.74 Wh/kg at a power density of 21 kW/kg. In view of the low-cost and excellent performance, Fe2MoC will hold great promise in energy-storage field for supercapacitors.
