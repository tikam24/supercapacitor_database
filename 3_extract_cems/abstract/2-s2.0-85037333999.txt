Different Ni 3 S 2 nanostructures have been successfully synthesized at different temperatures by a facile and efficient solvothermal method. The Ni 3 S 2 nanostructures with three-dimensional (3D) nanosheets array and silkworm eggs-like morphologies were obtained by adjusting the reaction temperature. A large number of 3D nanosheets are interconnected to form an open network structure with porous of Ni 3 S 2 at 180 °C, and electrochemical tests showed that the special structure exhibited the outstanding specific capacitance (1357 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 ) and excellent cycling stability (maintained 91% after 3000 cycles). In comparison, the performance of Ni 3 S 2 silkworm eggs-like structure is not very perfect. This may be due to the fact that the 3D nanosheets with porous structure can improve the electrochemical performance by shortening effectively the diffusion path of electrolyte ions and increasing the active sites during charging and discharging. Among them, the reaction temperature is the main factor to control the formation of the 3D nanosheets array. These results indicated the Ni 3 S 2 nanosheets promising applications as high-performance supercapacitor electrode materials.
