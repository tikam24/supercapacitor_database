Supercapacitors are efficient and developing energy storage devices. The main focus of this work was on the preparation of reduced graphene oxide supported boron nitride doped-nickel hydroxide [rGO/BN/Ni(OH)2] nanocomposites through a hydrothermal approach, for studying their electrochemical behaviour and specific capacitance by fabricating supercapacitor devices. Pristine BN, BN/Ni(OH)2and rGO/Ni(OH)2nanocomposites were also prepared and their use as supercapacitor electrode materials was studied. The structural and morphological properties were characterized using various analytical tools. SEM images showed a spherical shape with a marigold flower-like morphology. The electrochemical behaviour was studied using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques. The specific capacitances of rGO/BN/Ni(OH)2in 0.5 M KOH, 1 M KOH, 3 M KOH, and 6 M KOH were 349, 297 F g−1, 143 F g−1, and 94 F g−1, respectively. It was observed that the capacitance increased with a decrease in the electrolyte concentration and the maximum specific capacitance was noted in 0.5 M KOH. Also, a significant increase in energy density and power density in 0.5 M KOH was observed. These results demonstrate that rGO/BN/Ni(OH)2nanocomposites are a promising electrode material for high-performance energy storage devices.
