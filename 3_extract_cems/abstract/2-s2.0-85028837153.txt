A key issue of real-time applications is ensuring the operation by taking into account the stability constraints. For multisource vehicles, stability is impacted by the multisource interactions. Backstepping control ensures stable control for most classes of nonlinear systems. Nevertheless, no backstepping control in real time has been yet proposed for multisource vehicles. The objective of this paper is to apply the backstepping control to a multisource vehicle with fuel cell and supercapacitors for real-time implementation. A distribution criterion is used to allocate energy between sources. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed backstepping control can be implemented in real-time conditions. The supercapacitors can thus help the fuel cell to meet the requirements of the load with a guarantee of system stability.
