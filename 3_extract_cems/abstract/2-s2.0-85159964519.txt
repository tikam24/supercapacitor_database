The powder carbonaceous material（JPC）was obtained by pre-carbonizing Jujun grass at low temperature，and then activated with different proportions of KOH at different temperatures，amorphous carbon material （JPCK1）with microporous and mesoporous distribution was obtained. The specific surface area of the synthesized carbon JPCK1-900-4X is up to 3368 m2/g，with large pore volume and 0.95%（atomic percent）nitrogen content. Electrochemical tests showed that JPCK1-900-4X has good energy storage potential in supercapacitor applications. When the current density is 0.5 A/g，the specific capacitance is 311.7 F/g，and when the current density is increased to 10 A/g，the specific capacitance is 230 F/g. After 5000 cycles of charging and discharging at the current density of 10 A/g，the capacitance retention rate is 97.5%，which indicates that it has good stability. In the two-electrode system，when the power density is 250 W/kg，the energy density can reach 17.7 W·h/kg.
