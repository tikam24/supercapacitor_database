Unified Power Quality Conditioner (UPQC) is a versatile conditioning device to improve the perturbances in the power network. Here executed the performance of fuel cell-battery-integrated UPQC with supercapacitor to mitigate the power problems for unbalanced loads. The given method clarifies how best the integrated system works whenever sudden disturbances occurred in the system. The system is the mixture of a DC-to-DC converter fed by a fuel cell unit along with battery worked as the supplementary power device at the DC link to meet the conditions at the suitable point. A proper control mechanism is utilized for observing the system conditions, and it is implemented with MATLAB.
