Defect engineering is one of the main ways to adjust the internal structure and electrochemical performance of materials. Therefore, we prepared MnO2 ultra-thin nanosheets loading on Ni foam as a supercapacitor electrode through hydrothermal process and vacuum annealing, which not only obtained oxygen defects on the surface, but also led to a shift in the valence of Mn4+ to Mn3+. The results indicate that the optimal electrode can achieve high specific capacitance of 522.5 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g and excellent cycling performance of 95.24% at 5000 cycles. Then, we assembled an asymmetric supercapacitor using the sample annealed for 45 min as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode in the 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte to investigate the practical application. The asymmetric supercapacitor with a large voltage window of 0â€“2 V and an energy density of 18.06 Wh/kg at a power density of 1 kW/kg with a promising electrochemical stability was assembled. This article provides a simple method to improve electrochemical performance of transition metal oxide electrodes in supercapacitors by introducing defects.
