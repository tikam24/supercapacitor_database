Mesoporous manganese oxides (MnO2) microspheres were synthesized by the first chemical deposition of manganese carbonate (MnCO3) precursors at room temperature and followed by the low-temperature calcinations under 300,350 and 400 °C. The obtained MnO2 materials exhibit the Akhtenskite type MnO2 crystalline microstructures and the microspherical morphologies with the diameter of about 1 μm. The as-synthesized MnO2 microspheres under 300 ° C exhibit the largest specific area (240.5 m2 g-1 ) and the optimal mesopore volume (0.231 cm3 g-1 ) than the other two samples under 350 and 400°C (111.4, 106.3 m2 g-1 ; 0.055, 0.021 cm3 g-1 ), which contribute to the optimal electrochemical performances for supercapacitors. Moreover, the as-synthesized MnO2 microspheres under 300 ° C possess the highest tap density (1.156g cm-3) than the other two samples (1.126,1.043 g cm -3), leading to the more feasibility for practical applications in supercapacitors. The as-fabricated MnO2 electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance (129 F g-1 at 0.25 Ag-1 ) and high-rate capability (68 F g-1 at 4 Ag-1). The as-assembled activated carbon (AC)//MnO2 hybrid capacitor exhibits a wide working voltage (1.8 V), high power and energy densities (2197W kg -1 and 12.8Wh kg-1 at 4Ag-1), excellent cycling behavior (94.3% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 1 Ag-1), and excellent capacitance recovery performances under different rates (0.25-4 A g-1) for tested 4500 cycles, indicating the promising prospective of the easily fabricated mesoporous MnO2 microspheres for practical applications in supercapacitors. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
