Cross-linked polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) electrolyte membranes have been synthesized by using a solution casting method. In this study, PVA was blended with oxidative cross-linked agent (zinc acetate) and nano-sized silica as filler to stabilize PVA matrix and enhance conductivity. The cross-linked membranes were immersed into lithium hydroxide (LiOH) aqueous solution to increase their ionic conductivity. Two techniques were used to characterize the resulted membranes including Fourier transform infra red (FTIR) and AC impedance spectroscopies. The results showed that absorption peaks of C-O-C group and Si-O-Si are presence in the FTIR spectra attributed to the cross-linking process. Impedance spectra indicated that the contribution of ionic dopant (LiOH) to enhance conductivity is insignificant. The highest conductivity of the studied cross-linked PVA membrane is 1.34×10-3Scm-1 corresponding to 5% LiOH dopant concentration of cross-linked PVA-zinc acetate-nano silica membrane. The present study also suggested that the solution casting is appropriate for cross-linked membrane synthesis. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.
