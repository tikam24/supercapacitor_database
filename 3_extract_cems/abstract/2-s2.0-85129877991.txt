CaMoO4 nanoparticles/graphene oxide (CaMoO4/GO) composites are prepared by a facile hydrothermal method. CaMoO4 nanoparticles are adsorbed on the GO sheets by in situ reduction. Along with the synergistic effect between the CaMoO4 and GO sheets, the CaMoO4/GO nanocomposites exhibited high performances as electrodes for supercapacitors. The specific capacity (Qs) of the CaMoO4/GO electrodes could be up to 571.82Fg-1 at 0.5Ag-1. Furthermore, asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) are mainly composed of CaMoO4/GO composite and activated carbon (AC), respectively. The fabricated CaMoO4/GO//AC devices display an energy density of 25.18Whkg-1 at 1710.3Wkg-1. A blue LED is powered using two series-connected two ASC devices. These results indicate the considerable potential of CaMoO4/GO for use in high-performance energy storage devices.
