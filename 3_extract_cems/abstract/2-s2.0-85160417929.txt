Cellulose aerogels were fabricated from the corn stalks-derived cellulose with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) as a binding agent. The aerogel structure was constructed via the freeze-drying method and then carbon aerogels (CA) were obtained via carbonization under inert gas at 700 °C. The results showed that the CA has an amorphous structure with high porosity (> 96%). Therewithal, the adsorption capacity of the CA materials was evaluated with ciprofloxacin, a persistent antibiotic. As a consequence, it is indicated that CA1 with the precursors' ratio of cellulose:PVA (5:1) performs the highest adsorption efficiency with a maximum capacity of 99.01 mg/g. The process was determined to be chemical adsorption following the Langmuir isotherm model with the investigated initial concentration in the range of 25 − 100 mg/L for ciprofloxacin. Moreover, the electrochemical properties were determined through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and galvanostatic charge-discharge. Resultantly, the highest capacity reached 326.51 F/g at the scanning rate of 0.005 in the potential region of -0.5 to 0.5 V, corresponding to the CA3 sample with the cellulose:PVA ratio of 15:1. Furthermore, after 1000 continuous scanning cycles, the CA3 shows insignificant changes in the GCD curve, which depicts high stability as a supercapacitor. Besides, the safety of the prepared CA in energy storage application was also confirmed via the insignificant inhibitory performance on two strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The aforementioned results reveal that the CA from corn stalks is potentially applicable in environmental remediation and suitable material in supercapacitors for energy storage.
