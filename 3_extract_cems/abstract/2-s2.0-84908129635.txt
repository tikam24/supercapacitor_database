A layered structural Zn-doped Ni-MOF was synthesized and, for the first time, used as an electrode material for a supercapacitor. It exhibited large specific capacitance, high rate capability and good cycling stability. Capacitances of 1620 and 854 F g-1 can be achieved at rates of 0.25 and 10 A g-1, respectively. Simultaneously, the retention was maintained at over 91% even after 3000 cycles. These values demonstrated the best performance of all the MOF materials in supercapacitor at present. Such an excellent electrochemical property may be attributed to the intrinsic characteristics of Zn-doped Ni-MOF material including its crystal structure and morphology.
