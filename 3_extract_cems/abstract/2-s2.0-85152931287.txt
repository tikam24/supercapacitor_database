In this work, we grow CNTs on electrochemical exfoliation graphene with few FeCo(G-CNTs-FeCo) by hydrothermal as a new supercapacitors electrode. It has excellent specific capacitance (560.26 F/g at 1 mV/s) and low charge transfer resistance (30.79 Î©). The supercapacitor electrode exhibits better electron conductivity and electrochemical performance than pure graphene which was found to combine the merit of graphene, CNTs and FeCo metals. This paper would help to provide a method to improve graphene SCs performance.
