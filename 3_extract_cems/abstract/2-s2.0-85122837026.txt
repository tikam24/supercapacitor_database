In recent days the green approach of preparing reduced graphene oxide using plant extracts has attracted more attention among the research fraternity over the orthodox way of using chemicals. The green approach carries advantages like low cost and environmentally friendly nature. Here in this study, the reduction of graphene oxide is carried out using Phyllanthus Emblica, commonly known as amla. This fruit is grown in almost every part of the country, and is rich in vitamin C (478.56 mg/100 mL). The advantage of using Vitamin C is, it is composed of only carbon, oxygen and hydrogen. Thus minimizing the risk of introducing heteroatoms in the reduced graphene oxide. Also here we have employed a binder-free electrode for supercapacitor application. It is capable of delivering specific capacitance of 123.12 Fg-1 at the scan rate of 5 mVs-1. The characterization techniques performed here on the sample are powder X-ray diffraction technique, FTIR spectra and Raman spectra which give clear information on the reduction of graphene oxide. The morphology is studied by SEM images. Electrochemical studies include cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charging-discharging and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. All these studies illustrate that effective results are obtained from the green synthesis of reduced graphene oxide using Phyllanthus Emblica and it is an efficient and environmentally friendly method.
