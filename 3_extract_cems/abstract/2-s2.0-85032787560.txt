The bimetallic sulfides of Co1.5Ni1.5S4 flower-like nanosheets have been successfully synthesized on Ni foam via one-step electrodeposition method and used as electrode for high-performance supercapacitance. The effect of raw materials proportion on the electrochemical performance of the products was systematically investigated. Results showed that when the ratio of CoCl2 and NiCl2 was 11, the resultant Co1.5Ni1.5S4 flower-like nanosheets have formed, which demonstrated higher specific capacitance than Co9S8, NiCo2S4 and CoNi2S4, and showed good rate capability. All-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor device was fabricated using the Co1.5Ni1.5S4 flower-like nanosheets and active carbon as electrodes. The device retained 91 % of its original specific capacitance after 1000 charge-discharge cycles at a current density of 5 A g-1, which demonstrated that the long-term cycling stability of Co1.5Ni1.5S4 flower-like nanosheets are outstanding. These excellent properties can be mainly attributed to the unique architecture with large surface area and interspaces. The device in series could light a red LED indicator. Our strategy provides a remarkable way to fabricate all-solid-state energy storage devices for various applications including wearable microelectronics.
