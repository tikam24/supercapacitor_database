Brushless DC(BLDC) motors are well known for their reliability, efficiency and lifespan which suits many applications in automobile, aerospace, robotics, precision machine tool, industrial and household applications. Regenerative braking of BLDC motor can be done efficiently by making use of Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) for Electric vehicle(EV) applications. A new regenerative braking system is proposed for BLDCM driven electric vehicles with HESS. During regenerative braking, the voltage across the dc link is boosted and the energy thus produced is transferred to supercapacitor through a class-C chopper. The energy saved during regenerative braking can be utilized to improve the vehicles driving range and acceleration. Performance of the proposed hybrid energy storage system, BLDC fed electric vehicle is evaluated in MATLAB-Simulink platform. Results confirm the performance improvement of the drive during regenerative braking.
