Molybdenum diselenide-based composite has been considered a potential material in the supercapacitor application due to its variable oxidation states, high surface area, and electronic conductivity. This report presents the composite formation of molybdenum diselenide nanoflowers and iron oxide-hydroxide nanorods utilizing a hydrothermal route assisted by room temperature chemical blending technique. The symmetric cell designed based on prepared composite material delivers the specific capacitance of 132 F g−1 for 1 A g−1 for a 1 V voltage. It shows 100% capacitance retention for 3000 cycles and 100% coulombic efficiency for 10,000 cycles at 1 A g−1. It provides an energy density of 18.3 Wh kg−1 at 1174 W kg−1 power density. The practical application associated with the designed symmetric cell based on the composite electrode was confirmed via the illumination of the panel comprising 42 red LEDs for 10 min effortlessly without break. Additionally, a self-proposed charge mechanism has been incorporated for an enhanced understanding of the reader. The improved results indicate the point that the prepared electrode material has good capability for high-performance supercapacitors.
