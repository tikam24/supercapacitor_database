A facile and quick route for the chemical reduction of graphene oxide (GO) using In powder as a reductant has been established. The reduction of GO by In powder is traced by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, and the obtained reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is analyzed. The In3+ ions produced during the reaction between the GO and the In powder are chemically transformed to In 2O3 and then form In2O3/rGO hybrids. The In2O3/rGO hybrids are used as electrode materials and their electrochemical performance are studied using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge. The In2O3/rGO hybrids demonstrate excellent electrochemical performance and their highest specific capacitance is 178.8 F g-1 which is much higher than that of either In2O3 or rGO. In addition, the In2O 3/rGO hybrids are also very stable. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
