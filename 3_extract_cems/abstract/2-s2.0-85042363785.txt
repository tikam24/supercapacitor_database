The orientation construction of S and N dual-doped discoid-like graphene (labeled as SNDG) is achieved by regular arrangement of the polycyclic aromatics in pitch molecules using natural diatomites as templates. The superior electrochemical energy storage ability of SNDG is demonstrated by cathode and anode tests, respectively. The synergistic effects of the robust scaffold coupled with the hollow structure, unique porous structure, the excellent structural stability and the dual-doping of S and N lead to the electrode property enhancement in terms of rate capability and durability. The Li ion hybrid capacitor using SNDG as both anode and cathode, presents excellent long-term cycling stability and markedly energy and power densities (up to 143 Wh kg −1 and 13,548 W kg −1 ). This work provides a novel pathway to realize the mass production of high-rate electrode materials via the high value-added utilization of pitch.
