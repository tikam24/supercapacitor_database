Wire-shaped micro-supercapacitor and micro-battery: Aligned multi-walled carbon nanotube fibers and composite fibers have been easily twisted to produce both wire-shaped supercapacitors and lithium ion batteries with high performances. The energy densities achieved 92.84 and 35.74 mWh/cm3 while the power densities could reach 3.87 and 2.43 W/cm3 during the charge and discharge process, respectively. The unique structure enables promising applications in various fields, e.g., these wires can be easily integrated into electronic textiles by a conventional weaving technique.
