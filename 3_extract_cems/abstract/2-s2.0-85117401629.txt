In the present work, Copper cobaltites (CuCo2O4) were efficiently developed by the CTAB-assisted sonochemical process succeeded by calcination at 350 °C for 3 h. The differential scanning calorimetric analysis results showed that all the reactions ended at 300 °C. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction results established the formation of spinel CuCo2O4/CuO. The morphological analytic results exposed that CuCo2O4 possesses both the nanorods and nanoparticles structure. Furthermore, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronopotentiometric (CP) methods were used to evaluate the electrochemical properties of various CuCo2O4 formed. It is observed that the freshly prepared CuCo2O4 electrodes exhibit a very high specific capacitance of 811 Fg−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 and also demonstrates superior cycling stability retaining 91% of the initial capacitance even after 3000 continuous CV cycles. Hence, typical CuCo2O4 could be considered as an important electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
