The ground hybrid energy storage system (HESS) can effectively improve the utilization of regenerative braking energy in the traction power supply system of urban rail transit. In this paper, based on the traditional double closed-loop control strategy, the adaptive adjustment strategy of charge and discharge threshold based on fuzzy logic control (FLC) was proposed. The proposed strategy can solve the problem of the poor regenerative braking energy recovery effect in the energy storage system caused by the fluctuation of no-load voltage and the change of headway under the traditional fixed threshold strategy. In addition, according to the differences in power density, energy density and price between batteries and supercapacitors, this paper proposed a HESS sizing strategy considering energy saving rate to optimize the comprehensive economic benefits. The objective function of sizing including battery/supercapacitor life cycle cost and substation power consumption cost was then established. Taking the actual line conditions of Beijing Batong Line as a case, the parallel genetic algorithm (GA) was used to optimize the objective, and the influence of the energy saving rate constraints on sizing results was analyzed. Meanwhile, the proposed adaptive adjustment strategy of charge and discharge threshold was verified by simulation and a 1MW hybrid energy storage prototype at Liyuan Station of Beijing Batong Line.
