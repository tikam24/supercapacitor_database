A mixed metal-organic framework (MOF(Ni, Co)) was synthesized through a simple one-pot solvothermal method, and was characterized through X-ray diffraction, FT-IR, scanning electron microscope, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and N2 adsorption-desorption. The performance of the samples as supercapacitor electrode materials was further studied for the first time. The unique nano-flower-like structure of MOF(Ni1.2 Co0.8 ) provides more electro-active sites and a shorter pathway for electron transfer and electrolyte diffusion, resulting in an excellent electro-chemical performance with a high specific capacitance of 850 F·g-1 at 1 A·g-1 . At the same time, this work shows that the MOF(Ni) electrode material doped with an appropriate amount of Co can facilitate the electron/ion transpor-tation of the electrode, reduce the contact resistance between active material and electrolyte, increase the electrical conductivity, and enhance the electrochemical performance.
