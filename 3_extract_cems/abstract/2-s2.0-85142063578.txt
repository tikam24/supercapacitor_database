In this paper, an optimal sizing for a battery-supercapacitor (SC) Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) for an Electric Vehicle (EV) is proposed. In particular, the aim of the work is the system weight and volume minimization. Two power-split strategies are considered, respectively based on a low-pass filter and on a moving average filter. The sizing results are validated by carrying out simulations in Matlab/Simulink environment and the SoC, current and voltage trends of the sources composing the HESS are evaluated.
