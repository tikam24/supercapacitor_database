The technology development of supercapacitor is in the progress to meet the strong demands for increasing specific energy and reducing cost. We present a hybrid supercapacitor that integrated rice husk based activated carbon (RHC) with LiMn2O4. The electrochemical investigations revealed that the specific energy of the hybrid supercapacitor (LiMn2O4/RHC) has reached up to 29.5 W h kg-1, and the energy retention is 81.2% over 10 000 cycles at 0.3 AÂ·g-1 charge/discharge current. The excellent double layer electrical storage of the RHC is mainly attributed to its high specific surface area of 2516 m2 g-1 and the average pore diameter of 3.02.
