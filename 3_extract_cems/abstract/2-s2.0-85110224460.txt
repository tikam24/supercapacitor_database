The filtering device is a vital component of electronic goods that rectifies ripples which occur upon converting alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) and attenuates high-frequency noise during switching or voltage declines. Classical filtering devices suffer from low performance metrics and are bulky, limiting their use in modern electronic devices. The fabrication process of electrode materials for high-frequency symmetric supercapacitor (HFSSC) is complicated, hindering commercialization. Herein, for the first time, the design of a high-performance stand-alone carbyne film comprised of sp/sp2-hybridized carbon as an electrode for AC filtering under a wide frequency range is reported. The carbyne film as HFSSC shows the ideal capacitive behavior at ultrahigh scan rate of 10 000 V s−1 with excellent linearity which is top among the reported AC line filter capacitor. The carbyne HFSSC exhibits a high energy density of 703.25 µF V2 cm−2 at 120 Hz, which is superior to that of current commercial electrolytic filters and many reported AC line supercapacitors. As a proof of concept, a carbyne device is implemented in a real time AC to DC adaptor that demonstrates excellent filtering performance at high frequencies.
