This manuscript presents the methodology of the production of 2D and 3D graphene based material, and their applications in fuel cell, supercapacitor, and photovoltic in recent years. Due to the uniqueness and attractive properties of graphene nanosheets, a large number of techniques have been developed for raw graphene preparation, from a chemical method to a physical deposition of carbon vapor under extreme conditions. A variety of graphene based materials were also prepared from raw graphene or graphene oxide, including the metal loaded, metal oxides loaded, to the foreign elements doped graphene. Both two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) structured graphene were covered. These materials included the bulk or template hybrid composite, containing graphene hydrogel, graphene aerogel, or graphene foam and its derived products. They were widely used in green energy device research, which exhibited strong activity, and developed some special usage in recent research.
