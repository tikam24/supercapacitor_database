The polyaniline particles doped with TSNa is successfully synthesized by oxidization and then characterized. Its electro-chemical properties are also studied. The results indicate that this doped polyaniline has special structure with hierarchy, its cyclic voltammetry curve maintains an ideal rectangle, and the potential and time curve also maintains good linearity in the whole potential range of charge/dischage cycles. The maximum specific capacitance can reach 283.7 F/g.
