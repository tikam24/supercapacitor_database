The environmental stability of a solid silicotungstic acid (SiWA)-H 3PO4-poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) electrolyte in electrochemical supercapacitor (EC) applications was improved by the incorporation of nano-SiO2. Under ambient conditions, enhanced water retention and improved stability were observed for the electrolyte with SiO 2 compared to the electrolyte without SiO2. Due to the strengthening in bond interaction between SiO2 and water molecules, the electrolyte with SiO2 exhibited a more consistent proton conductivity than the one without SiO2. In addition, a cross-linking effect of SiO 2 on the PVA polymer was observed as a secondary function. The performance of the SiO2-containing electrolyte was evaluated in a planar double layer EC. The thin solid EC demonstrated high rate capability of 5,000 Vs-1 in cyclic voltammograms with good environmental stability and excellent cycle life (up to 100,000 cycles demonstrated).
