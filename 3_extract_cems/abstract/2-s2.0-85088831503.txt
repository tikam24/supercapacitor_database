For practical supercapacitors, recent advances in electrolytes have diminished long-standing problems such chemical stability, low ionic conductivity and limited electrochemical performance. Herewith, we communicate a facile method to produce anhydrous redox-active Bio-inspired electrolytes for flexible supercapacitors with application over a broad temperature range. The glycerol (Gly) gel electrolyte consists of various fractions of potassium hydroxide (KOH) and redox active unit, i.e., ammonium molybdate, (NH4)2MoO4 (abbreviated as Mo), in the anhydrous state. The doped glycerol matrix acts as a framework that provides a stable gel electrolyte, forming hierarchical pathway for ion diffusion. The developed gel network with Gly-KOH-MoX (X = 3, 5, 10, and 15%, w/w) provides an effective route to carry the ions onto the pores of the electrodes. The supercapacitor with Gly-KOH5-Mo10 gel provides a specific capacitance of 328 F g−1, and the same device achieved an energy density of 45.6 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 497 W kg−1. In addition, the supercapacitor maintained extraordinary cyclic robustness and wide temperature tolerance. Thus, the low cost and environmentally benign, cyclic durability of Gly-KOH-Mo makes these gel electrolytes a potential candidate for use in various energy storage devices.
