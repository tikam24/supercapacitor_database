Pyrolysis of cobalt (Co)-based metal-organic frameworks (MOF) was used to synthesize Co3O4@N-doped C composites. The hierarchical porous structure of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-67) was synthesized using a triethylamine-assisted method in water and room temperature. ZIF-67 was used as a precursor for the synthesis of Co3O4@N-doped C. The material was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM), and X-ray photoelectron microscope (XPS). The carbon content and hierarchical porous structure of ZIF-67 enhanced the electron and ion transport. As a result of these advantages, the Co3O4@N-doped C electrode demonstrated improved capacitive performance, with a high specific capacitance of 709 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and a reasonable rate capability after 5000 cycles. The simple synthesis procedure and the high electrochemical performance enable promising electroactive materials for supercapacitors using MOF-derived materials.
