Iron oxide (Fe3O4)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) nanocomposite films with varying iron weight percentages were prepared by electrospinning spray method on glass, aluminium foil and Si (100) substrate. The size of Fe3O4/rGO/PVP composite particles varied between 0.75 and 1.35 μm on the surface of the graphene sheet. The diffraction peaks at 36.77°, 47.06°, 52.98° and 61.34° confirmed the plane (311), (400), (422) and (440) of the Fe3O4 crystal lattice, respectively. The broad peaks around 26.6° and 43.47° correspond to the planes (002) and (102) for the rGO sheet in the Fe3O4/rGO/PVP nanocomposite films. The defect parameter, ID/IG ratio varied from 0.17 to 0.34 with 15 and 25wt% Fe3O4 content, respectively, indicates the decreasing of defects in the Fe3O4/rGO/PVP network. The minimum value of Ecorr and Icorr are 0.18 V and 4.76 μA, respectively.
