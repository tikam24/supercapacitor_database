In this work, a facile two-step strategy had been developed to synthesize carbon coated manganese oxide for the fabrication of high performance supercapacitor. First, MnO 2 nanoflakes were synthesized on Ni foam by a simple chemical deposition method. Then a thin layer of alginate sodium (NaAlg) coated the nanoflakes by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) and was calcined to carbon, which could increase the conductivity and prevent the crystal from dissolving. As a result, the carbon coated manganese oxide displayed an enhanced capacitance of 412 F g −1 at a current density of 1 A g −1 and the capacitance retention maintained 95.7% after 10,000 cycles of charge/discharge, indicating that the binder-free process provided low internal resistance and reversible charge storage behavior.
