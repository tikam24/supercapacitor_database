This paper presents the development and the experimental validation of a dynamic model of a Hybridized Energy Storage System (HESS) consisting of a lead acid (PbA) battery and double layer capacitors (DLCs), intended for automotive applications. The dynamic modeling of both the PbA battery and the DLC is performed using an equivalent electric circuit approach, which is the best suited for our application. An identification experiment is designed for each device; the PbA battery parameters are estimated at different state of charge (SOC) levels and for the two possible directions of the current. By contrast, the DLC parameters are supposed to be insensitive to those variables, yet they are estimated at different temperatures. The model of the HESS is obtained as the parallel connection of the two models; since our study involves a passive HESS, there is no power electronic interface between the two devices. The outputs of the combined model are the system voltage and the currents owing in the PbA battery and in the DLC module. A validation experiment is performed on a real HESS, aiming to reproduce the operation of the system in a vehicle equipped with the Start&Stop technology. Good agreement is found between the outputs predicted by the model and the corresponding measurements. The model is suitable for exploring the positive effects of the battery hybridization, for instance the impact of Start&Stop on the battery aging.
