A combined cyclic voltammetry and pulse reverse potential electrodeposition technique has been used to synthesize carbon-free Ni/NiO nanocomposite thin film supercapacitor electrode. The structural and morphological analyses have revealed the presence of crystalline phases of both Ni and NiO in the form of nanospheres of size ~50 nm. The electrochemical analysis of the Ni/NiOna nocomposite electrode has shown a remarkable performance by delivering a high specific capacitance of 2000 Fg−1 at an applied current load of 1 Ag−1 and a capacitance retention of 98.6%, after over 800 cycles under a high current load of 20 Ag−1 .
