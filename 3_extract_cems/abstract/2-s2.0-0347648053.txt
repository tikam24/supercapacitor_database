Mesoporous nickel electrodes have been electrodeposited by reduction of a nickel (II) solution dissolved within the aqueous domains of the hexagonal (HI) lyotropic liquid crystalline phases of Brif Â® 56 non-ionic surfactant. The nanostrutctured films consist of well ordered, periodic arrays of channels disposed on a hexagonal lattice with nanometer-sized dimensions. Cyclic voltammetry has shown these materials to have high surface areas (typically surface area enhancements of 100 times over non-templated electrodes) and a pore structure that allows extremely rapid diffusion of species to active sites within the structure. These characteristics suggest application as a low cost current collector and use in high power devices.
