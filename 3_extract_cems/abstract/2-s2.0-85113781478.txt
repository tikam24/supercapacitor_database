In this manuscript, the composite materials of MnO2-GO have elaborated the fabrication process of a supercapacitor. The nanocomposite materials of MnO2-GO are greatly deposited on the Stainless Steel (SS) substrate using the electrochemical deposition method. The composite of graphene oxide assisted by needle-like MnO2 nanocrystals (GOMnO2 nanocomposites) was fabricated using a simple soft chemical path. Intercalation and adsorption of manganese ions onto the GO sheets, followed by nucleation and growth of the crystal species. The potential of a supercapacitor to cycle and store energy was investigated using Galvano-static Charge Discharge and Cyclic- Voltammetry (CV). As a result, the composite MnO2-GO supercapacitor possesses better electrochemical capacitance. The chemical reaction between GO and MnO2 was found to improve the electrochemical efficiency of as-prepared nanocomposites. This process enables the deposit of MnO2 nanoparticles onto graphene oxide sheets (single layer of graphite oxide) in a simple and clear manner, and it can be easily applied to the preparation of other types of hybrids based on GO sheets for technical applications.
