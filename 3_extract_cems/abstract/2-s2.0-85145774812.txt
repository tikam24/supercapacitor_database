Herein, a unique synthetic approach called microemulsion is used to create nickel nanoparticles (Ni-NPs). SEM, TEM, EDX, and XRD techniques were employed for the investigation of morphology and structures of the synthesized material. Electrons from electroactive components are transferred to external circuits by Ni-NPsâ€™ superior electrical conductivity and interconnected nanostructures, which also provide a large number of channels for ion diffusion and additional active sites. The experimental findings showed that as a positive electrode for supercapacitors (SC), Ni-NPs had an outstanding ability to store charge, with a dominant capacitive charge storage of 72.4% when measured at 10 mV/s. Furthermore, at 1 A/g, Ni-NP electrodes exhibit a maximum capacitance of 730 F/g. Further, the Ni-NP electrode retains 92.4% of its capacitance even for 5000 cycles, highlighting possible applications for it in the developing field of renewable energy. The current study provides a new method for producing high-rate next-generation electrodes for supercapacitors.
