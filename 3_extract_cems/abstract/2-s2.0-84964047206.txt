This paper adopts frequency conversion principle to perform the energy harvesting from the electric field of overhead power line. An energy harvesting circuit is designed to charge the supercapacitor. The load impedance is a capacitive and non-linear load, and the load impedance changes in the charging process. In order to achieve maximum output power transmission, a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) circuit with low-power consumption is designed, which uses a 32.768 kHz quartz crystal to form a square wave oscillating circuit. Because the capacitor voltage cannot change suddenly, the current feedback MPPT system is constructed through controlling the switch turn-on time with the charging current. The MPPT circuit is tested at an operating current of 1.2uA, an operating voltage of 5V, and a power consumption of 6uW. Experiment results show that the charging voltage across the energy storing supercapacitor is 0.32V, and the output power reaches a maximum value of 18uW at the charging time of 36min. Compared with the direct charging circuit, the energy harvesting efficiency of the MPPT circuit increases by 50%.
