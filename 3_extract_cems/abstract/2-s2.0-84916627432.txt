A wireless tram which runs without catenary and instead uses batteries installed in the tram has been recently researched actively. This paper presents a new method maximizing absorption of regenerative energy of a wireless tram and extending life cycle of the energy storage device in the wireless tram by applying line-optimized charging and discharging scenario. Energy efficiency and life cycle of energy storage system (ESS) are highly dependent on the characteristic of operating conditions. For example, frequent charge and discharge with high power cause the problems that decrease the battery life cycles. Hybrid energy storage system (HESS) is combination of two ESSs which have complementary characteristics to each other. HESS can provide even better functionality and performance than the battery only ESS due to the synergy effect of two ESSs. This paper also provides a power distribution strategy and driving scenarios which increase the life cycle and energy efficiency of the HESS consisting of a battery and an ultra-capacitor. The developed strategy was tested and verified by a hardware-in-the-loop-simulation (HILS) system which emulates the a wireless tram.
