The aluminum foil collectors were respectively etched by electrochemical and chemical method. The effect of etching time on specific surface area and apparent morphology of aluminum foil was studied, and the effect of the current collector made with aluminum foil for different etching time on supercapacitor's specific capacitance and equivalent series resistance was also researched. Performance of supercapacitor made by aluminum foil etched by two etching methods under the optimal etching time were studied and compared by AC impedance, cyclic voltammetry and so on. The results show that the optimal etching time of electrochemical etching and chemical etching are 60 and 80 s respectively, the specific capacitance of supercapacitor prepared under the optimal etching time are 154.4 and 165.2 F/g, and the equivalent series resistance are 1.8 and 1.4 Î©. Aluminum foil etched by chemical method can obtain better surface corrosion condition, and the supercapacitor prepared with aluminum foil etched by chemical method can get smaller equivalent series resistance and bigger specific capacitance. The attenuation of specific capacitance of supercapacitor prepared by aluminum foil etched by two etching methods are all less than 0.7% after 2 000 cycles operation and the cycle performances are all very good.
