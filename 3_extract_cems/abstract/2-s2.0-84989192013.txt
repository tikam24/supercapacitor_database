We reported a rational design of branched NiCo2O4@NiMoO4 nanofilm core/shell arrays on Ni foam by two steps of facile hydrothermal processing for the first time, and Ni foam was directly utilized for supercapacitive investigation. The supercapacitor based on NiCo2O4@NiMoO4 nanofilm core/shell arrays yielded outstanding electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance of 6.29 F cm−2 at a current density of 5 mA cm−2 and 3.58 F cm−2 at 100 mA cm−2. Moreover, the hybrid electrode exhibit an excellent cycling stability (87% areal capacitance retention after 5000 charge-discharge cycles). Such remarkably electrochemical performance implied that this 3D honeycomb-like structure electrode could be a promising candidate for supercapacitors.
