A novel nano-composite of polyaniline/mesoporous carbon (PANI/CMK-3) was prepared with mesoporous carbon (CMK-3) serving as the support. Electrochemical asymmetric capacitors have been successfully designed by using PANI/CMK-3 composite and CMK-3 as positive and negative electrode, respectively. The results showed that the discharge capacity of the asymmetric capacitor could reach 87.4F/g under the current density of 5mA/cm2 and cell voltage of 1.4V. The energy density of the asymmetric capacitor was up to 23.8Wh/kg with a power density of 206W/kg. Furthermore, PANI/CMK-3-CMK-3 asymmetric capacitor using this PANI/CMK-3 nano-composite could be activated quickly and possess high charge-discharge efficiency. Â© 2010 Ling Bin Kong.
