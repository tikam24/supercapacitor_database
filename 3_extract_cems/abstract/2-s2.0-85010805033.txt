Epoxy based adhesive polymer electrolyte was prepared using polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiTFS), and epoxy. The ionic conductivity can reach the magnitude of 10-2 S cm-1. All-solid-state structural supercapacitor with K 3Fe(CN)6K4Fe(CN)6 mediators was fabricated. Electrochemical tests and mechanical tests were conducted on the structural supercapacitor. The specific energy is 1-5 Wh kg-1 while the specific power is 9-0.03 kW kg-1. The stress-strain curves show typical mechanical behavior of fiber-reinforced polymer composite materials. The structural supercapacitor stacks fabricated using carbon cloth have higher toughness than the structural supercapacitor stacks fabricated using carbon paper.
