Graphene has recently gained much interest in applications such as energy storage, catalysis and gas sensing. In terms of energy storage, micro supercapacitor has attracted a lot of interest in fields such as bioMEMS, biomedical implants such as cardiac pacemaker and the promising field of powering small electronic devices. In this paper, the structure of the micro supercapacitor PECVD graphene on electrodes consists of SiO2 substrate, graphene on Nickel (Ni) electrodes, with Polypyrrole (Ppy), graphene and Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) layers. To improve performance, graphene is one of the more promising material being investigated for micro supercapacitor electrodes due to several advantages such as high specific surface area and high electron mobility. Graphene was then grown on the Ni electrodes using the Plasma- Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) process. The graphene growth structure on the interdigital electrodes of micro supercapacitor was characterized by Raman Spectroscopy, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), Energy Dispersive X-Ray (EDX) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). A Raman spectrum of graphene growth on interdigital electrode has identified three peaks which are the D band, G band and 2D band. The broad peaks at 1340 cm-1 and 1580 cm-1 correspond to the D and G bands, respectively.
