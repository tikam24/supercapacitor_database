This paper proposes a new circuit configuration of an energy storage system, consisting of EDLC and its inverters connected in series to main motor windings and utilizing the overvoltage durability of traction motors. Our proposed system enables improved performance of the powering and the regenerative braking at the ever high speed region, without increasing traction motor current.
