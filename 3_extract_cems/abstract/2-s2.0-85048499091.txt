Different ultra capacitor models have been proposed in the last decade. These models seek to replicate the real behavior of the ultra capacitor in some applications. But, how fit these models real measures provided by manufacturers? This paper mentioned standards and methods for ultra capacitor modeling. Afterwards, models that have been presented in the literature are depicted. This work presents evidence of how some of these models do not comply with the characteristics set provided by the manufacturer or, in some cases;they replicate only the behavior of the normal capacitor.
