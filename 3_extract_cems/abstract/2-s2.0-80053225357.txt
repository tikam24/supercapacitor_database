Self-assembled graphene organogel (SGO) with 3-dimensional (3D) macrostructure was prepared by solvothermal reduction of a graphene oxide (GO) dispersion in propylene carbonate (PC). This SGO was used as an electrode material for fabricating supercapacitors with a PC electrolyte. The supercapacitor can be operated in a wide voltage range of 0-3 V and exhibits a high specific capacitance of 140 F g-1 at a discharge current density of 1 A g-1. Furthermore, it can still keep a specific capacitance of 90 F g-1 at a high current density of 30 A g-1. The maximum energy density of the SGO based supercapacitor was tested to be 43.5 Wh kg-1, and this value is higher than those of the graphene based supercapacitors with aqueous or PC electrolytes reported previously. Furthermore, at a high discharge current density of 30 A g-1, the energy and power densities of the supercapacitor were measured to be 15.4 Wh kg-1 and 16300 W kg-1, respectively. These results indicate that the supercapacitor has a high specific capacitance and power density, and excellent rate capability. Â© 2011 the Owner Societies.
