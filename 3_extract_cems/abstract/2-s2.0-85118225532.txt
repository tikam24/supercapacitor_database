Increasing requirements for wearable devices stimulate the development of flexible energy storage components. Herein, a flexible integrated electrode consisting of SnS2 nanosheet arrays in situ anchored on the functionalized carbon cloth was prepared via a facile one-step hydrothermal method. Through pretreatment of carbon cloth, rough morphology is appeared on the surface of carbon fiber, which is conducive to optimizing the accessible load of SnS2. The SnS2 nanosheet arrays and the carbon fiber as conductive skeleton cooperate with each other to provide a highly open surface, leading to the enhancement in capacitance (194.4 mF cm-2) and the outstanding retention after long-term service (86.5% after 10 000 cycles). A quasi-solid-state asymmetric flexible supercapacitor was assembled to evaluate the practical application under various conditions, suggesting satisfactory electrochemical performance as a maximum energy density of 10.95 Î¼Wh cm-2 at the power density of 4.75 mW cm-2 and mechanical stability under actual conditions.
