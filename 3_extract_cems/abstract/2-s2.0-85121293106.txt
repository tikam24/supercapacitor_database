The development of high-performance energy storage systems will address the pollution and energy demand problems. The main component in the presently available supercapacitor device is carbon. However, supercapacitor grade carbon availability, cost, and energy density problems must be addressed in the carbon-based system. In this work, readily available, reusable, and cheaper carbon collected from the used carbon water filter and its heat-treated, chemically activated carbons are used as electroactive materials. The carbon is amorphous, microporous, thermally stable up to 510 °C, having a high specific surface area, carbon-chain contains carbonyl group. This carbon in symmetric supercapacitor shows both behaviors of electrochemical double-layer capacitor and pseudocapacitor. Specific capacitance value (F g−1) increases in the order carbon (165) < calcinated carbon (191) < chemically treated carbon (252) at 1 A g−1. The cell shows a retention capacitance of 98% at 10,000 cycles at 2 A g−1. Even at a higher current density of 5 A g−1, gives 87% retention at 15,000. Cell also shows good rate capability, Ragone plot behavior, phase angle (84°). Three cells connected in a series glow LED bulb. Thus, this reusable carbon could be considered an efficient electrode in an aqueous-based supercapacitor cell for commercial applications.
