Demand increasing for next generation portable and miniaturized electronics has aroused much interest to explore microscale and lightweight energy storage devices. Herein, we demonstrate successful development of flexible wire-shaped micro-supercapacitors (micro-SCs) based on novel CoNi2S4/E-NZP film@Cu wire electrode. The etched Ni-Zn-P (E-NZP) film was synthesized by directly deposition of NZP film on Cu wire, followed by a chemical etching process. Alkaline etching treatment provides a micro- and mesoporous structure with high surface area and facilitates the penetration of electrolyte ions into the electrode matrix. Then, CoNi2S4 nanosheets as electroactive material are electrochemically grown onto the E-NZP film@CW electrode under a constant potential. The synergistic effects contributed by various components inside the CoNi2S4/E-NZP@CW electrode deliver superior performances with a high specific capacitance of 1.12 F cm-1, 8.9 F cm-2, and 889.68 F cm-3 at 4 mA cm-2, outstanding rate capability (0.66 F cm-1, 5.3 F cm-2, and 529.02 F cm-3 at 80 mA cm-2) and long-term cycling stability (93.4% capacitance retention after 7000 cycles). Moreover, a flexible solid-state asymmetric micro-SC is fabricated using CoNi2S4/E-NZP film @CW as the positive electrode and rGO-coated carbon fiber (rGO/CF) as the negative electrode. The fabricated device exhibits high length, areal and volumetric capacitances of CL: 40 mF cm-1, CA: 0.241 F cm-2 and CV: 18.54 F cm-3, good mechanical stability with a maximum energy (EL, 18 μW h cm-1 EA, 108.4 μW h cm-2 and EV, 8.34 mW h cm-3), and power densities (PL, 1454 μW cm-1 PA, 9280 μW cm-2 and PV, 716.9 mW cm-3). This work provides a new and facile approach to develop high-performance wire-shaped electrodes as a new generation in energy storage applications.
