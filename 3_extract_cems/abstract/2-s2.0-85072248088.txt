Mesoporous NiCo2S4 rod-like nanostructures were controllably fabricated through a facile and mild one-step chemical reduction method. For the mesoporous structure and high electrical conductivity nanomaterials, it is advantageous to transfer and transport electrons, which can significantly enhance electrochemical performance as an electrode of supercapacitor. Its capacitance is up to 1130 F g-1 at the current density of 0.4 A gâˆ’1. The excellent electrochemical performance of the mesoporous NiCo2S4 nanorods implies that it has a promising application in candidate electrode materials for the supercapacitor of energy storage.
