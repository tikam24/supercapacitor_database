Development of all-organic aqueous energy storage devices (ESDs) is a promising pathway towards meeting the needs of technically medium/low-demanding electrical applications. Such ESDs should favour low cost, low environmental impact, and safety, and thereby complement more expensive, high voltage, and energy/power dense ESDs such as lithium-ion batteries. Herein, we set out to assemble all-organic aqueous Na-ion hybrid supercapacitors, exclusively using commercial materials, with the aim to provide a truly sustainable and low-cost ESD. Overall, the created ESD delivers adequate technical performance in terms of capacity retention, Coulombic efficiency, energy efficiency, and energy/power density. Finally, we apply a straight-forward and qualitative biodegradability method to the ESD.
