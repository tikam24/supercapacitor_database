This work reports one-pot solvothermal synthesis of CuFeS2 nanomaterial using Cu(NO3)2•6H2O and FeCl2(3-Cl-benztsczH)2, where benztsczH = benzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone as molecular precursors. The electrochemical performance of as-prepared chalcopyrite, CuFeS2 nanomaterial was studied in order to investigate its ability to work as a supercapacitor material for energy storage devices. The material obtained was characterized by various techniques. The XRD pattern of as-prepared chalcopyrite, CuFeS2 matches with tetragonal phase of the material (JCPDS card no. 037–0471). The crystallite size calculated using Scherrer's formula is found to be 41.5 nm. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) revealed the presence of nanomaterial having spherical morphology. The electrochemical properties of the as-prepared chalcopyrite, CuFeS2 electrode were investigated in aqueous electrolyte, 6 M KOH. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) curves show the pseudocapacitive behaviour of the CuFeS2 electrode. The material is found to have excellent specific capacitance of 206.3 C g−1 (589 F g−1) at 0.5 A g−1 current density with cycle stability of ∼82% after 2000 cycles (at current density of 4 A g−1).
