Conventionally flexible AC transmission systems along with energy storage systems are in use for improving the load frequency control (LFC) in an interconnected power system. In this paper, application of variable frequency transformer (VFT), a latest power system technology, along with energy storage system, has been investigated. VFT is coordinated with fuzzy-based supercapacitor energy storage system (SCESS) to improve the LFC in an interconnected power system. VFT is modelled as a tie line power flow controller which stabilizes the inter area oscillations. It controls the phase angle shift between the interconnected areas in accordance with the power demand, while SCESS supplies the power to the interconnected areas. Fuzzy controller generates the power command for SCESS. It is designed such that it minimizes the frequency deviations during sudden load disturbances and restores the nominal storage capacity of SCESS after the load disturbance is tackled. Further, feedback gains of VFT and membership functions of fuzzy controller are optimized using genetic algorithm optimization technique to attain the optimal performance. The coordinated control of VFT and fuzzy-based SCESS effectively arrests the frequency deviations in an interconnected area during sudden load disturbances.
