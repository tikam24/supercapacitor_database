Polyionic liquids are a significant part of flexible electrochemical supercapacitor due to its high thermal stability, wide voltage window and its cycle stability. A series of ionogel based on [P14666][DCA], [P14666][NTf2] and [P14666][Cl] entrapped in the PMMA are developed and examined. The impact of changing anion by fixing cation on the electrochemical system is investigated. The physicochemical properties of the supported ionogel electrolytes are investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis, Raman spectroscopy, broadband dielectric spectra, and FTIR. The electrochemical performance of the solid-state supercapacitors is evaluated using cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge cycle, and impedance spectra. This comparative study reveals that the tuning of ionic liquids by the anion has a strong influence on the electrochemical system for energy storage applications. In this work among three ionogel, [P14666][DCA] ionogel exhibited a higher specific capacitance of 437.5 F/g, the specific energy of 136 Wh/kg and specific power of 4 kW/kg than other two ionogels.
