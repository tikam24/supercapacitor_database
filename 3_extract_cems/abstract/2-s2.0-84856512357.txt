In the case of conventional and hybrid vehicles, the research departments of automotive companies' use standardized driving cycles to estimate fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, for electric vehicles the main objective is the improvement of the vehicle performances such as the autonomy, the maximum speed, acceleration, to reach those of conventional vehicles. For this study, the ARTEMIS and the New European Drive cycle (NEDC) are selected to size the hybrid source (battery-supercapacitor) which propels the vehicle. Two sizing strategies are used, for the first the battery is sized to ensure the maximum discharge power required for each cycle, while for the second strategy, the battery is just used like an energy tank and it are sized to ensure the energy needed for 120km of autonomy. For the two strategies, the supercapacitor because of its high specific power is used like booster with battery. The results of the sizing are analyzed to focus the effect of the driving cycle on the size of the hybrid source supplying the electric vehicle. Â© 2011 IEEE.
