A high-performance, low-cost, aqueous Al-ion supercapacitor was fabricated based on nanostructured V 2 O 5 impregnated mesoporous carbon microspheres (MCM/V 2 O 5 ) electrodes and Al 2 (SO 4 ) 3 electrolyte for efficient energy storage. MCM/V 2 O 5 composites exhibit high dispersion of nanostructured V 2 O 5 in a mesoporous carbon matrix, beneficial to fast reversible redox reactions with a short diffusion path. The corresponding capacitor illustrates the distinguishable redox behavior, most likely due to the Al 3+ intercalation/deintercalation leading to the reduction/oxidation of V 5+ /V 4+ . It delivers a high-energy density of 18.0 Wh kg -1 at 147 W kg -1 and a long cycling lifespan with over 88% capacitance retention over 10 000 cycles. The competitive performance can be ascribed to the integration of the electric double layer capacitance provided from MCM with pseudocapacitance contributed by nanostructured V 2 O 5 . This work offers the possibilities of high-performance aqueous capacitors based on trivalent Al-ion as guest species, providing new directions for future development of supercapacitors.
