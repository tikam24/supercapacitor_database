Insufficient energy density and poor cyclic stability is still challenge for conductive polymer-based supercapacitor. Herein, high performance electrochemical system has been assembled by combining poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT):poly (styrene sulfonate) (PSS) redox electrode and potassium iodide redox electrolyte, which provide the maximum specific capacity of 51.3 mAh/g and the retention of specific capacity of 87.6% after 3000 cycles due to the synergic effect through a simultaneous redox reaction both in electrode and electrolyte, as well as the catalytic activity for reduction of triiodide of the PEDOT:PSS.
