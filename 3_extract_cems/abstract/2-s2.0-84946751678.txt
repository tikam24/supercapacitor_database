Solution-based methods for graphene synthesis, such as chemical reduction of graphene oxide, electrochemical exfoliation, and liquid-phase exfoliation are suitable for printing applications. This chapter discusses dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and the improvements brought about by the introduction of graphene. Lithium-ion batteries are widely regarded as the current main energy storage technology for mobile devices, laptops, and hybrid electric vehicles. An application of graphene at the positive electrode is with next-generation energy storage devices. Lithium-oxygen and lithium-sulfur are perhaps the most representative technologies in this respect. Electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), also found in literature as ultracapacitors or, more commonly, supercapacitors, constitute an interesting family of devices that are well suited for short-/medium-term energy storage. The global printed electronics market is expected to grow rapidly in the future. Graphene-based conductive inks have the potential to play a key role in specific parts of the overall market.
