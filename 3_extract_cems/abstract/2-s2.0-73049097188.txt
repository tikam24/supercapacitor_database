This paper deals with the fractional order modelling of the supercapacitor voltage response for a given current profile. The model is obtained using the porous electrode theory applied on the supercapacitor case. In order to simplify the complexity of the model, it is assumed that there is no diffusion process in the electrolyte. These assumption leads to neglect the supercapacitor self-discharge. So, we intend to combine both frequency and time identification methods. The differences on the obtained results show the importance of the experimental protocol. A numeric approach leads to estimate the supercapacitor initial state influence on the voltage response of a same model. An experiment is done on a 2000F/2.7V element to validate the assumption done and the result allows estimating the current sign dependency of the capacitance.
