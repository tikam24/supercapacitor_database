This paper highlights the idea of generating power using footsteps. It is based on the piezoelectric effect of material being used for production of energy. Energy has been needed and used by man at an increasing rate since time immemorial. An idea for using and putting to use an extravagant amount of energy in human feet is very much in line with the goals of tremendously populated countries like China and India. For developing nations where there is a high need for electricity, a proposal for the use of foot power waste energy with human mobility is pertinent. The use of piezoelectric materials to generate and store energy from vibrations caused by people walking and other types of vibrations is described in this study. The 'footstep power generating system's operating concept is based on piezoelectric sensors. When the flooring is constructed using piezoelectric technology, floor sensors catch the electrical energy generated by the pressure and a transducer transforms it into an electrical charge. These sensors are being placed in places or areas where there is huge crowd movement, like on footpaths, treadmills, city malls, shopping complexes, and more, in places with proper safety and equipment like breakers or shock absorbers. At these places, a huge amount of energy is wasted as mechanical or heat energy, which can be very useful.
