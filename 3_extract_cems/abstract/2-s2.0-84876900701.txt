Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)/sulfonic acid-functionalized graphene composite hydrogel was prepared by introducing microcontent of sulfonic acid-functionalized graphene (SFG) using in situ polymerization. The specific capacitance of the composite hydrogel was significantly improved by the introduction of SFG when the feeding ratio of SFG to 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) was as low as 1:1000, the specific capacitance of the composite hydrogel can reach 93 F/g, which was more than two times than that of the pure PEDOT hydrogel (39 F/g). The composite hydrogel showed a high specific capacitance of 135 and 220 F/g at high current density (5 A/g) when KI and K 3Fe(CN)6-H2SO4 solution were employed as redox-active electrolytes, respectively. The composite hydrogel in K3Fe(CN)6-H2SO4 can be used as potential electrode material for supercapacitor applications.Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
