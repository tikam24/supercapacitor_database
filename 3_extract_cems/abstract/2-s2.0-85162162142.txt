This study aims to develop a hybrid energy storage system (HESS), targeting a commercialised Hybrid Electric Vehicle model (Hyundai Sonata), that consists of battery and supercapacitor cells, to evaluate its benefits on the battery's health and vehicle's performance. The different possible configurations of combining the two energy storage devices are discussed, while a semi-active configuration is considered for the purpose of simulation and testing, where the supercapacitor is connected to a bidirectional DC-DC converter, implemented with a newly developed control logic for the HESS. The analysis of the HESS is done by modelling the vehicle powertrain on the simulation software Ricardo IGNITE, while adapting the WLTC Class 2 drive cycle. The results are validated by comparing HESS model to the sole battery model, which showed the working status of the battery is stabilised by the addition of the supercapacitor in the HESS model during both the traction and regenerative modes. There is a significant reduction in the battery peak current, 15.26% and 20.54% for the charge and discharge current, respectively. Other improvements include a 0.43% increase on the average battery SOC, a 6.8% decrease in the battery's maximum temperature and 47.56% decrease in the average battery power. On the other hand, there was a 0.46% increase on vehicle's average L/100 km fuel consumption, due to losses in the supercapacitor system. Various other results are also compared in the discussion section, justifying the addition of the supercapacitor. The investigation finishes off by conducting a parametric study based on the number of supercapacitor modules in parallel, and comparing results such as current, power, fuel consumption and battery SOC. The results show that 2 supercapacitor modules provided the optimal results in terms of battery's current and power behaviour.
