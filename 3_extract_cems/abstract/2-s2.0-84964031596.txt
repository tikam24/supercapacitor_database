Graphene/Mn3O4 nanocomposite is successfully synthesized from graphene oxide (GO)/MnO2 precursor using dilute hydrazine hydrate assisted hydrothermal reaction (DAH method). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman characterizations confirm the decrease of oxygen-containing functional groups of GO. The results indicate that GO have been reduced to graphene to a large degree to increase the electronic conductive channels. The morphology and the phase transformation of MnO2 can be ascribed to the "dissolution-recrystallization" mechanism. Such nanocomposite, as electrode material for supercapacitor, exhibits a high specific capacitance of 326.9 F g-1, almost 4 times that of GO/MnO2 precursor (81.3 F g-1). The good cycle stability of 94.6% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles, can be explained by the firm interfacial cohesion between graphene and Mn3O4 nanoparticle. This soft chemical DAH process could be readily extended to the preparation of other classes of hybrids.
