This chapter provides a rich discussion on the nanocomposites that can be 3-dimensionally (3D) printed and used for energy storage devices, mainly supercapacitors (SCs). A brief introduction is provided regarding the importance of supercapacitor and their advantages. The following sections cover the variety of materials used and the significance of nanocomposites for energy storage applications. The next section provides an in-depth discussion regarding the array of nanocomposites formed using 2D materials. Also, this chapter casts light on nanocomposites of metal oxides, sulfides, and phosphides, along with the advantages and drawbacks of the variety of nanocomposites used for the SCs. In addition, the effect of nanocomposites on their electrochemical behavior is discussed. Compared to conventional compounds, these nanocomposites offer various advantages such as low cost, simple processes, and compatibility with multiple substrates. Due to these outstanding merits, significant research efforts have been devoted to utilizing nanocomposite-based materials for SCs. Finally, a section is provided to emphasize the main challenges and future perspectives in this field.
