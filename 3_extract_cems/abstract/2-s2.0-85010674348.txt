Increasing numbers of flexible universal energy storage devices are required for wearable and portable products. A typical representation of energy storage devices are supercapacitors. However, their applications are greatly limited due to their low conductivity, which is strongly restricted by the effect of the binder. We designed and prepared a flexible and binder-free supercapacitor based on a graphene-polyaniline@carbon cloth composite by a one-step electrochemical co-deposition process. The composite exhibited excellent electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance of 793 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and favorable cycle stability (retention of 81% of initial specific capacitance after 10 000 cycles). The flexible symmetric device also showed satisfactory specific capacitance of 512 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1, desirable cycling stability (retention of 85% specific capacitance over 10 000 cycles) and considerable energy density of 11.38 W h kg−1 at a power density of 199.80 W kg−1. We believe that this flexible and binder-free supercapacitor with excellent electrochemical properties will meet the demands in roll-up displays, electronic paper and wearable electronic products.
