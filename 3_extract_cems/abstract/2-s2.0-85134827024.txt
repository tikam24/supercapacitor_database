Injecting polyoxometalate (POM) clusters into metal organic frameworks (MOFs) can not only provide more additional redox centers, but also solve the problems of easy agglomeration and low stability of POMs. Herein, we prepared {Co3Mo7O24}@[Ag4(μ-Hbtc)(μ-H2btc)]1/2 (shortened as {Co3Mo7O24}@Ag-BTC-2, btc = 1,3,5-benzyltricarboxylic acid) by a simple grinding method and characterized its morphology and composition. {Co3Mo7O24}@Ag-BTC-2 showed high specific capacitance (260.7 F g−1) and high capacitance retention (99.8% after 5000 cycles) in a three-electrode system with nickel foam as a collector. A symmetrical supercapacitor fabricated with {Co3Mo7O24}@Ag-BTC-2 delivers an energy density of 4.9 W h kg−1 at 355.1 W kg−1. The capacitance retention reached 97.6% after 5000 cycles. In addition, {Co3Mo7O24}@Ag-BTC-2 as a H2O2 sensor showed a wide linear range (1 μM to 0.43 mM), a low detection limit (0.33 μM) and a strong anti-interference ability, and can be used to detect H2O2 in real blood serum specimens. These results show that POMOF materials with high performance can be prepared by a simple grinding method.
