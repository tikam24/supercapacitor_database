The electrochemical properties of Ni(OH) 2/CNTs prepared by electrochemical deposition were investigated in this article. The results show that deposits of Ni(OH) 2 has high purity and can optimize the electronic and ionic conductivity to minimize the total resistance of the system and maximize the performance characteristics as supercapacitor electrodes. The specific capacitance at a scan rate of 2 mV/s reaches as high as 2486 F/g, which gives the composites potential application as high-performance supercapacitor electrode materials. Meanwhile, the products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
