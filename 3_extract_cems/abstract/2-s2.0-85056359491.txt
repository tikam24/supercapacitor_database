Abstract: Yarn supercapacitors (YSCs) are attracting considerable interest for wearable electronics and intelligent textiles due to their high flexibility and weavability. In the present study, stainless steel/cotton blended yarns were used as supports and current collectors to produce polypyrrole-coated yarn electrodes. The as-made YSC exhibited a high areal specific capacitance of 344 mF cm −2 at a current density of 0.6 mA cm −2 and good cycling stability (almost 93% capacitance retention over 1000 cycles). Moreover, the YSC could be knitted into other fabrics without damaging its original structure and electrochemical performance owing to its superior flexibility, indicating that it can meet the requirements of energy-storage devices for wearable electronics.
