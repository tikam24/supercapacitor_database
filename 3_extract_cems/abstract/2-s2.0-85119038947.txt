Activated carbon (AC) from sugarcane bagasse was prepared using a simple two-step method of carbonization and chemical activation with four different activating agents (HNO3, H2SO4, NaOH, and KOH). Amorphous carbon structure as identified by X-ray diffraction was observed in all samples. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the AC had more porosity than the non-activated carbon (non-AC). Specific capacitance of the non-AC electrode was 32.58 F g−1 at the current density of 0.5 A g−1, whereas the AC supercapacitor provided superior specific capacitances of 50.25, 69.59, 109.99, and 138.61 F g−1 for the HNO3 (AC-HNO3), H2SO4 (AC-H2SO4), NaOH (AC-NaOH), and KOH (AC-KOH) activated carbon electrodes, respectively. The AC-KOH electrode delivered the highest specific capacitance (about 4 times of the non-AC electrode) because of its good surface wettability, the largest specific surface area (1058.53 m2 g−1), and the highest total specific pore volume (0.474 cm3 g−1). The AC-KOH electrode also had a great capacitance retention of almost 100% after 1000 GCD cycles. These results demonstrate that our AC developed from sugarcane bagasse has a strong potential to be used as high stability supercapacitor electrode material.
