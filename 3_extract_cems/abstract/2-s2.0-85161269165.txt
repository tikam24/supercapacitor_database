Energy is available in several forms but its use to humans is predominantly in the electrical form. Since electrical energy is not immediately consumed post conversion, energy storage devices are required for its storage. This reinforces the importance of research in electrical energy storage devices. Till date, very few energy storage devices have been developed for commercial use. Asymmetrical supercapacitors are the newest addition to this list and have the potential to replace conventional energy storage devices in times to come. They can be further classified based on their electrode orientation namely horizontally and vertically configured electrodes. Research has been conducted on asymmetrical supercapacitors with horizontally configured electrodes as they have a better performance over vertically configured electrode. Analysis of asymmetrical supercapacitor with horizontally configured electrodes through statistical modelling approach is presented in the paper which is useful in setting electrode parameter values during the manufacture of this device. Electrode material loading on current collector of both electrodes is found to be affecting specific-capacitance values; they also add to nonlinearity in the device. Metal oxide contents are an addition to the interaction effect. Modelling approach adopted has provided better insights as to how various electrode parameters interact and in turn affect the specific capacitance. Presented research work also brings out need of extra negative plate or bigger size negative plate in asymmetrical supercapacitors. Findings of this research work can be used as basis for study of other electrical energy storage devices such as battery, fuel cell etc.
