Voltage unbalance or sag conditions generated by the power system faults can have a significant negative impact on the ASD's (Adjustable Speed Drives). A practical ride-through scheme based on supercapacitor/battery as an energy storage device for ASD's is presented in this paper. Energy storage module is connected to support the DC-link voltage during power system faults. The performance of ASD's under normal and power system faults is first simulated in MATLab Simulink and then experimentally verified. The Data AcQuisition boards (DAQ) of National Instruments along with LabVIEW software have been used to record the observed waveforms. Â© 2010 IEEE.
