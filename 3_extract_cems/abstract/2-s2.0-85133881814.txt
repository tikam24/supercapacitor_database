Stimuli-responsive supercapacitors have attracted broad interest in constructing self-powered smart devices. However, due to the demand for high cyclic stability, supercapacitors usually utilize stable or inert electrode materials, which are difficult to exhibit dynamic or stimuli-responsive behavior. Herein, this issue is addressed by designing a MoS2@carbon core-shell structure with ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets incorporated in the carbon matrix. In the three-electrode system, MoS2@carbon delivers a specific capacitance of 1302 F g−1 at a current density of 1.0 A g−1 and shows a 90% capacitance retention after 10 000 charging-discharging cycles. The MoS2@carbon-based asymmetric supercapacitor displays an energy density of 75.1 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 900 W kg−1. Because the photo-generated electrons can efficiently migrate from MoS2 nanosheets to the carbon matrix, the assembled photo-responsive supercapacitor can answer the stimulation of ultraviolet-visible-near infrared illumination by increasing the capacitance. Particularly, under the stimulation of UV light (365 nm, 0.08 W cm−2), the device exhibits a ≈4.50% (≈13.9 F g−1) increase in capacitance after each charging-discharging cycle. The study provides a guideline for designing multi-functional supercapacitors that serve as both the energy supplier and the photo-detector.
