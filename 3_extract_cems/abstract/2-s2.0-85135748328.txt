In this paper, the development of a novel technology for direct and rapid heating of battery electrolyte at low temperatures and maintaining the battery temperature at its optimal performance level is presented. The technology has been extensively tested on a wide range of primary and secondary batteries at temperatures as low as -54 deg. C without causing any damage to the batteries. The technology is applicable to almost all primary and secondary batteries, such as Lithium-ion, Lithium-polymer, NiMH and lead-acid batteries. The technology is also applicable to super-capacitors and has been used to rapidly heat super-capacitors at temperatures as low as -54 deg. C without any damage.
