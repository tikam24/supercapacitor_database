In view of the current problem that MOFs (Metal-organic frameworks)-based carbon as electrode materials for supercapacitors have poor conductivity and single component. We design porous hybrid carbon nanofibers (C-ZIF-67 @PAN@ZIF-8) derived from 1D core-shell MOFs. They can combine the advantages of 1D carbon materials (high conductivity) with hybrid carbon materials (multiple components) showing excellent electrochemical performance. The specific capacitance can reach 320.8 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, which is higher than C-ZIF-8 (180.8 F g−1) and C-ZIF-8 @PAN (273.7 F g−1) in a three-electrode system. In addition, symmetrical supercapacitors are assembled with C-ZIF-67 @PAN@ZIF-8, which can provide very stable performance and almost no capacitance decay after 10,000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g−1. The supercapacitors also can offer a high energy density of 8.0 wh kg−1 at a power density of 250 w kg−1.
