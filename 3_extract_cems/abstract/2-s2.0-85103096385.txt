A symmetric micro-supercapacitor (MSC) is constructed by electrochemically co-depositing molybdenum disulfide nanoflakes and poly-naphthalenemethylamine onto micro-patterned (100 Î¼m track/gap) palladium current collectors over a plastic substrate. Within this structure, the polymer/MoS2 nanocomposite provides the percolating framework necessary to facilitate the charge transport and intercalation of ions through the entire electrode volume and functional chemical groups and/or defects, increasing the pseudocapacitance contribution. The hybrid MSC gave a high volumetric capacitance of 130 mF/cm3 at a scan rate of 5 mV/s, affording a 3.1 V potential window using a PVA-H2SO4 solid gel electrolyte. Overall, the strategy developed in this work on commercial interdigitated electrodes is based on an easily scalable technology, and further fine-tuning of the electrode design or active material volume can lead to supplementary improvement of the MSC's performance and cycling stability.
