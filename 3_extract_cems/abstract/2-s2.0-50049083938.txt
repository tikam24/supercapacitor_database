Now pitch systems are widely used in the wind turbine system. To enhance stability, the pitch system is equipped with a ride through system to immediately ensure the reliable functioning of the fast blade pitch system in the event of a total power failure. Supercapacitor, as a new energy storage component, offers excellent performance, high power density, wide temperature range, and long life, particularly suitable for this application. In this paper, compared with other forms of energy storage components, the advantages and disadvantages of supercapacitor used in the ride through system for wind turbine pitch systems are discussed, and the design of supercapacitor based ride through system is presented in detail. Finally, experimental results are reported to verify the design.
