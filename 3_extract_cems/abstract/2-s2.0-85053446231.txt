A passive parallel connection of different energy storage technologies, like lithium ion batteries and supercapacitors, is very attractive to improve cycle life as well as power and energy density in comparison to pure energy storage technologies. Especially new technologies like lithium ion capacitors are attractive to be combined with lithium ion batteries due to similar voltage levels. In our approach, we show via experimental and model-based investigations how the energy and power density characteristics of such connections vary from energy storage systems based on one technology only and which advantages can result in applications.
