In this paper, a bimetallic samarium/tellurium metal-organic framework (ST-MOF) with tubular morphology and secondary urchin-like structures was prepared onto Ni foam by cathodic electrodeposition from aqueous samarium/thulium nitrate solution containing BTC organic linker. Various techniques were used to full characterization of the as-prepared electrode. The fabricated ST-MOF@NF was utilized as electrode material for supercapacitors and the high capacitances of 511 C/g and 419 C/g were attained at the current densities of 10 A/g and 50 A/g, respectively. Moreover, high-rate capability of 64.6% was observed by increasing the current density from 5 to 100 A/g. More interestingly, the ST-MOF@NF electrode exhibited excellent cycling stability, i.e. about 93.25% and 75.18% of initial capacitances after 12,000 GCD cycles at the current loads of 10 and 50 A/g, respectively. All of these characters suggested that ST-MOF@NF electrode could be promising battery-type electrode candidate for supercapacitors.
