This paper presents the supercapacitor parameters variations due to number of cycles (NbCy), the frequency of DC-current and the temperature. The goal of this study consists to show the parameters evolution which can serve to determine the supercapacitor energetic performances limits estimation for different conditions of use. The contribution of the paper is focused on the impacts of charge/discharge DC-current's frequency, the temperature and the number of cycles on supercapacitor resistance and capacitance. The proposed method uses several DC-current profiles based on fluctuations and no fluctuations consideration. To do the supercapacitor stress tests, the experimental tests based on charge and discharge operations with fluctuating DC-current are done. To do estimation of the series resistance and capacitance (characterization) a constant DC-current without any fluctuations consideration is used. The experimental tests results are presented and the impacts of the number of cycles, the frequency of DC-current and the temperature are analyzed.
