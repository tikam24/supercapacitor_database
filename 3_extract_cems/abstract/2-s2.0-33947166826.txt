Composite electrodes were prepared via electrochemical polymerization of 3-methylthiophene in porous PVDF membranes of various thicknesses. The electrochemical properties were determined by cyclic voltammetry and charge-discharge tests and the possible correlation of the results with the morphology of the host membranes was examined. The best definition of n- and p-doping/undoping processes and the biggest capacitance (82 F g-1) were obtained with a 27.5 μm-thick composite. Further characterization of this composite using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed three behaviors associated with variation in the oxidation state of poly(3-methylthiophene) during transition from the n-undoping to p-doping states. The behavior of the charge transfer resistance and the double layer capacitance as a function of the applied potential were also determined. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
