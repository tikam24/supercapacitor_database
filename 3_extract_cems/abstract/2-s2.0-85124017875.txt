An interesting strategy for synthesizing three-dimensional (3D) copper selenides micro-flowers (CuSe-MFs) by a facile wet-chemical process is reported for the supercapacitor's (SCs) electrode. The sample was characterized by XRD, SEM, and XPS. Moreover, advancing from the high intrinsic activity and microstructural properties, the CuSe-MFs electrode exhibits a high capacitance (490 F g−1 at 1.5 A g−1), excellent rate performance 66% at 5 A g−1, and superb stability of 88% after 11,090 cycles at 10 A g−1. The present study contributes substantially to the research of CuSe with complex architecture and the future application in high-performance SCs.
