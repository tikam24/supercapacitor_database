Phase pure lithium trivanadate (LiV3O8) was synthesized by an ultrasound-assisted rheological phase reaction method for aqueous supercapacitor applications. The precursor was exposed to ultrasound for different time periods of 2, 6 and 10 h and then calcined under similar conditions. The effects of ultrasound on the structural features of the synthesized samples was characterized by XRD, and FTIR spectroscopy and the morphological features by SEM analysis. The sample synthesized by exposing the precursor to ultrasound for 10 h showed a high value of d100spacing, which facilitated the lithium (Li+) ion movement. Also, the formation of rod-like structures by the exposure of ultrasound facilitated the fast Li+ ion movement and enhanced the electrochemical performance. The electrochemical performance was measured using a three-electrode cell setup in the potential range of âˆ’0.8 to 0.2 V using 1 M LiNO3aqueous electrolyte. The specific capacitance of the material was found to be 120 F/g at a current density of 1A/g for the sample sonicated for 10 h (10S-LVO). The symmetric supercapacitor constructed using 10S-LVO showed the highest specific capacitance of 317F/g at 0.5 A/g, with 66.28% capacitance retention at 1A/g after 150 cycles.
