A non linear passivity-based control can be suitably used to achieve stability of a Parallel Hybrid Fuel Cell/Supercapacitor (FC/SC) Power Source Architecture. Nevertheless, passivity properties are usually lost when such a controller is implemented in a sampled-data context and, as a consequence, stabilization objectives are degraded. This paper proposes a direct sampled-data control strategy based on the IDA-PBC techniques, ensuring the stabilization of the (FC/SC) system at its desired equilibrium point. Such a controller guarantees good energetic performances for a large range of sampling periods and small current amplitudes. Arguing so such a digital controller avoids the premature usage of FC and SCs, maintains a good transient response and can be implemented by cheaper computers, dealing important industrial requirements.
