Ni-MOF derivatives are fabricated through calcining in air at different temperatures without leading to original structure collapsing. The results indicate that the obtained NiO has fine electrochemical performance at the calcining temperature of 350 °C, which possesses a reversible specific capacitance of 485 F g−1 at the current of 1 A g−1, and nearly 87% retention after 5000 cycles. The superior electrochemical properties of Ni-MOF derived hexagonal flaky NiO is attributed to the enlarged surfaces and stable structure after calcination.
