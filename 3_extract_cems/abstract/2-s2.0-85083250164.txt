We report an on-chip micro supercapacitor (MSC) with ultrafast charge/discharge capability, which is contributed by the highly conductive carbon nanotube (CNT) electrode and greatly reduced interfacial resistance. To overcome the line-contact and Fermi level mismatch between CNT and metal current collector, a self-assembled single-layer reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is introduced to form a CNT/CNT-rGO wrapped/rGO 3-layer architecture. The fabricated MSC exhibits a volumetric capacity of 1900 mF/cm3 at an ultrahigh rate up to 2000 V/s. This work illustrates the potential of on-chip MSCs for filtering applications and may shed light on the way of further improving the operation speed of MSC.
