A 2 T magnetic field system (second long) based on storage supercapacitor was designed and developed to fulfill the guiding magnetic field requirement of the high-power microwave devices. First, the basic principle of the supercapacitor magnetic field system was briefly introduced. Then the main parameters of the power supply and solenoid were discussed and calculated in detail. In the end, through the simulation and experiment, we verified that the magnetic field system based on supercapacitor could well meet guiding magnetic need. Finally, the roadblock and outlook of this magnetic system were analyzed generally. The method in this research would have certain reference value for the design of similar magnetic systems.
