In this work, fabrication of Polyaniline (PANI) nanomaterial is performed by employing chemical oxidative technique. Fabrication of the nanomaterial is preceded by analysis of its electrochemical characteristics for distinct applications in numerous power devices. Especial focus is on energy and power saving device i.e. super capacitor. Electrochemical investigation is accomplished with the assistance of CV, EIS, GCD and I-V tests. The electrochemical analysis has assisted to prove it be one of the most promising nanomaterials for power storage devices.
