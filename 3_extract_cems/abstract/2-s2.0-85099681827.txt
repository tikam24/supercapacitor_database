The paper presents the integrated model of an electric vehicle (EV) supplied both by Li-Ion batteries and supercapacitors (SCs). A suitable design and power flow management of these components can remarkably mitigate the battery stress due to heavy charge/discharge power peak requirements, particularly in an urban traffic context. The proposed refined models of batteries and SCs enable a more accurate reproduction of the system performances in a highly uneven route, taking into account various electrical and mechanical issues. The optimal rating of the energy storage components for a typical urban drive cycle can then be identified by further parametric analyses.
