Ag nanoparticles decorated La 0.85 Sr 0.15 MnO 3 was designed and used as electrode for supercapacitors firstly. Ag nanoparticles not only facilitate to accelerate charge transfer but also contribute a small amount of pseudocapacitance. It shows a high specific capacitance of 186 F·g −1 at 1 A·g −1 and excellent cycling performance. When assembled asymmetric supercapacitor, it possesses maximum energy density of 20.6 Wh·kg −1 at power density of 1700 W·kg −1 within the wide potential window of 1.7 V, as well as 13.4 Wh·kg −1 at 8500 W·kg −1 . This work could prompt the development and application of high conductivity nanoparticles modified perovskite in supercapacitors.
