In this paper, we reported a novel biomass-derived porous carbon from torreya grandis shell for the first time by means of carbonization and KOH activation under N2. The pore structures were related to the ratio of KOH and activation temperature. N2 adsorption-desorption tests indicated that the sample of AC-800-3 has a maximum specific surface area of 2100.8 m2 g−1 and proper pore volume of 1.02 cm3 g−1. The electrode prepared with AC-800-3 realized a high capacitance of 290.5 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and excellent rate capability of 62.6% in three-electrode system. The assembled symmetrical cell of AC-800-3 electrode exhibited a high energy density of 13.5 W h kg−1 at a power density of 360.1 W kg−1 in the potential range of 0–1.6 V and excellent cycling stability with 93.1% retention of the initial capacitance after 5000 cycles.
