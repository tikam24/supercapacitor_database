The Ni3S2nanoparticles have been successfully grown on the carbon nanofibers (CNFs) derived from bacterial cellulose via a hydrothermal method, which the as-prepared composite exhibited high specific capacitance (883 F g-1at 2 A g-1), much more than CNFs (108 F g-1at 2 A g-1), and good cycle stability. The asymmetric supercapacitor was designed to contain the CNFs coated Ni3S2nanoparticles (Ni3S2/CNFs) as positive electrode and CNFs as negative electrode in 2 M KOH electrolyte. Due to the synergistic effects of the two electrodes, asymmetric cell showed superior electrochemical performances. The optimized asymmetric supercapacitor gave a operating potential of 1.7 V in 2 M KOH aqueous solution, exhibiting a high specific capacitance of 56.6 F g-1at 1 A g-1and considerably high energy density of 25.8 Wh kg-1at a power density of 425 W kg-1. Meanwhile, Ni3S2/CNFs//CNFs asymmetric supercapacitor showed excellent cycling stability with 97% specific capacitance retained after 2500 cycles.
