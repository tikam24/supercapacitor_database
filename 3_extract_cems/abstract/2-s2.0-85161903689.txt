The design and preparation of novel electrode materials for energy storage applications is of great importance. Supercapacitors are the energy storage devices which attracted the enormous attention because of the fast charge/discharge ability, high power density, and excellent cyclic life. The performance of the supercapacitor devices depends on the presence of electrode materials. Thus, it is important of great importance to design and develop the high surface area and nanostructured electrode materials for the preparation of supercapacitor electrodes. Surface morphology, concentration, and electrical properties of the electrode materials also affect the electrochemical activity of the supercapacitor electrodes. Previously, different materials like conducting polymers, carbon materials, metal oxides/hydroxides, and metal sulfides have been employed as electrode modifiers for energy storage applications. In this chapter, we have reviewed the construction of different electrode modifier for energy storage application. The future prospect and current states have also been reviewed.
