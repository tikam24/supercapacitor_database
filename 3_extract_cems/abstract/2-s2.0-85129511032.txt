Supercapacitors have received much attention as large-scale energy storage devices for high power density and ultralong cycling life. In this work, sodium vanadate Na0.76V6O15/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) nanocables with deficient bridge oxygen at the interface (denoted Vo•-PNVO) have been tailored for supercapacitors through the in situ polymerization of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene and studied using three different electrolytes. Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that all Na+, Zn2+, and Al3+ ions appear as hydrates in aqueous solutions but insert into the crystal structure as Na+ ions and Zn2+-H2O and Al3+-H2O hydrates, respectively. In comparison with the Zn2+-H2O and Al3+-H2O hydrates, Na+ ions with a smaller radius diffuse more quickly in Vo•-PNVO. Thus, Vo•-PNVO delivers better charge storage capability and stability when an electrolyte with Na+ ions is used. The results strongly suggest that an electrostatic interaction is significant in determining transport properties and storage capacities, rather than hydrate radii or valence states.
