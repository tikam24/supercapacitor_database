LiCr0.15Co0.85O2 nanowires were prepared successfully by electrospinning technique at the calcination temperature of 500 °C for 6 hours. The average diameter of the nanowires was 45 nm. The phase transformation, crystallite structure and morphology of the prepared LiCr 0.15Co0.85O2 nanowires were studied using thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction / FTIR spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope analysis, respectively. The crystalline phase of the sample was identified as a single phase with α-NaFeO2 type structure and the peaks were indexed to the hexagonal system assuming the R3m symmetry.The electrochemical behavior of the prepared LiCr0.15Co 0.85O2 nanowires based electrode was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and AC-impedance studies. The electrochemical measurements provided a maximum specific capacitance of 77.7 Fg-1 with a resistivity of 4.5ω. Finally, the asymmetric supercapacitor cell AC// LiCr0.15Co0.85O2 was fabricated and its specific discharge capacitance, energy density and power density were determined are found to be 72.3 Fg-1, 256.2 Wkg-1 and 183.5 Wh kg-1, respectively. The cell has good cycling stability and retaining 94 % of its initial charge even after 1000 cycles. It revealed that the prepared LiCr0.15Co0.85O2 nanowires could be used as an effective electrode material for high performance asymmetric supercapacitors. © 2013 IEEE.
