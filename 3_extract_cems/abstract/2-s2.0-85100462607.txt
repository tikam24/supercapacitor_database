A two-step polyaniline (PANI) loading procedure has been developed to produce polyelectrolyte complex composite membranes (CPECs) to be used as supercapacitor electrodes. In the first step, CPECs were prepared by co-precipitation of poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS) and poly (diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) mixed with various amounts of PANI as a filler. CPECs were formed by compression molding into 100 micron membranes using NaCl as a plasticizer and characterized for their electrochemical properties. In the second step, the highest capacitance CPEC membranes with 60% PANI loading were further modified and doped by crossflow polymerization of aniline through the composite membranes. By using a two-compartment crossflow reactor containing aniline and ammonium persulfate on each side, the PANI content of the composite membrane was further increased. Cyclic voltammetry showed a doubling in the capacitance of the membranes after the crossflow polymerization. The resulting electrodes were flexible with high capacitance and could be used to improve pseudo-capacitor performance.
