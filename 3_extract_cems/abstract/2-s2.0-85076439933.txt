FACTS devices are extensively employed to enhance power system quality and security. They are capable of exchanging limited real power even though they have real and reactive power exchanging capability with power system. The main reason for the limited ability to exchange real power is not considering energy storage device. In FACTS devices STATCOMs are most commonly employed because of many advantages. STATCOMs coupling with Energy Storage Devices (ESD) like batteries, Supercapacitor, flywheels, semiconductor magnetic energy storage (SMES) were initiated to increase real power exchanging capability with the power system. Because of slow chemical reaction batteries the power discharging capability is limited. Present trend is to employ energy storage for short term to improve dynamic stability. Supercapacitor ESD will help in the dynamic stability and quality with STATCOMs. Even though they have less energy storing capability power exchanging capability is large when comparison with batteries. In this paper design of energy storage system with Supercapacitor is discussed and coupling with bi dc/dc converters with controlled strategies. To control the SCESS system a peak current mode controller is used. SCESS system is constructed in MATLAB simulink and results with Supercapacitor and without Supercapacitor are discussed in this paper.
