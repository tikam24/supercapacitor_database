Abstract We demonstrate the design and fabrication of hierarchical mesoporous NiCo2O4/MnO2 on carbon fiber papers via a facile hydrothermal for supercapacitor applications. The influence of preparation conditions (reaction temperature and KMnO4 concentration) on the electrochemical performance are evaluated in details. Our results showed that lower temperature (90°C vs. 110°C, 130°C) and lower concentration of KMnO4 is favorable for preparation a high performance electrode for supercapacitor. With reaction temperature or KMnO4 concentration rise, the loading mass of MnO2 increases, but the specific capacitance decreases on the contrary. The importance of controlling the loading mass of MnO2 over NiCo2O4 is highlighted.
