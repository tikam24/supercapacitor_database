A novel and simple strategy by introducing a titanate coupling agent into the electrode to improve the supercapacitor performance has been developed in this study. The surface modification of the activated carbon material are conducted under neutral conditions. The improved electrodes are characterized by mechanical tests and electrochemical measurements. The obtained results reveal that the treated activated carbon electrode retains good mechanical properties with decreased bonder content. The electrode prepared using activated carbon treated with the Titanate coupling agent and a bonder mass content of 8.0 % shows the best electrochemical performance. The specific capacitance reaches 376.2 Fg-1, whereas the internal resistance is 0.91 Ω. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
