In this paper, a new porous Co-coordination polymer, with the merits of high specific surface areas and high nitrogen content, is synthesized as the electrode material to enhance the electrical performance of supercapacitor. Its electrochemical performance is investigated in the electrolyte of 3 M KOH. The nitrogen doping Co-coordination polymer product at 140 Â°C exhibits the highest specific capacitance of 512 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1. Excellent cycle performance is observed. The capacitance value remains 97.4% even after 40000 cycles. More significantly, the Co-coordination polymer exhibits the energy density of 13.27 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 2913 W kg-1.
