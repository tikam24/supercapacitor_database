Electrophorus Electricus (EE) is known to discharge electric voltage through multiple organs based on Reversible Membrane Potential (RMP). We report a new type of supercapacitor for mimicking the EE's RMP based on an Electron-Relay Nano-Biomimetic Membrane Electrode Assembling (ERNBMEA) and an asymmetric membrane design with features free from ion channeling effect and a negligible double layer potential effect. The results shown the newly developed device can fire high rate electric spikes at both ends of the anode and cathode with a firing rate of 2-fold higher compared with the EE's 3.75 V/s. The capacitance of the 0.2 cm3 biomimetic EE increased linearly from 0.25 to 13,240 μF/cm2 over 0.015 to 1000 Hz range. At 120 Hz, the high storage capacitance is 5,140 μF/cm2 that is an order of magnitude higher over the reported double-layer capacitor. © 2012 IFSA.
