We have successfully realized a high-capacity, good-rate-capability, and long-life supercapacitor electrode by developing the hierarchical 3D NiCo2O4 nanoneedle arrays (NNAs)@ZnWO4 nanoflakes (NFs) core-shell structures on carbon cloth (CC) for the first time. The free-standing CC@NiCo2O4@ZnWO4 electrode gives rise to a high specific capacity of 296.5 Cg−1 at a current density of 0.5 Ag−1 and 269.0 Cg−1 even at 10 Ag−1, and retains ∼90.1% of the capacity even after 5000 cycles of charge and discharge. Compared with CC@NiCo2O4 electrode, the remarkable electrochemical behaviors demonstrate that ZnWO4 NFs decorated NiCo2O4 NNAs on CC as a new type of electrode is highly desirable for application as high-performance electrochemical supercapacitors.
