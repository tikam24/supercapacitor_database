Supercapacitors are components for energy storage, well dedicated for applications where energy storage can help the smoothing of strong and short time power drops of a distribution network. Those properties are developed for two examples. The first one regards an elevator, where a low constant power is provided by a distribution power independently of the maximum peak power needed for the lift, thanks to intermediary supercapacitors. The second example deals with the voltage drop compensation in weak distribution systems, for maintaining constant the voltage at the end of a supply line for trolley buses avoiding the use of heavy and expensive supply station.
