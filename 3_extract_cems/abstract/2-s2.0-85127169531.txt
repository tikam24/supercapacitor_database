In this work, a novel 3-D Nanosheets of composite metal oxides of NiO-CoO and organic polypyrrole (PPy) are synthesized by facile one-step alternating current (AC) co-electrodeposition method on the surface of carbon cloth (CC) as a supercapacitor electrode. The growth process of the electrode is time-saving that the growth of electrode cost only 1 h. The NiO-CoO-PPy nanosheets display an excellent specific capacitance (1123 F g−1 (156 mAh g−1) at 1 A g−1) and remarkable cyclic stability (90.1% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles). Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitor with NiO-CoO-PPy electrode and active carbon as counter electrodes exhibits an excellent energy density of 35.9 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 801 W kg−1. It suggests that the AC co-electrodeposition method is a highly effective way for the growth of composite metal oxides and organics supercapacitor electrode materials, which has great application value.
