Flexible devices have attracted abundant attention in energy storage systems. In this paper, we presented a novel approach for fabricating flexible supercapacitor based on metal organic frameworks-derived material. In this approach, a uniform zeolitic imidazolate frameworks-8 layer with a high mass loading was deposited on a flexible carbon foam (CF) skeleton efficiently by the induction of a uniform ZnO nanomembrane prepared via an atomic layer deposition technique. A flexible N-doped carbon particle-carbon foam (N-CP-CF) composite with a hierarchically porous structure and a large specific surface area (i.e., 538 m2 g−1) was obtained in a subsequent pyrolysis process. The resultant materials have the excellent electrochemical performance (i.e., a high specific capacitance of 300 F g−1 and a high energy density of 20.8 W h kg−1). The N-CP-CF composite can provide a stable capacitance (i.e., 250 F g−1) and an energy density (i.e., 17.36 W h kg−1) under large deformation (25% of original thickness). This work could propose a promising strategy in fabrication of flexible electrode with a large potential towards energy storage applications in the future.
