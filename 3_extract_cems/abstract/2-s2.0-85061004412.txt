In view of the grid connection of the traditional composite energy storage electric vehicle system, the energy is usually provided by the battery pack alone, a new type of energy feedback grid-connected system was designed to optimize the ability of the battery pack to output high current and extend the life of the energy storage system. In this paper, the structure and working principle of the new energy feedback grid connected system are analyzed, and the battery and supercapacitor are modeled in detail, realize the requirements of variable power grid connection for energy storage through energy management strategy. The inverter is controlled by VSG technology as a synchronous generator to ensure the reliability of energy transmission and reasonable power distribution automatically, to realize the rapid compensation of unbalanced power and the state of energy storage capacity adjustment. It can simulate the inertia and damping characteristics of synchronous generators, overcome the influence of traditional inertialess connected inverter on the power grid, and can effectively improve the ability of the grid to accept renewable energy. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the control method are verified by simulation model. The research results can provide reference for the safety control of the new energy electric vehicle grid-connected system.
