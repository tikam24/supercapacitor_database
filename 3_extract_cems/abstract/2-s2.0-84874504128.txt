A control strategy based on the principle of low-pass filtering for the hybrid energy storage system (HESS) composed of battery and supercapacitor is proposed. The reference output power of the battery is determined according to the principle of moving average. The main part of wind power fluctuation is smoothed by the battery, while the remaining component with high frequency is smoothed by the supercapacitor. By assessing the charging and discharging status of the battery, a performance evaluation method with intrinsic operation life measurement and calculation for the HESS control strategy is developed. Based on the actual operation data of a wind farm, the effect of the cut-off frequency of the low-pass filter and the time scale of moving average on the operation life of the battery in HESS is analyzed by simulation. Besides, reference values of relevant control parameters are given to prolong the operation life of the battery. Research results provide a theoretical reference to the application of HESS.
