A single-step hydrothermal route for synthesizing molybdenum doped zinc oxide nanoflakes was employed to accomplish superior electrochemical characteristics, such as a specific capacitance of 2296 F g-1 at current density of 1 A g-1 and negligible loss in specific capacitance of 0.01025 F g-1 after each charge-discharge cycle (up to 8000 cycles). An assembled asymmetric supercapacitor (Mo:ZnO@NF//AC@NF) also exhibited a maximum energy density and power density of 39.06 W h/kg and 7425 W kg-1, respectively. Furthermore, it demonstrated a specific capacitance of 123 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and retained about 75.6% of its initial capacitance after 8000 cycles. These superior electrochemical characteristics indicate the potential of this supercapacitor for next-generation energy storage devices.
