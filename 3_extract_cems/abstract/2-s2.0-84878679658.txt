HCl doped polyaniline (PANI) and Ru (III) doped polyaniline (Ru/PANI) have been successfully prepared by in situ oxidative polymerization method and the effect of transition metal incorporation in PANI backbone is investigated thoroughly by the execution of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Raman study. Moreover, to examine the change in surface and bulk morphology of the composites, the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have also been carried out, which revealed the agglomerated state of PANI after being Ru doped. The confirmation of the presence of Ru in the composite is achieved by the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Also, the electrochemical characterizations namely, cyclic voltammetry (CV), ac impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic charge-discharge (CCD), of the composite was performed by conventional three-electrode system using 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. On doping with Ru, an increment of specific capacitance of PANI from 160 F/g to 425 F/g has been achieved with a considerable increase in cycle stability. Â© 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company.
