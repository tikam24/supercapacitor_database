Polyaniline (PANI) was settled on the surface of CNTs in advance and then used as self-sacrifice reducing agent that would react with KMnO4 to prepare MnO2/PANI@CNT supercapacitor material. With PANI substituting for CNTs to participant the redox reaction, CNTs was protected from being destroyed and could maintain its original morphology and conductivity. The results of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) show that the optimal capacitive performance can be reached at the MnO2 loading of 64.4 wt% and the pH of 1 during the deposition of MnO2. With the protective PANI, MnO2/PANI@CNT composite exhibits the superior specific capacitance of 215.8 F/g at a current density of 200 mA/g and remains 86.5% of its maximal specific capacitance at a current density of 1000 mA/g.
