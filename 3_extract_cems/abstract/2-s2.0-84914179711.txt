In order to extremely retain the lattice structure of graphene so as to enhance its conductivity and simplify the synthesis process of transition metal oxides/graphene composites, Mn3O4/graphene nanocomposites were successfully prepared through a hydrogen arc discharge method and a simple high-temperature treatment, and the proposed nanocomposites were used as the electrode of supercapacitor. The morphology, structure and composition of products were characterized by x-ray diffractometer (XRD), Raman spectroscope and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The results of electrochemical tests show that the supercapacitor prepared with the Mn3O4/graphene nanocomposites has good capacitive behavior, excellent electrochemical stability (about 96% retention after 3 000 cycles) and lower equivalent series resistance. Furthermore, the addition of Mn3O4 can enhance the specific capacitance, which is three times higher than that of pure graphene electrode. Therefore, the proposed method can provide a new idea for taking the novel transition metal oxides/graphene composite as the electrode of high-performance supercapacitors.
