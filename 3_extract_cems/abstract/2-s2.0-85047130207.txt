In this study, cobalt-doped nickel sulfide nanomaterials are synthesized. The experimental results show that cobalt is successfully doped into the lattice of NiS2. Co-doping causes the hollow sphere sulphides to break down and favors the formation of NixCo1-xS2 nanostructures with high-density active edge sites. The Ni0.75Co0.25S2 sample exhibits a high specific capacitance of 2141.9 F g-1 at a current density of 2 A g-1 due to its fluffy characteristics and edge site-enriched nanostructure. The asymmetric supercapacitor based on Ni0.75Co0.25S2 exhibits a high energy density (54.9 Wh kg-1) and stable cycling durability with 85.1% capacitance retention after 4000 cycles.
