New carbon-loaded nickel chalcogenide electrode materials (NiS2/GO and NiSe2/rGO) have been synthesized through an easy-to-operate process: NiSe2was obtained based on NiS2hollow spheres, and was successfully synthesized withl-cysteine assistance under the hydrothermal method at 120 °C. GO of different mass fraction was added together withl-cysteine. The electrochemical performance of NiS2/GO and NiSe2/rGO has been greatly improved because the formation of a carbon-loaded layer effectively increased the specific surface area and reduced the charge transport resistance. Compared with pure NiS2and NiSe2, NiS2/GO and NiSe2/rGO presented much better specific capacitance (1020 F g−1and 722 F g−1respectively at a current density of 1 A g−1) and more superior rate capability (when the current density was raised to 5 A g−1the specific capacitance remained at 569 F g−1and 302 F g−1). This work highlights the advantages of nickel compounds through a very simple experimental method, and contributes to providing a good reference for preparation of superior supercapacitor materials with high performance.
