Porous activated carbon monolith derived from renewable and environmentally friendly biomass of "red shoots"leaves (Syzygium oleana) was prepared for electrode material of supercapacitors. The raw materials were converted into biochar by using ZnCl2 impregnated and one-stage integrated pyrolysis. The samples were chemically activated using the 1 M ZnCl2, which was then converted into monolith/pellet by using a hydraulic press. The carbon monolith were then one-stage integrated pyrolysis both carbonization and physical activation. This study is focused in different carbonization temperature including 500 °C, 600 °C and 700 °C. The reduction of density in the activated carbon monoliths have been reviewed as physical properties. In addition, the XRD and FTIR characterization also reviewed. Based on this, the activated carbon monolith from "red shoots"leaves biomass for supercapacitors deliver a high specific capacitance of 138.5 F g-1 in 1 M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte at low scanning rate of 1 mVs-1. This results demonstrate the successfully conversion "red shoots"leaves (Syzygium oleana) biomass into renewable and environmentally friendly electrode supercapacitor energy storage.
