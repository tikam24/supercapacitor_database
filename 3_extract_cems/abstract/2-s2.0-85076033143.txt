CoMn2O4 electrode materials were prepared with pure water, 50% (in volume, the same below) pure water mixed with 50% ethanol and ethanol as a solvent respectively. The effect of solvent on the morphology, microstructure and electrochemical properties of CoMn2O4 materials was investigated. The results show that CoMn2O4 prepared with pure water as a solvent has nanosheets structure. The specific capacitance of CoMn2O4 nanosheets is 446F/g at a current density of 1A/g. After charge-discharge for 1000 cycles at a current density of 5A/g, the retention ratio of specific capacitance is 77%. CoMn2O4 prepared with 50% pure water mixed with 50% ethanol as a solvent has a mixed nanosheets/nanoparticles structure. The specific capacitance of CoMn2O4 is 684F/g at a current density of 1A/g. After charge-discharge for 1000 cycles at a current density of 5A/g, the retention ratio of specific capacitance is 81%. CoMn2O4 prepared with ethanol as a solvent has a porous nanoparticles structure. The specific capacitance of CoMn2O4 nanoparticles is 842F/g at a current density of 1A/g. After charge-discharge for 1000 cycles at a current density of 5A/g, the retention ratio of specific capacitance is 86%. CoMn2O4 nanoparticles prepared with ethanol as a solvent shows a superior supercapacitance performance.
