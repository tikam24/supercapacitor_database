Nitrogen-doped, 3-dimensional graphene (N3DG), synthesized as a one-step thermal CVD process, was further functionalized with atmospheric pressure oxygen plasma. Electrodes were fabricated and tested based on the functionalized N3DG. Their characterization included scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET), and electrochemical measurements. The tested electrodes revealed a 208% increase in the specific capacitance compared to pristine 3D graphene electrodes in a three-electrode configuration. The performed doping and plasma treatment enabled an increase in the electrode‘s surface area by 4 times compared to pristine samples. Furthermore, the XPS results revealed the presence of nitrogen and oxygen functional groups in the doped and functionalized material. Symmetric supercapacitors assembled from the functionalized 3D graphene using aqueous and organic electrolytes were compared for electrochemical performance. The device with ionic electrolyte EMIMB4 electrolyte exhibited a superior energy density of 54 Wh/kg and power density of 1224 W/kg. It also demonstrated a high-cyclic stability of 15,000 cycles with a capacitance retention of 107%.
