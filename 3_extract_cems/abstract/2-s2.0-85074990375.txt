In this work, Co(OH)F nanorods@KxMnO2 nanosheet core-shell nanostructure was assembled on Ni foam by a facile hydrothermal method and incorporated with an electrodeposition process. Benefiting from their core-shell nanostructure and heterogeneous nanocomposites, the arrays present high areal capacitance up to 1046 mF cm-2 at 1 mA cm-2 and display a remarkable specific capacitance retention of 118% after 3000 cycles. When the current density increases to 10 mA cm-2, the capacitance is 821 mF cm-2 displaying a good rate capability. The excellent electrochemical properties allow them to be used as a promising electrode material for pseudocapacitors and display wide application potential in the field of electrochemical capacitors.
