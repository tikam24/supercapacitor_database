With the emergence of deadly viral and bacterial infections, preventing the spread of microorganisms on surfaces has gained ever-increasing importance. This study investigates the potential of solid-state supercapacitors as antibacterial and antiviral devices. We developed a low-cost and flexible carbon cloth supercapacitor (CCSC) with highly efficient antibacterial and antiviral surface properties. The CCSC comprised two parallel layers of carbon cloth (CC) electrodes assembled in a symmetric, electrical double-layer supercapacitor structure that can be charged at low potentials between 1 to 2 V. The optimized CCSC exhibited a capacitance of 4.15 ± 0.3 mF cm−2 at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, high-rate capability (83% retention of capacitance at 100 mV s−1 compared to its value at 5 mV s−1), and excellent electrochemical stability (97% retention of the initial capacitance after 1000 cycles). Moreover, the CCSC demonstrated outstanding flexibility and retained its full capacitance even when bent at high angles, making it suitable for wearable or flexible devices. Using its stored electrical charge, the charged CCSC disinfects bacteria effectively and neutralizes viruses upon surface contact with the positive and negative electrodes. The charged CCSC device yielded a 6-log CFU reduction of Escherichia coli bacterial inocula and a 5-log PFU reduction of HSV-1 herpes virus. Antibacterial and antiviral carbon cloth supercapacitors represent a promising platform technology for various applications, including electronic textiles and electronic skins, health monitoring or motion sensors, wound dressings, personal protective equipment (e.g., masks) and air filtration systems.
