The GO-COOZn (Graphene Oxide-COOH ZnO) and GO-COOMn (Graphene Oxide-COOH α-Mn2O3) nanocomposites grown ZnO and α-Mn2O3 onto graphene sheets by a one-step thermal method suing GOCOOH (Graphene Oxide-COOH), Zn(NO3)2 and Mn(NO3)2. The graphene oxide prepared by Hummers method using graphite flakes was used as a starting material. The GO-COOH were synthesized by GO (Graphene Oxide) and chloroacetic acid (Cl-CH2-COOH). The GO, GOCOOH and GO-COOZn and GO-COOMn were characterized by XRD, AFM, SEM, TEM, FT-IR, C-NMR, and Raman spectroscopy. The electrochemical performances of the GO-COOZn and GO-COOMn supercapacitor were tested by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests. The results show that the asymmetric supercapacitor has electrochemical capacitance performance within potential range 0 ~ 0.7 (GO-COOZn) V, 0 ~ 1 (GO-COOMn) V. The supercapacitor delivered a specific capacitance of ~ 238 F/g (GO-COOZn) and ~ 300 F/g(GO-COOMn) at a current density of 50 mA/cm2. This method provides a facile and straightforward approach to deposit ZnO and α-Mn2O3 nanoparticles onto the graphene sheets and may be readily extended to the preparation of other classes of hybrids based on GO sheets for technological applications.
