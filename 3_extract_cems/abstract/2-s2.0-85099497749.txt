We present a one-step route for the preparation of nickel phosphide/carbon nanotube (Ni2P@CNT) nano-composites for supercapacitor applications using a facile, ultrafast (90 s) microwave-based approach. Ni2P nanoparticles could grow uniformly on the surface of CNTs under the optimized reaction conditions, namely, a feeding ratio of 30:50:25 for CNT, Ni(NO3)2 · 6H2O, and red phosphorus and a microwave power of 1000 W for 90 s. Our study demonstrated that the single-step microwave synthesis process for creating metal phosphide nanoparticles was faster and simpler than all the other existing methods. Electrochemical results showed that the specific capacitance of the optimal Ni2P@CNT-nanocomposite electrode displayed a high specific capacitance of 854 F · g−1 at 1 A · g−1 and a superior capacitance retention of 84% after 5000 cycles at 10 A·g−1. Finally, an asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled using the nanocomposite with activated carbon as one electrode (Ni2P@CNT//AC), which showed a remarkable energy density of 33.5 W · h · kg−1 and a power density of 387.5 W·kg−1. This work will pave the way for the microwave synthesis of other transition metal phosphide materials for use in energy storage systems. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
