This paper presents electrical characterization and power management circuit of textile-based enzymatic biofuel cell. Firstly, static electrical characteristics (open circuit voltage, short circuit current, and maximum power) of the enzymatic biofuel cell have been investigated by imposing a voltage across the biofuel cell and measuring corresponding output current. Output power of the biofuel cell has been characterized as a function of load resistance, while a glucose solution of 100 mM is fed from one end of the textile-based biofuel cell. Two-step approach based on supercapacitor and DC-DC converter has been proposed and tested as power management of the proposed biofuel cell.
