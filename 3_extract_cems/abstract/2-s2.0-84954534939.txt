We developed a simple method for fabricating a 3D (3-dimensional) porous Ag nonwoven mat for use as the current collector in supercapacitors, and investigated the supercapacitive properties of this mat using cyclic voltammetry. The specific capacitance of an activated carbon electrode on the 3D porous Ag nonwoven mat was 1.24 times greater than that observed for an activated carbon electrode on a conventional 2D (2-dimensional) Ag plate. Additionally, the system with the 3D porous Ag nonwoven mat showed a lower charge transfer resistance of the AC (activated carbon) electrode. These findings demonstrate that the 3D porous Ag nonwoven mat is suitable for use as the current collector in supercapacitors.
