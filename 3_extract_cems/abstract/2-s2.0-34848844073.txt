Based on the results of the experimental study in Part I [1], a holistic simulation model that combines electrical and thermal simulation of electrochemical double-layer capacitor (EDLC) modules with an ageing model is presented. This simulation model allows analysing self-accelerating degradation effects caused by elevated voltages and temperatures. Furthermore, the divergence of cell performance in a stack of cells can be investigated which makes the model a valuable tool for cell and stack design as well as for testing operating strategies and cooling systems.
