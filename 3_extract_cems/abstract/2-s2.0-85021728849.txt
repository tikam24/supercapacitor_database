The fabrication of nano-network structures for enhancing specific surface area and electrical conductivity is very crucial to attain high specific capacitance and energy density, which are important parameters to investigate a material for supercapacitor applications. Graphene oxide (GO) supported Al2S3 with hierarchical nanorambutan like morphology was fabricated by employing hydrothermal method. The determined high electrical conductivity, surface area, as well as the mechanical support offered by GO make the Al2S3 nanorambutan electrochemically active. The CV curves with well-defined redox peaks confirm the pseudocapacitive behavior of GO based hierarchical Al2S3 nanorambutan in 1 M NaOH electrolyte. The specific capacitance extracted from the CV curves is 1687.97 Fg−1 at the scan rate of 5 mVs−1. Moreover, a good galvanostatic discharge time of 903 s and a huge specific capacitance of 2178.16 Fg−1 at the current density of 3 mA cm−2 have been observed. The energy density calculated from the galvanostatic discharge is 108.91 WhKg−1 at the current density of 3 mA cm−2, while a power density of 978.92 WKg−1 is observed at the current density of 15 mA cm−2. The electrochemical impedance also confirms the pseudocapacitive nature of Al2S3 hierarchical nanorambutan electrode. The electrode stability test shows 57.84% retention of the specific capacitance up to 1000 cycles. The experimental results suggest that hierarchical Al2S3 nanorambutan is suitable electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
