To improve the electrochemical energy storage performance of the graphite nanoparticles/polyaniline (G/PANI) nanocomposites prepared via chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline with the MnO2 in the spent battery powder (SBP) as oxidant, graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets were added as 2D conductive support with different feeding ratios. The electrochemical properties of the resultant ternary GO/G/PANI nanocomposites were compared with their reduction products, the reduced graphene oxide/graphite nanoparticles/polyaniline (rGO/G/PANI) nanocomposites. The results showed that the reduction of the GO/G/PANI nanocomposites with hydrazine hydrate was favorable to the capacitive property, and the rGO/G/PANI-3 nanocomposite exhibited the highest specific capacitance of 421 F/g, with capacitance retention of 106.6% after 1000 cycles.
