Mesoporous carbon/graphene composite materials were fabricated by a chemical vapor deposition method using palm tree leaves as carbon resources and templates. The morphology, structure and surface area of the mesoporous carbon/graphene composite materials were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectrometry and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller specific surface area measurement, respectively. The electrochemical properties of the supercapacitor in 1 mol/L H2SO4 electrolyte were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge techniques. In three electrode system, the supercapacitor exhibits a superior specific capacitance value of 144 F/g at 1 A/g. Whereas in two electrode system, the specific capacitance reaches 138 F/g, which is slightly lower than that in three electrode system. Also, the supercapacitor has the excellent rate performance, and delivers a capacitance of 78 F/g at 20 A/g, which is close to that in three electrode system.
