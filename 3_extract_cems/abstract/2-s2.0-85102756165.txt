Reduced inertia negatively impacts the frequency stability of power systems resulting in worse frequency nadirs, larger rates of change of frequency, and more dynamic frequency behavior. The issue will become increasingly prevalent in future power systems containing large amounts of inverter-based resources. This paper presents a supercapacitor-based inertial response scheme for wind parks, which provides sufficient complementary active power injection (virtual inertia) for both the regulation and preservation of power system frequency stability. The performance of the wind turbine-supercapacitor combination is verified using a reduced-order, renewable-integrated east Australian test system. Supercapacitors are shown to be a feasible energy storage solution for power systems owing to their swift dynamic response during frequency excursions. Furthermore, the constant power characteristic of the wind park is demonstrated to aid frequency stability under some circumstances.
