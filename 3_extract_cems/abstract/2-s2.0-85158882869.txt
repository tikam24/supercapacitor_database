Energy requirement is increasing no matter what is the energy source. With the world's population projected to grow by around two billion people over the next twenty years, and with rising living standards, energy generation is estimated to rise by 49% by 2040. The major sources of energy are non-renewable, and their consumption leads to the deterioration of environment. In order to deal with the growing energy and environmental issues, energy conversion and storage (ECS) systems are predicted to be instrumental in the advancement of renewable technology. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), solar cells, water splitting photoelectrochemical cells, fuel cells and supercapacitors are important examples of ECS systems. The efficient use of ECS systems crucially relies on the synthesis of novel nanomaterials having superior performance, exceptional properties and are relatively cheaper. To meet the upcoming high demand of ECS, heterogeneous nanostructured metal chalcogenide materials are of immense interest due to their synergic properties and promising applications. This review is focused on providing an insight into the nanostructured metal chalcogenides, their different synthesis techniques, properties and ECS device applications including LIBs, solar cells and supercapacitors. This review will serve as a comprehensive guide for beginners as well as established researchers.
