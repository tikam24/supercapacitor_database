In order to prepare supercapacitor electrode materials with high specific capacitance and high stability, benzoxazineprecursor (C-BOZ) was synthesized from hexanediamine, cardanol and paraformaldehyde. Nitrogen doped ordered mesoporous carbon (NCC) was prepared using mesoporous silica-based molecular sieve (SBA-15) as template. The effects of mass ratio of flooding to template (1:0.6, 1:0.8 and 1:1) on electrochemical properties of carbon materials were investigated. The morphology and elements of the materials were characterized by N2 isothermal adsorption desorption, X-ray diffractometer (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results show that the specific surface area of NCC which was successfully reproduced from SBA-15 can reach 1 432 m2∙g-1. When the mass ratio of driving agent to template is 1:0.8, the specific capacitance reaches 464 F∙g-1 with the current density of 0.5 A∙g-1. The specific capacitance still remains 97.7% of the initial specific capacity after 6 000 cycles of charge and discharge, which indicates the material has good cycle stability.
