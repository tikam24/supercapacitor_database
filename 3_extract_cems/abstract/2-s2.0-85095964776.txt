To realize speed adjustment, achieve adaptive power allocation, and enhance operation safety, a synthetic strategy combining operation control and power allocation is proposed in this article for fuel cell (FC) hybrid tramway. First, the asynchronous motor model based on vector control is established. Considering available power variation with state of charge (SOC), a speed self-adjusting strategy is proposed to adjust the tramway speed actively and maintain the distance unchanged meanwhile. Besides, adaptive droop control is adopted to allocate demand power. To obtain better economic performance and SOC sustaining, the regulation factors for supercapacitor and battery are introduced to optimize the droop coefficients. Then, the proposed strategy is verified under a drive cycle of low floor light rail vehicle in a hardware-in-loop platform. The results demonstrate that the proposed strategy is sufficient to adjust the tramway speed and allocate power among sources to maintain the given speed when without enough power, thus the operation safety and system robustness is reinforced. The comparison with and without regulation factors is conducted to prove the effectiveness of the factors. The proposed strategy is also compared with the equivalent consumption minimization strategy to further prove its priority.
