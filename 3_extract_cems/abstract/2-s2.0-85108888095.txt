In this study, we prepared ceramic-based hydroxyapatite (HAp)/polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)/MnO2@MnCO3composites for high temperature-operable electrolyte-engraved planar supercapacitors. The electrode material was prepared to deposit a composite coating of HAp, PVP, and MnO2@MCO3on carbon clothviaa one-step hydrothermal technique. The chemical compositions, crystallinity, morphologies, and thermal stability of the resulting composites were investigated by carrying out Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy, and thermogravimetric analyses. The XPS profiles of the composites exhibited Mn 2p1/2(653.6 eV), Mn 2p3/2(642.2 eV), N 1s (401.3 eV), and C 1s (285.1 eV) peaks. The planar supercapacitor showed an areal capacitance of ∼84 mF cm−2and a gravimetric specific capacitance of 409.5 F g−1with energy density of 56.9 W h kg−1. The supercapacitor exhibited a specific capacitance of 126 F g−1up to 400 °C. The supercapacitor showed capacity retention of 90% after 100 000 charge-discharge cycles. The supercapacitor prepared in this study was found to be suitable for application in smart electronic devices operating at high temperatures.
