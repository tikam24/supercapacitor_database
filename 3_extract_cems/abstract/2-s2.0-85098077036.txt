The optimum electrochemical performance of the poly(3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/nickel foam (PEDOT/NF) composite electrode was obtained by studying the effect of PEDOT amount on the performance of the supercapacitor. Monomer 3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) was electroplated on NF with a larger specific area and high conductivity by one-step method, which adopted the cyclic voltammetry of electrochemical workstation with a voltage window from 0 to 1 V and scan rate of 100 mV/s. The morphology and element composition of the PEDOT/NF composite electrode were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray energy spectroscopy (EDS). The electrochemical performance of the PEDOT/NF composite electrode was systematically studied by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry and constant current charge and discharge. The results of SEM and EDS indicate that PEDOT is uniformly polymerized onto the backbone of NF and tightly combined with NF. The PEDOT/NF composite electrode material has a mass specific capacitance of 308.68 F/g at a sacn rate of 10 mV/s, a minimum resistance of 11.26 Î© at a constant current charge-discharge, energy density of 16.03 Wh/kg at the power density of 1444 W/kg, and 79.2% of the maximum capacitance after 3000 cycles in cyclic voltammetry. Supercapacitors using PEDOT/NF as electrode materials exhibits high mass specific capacitance, large energy density and power density, low resistance, excellent cycle stability, which shows excellent capacitor performance.
