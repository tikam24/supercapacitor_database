The supercapacitors possessing high energy storage and long serving period have strategic significance to solve the energy crisis issues. Herein, fluffy nano-dendrite structured cobalt phosphide (CoP) is grown on carbon cloth through simple hydrothermal and electrodeposition treatments (CoP/C-HE). Benefit from its excellent electrical conductivity and special structure, CoP/C-HE manifests a high specific capacity of 461.4 C g-1 at 1 A g-1. Meanwhile, the capacity retention remains 92.8% over 10 000 cycles at 5 A g-1, proving the superior cycling stability. The phase conversion of Co2P during the activation process also contributes to the improved performance. The assembled two-electrode asymmetric supercapacitor demonstrates excellent performance in terms of energy density (42.4 W h kg-1 at a power density of 800.0 W kg-1) and cycling stability (86.3% retention over 5000 cycles at 5 A g-1), which is superior to many reported cobalt-based supercapacitors. Our work promotes the potential of transition metal phosphides for the applications in supercapacitors.
