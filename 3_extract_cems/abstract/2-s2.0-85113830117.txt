The electric vehicle dynamic wireless power transfer (EV-DWPT) system effectively solves the mileage anxiety problem of electric vehicles (EVs). However, due to the change of mutual inductance in the process of vehicle driving, the output power of the system is unstable, which is not conducive to charging the battery. Therefore, this paper proposes a power stability control method of EV-DWPT based on sliding mode control (SMC) and supercapacitor. The Buck converter is used to control the output power, and the SMC method is used to suppress power fluctuation. The simulation and experimental results show that the SMC has good robustness and can effectively resist the system parameter perturbation caused by the change of mutual inductance. In addition, the overshoot of the system can be reduced from 50 to 30% with the utilization of the supercapacitor, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.
