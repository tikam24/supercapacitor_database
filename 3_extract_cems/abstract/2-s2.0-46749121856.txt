The positive electrode area of an EDLC where doesn't face to a negative electrode (PE non-confrontation area) was known as an easily deteriorate area. However, it didn't know that cause. In this paper, in the first, it was confirmed by an experiment a remarkable decline of the performance of an EDLC with non-confrontation area, and an unusual corrosion near the PE non-confrontation area also was observed. In the second, multi-probes (three lithium-metal reference electrodes) were set around an EDLC, and voltage changes among the electrodes were evaluated. Significant electric potential shifts were observed between the three reference electrodes near the area where positive and negative electrodes were not faced each other. The potential shifts were canceled after more than an hour, and the voltage between the three reference electrodes became the same value. To charge and to discharge the PE non-confrontation area several hours were needed. These phenomena can be related to the easily deteriorate area of positive electrode.
