This study presents a power management scheme for application in hybrid electric vehicle (EV) systems. Now a days, the green energy sources like solar photovoltaic, fuel cell, wind etc., are highly relevant and one of the their various applications is hybrid electric vehicle. The present work has chosen photovoltaic (PV) as the main power source of EV due its high efficiency, and high reliability. However, in order to mitigate with the intermittency problem of solar cell, auxiliary source is required to be incorporated along with PV. Specially, when high power is required in the load, PV with MPPT alone cannot fulfill the load demand without the help of back-up sources. Hence here PV /battery/ultra-capacitor hybrid energy system is considered. Battery cells and ultra-capacitor are used as backup sources. They are used to store excess solar energy through the bidirectional DC-DC converter and discharge the power to the load when required. Here, two cascaded boost converters are used in PV side. Between them 1st converter is used to extract the maximum power through PO(MPPT) controller and 2nd converter is used to make the DC link voltage stable. The MATLAB simulation results are represented and observed to express the behavior of the responses even in presence of variation in load as well as in different illumination condition of PV module with MPPT algorithm and also to show the power coordination between PV cell , battery and ultra-capacitor.
