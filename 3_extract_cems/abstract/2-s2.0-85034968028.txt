In the search for clothlike wearable energy-storage devices with both high energy density and high power density, metal fibers surrounded by micro metal dendrites, as current collectors, are either rooted inside a thick layer of carbon particles or wrapped with flowerlike nano NiO in a similar manner to the root or stem system of natural plants, to form dendritic cablelike negative or positive electrodes. These dendritic cable electrodes could be further combined or woven into flexible solid-type supercapacitive garland or fabric, together with cotton wires. Benefiting from the ultra large interface of the metal dendrites current collector, it can be charged up to 1.8 V, and give an energy density of 0.1408 mWh cm-2 and a power density of 3.01 mW cm-2, which is capable of directly starting a small electric car with a short and flexible piece of supercapacitor.
