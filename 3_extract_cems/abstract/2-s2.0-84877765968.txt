This paper reports the design, modeling and implementation of a controlled latching method for assembling two-dimensionally patterned micro-plates into three-dimensional MEMS structures. The technique is based on melting, fusing and then solidifying photo-patterned polymer pads on the assembled plates. Resistive heaters made in an underlying gold wire pattern are used to melt the pads. The pads can be individually addressed, providing control over the latching sequence of segments in a multi-segment device. After solidification, the fused pads on the mating segments form a strong bond that holds the pieces together. The latching method was demonstrated by assembling a two-layered supercapacitor. The strength of the bond established by a pair of 100 μm × 200 μm oval pads was found to exceed 6.8 μN.
