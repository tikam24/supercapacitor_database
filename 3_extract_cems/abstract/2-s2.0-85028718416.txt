This paper proposes a standard and flexible test bench architecture for the testing and modeling of electrochemical energy modules. It also presents a comprehensive methodology that enables to obtain accurate models under realistic operating conditions with a low computational cost. For this purpose, three different configuration modes of the experimental architecture setup are introduced. Finally, the test bench architecture and the experimental methodology proposed have been validated by the modeling and testing of a Li-ion battery pack and a supercapacitor module.
