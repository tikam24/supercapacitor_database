A two‐step process was applied to synthesize the cobalt ferrite‐graphene composite materials in a one‐pot hydrothermal reaction process. Graphene Oxide (GO) was synthesized by a modified Hummer’s method. The synthesized composite materials were characterized by X‐ray dif-fraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE‐SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The XRD and FTIR results were in good agreement with the TGA/DTG observations. SEM and TEM disclosed the spherical shape of the nanoparticles in 4–10 nm. The optimized CoFe2O4‐G (1–5 wt.%) composite materials samples were tried for their conductivity, supercapacity, and corrosion properties. The CV results demonstrated a distinctive behavior of the supercapacitor, while the modified CoFe2O4‐G (5 wt.%) electrode demonstrated a strong reduction in the Rct value (∼94Ω). The highest corrosion current density valves and corrosion rates were attained in the CoFe2O4‐G (5 wt.%) composite materials as 5.53 and 0.20, respectively. The high conductivity of graphene that initiated the poor corrosion rate of the CoFe2O4‐graphene composite materials could be accredited to the high conductivity and reactivity.
