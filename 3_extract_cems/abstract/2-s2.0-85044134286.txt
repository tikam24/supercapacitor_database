A tanghulu-like NiO microcubes on Co3O4 nanowires array anchored on Ni foam was prepared via a facile method. As a pseudocapacitor electrode, the hybrid array exhibits a specific capacitance as high as 2691 mF cm-2 at 2 mA cm−2 and good cycling stability of 84.62% retention after 2000 cycles. Remarkably, the NiO/Co3O4/NF composite demonstrates about 2 times higher specific capacitance than that of Co3O4/NF precursor at a current density of 2 mA cm−2. The improved electrochemical performance could be attributed to the synergistic effect of uniqure tanghulu-like wire-penetrated-cube hybrid arrays on Ni foam conductive substrate. Most importantly, a red light-emitting diode (LED) can be illuminated by two connected ASCs, indicating that as-synthesized NiO/Co3O4/NF possesses great potential for practical applications.
