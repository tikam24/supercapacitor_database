The purpose of suppressing self-stacking between 2D materials was achieved by using the structural characteristics of Ti3C2Tx and carbon nanotube (CNT). A mesoporous structure was priorily constructed on the surface of Ti3C2Tx, and composite fibers were synergistically prepared with CNT by wet spinning, which further increased the ion transport channels in the fiber electrode. The results show that the p-Ti3C2Tx /CNT fiber electrode exhibited the highest volumetric capacitance of 167.9 F/cm3 at a scan rate of 5 mV/s. The specific capacitance of the assembled symmetric fiber supercapacitor was 107.6 F/cm3 at a current density of 0.2 A/cm3. The specific capacitance retention rate reached at 88.3% after 10000 charge-discharge cycles and showed a good electrochemical performance under different bending angles.
