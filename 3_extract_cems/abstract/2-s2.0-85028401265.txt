Power systems for exploration rovers tend to be complex as three separate converters are necessary; in addition to a main dc-dc converter and cell equalizer for rechargeable energy storage cells, an equalizer for photovoltaic (PV) modules is desirably equipped in order to preclude negative impacts of partial shading. This paper proposes the pulse width modulation (PWM) converter integrating voltage equalizers for PV modules and energy storage cells. The proposed integrated converter comprises a switched capacitor converter, PWM buck converter, and series-resonant voltage multiplier that perform PV equalization, power conversion from the PV modules to the load, and cell equalization, respectively. Three converters can be integrated into a single unit with reducing the total switch counts, achieving not only system-level but also circuit-level simplifications. The derivation procedure of the integrated converter is explained, followed by the operation analysis. Experimental tests were performed using series-connected supercapacitor (SC) modules and solar array simulators to emulate a partial shading condition. With the integrated converter, the extractable maximum power from the PV modules significantly increased while voltage imbalance of SC modules was adequately eliminated, demonstrating the integrated performance of the proposed converter.
