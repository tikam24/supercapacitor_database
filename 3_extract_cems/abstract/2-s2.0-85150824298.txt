The multiple oxidation states of redox-active materials enable them to store high-energy better than the commonly used carbon-based electrode materials. Accounting for these advantages, designing asymmetric supercapacitors by coupling redox-active materials as positive electrodes with carbon-based negative electrodes becomes a very attractive strategy. Herein, reduced graphene oxide-wrapped hexagonal WO3 nanorod (rGO-WO3 NR) by simple hydrothermal synthesis method is synthesized. Because of improved reaction kinetics resulting from the close contact between rGO and WO3 NRs, rGO-WO3 NR demonstrates superior electrochemical properties than pure WO3. Motivated by the very high areal capacitance (2.5 F cm−3 at the applied current of 30 mA cm−2), an asymmetric SC device by combining rGO-WO3 NR with activated carbon is assembled. The as-assembled rGO-WO3 NR//activated carbon asymmetric supercapacitor device demonstrates outstanding electrochemical performance in an operating voltage window of 1.2 V, admirable cycling stability of ≈95% (even after 14 000 cycles), with an energy density of 24.1 Wh Kg−1 at a power density of 1532.6 W Kg−1. These demonstrate the combination of redox-active materials with high energy density can importantly boost the energy storage capacity of a supercapacitor.
