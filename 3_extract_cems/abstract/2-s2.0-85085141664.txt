Biomass carbon materials have the advantages of low cost, wide source, adjustable and controllable porosity, diverse morphology, easy production, and easy to incorporate heteroatoms. Therefore, the development and application of biomass carbon-based materials have become a very important area in modern materials science. In this work, the plant leaves were treated by hydrothermal oxidation with different oxidants. Then the obtained product was pyrolyzed at 600 â„ƒ to obtain biomass carbon materials. Compared with the traditional pyrolysis methods, hydrothermal oxygen reaction could reduce the pyrolysis temperature and maintain the vein structure of leaves to a great extent. Graphene like thin-layer carbonization materials were obtained. The samples were characterized by XRD, XPS, TEM and SEM. The results show that the properties of the carbon materials obtained by hydrothermal oxidation with different oxidants were different. When the oxidant was KMnO4, the obtained biomass carbon material (MnOC) retained the original microscopic pores of the blade and formed new pores. Its specific surface area could reach 482.934 m2/g with an average pore size of 3.833 nm. XRD and XPS results show that the degree of graphitization of MnOC was relatively high and preserved the N element (6.5%) as much as possible. TEM and AFM analysis shows that MnOC had a lamellar structure with the thickness of less than 2 nm. The MnOC exhibited the capacitance of 191.15 F/g at 1 A/g.
