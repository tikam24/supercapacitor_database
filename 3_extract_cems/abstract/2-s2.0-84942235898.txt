This chapter explores the electrical characteristics and modeling techniques of major types of renewable energy systems and competent energy storage devices, namely batteries, fuel cells, PV cells, ultracapacitors, and flywheels. Due to their high specific energy and the potential to be produced at low cost, Li-ion batteries are expected to widely replace Ni-MH batteries for future electric propulsion applications. The Li-ion battery consists of oxidized cobalt material on the positive electrode, carbon on the negative electrode, and lithium salt in an organic solvent as the electrolyte. Electrochemical double-layer capacitors or ultracapacitors work in much the same way as regular capacitors, in that there is no ionic or electronic transfer, resulting in a chemical reaction. Flow batteries, also called redox (reduction-oxidation) batteries, comprise two electrolytes, separated by ion or proton exchange membrane. Energy can be stored in the electrolytes by increasing the potential difference between the two liquids. Flywheels are most definitely finding numerous applications as energy storage devices in various power system configurations. Furthermore, the constant improvement in digital signal processing and microprocessor technologies in conjunction with the recent development in magnetic material technology makes this fact a distinct possibility.
