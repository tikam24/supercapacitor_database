Hybrid nano-architectures with high electrochemical performance for supercapacitors have been designed by growing hierarchical ZnO NRs@CuS@PEDOT@MnO2 core@shell heterostructured nanorod arrays on ITO/glass substrates. This hybrid nano-structured electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, with a high specific areal capacitance of 19.85 mF cm-2, good rate capability, cycling stability and diffused coloured transparency.
