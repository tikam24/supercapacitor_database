To overcome the drawback of low electrical conductivity within supercapacitor applications, several surfactants are used for nanoscale V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf> to enhance the specific surface area. Polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG-6000), sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS), and Pluronic P-123 (P123) controllers, if used as soft templates, easily form large specific surface area crystals. However, the specific mechanism through which this occurs and the influence of these surfactants is not clear for V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf><inf>2</inf>O. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the mechanism of crystal growth through hydrothermal processes and the pseudocapacitive behavior of these crystals formed by using diverse surfactants, including PEG-6000, SDBS, and P123. Our results show that different surfactants can dramatically influence the morphology and capacitive behavior of V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf><inf>2</inf>O powders. Linear nanowires, flower-like flakes, and curly bundled nanowires can be obtained because of electrostatic interactions in the presence of PEG-6000, SDBS, and P123, respectively. Furthermore, the electrochemical performance of these powders shows that the nanowires, which are electrodes mediated by PEG-6000, exhibit the highest capacitance of 349Fg<sup>-1</sup> at a scan rate of 5mVs<sup>-1</sup> of all the surfactants studied. However, a symmetric P123 electrode comprising curly bundled nanowires with numerous nanopores showed an excellent and stable specific capacitance of 127Fg<sup>-1</sup> after 200cycles. This work is beneficial to understanding the fundamental role of the surfactant in the assisted growth of V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf><inf>2</inf>O and the resulting electrochemical properties of the pseudocapacitors, which could be useful for the future design of appropriate materials. Morphing into it: The effect of diverse surfactants on the morphology of V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf><inf>2</inf>O powders is studied. The pseudocapacitive behavior of V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf><inf>2</inf>O powders mediated by polyethylene glycol 6000exhibit a high capacitance at a scan rate of 5mVs<sup>-1</sup>. Moreover, the V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf><inf>2</inf>O electrode mediated by Pluronic P-123 delivers a high capacitance with excellent stability after 200cycles.
