As a key index to evaluate the performance of power system of more electric aircraft (MEA), power supply reliability is closely related to flight safety. The power allocation methods of fuel cell-battery-supercapacitor hybrid power supply system for MEA have disadvantages of relatively high cost, low reliability and poor flexibility. Therefore, this paper proposes a highly reliable decentralized dynamic power allocation strategy based on the modified mixed droop control method. It can simultaneously achieve the optimized load power allocation among power supply units, state-of-charge regulation of energy storage units and regenerative energy recycling. If one power supply unit is disconnected from the system due to malfunction, the proposed strategy can still realize dynamic power allocation among other power supply units to ensure the normal power supply of critical loads. Experiments verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed strategy.
