Ni doped V2O5 nanorods were synthesized by simple solâ€“gel route. The effect of Ni doping has been studied through XRD, Micro-Raman, SEM and CV analysis. The XRD result shows that the synthesized samples were exhibits orthorhombic structured V2O5. SEM images illustrate the Ni particles are decorated on the V2O5 rod surfaces. From the Raman analysis, the prepared samples are observed in V-O vibrational modes without impurities. Both V2O5 and Ni:V2O5 electrodes are exhibits pseudocapacitance nature, which shows the superior specific capacitance values for 112 and 152 Fg-1 at 10 mVs-1, respectively.
