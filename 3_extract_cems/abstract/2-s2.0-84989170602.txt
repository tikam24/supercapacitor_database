This paper describes the electrospray of resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) sol on a carbon paper for making carbon electrodes. The sol layer undergoes curing, solvent removal, and pyrolysis under an inert atmosphere. In a separate study, the powdered carbon samples were derived from bulk RF-gel samples, prepared in bottles. The gel composition and the processing method were systematically varied. The EDX and BET analyses of the carbon samples helped in arriving at an optimized composition of the precursor sol, and the processing method for the electrospray derived carbon film. The electrodes showed a specific capacitance of 200 F g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 of current density with 2 M potassium chloride solution as electrolyte. The high value of specific capacitance was possible by the splitting of precursor sol prior to deposition on the current collector, and also by removal of solvent by lyophilization that retained the pore structure of the gel.
