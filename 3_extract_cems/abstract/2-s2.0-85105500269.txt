Zero-dimensional amorphous Ni3S4 quantum dots (QDs) are easy to agglomerate due to their huge surface energy and van der Waals force, and have a large number of interfaces that hinder electron transfer. Although the zeolite imidazole framework nanosheets (ZIN-P) have a conductive conjugated system, but the specific capacity is relatively low. Here, we propose a synergistic strategy that combines amorphous Ni3S4 QDs and ZIN-P, so that the electrochemical performance of the composite material is better than that of a single component. It was demonstrated that the electrochemical performance of the composite material can be enhanced twice versus that of amorphous Ni3S4 QDs and 6 times versus that of ZIN-P. Subsequently, Ni3S4 QDs@ZIN-P and activated carbon were assembled into an asymmetric supercapacitor, the energy density can reach 41.5 Wh kgâˆ’1. This work is expected to add new ideas for the rational design of electrode material structure.
