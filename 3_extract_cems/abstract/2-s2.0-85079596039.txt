CoO-C nanowires can be large-scale synthesized with the Co(MAA)2 nanowires as precursors, which are fabricated by a simple self-assembled process at room temperature. Since the Co2+ ions are uniformly distributed in the precursor at molecular level, the generated CoO nanoparticles are well dispersed in the whole carbon nanowires. Such “brick and cement” hybrid structures of CoO and carbon are regarded as reasonable structures to achieve supercapacitor with high specific capacitance and outstanding cycle performance. To investigate the effect of heating rates on the electrochemistry performance, CoO-C nanowires with different heating rates are prepared in the atmosphere of nitrogen. The as-prepared CoO-C electrode shows the highest specific capacity of 187 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g. More importantly, the cyclic stability of the CoO-C hybrid electrode is extraordinary. Over 90% of the capacitance is retained after a long cycle exceeding 12,000 cycles.
