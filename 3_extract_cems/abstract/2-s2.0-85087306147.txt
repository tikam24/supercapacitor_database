Transition metal hydro/oxides (TMH/Os) are treated as the most promising alternative supercapacitor electrodes thanks to their high theoretical capacitance due to the various oxidation states and abundant cheap resources of TMH/Os. However, the poor conductivity and logy reaction kinetics of TMH/Os severely restrict their practical application. Herein, hierarchical core–shell P-Ni(OH)2@Co(OH)2 micro/nanostructures are in situ grown on conductive Ni foam (P-Ni(OH)2@Co(OH)2/NF) through a facile stepwise hydrothermal process. The unique heterostructure composed of P-Ni(OH)2 rods and Co(OH)2 nanoflakes boost the charge transportation and provide abundant active sites when used as the intergrated cathode for supercapacitors. It delivers an ultrahigh areal specific capacitance of 4.4 C cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2 and the capacitance can maintain 91% after 10 000 cycles, showing an ultralong cycle life. Additionally, a hybrid supercapacitor composed with P-Ni(OH)2@Co(OH)2/NF cathode and Fe2O3/CC anode shows a wider voltage window of 1.6 V, a remarkable energy density of 0.21 mWh cm−2 at the power density of 0.8 mW cm−2, and outstanding cycling stability with about 81% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles. This innovative study not only supplies a newfashioned electronic apparatus with high-energy density and cycling stability but offers a fresh reference and enlightenment for synthesizing advanced integrated electrodes for high-performance hybrid supercapacitors.
