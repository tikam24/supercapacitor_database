Two key features—non-volatility and non-flammability—make ionic liquids (ILs) very attractive for use as electrolyte solvents in advanced energy storage systems, such as supercapacitors and Li-ion batteries. Since most ILs possess high viscosity and are less prone to dissolving common electrolytic salts when compared to traditional electrolytic solvents, they must be formulated with low viscosity thinner solvents to achieve desired ionic conductivity and dissolution of electrolyte salts in excess of 0.5 M concentration. In the past few years, our research group has synthesized several specifically designed ILs (mono-cationic, di-cationic, and zwitterionic) with bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (TFSI) and dicyanamide (DCA) as counter anions. This article describes several electrolyte formulations to achieve superior electrolytic properties. The performance of a few representative IL-based electrolytes in supercapacitor coin cells is presented.
