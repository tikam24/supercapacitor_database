Conducting polymer and carbon-based materials are important in supercapacitor applications as capacitive materials. However, the use of these materials alone limits their application due to poor rate capability and short lifetime or low capacitance. Herein, the supercapacitor electrodes were successfully synthesized by two step process on the carbon-felt. Firstly, S-GO, N-GO and Cl-GO was obtained by chronoamperometry method at room temperature. After, PANI composites were synthesized through a hydrothermal method with S, N and Cl heteroatom doped graphene oxide powders. The best specific capacitance for Cl-GO doped PANI (PANI/Cl-GO) electrode reaches 1217 mFcm−2 (608.3 Fg−1) at 4 A g−1 and, significantly higher that the results of PANI and other hybrids. Moreover, the symmetric supercapacitor using PANI/Cl-GO electrodes demonstrates excellent long-life performance after 5000 cycle (96.9%). The device has a maximum energy density of 42.8 Wh kg−1 while delivering a power density of 250 W kg−1
