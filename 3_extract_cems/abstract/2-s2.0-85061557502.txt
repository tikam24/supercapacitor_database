In this work, three Cu metal-organic framework samples with tunable rhombic, squama, and trucated bipyramid morphologies have been synthesized at 0, 25, and 60 Â°C, respectively, and further employed as precursors to initially prepare Cu@C composites by the calcination-thermolysis procedure. Then Cu@C composites have been etched with HCl and subsequently activated with KOH to obtain activated porous carbon (APC-0,-25, and-60). Interestingly, APC-25 presents a loose multilevel morphology of cabbage and possesses the largest specific surface area (1880.4 m 2 g -1 ) and pore volume (0.81 cm 3 g -1 ) among these APC materials. Consequently, APC-25 also exhibits the highest specific capacitance of 196 F g -1 at 0.5 A g -1 , and the corresponding symmetric supercapacitor cell (SSC) achieves a remarkable energy density of 11.8 Wh kg -1 at a power density of 350 W kg -1 . Furthermore, APC-25 shows excellent cycling stability, and the loss of capacitance is only 7.7% even after 10000 cycles at 1 A g -1 . Significantly, five light-emitting diodes can be lit by six SSCs, which proves that APC-25 can be used in energy storage devices.
