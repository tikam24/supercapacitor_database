Constructing manganese oxide nanoparticles with different crystal structures and morphologies is crucial for the development of improved supercapacitors. Here, zero-dimensional (0D) α-MnO2 and δ-MnO2 nanoparticles were first synthesized by an ultra-simple solvent-free synthetic strategy. The α-MnO2 nanoparticles exhibited better performance for supercapacitors than δ-MnO2 nanoparticles due to a higher specific surface area and accelerated electrical charge transfer. Two-dimensional (2D) α-MnO2 nanosheets and three-dimensional (3D) flower-like α-MnO2 microspheres were also fabricated by the inclusion of surfactants to investigate the effects of morphology on electrochemical storage capacity with the assistance of different surfactants. Notably, 3D α-MnO2 microspheres exhibited enhanced electrochemical properties than 0D α-MnO2 nanoparticles and 2D α-MnO2 nanosheets for supercapacitors, and generated a favorable specific capacitance of 212.8 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, primarily originating from high porosity, which allows the full infiltration of electrolytes and the rapid shuttling of ions. This work thus describes a simple strategy for the synthesis of 2D nanosheets and 3D self-assembled nanostructures of MnO2 for application in supercapacitor development.
