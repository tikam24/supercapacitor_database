The paper objective is to propose an innovative power converter topology combining the advantages of capacitor discharge and switch-mode converters to generate half sinusoidal fast current pulses with high precision. The capacitor discharge operation mode of the converter allows the generation of current pulses with fast transient response and the switch-mode operation enables the control of the pulse shape with high precision. The Energetic Macroscopic Representation permits to address these two aspects using a unified formalism and to deduce the control laws for the regulation of the hybrid converter voltage and current. In this paper, the converter requirements are presented and the proposed topology is described. The converter is then modelled using EMR and its control loops are defined. Finally, simulations results are given.
