The authors have developed an EV traction system with microcontroller power management, based on feedback on the electric motor current consumption and SC charging rate control. The stand in a scale of 1:5 on the EV power system capacity was developed to evaluate the effectiveness of this system. The research results of electric vehicle (EV) acceleration mode using the combined power supplies, consisting of supercapacitors (SC) and storage battery (STB) were given in the paper. It was found that SC-based power supply provides the required peak power in the EV power supply system. At the same time, double increase in SC capacity does not give an adequate increase in discharge current. It is shown that the SC with low energy intensity is able to operate in the EV traction system with a small acceleration time. The proposed microcontroller management system of STB and SC operating modes in the EV traction system provides optimal and operational EM power management. The developed stand allows to increase charging run time.
