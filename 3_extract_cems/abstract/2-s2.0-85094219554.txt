A transition metal phosphide is an excellent candidate for supercapacitors due to its superiorelectrical conductivity and high theoretical capacity. In addition, compared with traditional 3D nano-materials, 2D nanosheets possess a greater specific surface area and shorter electron transport distance. In this study, a reasonable approach is proposed for the synthesis of ZIF-67 nanosheets on nickel foam with subsequent phosphorization by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to obtain flake-like CoP combined with Ni2P (NCP/NF), in which nickel foam serves as the current collectoras well as the resource of Ni to form Ni2P. Benefiting from the nanosheet array of CoP, the NCP/NF can improve the capacity of Ni2P from 0.57 C cm-2 to 1.43 C cm-2 at 1 mA cm-2. Furthermore, the NPC/NF/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) shows an energy density of 26.9 Î¼W h cm-2 at a power density of 0.896 mW cm-2, and excellent cycling performance with a capacity retention of 93.75% after 5000 cycles at 10 mA cm-2.
