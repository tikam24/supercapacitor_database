The current study demonstrates the layered nanospheres of NiCo2S4/NiO/NF that were synthesized using the facile and economical chemical bath deposition that was employed as a potential electrode for supercapacitors. Various electrochemical analyses were made using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, potentiostatic electron impedance spectroscopy. The structure, phase, morphology, and chemical composition were examined by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The as-synthesized precursors of electroactive material behavior were illustrated by the three-electrode setup where 3 M KOH was deployed as an electrolyte. The peculiar and unique structural features of the nanoparticles enable and deliver effective pathways for swift electronic and ionic diffusion. Hence, as-synthesized binder-free NCS/NiO/NF showed a dominant specific capacity of 188.03 mA h g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, the enhanced rate capability of 80.63%, and the predominant cycling stability of 92.56% over 4000 cycles which are considered an appreciable value than the independent NCS/NF and NiO/NF electrodes. The results in this study portray the fact that the nanocomposite of NCS/NiO/NF establishes an excellent energy storage performance for next-generation supercapacitor applications.
