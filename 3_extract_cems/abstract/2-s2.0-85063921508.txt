Recently, flexible energy devices have been used to power up portable electronics such as E-skins, smart clothes, and bendable displays. However, the usage of rigid and inactive components in electrode materials limits the application in flexible energy devices. Here, we report a novel method to fabricate porous polyaniline composites (Pt_CPPy/PANI:CSA) using Pt decorated carboxyl polypyrrole nanoparticles (Pt_CPPyNPs) as a nucleating agent for electrodes of supercapacitors. The specific capacitance and electrical conductivity of the Pt_CPPy/PANI:CSA film are 325.0 F g−1 and 814 S cm−1, respectively, which are much higher than those of the pristine PANI:CSA film. Furthermore, the porous PANI:CSA composites exhibit excellent rate capability and cycling stability as the pores in the PANI structure enhance the active surface area between PANI and the ions of the electrolytes. This unique fabrication technique is an effective approach for preparing large scale highly porous polyaniline nanomaterials for diverse electrochemical applications.
