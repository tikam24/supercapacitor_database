The objective of this work is to improve the power management subsystem of a hybrid fuel cell / supercapacitor power generation system. The predictive approach is a relevant available control strategy that can explicitly handle constraints including soft ones and that can also deal with multiple control inputs. Some improvements are presented to shorten the computation time which is very important in practical cases. The first results show the interest of the proposed approach and the possible improvements.
