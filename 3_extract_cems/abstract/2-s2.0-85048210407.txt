Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) are promising electrode materials for electrochemical double layer capacitors due to their high porosity and electrical conductivity. CNFs were prepared by electrospinning and subsequent thermal treatment of a new precursor polymer, 6FDA-durene, without the addition of pore generating agents. The conversion of precursor nanofibers into CNFs was confirmed using Raman spectroscopy. CNFs were activated and annealed, and nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements were conducted to determine surface area and porosity. These activated/annealed CNFs were used as binderless electrodes in coin cells with an ionic liquid electrolyte. The devices displayed a specific capacitance of 128 F g-1, an energy density of 63.4 Wh kg-1 (at 1 A g-1), and a power density of 11.0 KW kg-1 (at 7 A g-1).
