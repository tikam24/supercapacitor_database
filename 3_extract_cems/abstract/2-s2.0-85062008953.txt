In this paper, the Ni2P nanostructures were grown on the surface of Ni foam (NF) via a phosphorization reaction of Ni(OH)2 nanostructures that were synthesized by a facile, low-cost hydrothermal reaction of NF in 15 mM urea solution without nickel salt. Others, the obtained NF loaded by Ni2P nanostructures (Ni2P-NF) can be used as a binder-free electrode. Electrochemical testing was used to research the electrochemical performances of the Ni2P-NF as supercapacitors electrode. Results showed that the Ni2P-NF electrode displays remarkable specific capacitance of 2031 mF cm−2 (2539 F g−1) at the current density of 1 mA cm−2 (2859 mF cm−2 (3574 F g−1) at the potential scan rate of 5 mV s−1), good rate capability, and prominent cycle stability (the capacitance retention is 89.3% after 2500 cycles). Therefore, the self-supported Ni2P-NF is an excellent electrode for high-performance supercapacitors.
