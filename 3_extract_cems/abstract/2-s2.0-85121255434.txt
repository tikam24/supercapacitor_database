The energy management strategy of passenger vehicles that adopts the hybrid energy form of the fuel cell, battery and supercapacitor was complicated. Traditional power following-logic threshold filtering strategy could better use the power directly output by fuel cell(FC) and reduce the loss of charge and discharge. In some power ranges, the energy produced by the fuel cell lagged behind the demand power. In response to this problem, the power following-logic threshold filtering strategy is optimized based on dynamic allocation. According to the parameters of the vehicle, Simulink/Powertrain was used to build a power system model to verify the effectiveness of the current strategy under urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS) and then compared with the traditional control strategy. The optimized energy management strategy decreases hydrogen consumption by 1.9%; the proportion of power above 10 kW is reduced by about 20%; the battery end state of charge (SOC) values under the control strategy before and after the improvement are 51.64 and 50.91, respectively.
