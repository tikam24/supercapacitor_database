Currently, researchers are struggling with the development of energy storage systems, like high energy density supercapacitors, with cheap cost and high stability. Herein research we present a facile preparation and evaluation of the manganese ferrite/graphene oxide (MnFe2O4/GO) nanocomposite electrochemical behavior as active electrode material in supercapacitors. The chemical composition and morphology were specified with different physicochemical characterization techniques. The TEM and FESEM images exhibit MnFe2O4 semi-spherical nanoparticles on GO plates. The prepared electrodes performance were proceeded with charge-discharge galvanostatic measurement (GCD), electrochemical impedance (EIS), and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The specific capacity value of MnFe2O4/GO new composite determined 298 F gâˆ’1 in 1 A/g current density. Also MnFe2O4/GO electrodic composite shows acceptable GCD stability, by maintaining its original capacity of 92% at 500 cycles. The EIS analysis also displays low internal resistance of MnFe2O4/GO compared to other electrodes in the same conditions. In addition to experimental analysis, density functional theory was also used to get a more accurate understanding of the electrochemical behavior of electrode materials. The theoretical results showed that with the formation of MnFe2O4/GO nanocomposite, the electron conductivity is improved (energy gap decreases to 0.019 eV) and leads to an increase in supercapacitor performance, which is in agreement with the experimental results.
