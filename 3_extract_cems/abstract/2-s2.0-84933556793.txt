Some aging effects limit current supply to the Integrated Circuit (IC) due to the instable switching power supply, requiring an additional specific circuit board for supplying and regulating electric power to the main circuit board. It can be solved by depositing a capacitance layer on top of circuitry substrate. Copper (Cu) nanotube (NT)-based micro-chip capacitors fabricated onto an IC can be used to compensate the power requirement in regulating electric power to a circuit board. In this work, a process for fabricating NTs electrodes which may be compatible with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) is presented. Cu NTs were used as the electrode materials for the on-chip capacitors. Anodized Oxide aluminum (AAO) templates integrated on SiO2/Si substrates were used for fabrication of a vertical array of Cu NTs. The surface area of the capacitor was increased by adding Cu NTs which enable a high density of capacitance for the devices.
