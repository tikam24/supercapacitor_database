Transition metal sulfides have got more concerns in the field of new energy devices. However, their practical application is vastly limited due to the high cost. In this report, we develop a simple self-templating approach to synthesize novel hollow CuCo 2 S 4 nanoprism as a redox-type electrode. Owing to the hollow characteristic, the CuCo 2 S 4 electrode offers a high specific capacity of 560 F g -1 at 1 A g -1 and displays 53.5% retention from 1 to 10 A g -1 in 3 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. This result provides a new route to prepare the other metal electrode materials for supercapacitors.
