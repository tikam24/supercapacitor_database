In this paper, we have successfully synthesized Zn-chitosan aerogels by freeze drying and further obtained N-doped hierarchically porous carbon (NHPC) aerogels through a one-step carbonization process. Zn ions as activators and soft templates can efficiently fabricate hierarchical porous structures in a carbon matrix. By adjusting the ratio of zinc-chitosan complexes, the structure and morphology of NHPC can be controlled. In three-electrode systems, the optimal NHPC shows a superior capacity of 230 F g-1(0.5 A g-1) and excellent cycle stability. In two-electrode systems, the symmetric supercapacitors deliver a high energy density and power density in aqueous electrolytes (4.67 W h kg-1and 5101 W kg-1, respectively). Our work provides a prospect for the efficient preparation of biomass porous carbons and the development of high-performance supercapacitor electrode materials.
