Due to the rapid increase in the global energy consumption of fossil fuels there has been an urgent demand for the development of alternative energy sources, one of them is a hybrid asymmetric supercapacitor. Electrode materials play a significant role in providing high performance for them. It was proposed as a cheap and environmentally friendly material to use activated carbon derived from plant raw materials. The properties of activated carbon derived from birch wood, corn trunks and leaves and beet pulp as electrode material for these devices were investigated. It has been established that the investigated types of biocarbon have asymmetric properties during polarization of potentials of different signs. It is shown that ultrasonic irradiation of activated carbon from birch wood, beet pulp, trunks and leaves of corn leads to an increase in the asymmetry of the spatial charge region width in the solid phase at cathode and anode polarizations. This providing a high capacity (up to 214 F/g) if the charge accumulation takes place in the negative potential region.
