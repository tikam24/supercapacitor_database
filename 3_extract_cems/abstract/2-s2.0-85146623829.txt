In present study, nanospheres of CeO2 are fabricated via utilizing a solvothermal mixed solvent technique at a low temperature. Using a three-electrode set up, the electrochemical activity of CeO2 nanospheres in 2.0 M alkaline medium was evaluated. At a scan range of 5 mV s−1, the material displayed large stability, the ability to work at high rates, and columbic efficiency, like specific capacitance value of 1435 F g−1 with specific energy of 87.89 Whkg−1 as well the power density of 1.0986 Wkg−1. The outstanding outcome of the CeO2 nanosphere is due to its mesoporous structure and high electrical double-layer capacitance of 6.35 mF. The nanospheres morphology of CeO2 was responsible for increased conductivity that allows ions to pass easily, and the improved findings show that the procedure employed to make the oxides, which is beneficial for future generations and may be used to produce a variety of oxides that will resolve the energy issues.
