Abstract: Bismuth iron oxide (BFO) nanoparticles film prepared by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) process has been explored for supercapacitor application. EPD process has several benefits compared to other techniques such as vacuum free, controllability over nanofilms and suitable method to prepare electrodes. The structure of the as-deposited film was characterized using X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The morphology of the as-deposited BFO nanoparticles film was examined with scanning electron microscopy. Cyclic voltammetry and constant current charging/discharging methods were employed to study the electrochemical properties of BFO nanoparticles films. The BFO nanoparticles film exhibited a specific capacitance of 7.4 mF/cm2 determined at a scan rate of 10 mV/s.
