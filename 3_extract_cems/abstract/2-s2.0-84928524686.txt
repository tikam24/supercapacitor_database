Carbon aerogel was prepared by a sol-gel polymerization of resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) method, and it was activated with CO<inf>2</inf> to obtain activated carbon aerogel (ACA). A series of modified activated carbon aerogels (MACA-X, X = 3, 6, 9, and 12 h) were then prepared by HNO<inf>3</inf> oxidation of ACA with a variation of oxidation time (X) in order to investigate the effect of surface oxygen group on their electrochemical performance as supercapacitor electrode material. Electrochemical properties of ACA and MACA-X were measured by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, and EIS (electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) measurements. Among the samples, MACA-6 h showed the best rate capability and the highest specific capacitance. Thus, an optimal HNO<inf>3</inf> oxidation condition was required for the highest supercapacitive electrochemical performance of modified activated carbon aerogel.
