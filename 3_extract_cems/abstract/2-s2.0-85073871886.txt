Scalable production of high-quality heteroatom-doped carbon-based materials is critical for supercapacitors. However, use of current strategies to fabricate carbon-based electrode materials that simultaneously exhibit high specific surface areas, efficient porosities, high conductivity, and high-level heteroatom doping remains a challenge. Herein, we report a facile method to prepare novel porous carbon materials with a large specific surface area and high graphitization using a biphenylene-bridged hybrid porous solid (BS) as the precursor. The as-prepared porous carbon material features a large number of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms in its aromatic rings, hierarchical porous structures, and preserved oxygen heteroatoms. By optimization of the experimental conditions, porous carbon materials show high electrochemical capacitances in electrolytes including 2 M H2SO4 and 6 M KOH in a three-electrode system. Specifically, these materials show a high capacitance of 256 F/g at 1 A/g in the acidic electrolyte and offer exceptional cyclability after 10000 continuous charge-discharge processes. We believe that these porous carbon materials hold great potential for development of energy storage materials.
