We report on the synthesis of copper-ferrite (CuFe2O4) thin films with tiny grain size (150 Å) by a spray-pyrolysis method, which may be suitable for supercapacitor applications. The films show specific capacitance (SC) value of 4 F/g, and their redox reaction active sites are investigated by calculating inner and outer charges. Densely compact surface morphology and calculated results, i.e., total charge and redox active sites show that the degree of ion diffusion into CuFe2O4 matrix is dependent on the porous and amorphous structure of thin films. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.
