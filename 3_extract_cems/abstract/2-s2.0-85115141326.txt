The influence of RuxBi1-x-oxide composition on the materials' charge storage/delivery capabilities as potential supercapacitor electrode materials was investigated in an alkaline medium. The oxides were produced as 2D coatings on a Ti substrate and were characterized by employing cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy techniques. It was found that with an increase in Ru content in the binary oxide, the corresponding specific areal capacitance increased, reaching a maximum value of 338 Â± 4 mF/cm2 at the current density of 3 mA/cm2 for the Ru0.6Bi0.4-oxide composition, and then decreased with a further increase in Ru content. Ru0.6Bi0.4-oxide was found to retain ~72% of its initial charge storage capacity after 5000 charging/discharging cycles at a high current density (200 mA/cm2). These results indicate that Ru0.6Bi0.4-oxide exhibits excellent charge storage/delivery capabilities and could be a potential candidate for nanostructured electrode materials for supercapacitors.
