In the present work, NiCo 2 O 4 nanoplates were prepared by a facile, low temperature, hydrothermal method, followed by thermal annealing and used supercapacitor applications. The physico-chemical characterization of as-prepared materials were investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FT-IR) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The electrochemical measurements demonstrate that the NiCo 2 O 4 nanoplates electrode (NC-5) exhibits a high specific capacitance of 332 F g -1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s -1 and also retained about 86% of the initial specific capacitance value even after 2000 cycles at a current density of 2.5 A g -1 . These results suggest that the fabricated electrode material has huge potential as a novel electrode material for electrochemical capacitors.
