In this paper, a simple and fast colloid electrostatic self-assembly method was adopted to prepare the SnO2/graphene nanocomposite (SGNC). The crystal structure, chemical composition, and porous property of composite were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and N2 adsorption–desorption experiments. The morphology analyses showed that the SnO2 nanoparticles about 5 nm were distributed homogenously on the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets surface. The electrochemical performance measurements exhibited that SGNC possessed the specific capacitance of 347.3 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution. Furthermore, this material also showed excellent cycling stability, and the specific capacitance still retained 90 % after 3000 cycles. These results indicate that the SGNC is a promising electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.
