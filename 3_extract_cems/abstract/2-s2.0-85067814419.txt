Two important future research directions: polymer/carbon material/metal oxide ternary composite electrode and asymmetric capacitors were indicated and summarized. With its excellent mechanical strength, high electrical conductivity, high specific surface area and good flexibility, graphene is considered as an ideal candidate material for electrochemical double-layer capacitor. These studies show that there is a significant synergistic effect between graphene and polyaniline. For these composites, due to the mechanical rigidity of graphene, the expansion of polyaniline and volume shrinkage during charging and discharging are limited.
