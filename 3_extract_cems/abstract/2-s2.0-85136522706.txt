An intention of the present work is to synthesize a quaternary metal oxide by a simple and cost-effective method. MoVMnAg-oxide@Ni-foam is synthesised by one-step hydrothermal method. The as-deposited MoVMnAg-oxide sample is systematically examined through XRD, FESEM, EDS-mapping, and TEM analysis. The electrochemical performance of an MoVMnAg@Ni-foam electrode is tested using CV, GCD, and EIS techniques. MoVMnAg-oxide@Ni-foam has a considerable high areal capacitance of 651 mFcm−2 with 0.13 mWhcm−2 energy at 1.8 mWcm−2 power density in 1 M KOH electrolyte calculated from GCD curves. Also, the electrode shows a diffusion coefficient of 1.52 × 10−7 cm2s−1 along with 91 % of diffusive-controlled contribution and a b-value of 0.51, which depicts faradaic charge storage mechanism. An assembled asymmetric supercapacitor device (MoVMnAg@Ni-foam//AC) delivers an areal capacitance of 312 mFcm−2 with 0.37 mWcm−2 power density at 1 mAcm−2 current density within 0 – 1.5 V voltage window. The asymmetric device showed cyclability and coulombic efficiency of 80.3% and 95% respectively measured up to 10,000 GCD cycles. These results demonstrate the deposition of quaternary metal oxide directly on Ni-foam showing highly competitive electrochemical performance so that they can be utilized in energy storage applications.
