Exfoliation is an effective strategy to improve the performance of graphite paper. In this paper, the expanded graphite paper is electro-exfoliated successfully by oxygen reduction reaction at low-potential in alkaline environment. As the surface of the electro-exfoliated expanded graphite paper becomes rough, the specific capacity and stability of the material are significantly improved, reaching 36.8 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and 99.5% after cycling 10,000 times. After being further electro-oxidated and electrodeposited, the treated expanded graphite paper shows excellent electrochemical properties, proving that the electro-exfoliation is an effective synthesis strategy.
