Supercapacitors offer an attractive energy storage solution for lifetime 'fit and forget' photovoltaic (PV) energy harvesting powered wireless sensor nodes for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Whilst their low storage capacity is not an issue for sub-mW PV applications, energy loss in the charge redistribution process is a concern. Currently, there is no effective method to estimate the storage of the supercapacitor in IoT applications for optimal performance with sub-mW input. The existing energy-based method requires supercapacitor model parameters to be obtained and the initial charge state to be determined, consequently it is not suitable for practical applications. This paper defines a charge-based method, which can directly evaluate supercapacitor's storage with straightforward calculations. Time constant analysis and experimental tests demonstrate that with the newly proposed method, the manufacturer-specified tiny leakage current, although measured long after postcharge (e.g., 72 h), can be directly used, making the storage estimation for a supercapacitor in IoT applications as simple as that for an ordinary capacitor. In addition, the demonstrated tiny leakage current at the required energy storage for a sub-mW PV-powered IoT application enables a supercapacitor alone to be employed as the storage mechanism, thus achieving lifetime battery-replacement-free, self-powered IoT nodes.
