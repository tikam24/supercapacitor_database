Graphene-fiber (GF) supercapacitors have attracted significant research attention in the field of wearable devices. However, there is still a need for active materials with high energy density. Transition Metal Nitrides (TMNs) are promising candidates for this purpose compared with conventional Transition Metal Oxides (TMOs) or conducting polymers (CPs) owing to their higher electrical conductivity, stability and relevant electrochemical properties. We have successfully integrated Tungsten Nitride (WN) with reduced graphene oxide fibers (rGOF) and developed high-performance hybrid fiber (WN-rGOF) supercapacitors. These hybrid supercapacitors attained a high capacitance of 16.29 F cm-3 at 0.05 A cm-3 and an energy density of 1.448 mW h cm-3, which is 7.5 and 1.75 times higher than those of the pure rGOF supercapacitor and the Tungsten Oxide/rGO hybrid fiber (WO3-rGOF) supercapacitor, respectively. The energy density readily increased up to 2.896 mW h cm-3 when three WN-rGOF supercapacitors were connected in series. The WN-rGOF supercapacitor also showed high capacitance retention of 84.7% after 10000 cycles along with appreciable performance under severe mechanical deformation.
