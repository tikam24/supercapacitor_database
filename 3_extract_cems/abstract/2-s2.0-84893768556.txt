The porous NiO nanofibers have been successfully synthesized by a simple process of hydrothermal treatment with subsequent calcination. The as-prepared porous NiO nanofibers, when applied as supercapacitor electrode exhibited a higher specific capacitance of 884 F/g with enhanced rate capability and good cycle stability. The excellent capacitive behaviors are mainly attributed to their unique configurations, which can not only provide high specific surface area but also greatly enhance the effective utilization of active materials as well as rapid ion/electron transportation. It is expected that such intriguing NiO porous nanofibers can serve as promising electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors. Â© 2013 ASM International.
