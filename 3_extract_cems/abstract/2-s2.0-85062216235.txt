To investigate the depth of charging at the material surface, batches of nickel hydroxide nanoparticles were hydrothermally synthesised in the range 3â€“450 nm. Any surfactant added was removed post synthesis using ozone. The capacity per gram (C s ) increased and the capacity per unit area (C A ) was constant with decreasing particle size down to 20 nm. Further reduction in particle size resulted in a decrease in both C S and C A , suggesting the Ni(OH) 2 is charged to a depth in the order of 10 nm at the charging rate studied. The results obtained have implications in the design of Ni(OH) 2 electrodes in charge storage applications.
