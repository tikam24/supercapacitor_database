With the use of smart wearable and flexible devices, there is a need for flexible energy storage devices. To meet the increasing demand for flexible, portable and even wearable electronic devices, flexible energy storage systems have received great attention as a key component in this emerging field. Flexible inorganic based electrodes have great potential in the field of stretchable, light weight and intrinsic fast charging and discharging performance, because the electrode material is the core component of the flexible supercapacitor. To date, a significant contribution has been assigned for developing high performance flexible electrode, and in this chapter inorganic based electrodes are reviewed. Furthermore, carbon nanomaterial (graphene, carbon nanotubes, graphene oxide and carbon fiber) with inorganic material is also reviewed. Inorganic material with graphene has shown the high specific capacitance, specific power and long cyclic stability.
