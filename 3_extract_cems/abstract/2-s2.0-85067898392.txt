Abstract: In this paper, we investigate supercapacitor behavior properties of MnO2/RGO nanocomposite thin film. The graphene thin film is deposited on the silver paper as a conductive substrate using electrochemical deposition. MnO2 nanostructure is also deposited on reduced graphene oxide, due to its high theoretical specific capacitance (1370 F g−1), through an electrochemical deposition process. The as-prepared MnO2 and MnO2/RGO nanocomposite thin films are characterized by atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction and based on achieved results a hybrid supercapacitor electrode is assembled. The electrochemical behaviors of the supercapacitor systems are estimated by cyclic voltammetry analysis. The experimental result, indicate that the synergistic effect between the high conductivity of graphene and pseudocapacitance of MnO2 generates large capacitance for our synthesized nanocomposite. The MnO2/RGO/Ag nanocomposite (300 F g−1) exhibits higher capacitance performance than MnO2/Ag (70 F g−1) in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. Graphical Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
