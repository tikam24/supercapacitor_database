Ti–10Fe–6Al alloy was rapidly solidified using single roller melt-spinning technique to obtain ribbons, which was developed and used for supercapacitor electrode materials for the first time through facile oxidation. After oxidation at 680 °C for 100 h, TiO2/Fe2O3/Al2O3 nanocomposite on Ti–10Fe–6Al alloy ribbons consisting of numerous nanoparticles with average diameter of 90 nm was formed, which directly served as current collectors. For Ti–10Fe–6Al alloy foils cut from alloy ingot, oxidation product also showed particle shape but the diameter was far larger than that on oxided Ti–10Fe–6Al alloy ribbons. The ribbon electrode exhibited excellent electrochemical performance with areal capacitance of 10,500 µF cm−2 at current density of 40 µA cm−2 as well as long-term cycling stability of about 79.9% capacitance enhancement after 5000 cycles.
