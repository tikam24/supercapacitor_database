The Incredible Bulk: We investigate and quantify the different contributions in both amorphous and crystalline electrode materials. The results provide a scientific basis for future NiO electrode design. The conclusions and the characterization techniques can also be helpful in understanding other candidate materials for pseudocapacitors. Copyright Â© 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
