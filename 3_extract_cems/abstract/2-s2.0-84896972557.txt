Metal oxide nanosheets have promising potential applications in novel energy storage devices. In this work, Co3O4 nanosheets/carbon foam with excellent supercapacitor characteristics was successfully fabricated, without using metal substrates. The experimental results demonstrate that the electrochemical tests showed that the as-prepared Co3O4 nanosheets exhibited an ideal capacitive behavior with a maximum specific capacitance of 106 F/g in 1 M NaOH solution at a scan rate of 0.1 V s-1.
