Although Graphene oxide (GO)-based materials is known as a favorable candidate for supercapacitors, its conductivity needs to be increased. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the performance of GO-based supercapicitor with new methods. In this work, an ammonia solution has been used to remove the oxygen functional groups of GO. In addition, a facile precipitation method was performed to synthesis a NiMoO4 /3D-rGO electrode with purpose of using synergistic effects of rGO conductivity properties as well as NiMoO4 pseudocapacitive behavior. The phase structure, chemical bands and morphology of the synthesized powders were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and field emission secondary electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The electrochemical results showed that the NiMoO4 /3D-rGO(II) electrode, where ammonia has been used during the synthesis, has a capacitive performance of 932 Fg−1. This is higher capacitance than NiMoO4 /3D-rGO(I) without using ammonia. Furthermore, the NiMoO4 /3D-rGO(II) electrode exhibited a power density of up to 17.5 kW kg−1 and an energy density of 32.36 Wh kg−1. These results showed that ammonia addition has increased the conductivity of rGO sheets, and thus it can be suggested as a new technique to improve the capacitance.
