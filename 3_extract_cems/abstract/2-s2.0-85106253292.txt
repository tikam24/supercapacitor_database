The conversion from existing electrical networks into an all-renewable and environmentally friendly electrification scenario is insufficient to produce and distribute energy efficiently. Electrochemical devicesâ€™ premature degradation as a whole caused by electrical stressors in smart grids is incipient from an energy management strategies (EMS) perspective. Namely, few electrical-stress degradation models for photovoltaic panels, batteries, fuel cells, and super/ultra-capacitors (SCs), and particular stressors can be found in the literature. In this article, the basic operating principles for such devices, existing degradation models, and future research hints, including their incorporation in novel EMS, are condensed. The necessity of extending these studies to other stressors and devices is also emphasized. There are many other degradation models by non-electrical stressors, such as climatic conditions and mechanical wear. Although novel EMS should manage both electrical and non-electrical degradation mechanisms and include non-electrochemical devices, models with pure non-electrical-stressors are not the subject of this review since they already exist. Moreover, studies for the degradation of non-electrochemical devices by electrical stressors are very scarce.
