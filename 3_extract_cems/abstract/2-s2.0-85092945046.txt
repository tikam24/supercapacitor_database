To construct a high-performance next-generation carbon-based flexible supercapacitor, high porosity, large mass density, and high flexibility are three significant challenging goals. However, one side always affects another. Herein, high-density tetratomic-doped porous composite carbon derived from sustainable biomaterials is achieved via two-step processes of carbonization and acid-washing treatment. The assembled carbon-based electrodes are highly doped with various heteroatoms (B, O, N, and P) for 33.59 atom %, resulting in abundant porosity, high densities, high pseudocapacitive contribution for 84.5%, and superior volumetric capacitive performance. The fabricated flexible electrode exhibits high flexibility, high mass loading (316 mg cm-3), and remarkable tensile strength (44.6 MPa). Generally, the volumetric performance is key and a significant parameter to appraise the electrochemical characteristics of flexible supercapacitors within a limited space. The aqueous symmetric supercapacitor demonstrates a high volumetric energy density and an excellent power density of 2.08 mWh cm-3 and 498.4 mW cm-3, respectively, along with 99.6% capacitance retention after 20â€¯000 cycles, making it competitive to even some pseudocapacitors.
