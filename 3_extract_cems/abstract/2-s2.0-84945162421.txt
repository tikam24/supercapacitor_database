An electrochemical alternating voltage approach of producing NiCo double hydroxide (NiCoDH) layered ultrathin nanoflakes with large specific surface area (355.8 m2 g-1), remarkable specific capacitance and rate capability is presented. The obtained NiCoDH as anode for asymmetric supercapacitors shows excellent energy density of 17.5 Wh kg-1 at high power density of 10.5 kW kg-1 and cycling stability (91.2% after 10 000 cycles).
