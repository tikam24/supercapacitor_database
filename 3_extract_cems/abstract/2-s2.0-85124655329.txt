In order to solve the problems of low efficiency and short battery life of single energy pure electric vehicle, the super capacitor is integrated into the energy storage system of electric vehicle, and the energy management strategy based on model predictive control is adopted. The model predictive controller solves the minimum value of the objective function within the predetermined constraint range, and obtains the optimal distribution of load power between the battery and the super capacitor, so as to give full play to the maximum benefit of the hybrid power system and improve the battery life. The simulation results under UDDS, NEDC and NYCC conditions show that compared with the rule-based control strategy, the capacity attenuation of lithium battery under the model predictive control strategy is less and the system efficiency is higher.
