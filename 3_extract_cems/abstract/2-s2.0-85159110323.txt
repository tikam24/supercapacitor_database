Transition metal sulfides (TMSs) are considered as one of the promising electrode materials due to their fascinating redox reversibility and electronic conductivity. However, volume expansion during the charge/discharge process impedes their practical applications. The reasonable design of TMS electrode materials with unique morphology can improve the energy storage performance. Herein, we prepared the Ni3S2/Co9S8/NiS composite that is in situ grown on Ni foam (NF) via a one-step electrodeposition process. The optimized Ni3S2/Co9S8/NiS-7 shows a superhigh specific capacity of 2785.3 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and remarkable rate capability. Furthermore, the as-assembled device displays a high energy density of 40.1 W h kg−1 at a power density of 799.3 W kg−1 and a satisfactory stability of 96.6% retention after 5000 cycles. This work provides a facile way to fabricate new TMS electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors.
