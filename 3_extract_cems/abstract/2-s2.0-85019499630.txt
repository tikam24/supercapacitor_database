The catalytic reactivity of graphene oxide (GO) has been known since the 1960s. However, it is only recently that carbocatalysis has received a significant amount of attention. GO and its derivatives possess significant properties that make them interesting as catalysts in oxidative reactions, Friedel-Crafts and Michael additions, polymerization reactions, oxygen reduction reactions and photocatalysis. The interesting properties of GO as a catalyst are discussed in the current chapter, along with recent advances in their catalytic applications and future prospects in the field.
