Hollow sphere NiS2 is fabricated by a two-step hydrothermal method. When used as hybrid supercapacitor electrode materials, the NiS2 displays good electrochemical behaviors. The specific capacitance achieves 1382.0 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and 506.1 F g-1 at 20 A g-1, and the specific capacitance still maintains 451.1 F g-1 at 10 A g-1 after 5000 circles. The enhanced performances may be attributed to its hollow sphere structure, which promotes ion and electron transfer and provides a large number of active sites.
