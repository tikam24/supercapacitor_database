For the first time, cobalt tungstate (CoWO4) thin films were synthesized by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. The monoclinic crystal structure of CoWO4 film was confirmed from X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. The elemental, surface morphological, structural, and electrical analyses were executed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), two point probe method, and contact angle measurement techniques. The surface morphology of CoWO4 thin film consisted of islands of agglomerated cauliflower-like spherical nanoparticles with hydrophilic nature. The specific surface area of 60 m2 g−1 with an average pore size of 1.10 nm. The CoWO4 thin film electrode exhibited specific capacitance of 1436.5 F g−1 at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 in 1 M KOH as well as capacitance retention of 94% over 3000 galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) cycles. Furthermore, flexible solid-state symmetric supercapacitor (FSS-SSC) device assembled using CoWO4 thin films, showed specific capacitance of 101.32 F g−1, specific energy of 14.07 Wh kg−1 and specific power of 1225.25 W kg−1. This work highlights simplistic preparation of CoWO4 thin films for energy storage application.
