Though conjugated polymers such as polyaniline and polypyrrole are widely used in flexible supercapacitor electrodes owing to its high pseudocapacitance and intrinsic flexibility, structural instability and limited cycling stability of freestanding conjugated polymer films during charge-discharge process greatly reduce their practicality in applications. Herein, we report a new decentralized conjugated polymer (PDT) and approach to enhance flexible cycle performance by forming a freestanding hybrid film through a combination PDT chain with layered MXene (Ti3C2Tx). The film electrode exhibits a remarkable area capacitance of 284 mF cm−2 at 50 mA cm−2 and lowly capacitance loss, even almost 100% capacitance retention is achieved after 10,000 charge-discharge cycles. The freestanding PDT/Ti3C2Tx film is further used to fabricate a symmetry all-solid-state supercapacitor, which shows a high capacitance of 52.4 mF cm−2 (3.52 F cm−3) at 0.1 mA cm−2, and excellent electrochemical performance stability at dynamic bending state during 100 cycles. Interestingly, the film supercapacitor shows good flexibility and could withstand the 0–90° static bending test of 10,000 cycles. The analysis result reveals that this decentralized chain of PDT are beneficial formation strong bonds between surfaces of Ti3C2Tx, not only provide precise pathways to charge transport but also improve the structural stability of PDT backbones.
