Heterostructured metal oxide core–shell architectures have attracted considerable attention owing to their superior electrochemical performance in supercapacitors compared to a single structure. Here, we report a simple and effective synthesis of hierarchical MnCo2O4 nanowire@MnO2 sheet core–shell nanostructures anchored on graphite paper for use in supercapacitors. The proposed electrode exhibits a specific capacitance of 2262 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. In addition, good rate capability and excellent cycling performance are observed. An asymmetric supercapacitor with operating potential at 1.6 V is demonstrated using MnCo2O4@MnO2 as cathode and graphene/nickel foam (NF) as anode. The MnCo2O4@MnO2//graphene/NF asymmetric device shows a high energy density of 85.7 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 800 W kg−1 while maintaining a high energy density of 34.7 Wh kg−1 at 24 kW kg−1. Moreover, the device demonstrates a long-term cycling stability of 81.6 % retention of its initial specific capacitance.
