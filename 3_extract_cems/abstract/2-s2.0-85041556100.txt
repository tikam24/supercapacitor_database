Integration can diversify the function of a device with the same volume, therefore it facilitates the development of portable, wearable and flexible electronics. In this review, we described several kinds of novel and unconventional multifunctional integrated supercapacitors which can not only be used to storage energy but also be applied to other fields such as photodetecting, electrochromics, monitoring physiological/mechanical activities, gas sensor, and so on. First, a brief introduction of the significance and advantages of multifunctional integrated supercapacitors was presented. Then we outlined the enormous progress which has been made in the area of multifunctional integrated supercapacitors. In the end, the prospects and further developments in this exciting field were also suggested.
