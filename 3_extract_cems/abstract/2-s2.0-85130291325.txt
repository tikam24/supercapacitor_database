In the present report, we have studied the impact of aging on selenium (Se) powder in hydrazine hydrate (act as reducing agent) during synthesis of pure molybdenum selenide (MoSe2) material. The MoSe2 as electrode material is prepared via single-step hydrothermal technique with aging Se powder in reducing agent for zero, one, and three days. The structural, microstructural, and chemical nature analysis of the samples was done via XRD, FESEM, and FTIR tools whereas the electrochemical study was performed via CV, GCD, and EIS techniques. The optimized material coded as M 39 (three days aged sample with pH 9) shows a high specific capacitance (Cs) of 368 F g−1 at the current density of value 0.5 A g−1 along with an energy density of 51 Wh kg−1 and power density of 250 W kg−1. Based on the electrode's electrochemical outcomes, it may be indicated that the electrochemical performance of MoSe2 material upsurges as the aging of Se increases from zero to three days. From the obtained results it is could be predicted that the M 39 material may stand appropriate for commercial supercapacitors.
