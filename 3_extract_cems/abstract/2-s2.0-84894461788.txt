A standalone direct AC line battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system based on a novel configuration and its associated control strategy are proposed in this paper. The proposed double loop control strategy incorporating an outer voltage and an inner current loop is verified by simulation under rated conditions, load short circuit and nonlinear load conditions. The advantages of the proposed system are that it allocates the high frequency power component to the supercapacitor while the battery supplies the DC power, maintains operation of both the battery and the supercapacitor within specified current limits, maintains the supercapacitor voltage at a pre-defined value, and charges the supercapacitor from the battery.
