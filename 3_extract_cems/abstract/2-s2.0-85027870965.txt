This paper presents a statistical approach to determine the capacity of Hybrid Energy Storage System HESS in an autonomous PV/Wind power system generation. A frequency management is used for distributing the power of HESS into two signals, which are defined according to their dynamics. A low-pass filter is designed to manage the power variation of each storage system in a frequency domain, such that the high and low components. The powers supplied to the battery and supercapacitor are delimited based on a hysteresis controller, which is subject to define an appropriate range of states of charge (SOC). This statistical proposed approach has been mainly used to describe the power and energy capacities distributions of HESS. The integrated HESS aims to smooth the variations in wind-solar power production and ensure a more controllable output power. A probabilistic study is performed to achieve the maximum capacity of each storage system at different cumulative probability density function. The results obtained verify that the statistical approach offers a good compromise between flexibility and accuracy.
