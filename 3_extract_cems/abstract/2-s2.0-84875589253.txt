Here the large-area hierarchical Bismuth Molybdate nanowires have been successfully prepared via a facile electrodeposition-heat-method. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and laser micro-Raman spectrometer measurements were employed to characterize the hierarchical Bismuth Molybdate nanowires. In addition, the as-synthesized hierarchical Bismuth Molybdate nanowires manifest a high specific capacity and good electrochemical stability. Â© 2012 The Electrochemical Society.
