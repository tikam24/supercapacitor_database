Reports of recent fire accidents in the electronics and electric vehicles (EVs) industries show that thermal runaway (TR) reactions are a key consideration for the industry. Utilization of solid electrolytes (SEs) could be an important solution in to the TR issues connected to exothermic electrochemical reactions. Data on the thermal stability of modern SEs, ionic transport mechanisms, kinetics, thermal models, recent advances, challenges, and future prospects are presented in this review. Ceramic polymer nanocomposites are the most appropriate SEs for high-temperature stable batteries (in the range of 80–200 °C). Hydrogels and ionogels can be employed as stable, flexible, and mechanically durable SEs for antifreeze (up to –50 °C) and high-temperature (up to 200 °C) applications in supercapacitors. Besides the thermal safety features, SEs can also prolong the lifecycle of energy storage devices in next-generation EVs, space devices, aviation gadgets, defense tools, and mobile electronics.
