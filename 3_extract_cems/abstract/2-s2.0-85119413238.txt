MnCo2O4/g-C3N4 composite material was synthesized by the hydrothermal method, compared with MnCo2O4 without g-C3N4, it has excellent electrochemical performance. The composite material can reach a specific capacitance of 350 Fg-1 at 1 Ag-1. The capacity retention rate is 96% after 1000 cycles at the rate of 2 Ag-1. Experiments show that g-C3N4 can effectively disperse and improve the conductivity of urchin-like MnCo2O4, and the composite of sufficient g-C3N4 can give full play to the performance of urchin-like MnCo2O4, provide faster electronic transport channels, effectively improve the ion migration rate, and make urchin-like MnCo2O4 increase the rate performance under high charge and discharge rates.
