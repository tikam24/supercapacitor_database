Microporous zeolite templated carbon (ZTC) was synthesized by impregnation method using zeolite Y (Na-form) as a template, and furfuryl alcohol as a carbon precursor. The characterization was carried out by X-ray diffractometry, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen physisorption, elemental analysis and electrochemical methods. Physisorption measurements evidenced high micropore volume of obtained material (âˆ¼0.43 cm3 g-1). The charge storage ability in aqueous KOH, H2SO4 and Na2SO4 solutions was systematically studied by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charging/discharging and complex impedance measurements. Specific coulombic capacitance, the hydrogen storage, H-ZTC bonding and relaxation time of adsorption were found to be dependent on the type of electrolyte. Neutral Na2SO4 aqueous solution was found to be the best for supercapacitor application, thanks to: i) the highest available voltage window ii) lowest corrosion and iii) highest capacitance amounting to 123 F g-1 at 1 A g-1.
