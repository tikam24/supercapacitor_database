Economical Successive Ionic Layer Adsorption and Reaction (SILAR) method was used to deposit copper iodide (CuI) thin films on amorphous glass and stainless steel (SS) substrates at room temperature. The resulting thin films were characterized for their structural, morphological and optical properties using X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and UV–vis Spectroscopy respectively. The energy band gap observed for the material was 2.98 and 2.78 eV at 20 and 30 cycles respectively. The electrochemical properties of this p-type semiconductor were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in Na2SO4 electrolyte. The CuI film on SS gave a specific capacitance of 93 Fg−1 at a scan rate of 2 mV/s with an excellent long-term cycle and reversible stability.
