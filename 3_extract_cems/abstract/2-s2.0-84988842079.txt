Redox electrolytes can provide significant enhancement of capacitance for supercapacitors.However, more important promotion comes from the synergetic effect and matching betweenthe electrode and electrolyte. Herein, we report a novel electrochemical system consisted ofa polyanilline/carbon nanotube composite redox electrode and a hydroquinone (HQ) redoxelectrolyte, which exhibits a specific capacitance of 7926 F/g in a three-electrode system whenthe concentration of HQ in H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte is 2 mol/L, and the maximum energydensity of 114 Wh/kg in two-electrode symmetric configuration. Moreover, the specific capacitanceretention of 96% after 1000 galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles proves an excellent cyclic stability.These ultrahigh performances of the supercapacitor are attributed to the synergistic effect both inredox polyanilline-based electrolyte and the redox hydroquinone electrode.
