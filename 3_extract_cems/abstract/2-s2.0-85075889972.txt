The development of highly conductive, flexible, mechanical reinforced and chemically modified cotton yarns for electrodes of supercapacitors represents an important advance in the energy storage devices applied in wearable electronics. The production of carbon-based conductive layers as supports for chemical polymerization of active polymeric materials (such as polypyrrole) is an important strategy that associates the high electrical double-layer capacitance of the carbon derivatives (carbon nanotubes and graphene nanoplatelets) and the pseudocapacitance of the polypyrrole in truly flexible devices with improved electrochemical response—high capacitance. These properties are affected by relative concentration of graphene nanoplatelets in carbon complexes due to the variation in overall conductivity of electrodes (in consequence of low aggregation degree and available surface area) and the electrochemical properties of the resulting devices that reaches capacitance in order of 45.5 F g−1 with a capacitive retention of 70% after 2000 cycles of use. These promising results open possibilities for new systems in wearable electronics.
