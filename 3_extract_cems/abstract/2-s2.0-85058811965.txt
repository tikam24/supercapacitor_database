Insightful growth in nanostructure materials has flourished the field of nano-energy research, especially, supercapacitors, as an answer to worldwide energy issues. In this chapter, application of nanostructured materials for supercapacitors focusing on latest exploration and development in nano-energy materials and their effect over charge storage capacities has been described. Several factors such as safety, environment friendliness, durable life cycle, higher coulombic efficiency, energy, and power densities, play a critical role in defining supercapacitors as a device of interest. A major part of this chapter focuses on the development of nanostructured materials for electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors. However, brief background over charge storage mechanism has also been considered.
