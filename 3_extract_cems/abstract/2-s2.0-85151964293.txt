Herein, the facile electrospinning route is demonstrated to fabricate nanofibrous based tin oxide flexible electrode processed at different annealing temperatures and further envisaged in high-performance energy storage application. Tin oxide (SnO2) processed at 400 °C of annealing temperature showcased excellent specific capacitance (844 F/g) along with interfacial capacitance (0.1434 F/cm2) at 1 mV/s of scan rate which was tested in 1 M NaOH aqueous electrolyte and exhibited remarkable stability even after 2000 cycles. Nanofibers with beads-formation type morphology of the electrodes were confirmed through scanning electron microscopy. Hydrophilic nature of the electrode surface was confirmed by water contact angle measurements. The structural study was done with the help of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) and X- ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In addition, the flexible symmetric supercapacitor device is believed to have an excellent flexibility and electrochemical stability during mechanical bending up to 180°, suggesting SnO2 as promising electrode material for applications in future flexible and wearable electronics devices.
