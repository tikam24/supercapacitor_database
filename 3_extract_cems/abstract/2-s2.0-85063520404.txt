Transition metal oxides can easily lose electrons and thus possess multiple accessible valences. Especially, if two different transition metals are combined, better capacity and cycling stability are achieved. In this study, a binary transition metal oxide, CoV2O6, was synthesized via a facile co-precipitation process for use as a supercapacitor cathode; the as-synthesized CoV2O6 exhibited high-capacity (306.6 F g−1, 1 A g−1 and 219.2 F g−1, 20 A g−1) and stable cycling stability, retaining 83.3% of its initial specific capacitance after 20 000 cycles. We believe that this facile synthesis process presents an effective method and a new opportunity for promoting the application of electrode materials based on binary transition metal oxides in supercapacitors.
