This paper challenges the fabrication of a thin film energy storage device on a flexible polymer substrate specifically by replacing most commonly used metal foil current collectors with coated current collectors. Mass-manufacturable spray-coating technology enables the fabrication of two different half-cell electric double layer capacitors (EDLC) with a spray-coated silver paste current collector and a Ni foil current collector. The larger specific capacitances of the half-cell EDLC with the spray-coated silver current collector are obtained as 103.86 F/g and 76.8 F/g for scan rates of 10 mV/s and 500 mV/s, respectively. Further, even though the half-cell EDLC with the spray-coated current collector is heavier than that with the Ni foil current collector, smaller Warburg impedance and contact resistance are characterized from Nyquist plots. For the applied voltages ranging from -0.5 V to 0.5 V, the spray-coated thin film energy storage device exhibits a better performance.
