We introduce ammonia borane, a versatile reducing agent for graphene oxide (GO) reduction in both aqueous and organic solvents; it is nontoxic and more effective than hydrazine. More interestingly, ammonia borane reduction of GO tetrahydrofuran produced higher nitrogen- and boron-doped graphene that exhibited high supercapacitor performance.
