Developing a precise controllable strategy for modulating the micro-morphology, atom coordination environment, and electronic structure of electrode materials is crucial for the performance in the field of energy storage, yet still a tremendous challenge. Herein, a facile and universal in-situ electrochemical self-optimization design, electro-regulating, is designed to controllably produce electrode materials with abundant defects. Through detailed characterization studies, the microstructure of MnO2 is reconstructed after electro-regulating, which exhibits a structure of small fragments with numerous holes due to the partial self-dissolution of acidic oxides under an alkaline operating environment. Furthermore, the electro-regulating strategy not only presents the formation steps of numerous holes but is also accompanies by a number of O vacancies generation process due to the activation of an external electric field. This study provides a new inspiration for reasonably designing advanced functional electrode materials for various electrochemical applications and beyond.
