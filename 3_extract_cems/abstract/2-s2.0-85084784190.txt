Two electrochromic polymers based on thiophene-benzene derivatives were prepared using an electrochemical method and exhibited multiple separate redox couples due to the introduction of side chains. The energy storage states of electrochromic supercapacitors based on the resulting polymers could be monitored by their appearance colour.
