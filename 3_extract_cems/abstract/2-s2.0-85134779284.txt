Nanocrystalline and porous bismuth oxide-doped graphene oxide nanocomposite (Bi2O3-GO NC) electrode material synthesized via microwave irradiation method has been envisaged for supercapacitor application. Surface morphology, elemental configuration, phase purity, surface area, porosity, and binding energy etc., are initially screened and then preferred in electrochemical measurement analysis. The as-obtained Bi2O3–GO NC electrode adduces a better performance with quasi-faradaic redox reactions in electrochemical measurements over pristine GO in 6 M KOH electrolyte solution. The specific capacitance of the Bi2O3–GO NC electrode measured at current densities 5–14 A/g is varied from 1250 to 933 F/g. The as-assembled Bi2O3–GO//Bi2O3–GO symmetric supercapacitor device reveals an exceptional electrochemical performance with 25.83 W-h/kg specific energy at 337 W/kg specific power, and excellent stability of about 80% for 5000 cycles, evidencing usability potential of metal oxide-GO composite electrode materials over solitary carbonaceous electrode. A demonstration of 42 LEDs ignited with full-bright intensity supports our claim as well.
