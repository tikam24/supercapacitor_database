Herein, a modified interfacial synthetic route has been demonstrated by synthesizing uniform poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/MnO2 hierarchical mesoporous nanocomposite. The in-situ generated polymer has been proven to be effective in constraining the overgrowth of nuclei. Consequently, assembled nanosheets with a thickness less than 5 nm have been prepared. At a high rate of 10 A g-1 charge/discharge process, the nanocomposite electrode retains 73.4% of the specific capacitance exhibited at 1 A g -1. At a current density as large as 800 mA g-1, the nanocomposite electrode attains reversible lithium storage specific capacities of 400 mAh g-1 after 50 cycles and 300 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles. The excellent high-rate performance of the nanocomposite electrode is highlighted in terms of its extremely large surface area, unique microstructure and mesoporous features.
