Thumbs up for porous graphene! Single-layer-graphene-assembled 3D hexaporous carbon is prepared by catalyst-free pyrolysis of poly(4- styrenesulfonic acid-co-maleic acid) sodium salt. The material has a hierarchical structure of mesoporous as well as microporous graphene with hexagonal nanopores of uniform size and shape. The results show that the sample is highly conducting in aqueous electrolyte, with an extremely high surface area of 1720 m2 g-1 and an enhanced capacitance of 154 F g-1.
