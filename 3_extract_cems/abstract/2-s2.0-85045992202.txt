Voltages of series-connected batteries gradually become imbalanced due to nonuniformity in terms of not only battery characteristics but also self-discharge rate that is significantly dependent on temperature. In large-scale energy storage systems, a large temperature gradient is very likely because of its huge geometry, and therefore, equalizers capable of relatively large equalization currents would be necessary to eliminate voltage imbalance originating from uneven temperature distribution. A two-switch string-to-battery voltage equalizer using a half-bridge converter with multistacked current doublers (MSCDs) is proposed for series-connected batteries in this paper. The proposed equalizer is capable of providing relatively large equalization currents without increasing ripple currents thanks to the interleaved operation of the MSCDs. Fundamental operational analysis for a discontinuous conduction mode, in which currents in the equalizer can be limited to desired levels without feedback control, is performed. The experimental results of equalization tests performed for four supercapacitor modules and lithium-ion batteries connected in series demonstrated the equalization performance of the proposed equalizer.
