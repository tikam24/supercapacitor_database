Facile hydrothermal method had been used for the multiple phase synthesis of nickel sulphide. Mixed phase of Ni3S4 and Ni3S2 were identify by the HRXRD and its crystallite size is 34 nm. Electro-catalytic properties of the synthesized sample was examined by Cyclic stability, cyclic voltammetry and Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in 1 M LiOH. During analysis of electro-catalytic properties pure mixed phase of nickel sulphide was used as a working electrode without mixing of binder and conducting material. All electrochemical impedance spectroscopy parameters had been evaluated using z-fit by Ec-lab software and cyclic stability of synthesized sample 72%. All above properties showed that synthesized sample can be used as electrode in supercapacitor, Li-ion batteries etc.
