Thanks to their considerable electrochemical and mechanical properties, fiber-shaped supercapacitors have become the most potential energy storage devices for portable and wearable electronics in the future; however, challenges still exist in the pursuit of practical applications among them. In this work, ternary microfibers, which are composed of TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibers/reduced graphene oxide microfiber cores coated with polypyrrole shell layers, are successfully fabricated through industrializable and sustainable wet-spinning and interfacial polymerization strategies. The prepared microfibers possess well-defined microstructures and outstanding mechanical properties (559 MPa). When assembled into symmetrical all-solid-state fiber-shaped supercapacitors (FSCs), they exhibit remarkable electrochemical properties (647 mF cm−2, 14.37 µWh cm−2 at 0.1 mA cm−2), prominent cycling stability (92.5% capacitance retention and 92.6% coulomb efficiency after 10 000 cycles), and extraordinary flexibility (no significant decay in capacitance after 5000 bending cycles), which are superior to all the congeneric FSCs reported to date. The prominent performances are ascribed to the synergistic effect of the well-designed ternary system and synergistic effects between interior components. The advantages in electrochemical, mechanical, and industrial properties of the ternary FSCs can provide reference and boost the development of flexible energy storage applications.
