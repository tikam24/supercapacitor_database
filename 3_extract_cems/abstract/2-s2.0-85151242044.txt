In this study, cobalt chromite (CoCr2O4)/electro-reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) (CCO/ERGO) nanocomposites were electrochemically fabricated on nickel foam (NF) electrode by a two-step synthesis method including the one-pot electrochemical deposition technique and thermal annealing. The analytical and morphological structure of the CCO/ERGO nanocomposite was studied by X-ray diffractometer (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) techniques. The characterization results indicated that CCO/ERGO nanocomposite included CCO spinel structure and ERGO. For the first time, the electrochemical fabrication of CCO/ERGO was reported via a one-pot synthesis strategy for high-performance supercapacitors applications. The electrochemical performances of CCO/ERGO nanocomposites were investigated in detail based on cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and cyclic stability test. The CCO/ERGO nanocomposite electrodes exhibited a high specific capacitance of 1610 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 in 1 M KOH solution. The results show that the synthesized CCO/ERGO electrode has high performance for future-generation supercapacitors applications.
