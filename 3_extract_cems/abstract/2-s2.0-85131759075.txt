The contradiction between the input power fluctuating caused by the working condition's randomness and the fixed energy recovery power of the energy storage system caused by the energy storage units’ fixed power density has arisen in many fields. The battery-ultracapacitor energy storage system and the parallel hydraulic-pneumatic hybrid system have been proved feasible to solve this contradiction in electric vehicles and heavy vehicles respectively. A hydraulic transformer with a function of regulating the pressure ratio between the input circuit and the load circuit could be a potential solution to the contradiction in the parallel hydraulic-pneumatic hybrid system. However, there were two load circuits (hydraulic and pneumatic) in the parallel hydraulic-pneumatic hybrid system which proposed challenges for the implantation of hydraulic transformer into the system and regulation of the pressure ratio between the input circuit and the two load circuits. To solve this problem, a hydraulic transformer with two variable displacement hydraulic power units was used to form a hydraulic transformer, the different connection methods of hydraulic transformer ports and each circuit, and the corresponding pressure proportional relationship were investigated. Based on above analysis, a new pressure adjustable parallel hydraulic-pneumatic hybrid system is proposed in this paper. The implantation of the hydraulic transformer into the system and the proportional regulation of the pressure in each circuit were achieved. Simulation models for parallel hydraulic-pneumatic hybrid system and the pressure adjustable parallel hydraulic-pneumatic hybrid system were built, and the simulation results were compared and analyzed. The regenerative braking torque could be varied from 14433.9 Nm to 168.56 Nm by adjusting the displacement factor ratio of the hydraulic transformer; the regenerative braking torque fluctuation of the PAPHPH system can be reduced by 65.61% when the displacement coefficient ratio (εB/εA) is 0.5; Stable work of the air compressor was achieved.
