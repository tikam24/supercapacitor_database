In the present study, nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide is synthesized using hydrothermal method for high-performance supercapacitor application. The N-doping level is found to be ~7 at.%, and nitrogen atoms remain in pyridinic, pyrrolic and quaternary form. Because of the multiple synergistic effects of good wettability, increased electron density and a great number of active sites, the material shows a remarkably improved electrochemical behavior compared to reduced graphene oxide prepared by the same method. The electrochemical performance was measured both in the alkaline, and acidic electrolyte in two-electrode configuration. In alkaline electrolyte nitrogen doped graphene shows excellent cyclic stability (97% retention after 1000 cycles) and low internal resistance (0.207 Î©), resulting in higher specific capacitance in high current region compared to acidic electrolyte.
