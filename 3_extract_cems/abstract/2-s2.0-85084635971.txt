Polymer electrolytes are key enablers in solid flexible devices for sensing, ac-line filtering and energy storage. While most of the reports in literature are focusing on demonstration of their important functionalities and promising performance in pristine devices, little attention has been given to the long term service life and shelf life of the devices or the failure mechanisms of the polymer electrolytes. In this talk we will discuss these issues through a few case studies to show the influential factors on the properties of the polymer electrolytes and the longevity of the solid devices.
