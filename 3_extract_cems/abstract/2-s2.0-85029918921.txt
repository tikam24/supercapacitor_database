We report graphene@polymer core-shell fibers (G@PFs) composed of N and Cu codoped porous graphene fiber cores uniformly coated with semiconducting polymer shell layers with superb electrochemical characteristics. Aqueous/organic interface-confined polymerization method produced robust highly crystalline uniform semiconducting polymer shells with high electrical conductivity and redox activity. When the resultant core-shell fibers are utilized for fiber supercapacitor application, high areal/volume capacitance and energy densities are attained along with long-term cycle stability. Desirable combination of mechanical flexibility, electrochemical properties, and facile process scalability makes our G@PFs particularly promising for portable and wearable electronics.
