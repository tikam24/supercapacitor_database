Recently, ternary cobalt nickel sulfide, performing as the promising electrode material for supercapacitors has obtained great interests. Herein, the hollow and spinous NiCo 2 S 4 nanotubes are designed and prepared through a simple hydrothermal reaction using the natural silk as the template. The spinous Ni-Co precursors are grown on the natural silk through a facile hydrothermal strategy and the hollow structure is obtained by decomposing the silk via hydrothermal sulfurization. After the calcination treatment, the hollow and spinous NiCo 2 S 4 nanotubes are applied as the electrode material and exhibit better electrochemical performance than the solely vulcanized samples. In addition, owing to the unique hollow and spinous structure of NiCo 2 S 4 nanotubes, the supercapacitor electrode material shows good specific capacitance (630 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 ), low internal resistance R s (0.68 Ω) and high capacitance retention (91% after 3000 cycles) at 10 A g −1 . Furthermore, an all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor is self-assembled with the SC400 composite and exhibits an energy density of 52.34 Wh kg −1 at the power density of 2206.37 W kg −1 . Additionally, a blue LED indicator can be powered by connecting two ASCs in series. The prepared hollow and spinous NiCo 2 S 4 nanotubes with excellent electrochemical properties can envision promising applications in energy storage devices and nanotechnology.
