Two-dimensional ultrathin mesoporous NiCo2O4 nanosheets on carbon fiber paper (CFP) are synthesized through a facile solvothermal method combined with a post thermal treatment. The well interconnected ultrathin NiCo2O4 nanosheets directly grown on the carbon nanofibers could allow for easy diffusion of the electrolyte, shorten the transport path of ion and electron and accommodate the strain during cycling. As a result, superior pseudocapacitive performance is achieved with large specific capacitance of 999 F g-1 at a high current density of 20 A g-1. The capacitance loss is 15.6% after 3000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g-1, displaying good cycle ability and high rate capability. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
