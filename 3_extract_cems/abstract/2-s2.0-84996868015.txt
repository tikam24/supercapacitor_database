The development approach for energy storage systems focuses on optimally sized capacitor modules to reduce peak power and to avoid energy recovery of production machines. Using servo presses as an example, the application of two different energy storage systems in the DC link is practically examined. A simulation model in Matlab/Simulink and a test stand of a servo press are proposed for representing the power flows between the mains supply, the electric drives and the storage systems. The description of forming machines and the behaviour of the electric components are used to control the amount of stored energy in a storage system and to influence the process regarding a reduction of peak power.
