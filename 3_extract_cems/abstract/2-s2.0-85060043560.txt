We report the utilization of three-dimensional graphene hydrogel embedded with Ni foam as a high-surface-area support and one-step electrodeposition of NiCo 2 O 4 nanoflakes on the support for use as supercapacitor electrode, with dramatic improvements in the accessible electrode surface area and loading amount of pseudocapacitive material being achieved. The constructed NiCo 2 O 4 /graphene hydrogel/Ni foam ternary composite electrode possesses a hierarchical open-porous structure scaling from macropores to mesopores, which synergistically provides continuous electron path, commodious ion channel and large electrolyte-electrode interface, thus benefiting the improvement of overall energy storage properties of the supercapacitor electrode. Accordingly, the as-prepared electrode exhibits exceptional high capacitance of 3.84 F cm −2 at 2 mA cm −2 and excellent rate capability with 71.6% retention at 50 mA cm −2 . Moreover, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor using NiCo 2 O 4 /graphene hydrogel/Ni foam as positive electrode and graphene hydrogel/Ni foam as negative electrode renders a maximum energy density and power density of 65 Wh kg −1 and 18.9 kW kg −1 , respectively, and a striking cycling stability with 92% capacitance retention after 5000 charge-discharge cycles. These desirable results suggest a great potential of hierarchical porous NiCo 2 O 4 /graphene hydrogel/Ni foam electrode for the high-performance supercapacitor application.
