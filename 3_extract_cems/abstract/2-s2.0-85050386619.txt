In this study, the losses of the hybrid energy storage system (HESS) including super-capacitor (SC) and battery in an electric vehicle (EV) are analyzed. Based on the presented vehicular system structure, the simulation model is proposed. With the controllable super-capacitor current, the operation of an EV with the hybrid battery-supercapacitor energy storage system is simulated under the European urban driving schedule ECE-15 and the losses of the hybrid energy system are computed and analyzed. The simulated results demonstrate that the super-capacitor current can be optimized under various operating conditions to minimize the losses of the hybrid battery-supercapacitor energy storage system in the EV. Thus, this study provides the valuable approach to maximize the operating efficiency of the hybrid battery-supercapacitor energy storage system in EVs.
