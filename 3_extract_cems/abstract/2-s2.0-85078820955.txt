Nowadays, electric vehicles (EVs) are getting much attention than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Recent developments in electric vehicle system propose an energy recovery through the vehicles regenerative braking system (RBS). Here combined qualities of batteries and supercapacitor can effectively utilize in a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) of EVs. Efficiency of the electric vehicles can be improved by Regenerative Braking (RB). The impulse current produced during RB can be efficiently harvested by employing HESS; this will improve the system performance. This further improves the energy usage efficiency and can increase the driving interval of EVs. The braking force distribution is realized through Fuzzy logic controller (FLC).
