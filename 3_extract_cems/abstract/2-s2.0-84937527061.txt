Facile synthesis of heteroatom doped graphene nanosheets is one of the recent trends in the development of energy storage materials like supercapacitors. Phosphorus doped graphene sheets (P-GNS) have been prepared using electrochemical method (EC), which is the most emerging technique for large scale synthesis. X-ray diffraction studies of as-electrochemically phosphorus doped graphene nanosheets (EC-P-GNS) synthesized show a shift towards lower 2θ values due to functionalized graphene sheets. Scanning electron microscopy analysis of EC-P-GNS shows folded and twisted type graphene nanosheets and the average sheet thickness was measured to be 40 nm. High resolution-transmission electron microscopy depth profile confirms the presence of few layer transparent graphene with twisted type sheets. Fourier transform-infra red analysis of EC-P-GNS confirms the presence of functional groups in the doped graphene sheets. X-ray photoelectron microscopy analysis of EC-P-GNS shows 0.68 % phosphorus atomic doping which confirms the P-doping in graphene nanosheets. The electrochemical performance was analyzed using EC-P-GNS and shows good cycle performance compared to graphite. The electrochemical charge/discharge curves of EC-P-GNS give a high specific capacitance (Csp) of 290 F g−1 along with high energy density 43.75 Wh kg−1. Based on the above merits including higher Csp, we hope that our EC-P-GNS would be a promising material for super capacitors. Further, the prepared single pot electrochemical anodic erosion strategy provides easy scale up for all heteroatoms doped graphene nanosheets synthesis.
