This chapter discusses self-powered chemical sensors and biosensors for environmental monitoring/protection, and self-powered electrochemistry systems such as self-powered anti-corrosion, etc. It describes the applications of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) in the field of electrochemistry. Industrial pollution has always been an important issue in many cities, such as from phenol, dopamine, heavy metals, etc. Industrial pollution monitoring is necessary for our life. More important, however, is environmental protection. In general, the sewage produced in industries contains a variety of environmentally hazardous chemicals. Self-powered systems based on TENGs typically have two approaches. One is to store electrical energy into a supercapacitor or a lithium battery through an energy management circuit to power small electronic devices. Another is to use an electrical pulse to supply energy through a rectifier bridge for the electrochemistry system or anti-corrosion system application. TENGs can harvest energy for mechanical and wave energy.
