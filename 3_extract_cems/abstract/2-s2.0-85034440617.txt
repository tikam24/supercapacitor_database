Nanoporous Ni-Mo alloy was prepared by a method of rapid quenching and de-alloying, and the samples were annealed to synthesize the nanoporous NiMoO4 material. The composition, morphology and microstructure of NiMoO4 were analyzed by XRD, SEM and TEM. The electrochemical performance was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge. The results show that the 3D bicontinuous nanoporous NiMoO4 can be prepared by de-alloying and annealling of the Ni5Mo5Al90 and Ni2.5Mo2.5Al95 alloy. Molybdenum with a low surface diffusivity has a pinning effect on mobile Ni atoms, thus leading to the decrease of the skeleton and pore size. The specific capacitance of nanoporous NiMoO4 prepared by Ni5Mo5Al90 is 708 F路g-1 at current density of 1 A路g-1 and its retention ratio remains at 57.1% when the current density increases to 20 A路g-1. After galvanostatic charge-discharge 1 000 cycles at 4 A路g-1, the retention ratio of specific capacitance is 91.2%.
