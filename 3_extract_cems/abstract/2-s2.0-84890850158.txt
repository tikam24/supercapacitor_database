Four porous carbon samples APC-700, APC-800, APC-900 and APC-950 were prepared by the carbonization of MOF-5 at 700, 800, 900 and 950Â°C under Ar atmosphere and further activated in 16 mol/L HNO3 solution. The influences of carbonization temperature on the structure and electrochemical properties of porous carbon were studied. The physicochemical and electrochemical properties of samples were characterized by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), nitrogen sorption isotherm, cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, respectively. The results show that the pore volume increases with the increase of carbonization temperature, while the BET surface area increases firstly and decreases afterwards. Especially, APC-900 shows a higher specific surface area and better electrochemical performance. Cyclic voltammetry study indicates that the specific capacitance of 312.8 F/g can be obtained at a scan rate of 1 mV/s in 6 mol/L KOH electrolyte. Meanwhile, the maximum specific capacitance of the supercapacitors using APC-900 as active electrode material reaching up to 71.8 F/g was obtained at the current density of 1 A/g and the specific capacitance retention of the sample is still as high as 98% after 1000 charge-discharge cycles.
