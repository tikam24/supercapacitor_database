The increasing demand to develop renewable energy has increased drastically due to limited resources and environmental problems of fossil fuel. The most widely used energy storage devices are batteries and capacitors. Supercapacitors, on the other hand, can induced higher power density by fast charging/discharging rate which results in higher power density and longer cycle life compared to batteries and fuel cells. To fulfil the demand for safer energy sources, the use of highly flammable organic liquid electrolytes and polymer separators must be replaced by solid electrolytes. Therefore, supercapacitors with solid electrolytes can be alternative renewable energy. Commercially, there are three types of electrolytes of supercapacitors: aqueous electrolytes, organic electrolytes, and ionic liquids. In this paper, there is selective review on solid electrolytes of supercapacitors including chitosan, polyacrylamide, poly(aryl ether ketone), and polyethylene glycol. Overall, this paper aims to provide comprehensive reviews on recent advances in potential solid electrolytes of supercapacitors and the remaining challenges.
