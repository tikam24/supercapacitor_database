Dendrite-like MnO2 nanostructures grown on carbon cloth are successfully prepared by a facile one-step route. The as-prepared nanoarchitecture delivers a specific capacity of 430 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and excellent cycling stability. In addition, a quasi-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled by using the dendrite-like MnO2 nanostructures as the positive electrode. It shows an energy density of 20.65 W h kg-1 at a power density of 437.30 W kg-1 at a voltage window of 2.45 V. The results reveal that the as-synthesized MnO2 products might be promising electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage.
