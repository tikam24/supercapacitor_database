Various hybrid materials containing transitional metals (TMs) with selenium (Se) have been widely studied, but the controlled infiltration of Se in a cobalt phosphide nanostructured array (CPNA) derived from a two-dimensional cobalt metal-organic Framework (2D Co-MOF) is the different approach of material design for energy storage applications. In this work, 2D Co-MOF arrays are successfully grown on an activated carbon fiber textile (ACFT) and converted into Sex@CPNA-ACFT through successive phosphidization and selenium infiltration processes under the optimized conditions. In the three-electrode system, Se0.6@CPNA-ACFT shows a higher specific capacity of ∼302 mAh g-1 and excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of ∼93.8% after 10,000 cycles. The flexible quasi-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) based on Se0.6@CPNA-ACFT as a positive electrode and FeS2 decorated reduced graphene oxide at etched CFT (FeS2@rGO-ECFT) as a negative electrode exhibits a maximum energy density of ∼70.6 Wh kg-1 (volumetric energy density of ∼1.81 mWh cm-3) and a maximum power density of 8.163 kW kg-1 with remarkable stability. This work provides a good example of the rational modification of a 2D Co-MOF into an efficient Se0.6@CPNA-ACFT electrode material for a high-performance quasi-solid-state flexible ASC for future energy storage applications.
