The properties of cement based on magnesium phosphate (MPC) were investigated; the effect of various concentrations (3M, 6M and 9M) of alkalis LiOH, NaOH and KOH on the internal resistance, ionic conductivity and compressive strength of the structural electrolyte was studied. The results show that MPC-K9 is the optimal structural electrolyte. The maximum ionic conductivity of the MPC-K9 structural electrolyte was 16.85 mS-cm-1, which indicates its best electrochemical characteristics. An integrated structural supercapacitor is assembled with graphene electrodes and MPC-K9 structural electrolyte, and its electrochemical characteristics have been measured. The cyclic voltammetry curve was nearly rectangular in shape, indicating a typical double layer effect. The constructive supercapacitor had a surface capacity 16.72 mF/cm2 and a compressive strength 5.9 MPa. The structural supercapacitor shows good stability and reversibility with 94.50 % capacity retention after 3000 cycles. Thus, magnesium phosphate cement can be used in the field of energy storage in buildings.
