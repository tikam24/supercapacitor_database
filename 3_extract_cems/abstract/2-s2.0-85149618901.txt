The orthorhombic V2O5 nanorod-like structure and PANI are successfully prepared by hydrothermal and oxidative polymerization methods respectively and confirmed by XRD as well as FESEM. The electrochemical performance of electrodes with different mass-loadings of PANI doped V2O5 nanocomposites on nickel- foam has been checked by means of CV and GCD. The electrode with 2 mg mass-loading exhibits a high specific capacity of 889 Fg−1 at 5 mV/sec scan rate and 612.21 Fg−1 at 2 Ag−1 current density. The combined impacts of PANI and V2O5 can give an alternative path for developing cost-effective next-generation high-performance supercapacitor applications.
