A new kind of supercapacitor electrode material, polyaniline/activated carbon composites (PANI/AC), has been synthesized by in situ polymerization of aniline on the surface of activated carbon. The effect of adding a cobalt salt on the electrochemical performance of the PANI/AC composite was studied. The microstructures of the composites were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and IR spectroscopy was used to determine the molecular structures and chemical bonding of the composites. The electrochemical performance of the composites was characterized by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements and electrochemical impedance spectrometry in 6mol/L KOH solution using Hg/HgO as the reference electrode. Due to the presence of the cobalt salt, Co-PANI/AC shows the desired microstructure, good high-current charge-discharge performance and good electrochemical behavior, with its capacitance of 530F/g being 38.2% higher than that of PANI/AC (387F/g).
