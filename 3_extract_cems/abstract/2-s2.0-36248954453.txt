Polyaniline/multi-wall carbon nanotubes composite (PANI/MWNTs) was rapidly synthesized by microwave-assisted polymerization. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) image revealed that this composite was a core-shell structure with PANI layers (50-70 nm). Electrochemical behavior of the composite was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests with a two-electrode system. An enhanced specific capacitance of 322 F/g with a specific energy density of 22 W h/kg was about 12 times that of MWNTs. This composite also exhibited a good rate capability, retaining up to 87% of initial capacity at a current density of 5 mA/cm2. Â© 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
