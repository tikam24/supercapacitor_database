Regulating the composition and microstructure of multiphase nanocomposites can be used to significantly improve the charge storage capacity of the materials. Herein, the thermometal NiCo-MOF was used as precursor, which was placed in the designed alkaline oxidation environment for alkalization treatment, and NiCo-LDH and Ni(OH)2 heterogeneous composite (NiCo-LDH@Ni(OH)2) was prepared. The ratio of Ni/Co in MOF precursor was further regulated to optimize the composition and structure. Finally, NiCo-LDH and Ni(OH)2 with two-dimensional nanosheet structure were obtained when the Ni/Co ratio was 2:1. Benefiting from the nanostructure of electroactive material and the synergistic effect of multicomponent heterogeneous composite, the electrochemical reactivity is effectively improved, which the NiCo-LDH@Ni(OH)2 electrode has a specific capacity of 754.8C g−1 at 1 A g−1. Further, hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) is assembled to explore practical applications device, which the NiCo-LDH@Ni(OH)2//AC HSC device can output energy density of 30.6 Wh kg−1, power density of 799.9 W kg−1, and maintain 89.0 % of the initial performance after 5000 cycles.
