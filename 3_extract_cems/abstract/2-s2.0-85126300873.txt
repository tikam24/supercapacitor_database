Zeolite Imidazole Framework (ZIF) has the advantages of large specific surface area, high porosity, and easy functionalization, so it looked like one of the most promising energy storage and conversion materials. In the meantime, transition metal oxides and sulfides have been widely used in environmental and energy conversion applications. Hence, a NaOH-assisted thioacetamide etching strategy is, therefore, designed with the metal-organic framework as precursor to realize the hollow nanostructure of ZIF bimetallic sulfide (Sx-CoCd-350) with abundant sulfur vacancies for enhanced catalysts oxygen evolution reaction (OER)/hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)) performance and capacitance performance of capacitor. The overpotential of S2-CoCd-350 in the OER process is 355 mV at 50 mA cm−2, which is substantially lower than other reported ZIF-based catalysts. S2-CoCd-350 has an overpotential of 84 mV at 10 mA cm−2 when employed as HER catalyst. Furthermore, the S2-CoCd-350 electrode did not alter appreciably during a long-term durability test of more than 10 h. More impressively, S2-CoCd-350 matches the activated carbon (AC) electrode with excellent capacitance performance 1220 μWh cm−2 energy density (at 3370 μW cm−2) and 25,000 μW cm−2 (at 700 μWh cm−2) maximum power density. In addition, the assembled supercapacitor has excellent cycling stability.
