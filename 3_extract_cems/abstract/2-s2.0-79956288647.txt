IrO2 nanocrystals (NCs) were grown on vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs) forming IrO2/CNTs nanocomposites by metal organic chemical vapor deposition using (C6H7)(C8H 12)Ir as a source reagent. The surface morphology, structural and spectroscopic properties of the nanocomposites were characterized. Micrographs of field-emission scanning electron microscope showed that the surface morphology of the as-deposited IrO2 NCs varied from particle-like to tube-like NCs as the deposition time increased from 5 to 60 min. The transmission electron microscope image of IrO2/CNTs nanocomposites revealed that IrO2 NCs had been deposited onto the surface of the CNTs with uniform size distribution and random directions. X-ray diffraction pattern confirmed the formation of pure rutile IrO2 NCs on CNTs. The redshifts of the peak positions and broadening of linewidths of the IrO 2 Raman features were attributed mainly to the size effect. The particles-like IrO2 NCs may be used as a protective layer on CNTs, providing stable and uniform field emission application. While the nanotube-like structure may increase the surface-to-volume ratio which makes the IrO 2/CNTs nanocomposites as an attractive candidate for the supercapacitor application.
