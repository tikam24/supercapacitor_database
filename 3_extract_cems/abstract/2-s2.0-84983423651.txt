The supercapacitor is currently emerging as a major energy storage device and a lot of research is focusing on improving its performance. This study tries to investigate the effects of area of the electrode on the output parameters of the supercapacitor like specific capacitance, equivalent series resistance, power density, energy density and pulse current. Rectangle and square electrodes were chosen for the study as these shapes are standard for an electrode. An ANN model was made which was then able to predict the specific capacitance, equivalent series resistance, power density and pulse current.
