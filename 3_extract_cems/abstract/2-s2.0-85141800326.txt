Green synthesis of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was done using three different plant extracts, such as banana, mango leaves and potato, as the reducing agent. The field-emission scanning electron spectroscopy revealed the formation of thin layers in the morphology of rGO reduced with the green extracts. The X-ray diffraction patterns reveal that the peak for GO (001) appeared at 2θ = 11.01° and in rGO broad peak appeared for the (002) plane at ~21°–26°. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy graphs showed the peaks for C=C at ~1571 cm−1, which confirmed the formation of the graphene backbone structure. Raman analysis showed the characteristic G band for the sp2 carbon structure of rGO. The cyclic voltammetry study revealed that the rGO-b exhibits the most significant value of specific capacitance of 176 F g–1 at a 5 mV s–1 scan rate.
