Supercapacitors, possessing high power densities, have been supposed to be one of the promising energy storage devices. Among various electrode materials of supercapacitors, carbon materials with porous nanostructure are considered as the emerging and promising candidates. This feature article reviewed the recent advances in different dimensional carbon-based nanoarchitectures for supercapacitors and particularly addressed the novel synthetic strategies to improve the electrochemical performances and corresponding theoretical foundations. The state-of-the-art progress was discussed, and diverse challenges for the electrochemical properties of carbon-based materials were propounded. Furthermore, perspectives for the design and assembly of advanced carbon-based nanoarchitectures for the supercapacitor electrode materials were highlighted. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
