The trap state in graphene has been recently reported, however its role on charge transport and charge storage capacity in a graphene based electrode material has not yet been explored. In semiconducting devices trap states have a negative role in charge transport and current-voltage characteristics. Therefore, exploiting the huge trap states in chemically synthesized graphene to improve the desired material property is a unique idea. In the present work, trap states have been analyzed in detail using capacitance-voltage and current-voltage characteristics in chemically synthesized graphene/MoO3 composites. The effect of trap states on charge transport and on enhancing the dielectric properties are also demonstrated. Finally, we have shown that storage capacitance of the graphene/MoO3 electrode material increases remarkably to about 160% due to the increase in trap states in the material. We believe that this study will reveal a new way of exploiting trap states to improve the material's characteristics, such as storage capacity etc.
