A new 3D V2O5@PPy network built from numerous ultrathin, flexible and single-crystalline nanoribbons was successfully fabricated by a combined hydrothermal, freeze-drying and nanocasting process. Such a unique network can not only provide a high surface area for enhancement of electrolyte/electrode interactions, and reduce the diffusion length of ions, but also efficiently maintain the high electrical conductivity. As a result, this network exhibits high capacitance, excellent rate capability and good charge-discharge stability for energy storage. An asymmetric supercapacitor based on a 3D V2O5@PPy network as the cathode material further delivers high energy density and high power density. We expect that our work presents an efficient approach to design and produce various 3D architectures built from nanoribbons or nanosheets for energy storage and other applications.
