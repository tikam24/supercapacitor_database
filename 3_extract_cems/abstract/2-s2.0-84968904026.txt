An underlying electrode material of manganese phosphate has been designed and synthesized, possessing wide potential windows (-0.9-0.7 V in neutral and -0.5-0.6 V in alkaline electrolyte), satisfying specific capacitances (203 F g-1 in neutral and 194 F g-1 in alkaline electrolyte), outstanding rate capabilities and excellent cycling stabilities. The morphological characteristics and electrochemical analyses indicate that the layered crystal structure offers many nano-paths and improves the diffusion of electrolyte ions, which can noticeably promote electrochemical performance. Furthermore, a Mn3(PO4)2//AC asymmetric supercapacitor and a Mn3(PO4)2//Mn3(PO4)2 symmetric supercapacitor have been assembled at a cell voltage between 0 and 1.6 V, and exhibit excellent electrochemical stabilities and stable energy and power characteristics, which reveal that this manganese phosphate material is promising for electrochemical energy storage applications.
