The improvement of the supercapacitor model redundancy is a significant method to guarantee the reliability of the power system in electric vehicle application. In order to enhance the accuracy of the supercapacitor model, eight conventional supercapacitor models were selected for parameter identification by genetic algorithm, and the model accuracies based on standard diving cycle are further discussed. Then, three fusion modeling approaches including Bayesian fusion, residual normalization fusion, and state of charge (SOC) fragment fusion are presented and com-pared. In order to further improve the accuracy of these models, a two‐layer fusion model based on SOC fragments is proposed in this paper. Compared with other fusion models, the root mean square error (RMSE), maximum error, and mean error of the two‐layer fusion model can be reduced by at least 23.04%, 8.70%, and 30.13%, respectively. Moreover, the two‐layer fusion model is further ver-ified at 10, 25, and 40 °C, and the RMSE can be correspondingly reduced by 60.41%, 47.26%, 23.04%. The results indicate that the two‐layer fusion model proposed in this paper achieves better robust-ness and accuracy.
