The CdO is a reliable metal oxide for a variety of applications in energy storage capacitors, alkaline batteries, photovoltaic cells, liquid crystal displays, smart windows, transparent electrodes, and antireflection coatings. Supercapacitor is most important emerging technology in energy storage field. The preparation of electrode materials with excellent structures and morphological features is important to enhance the specific capacitance, which participates a significant position in the energy conversion and energy storage development for sustainable human growth. The role of neodymium ion doping with two different variations has been studied. The pure CdO and different percentages of Nd3+ ion-doped CdO (1% and 3%) was prepared using one-step hydrothermal method. The cubic CdO was confirmed employing the X-ray examination. The 50-60 nm crystallite size was obtained from the XRD results. Electrochemical performance was studied in detailed with respect to various Nd3+ doping percentages. The 652 F/g specific capacitance was obtained for the 3% Nd-doped CdO electrode from charge–discharge studies. This electrode also showed 94% capacitive retention after 5000 charge–discharge cycles. This article described that Nd-ion doped CdO electrodes increases the high conductivity as a result of high specific capacitance, extended cycle life, and small charge transfer resistance and are recommended here as the best choice for 3% Nd3+ doped CdO for supercapacitor electrodes.
