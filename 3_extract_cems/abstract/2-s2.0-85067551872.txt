Graphene, as a rising star in materials science, is intensively studied in Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors, owing to its unique structure and excellent properties. The research status of the application of graphene in energy storage field was disscussed and the future development trend was predicted, and therefore to enhance the understanding of the structure-performance relationship of graphene and also the application of graphene in this field. Firstly, the application of graphene in cathode and anode of Li-ion battery, and the application of graphene in electrical double-layer capacitor and pseudo-capacitor were introduced. Secondly, the challenges of graphene in electrical double-layer capacitor were discussed and the ideal structure of graphene applied to electrical double-layer capacitor was proposed. Finally, the "three steps" to realize the commercial application of graphene-based electrical double-layer capacitor were put forward.
