In order to solve the environment pollution of the ship emission and improve the control performance of the propulsion motor, for the shortage of fuel cell's dynamic response, a hybrid FC/battery power system for a low power new energy boat is put forward. A Z-source inverter topology with high voltage boost ability was applied in the electrical propulsion of the boat. As a very smaller shoot-through duty ratio can get a high voltage boost ability, the Z-source inverter is able to reduce the voltage stress on Z-source capacitor and inverter-bridge. The operation mode and working principle of the new energy boat were fully studied, the system small signal model was deduced and the controller was designed on this basis. The output power of fuel cell and the super capacitor were controlled by the shoot-through duty cycle and modulation factor. The direct torque control method was used to control the speed of the propulsion motor. During the boat operating, the fuel cell provided average power, and the super capacitor provided transient power and also absorbed the brake power. Finally, the simulation and experiment were carried out. Simulations and experimental results verifiy the validity of the proposed control strategies during motoring, and regenerative braking operations.
