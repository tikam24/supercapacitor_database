Flexible electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) based on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) electrolytes are fabricated. During the process, electrode materials are mixed into a film and pressed on the current collector instead of the traditional coating method. In order to explore the electrochemical performance of this kind of supercapacitors, a series of testing method including cyclic voltammetry, Galvano static charge discharge testing and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. It is revealed that the electrochemical capacitor based on PVA exhibits excellent electrochemical performance and long cycle life. The specific capacitance for the EDLC based on PVA reaches 187F/g at the current density of 1A/g, and the specific capacitance decreased with the increasing of the scanning rate. The results indicate that the supercapacitor cell capacitance keeps more than 70% after 10000 charging and discharging cycles.
