Self-supported electrode materials have been widely used in supercapacitors. Carbon materials are promising substrates in building self-supported electrode materials attributed to their diverse structures, rich resource, relatively low cost and high stability. Combined with our own research in this field, we summarize here the recent progress on the synthesis of self-supported electrode materials and their supercapacitance properties. The overall synthetic strategy could be divided into two categories: "top-down" and "bottom-up". We hope this review is helpful for the development and application of renewable sources in self-supported electrode materials.
