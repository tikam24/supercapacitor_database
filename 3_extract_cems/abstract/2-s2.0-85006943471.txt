Besides a lack of low-cost electrode materials, the match between the electrode materials and electrolytes is one of the top issues to achieve high-rate electrochemical supercapacitors. Herein, we report an environmentally friendly strategy to prepare three-dimensionally interconnected carbon nanorings (TDICNs) from biomass waste, batata leaves and stalks (BLS). The microstructure of TDICNs matches well with acidic and alkaline electrolytes, making them exhibit high specific capacitances of 532.5 F g1 (1 A g1) and 264.0 F g1 (30 A g1), excellent capacitance retention (95.1% and 91.7% after 1000 cycles at 1 A g1 and 10000 cycles at 30 A g1, respectively) and a high energy density of 25.8-11.9 W h kg1 with a power density of 249.5-13068.0 W kg1 in 1 mol L1 H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. In 6 mol L1 KOH electrolyte, they still exhibit high specific capacitances of 350.0 F g1 (1 A g1) and 246.9 F g1 (30 A g1), excellent cycling stability (95.06% and 91.1% of capacitance retention after 1000 (1 A g1) and 10000 (30 A g1) cycles, respectively), a high energy density of 24.5 W h kg1 and a power density of 12918.0 W kg1
