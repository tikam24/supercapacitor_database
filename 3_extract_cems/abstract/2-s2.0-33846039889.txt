To demonstrate the potential of electrical powertrain technologies for a more sustainable mobility MICHELIN and Paul Scherrer Institut PSI joined forces to realize a passenger vehicle on a white sheet of paper approach to maximize the opportunities of a polymer electrolyte fuel cell system operated with H 2 and O2 and an electrical powertrain. The concept vehicle HY-LIGHT has been presented in 2004 in Shanghai at the "Challenge Bibendum". PSI developed the fuel cell system and the double layer capacitor unit and MICHELIN was responsible for the global concept, the development and the realization of all other components and systems of the HY-LIGHT. At that event the HY-LIGHT performed in a fuel consumption test over a distance of 130 km with an average speed of 70 km/h with a consumption of 2.5 litre gasoline equivalent. The combination of the supercapacitor-module and the fuel cell system allows good acceleration performance and reduction of the fuel consumption of 12-15%. For propulsion and suspension control advanced electric motors are used. They are integrated in the wheels, which enhances design flexibility for the vehicle. The integration of the hydrogen tank in the structure of the chassis enables a tank volume for hydrogen which boosts the range of the vehicle. A low mass of the vehicle and the efficiency of the powertrain are prerequisite for a consumption level of 2.5 litre gasoline equivalent. Beside real world consumption also test cycle consumption in NEDC-tests show values in the same range. The efficiencies will be discussed. Beside an advanced vehicle technology also the hydrogen production process has to be assessed and based on renewable energy sources to foster more sustainable individual mobility.
