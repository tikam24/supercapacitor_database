The manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanosheets with numerous in-plane nanopores are prepared via an in-situ redox reaction, then followed by an etch process. Originating from the reaction between Fe2+ ions and negatively charged MnO2 nanosheets, the obtained porous MnO2 nanosheets (P-MnO2) exhibit high micro/mesoporous structure, which provide a large ion-accessible surface area for efficient charge storage. Moreover, the designed nanopores of MnO2 nanosheets facilitate the electrolyte ions diffusion across the 2D MnO2 nanosheets. As a result, in comparison to the pristine MnO2, the P-MnO2 achieves a higher specific capacitance and desirable rate capability.
