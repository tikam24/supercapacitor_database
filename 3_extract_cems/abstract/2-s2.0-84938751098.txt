We report the synthesis of electrode materials based on one-dimensional α-NiMoO4 nanorods for application as a supercapacitor. The structure and morphology of the electrodes were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, Raman analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The maximum specific capacitance obtained from electrochemical measurements on a standard three-electrode system was 730 Fg-1 at a scan rate of 5 mV-1. Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was fabricated in which the NiMoO4 nanorods were used as the positive electrode and reduced graphene oxide was used as the negative electrode. The maximum specific energy obtained from the ASC study was 12.31 Whkg-1 at a specific current of 0.5 Ag-1 in an aqueous KOH electrolyte. This ASC cell showed good stability with 85% capacitance retention up to 2000 cycles. These results reveal that our ASC shows a high performance and specific energy as well as good cycling stability. We report the synthesis of electrode materials based on 1D α-NiMoO4 nanorods for application as a supercapacitor. The nanorod morphology can be easily controlled by optimizing the initial reaction conditions. Thus, this simple chemical approach to the synthesis of binary metal oxides could be extended to other metal oxides and lead to promising performances in energy storage applications.
