Development of pseudocapacitor electrode materials with high comprehensive electrochemical performance, such as high capacitance, superior reversibility, excellent stability, and good rate capability at the high mass loading level, still is a tremendous challenge. To our knowledge, few works could successfully achieve the above comprehensive electrochemical performance simultaneously. Here we design and synthesize one interwoven three-dimensional (3D) architecture of cobalt oxide nanobrush-graphene@NixCo2x(OH)6x (CNG@NCH) electrode with high comprehensive electrochemical performance: high specific capacitance (2550 F g-1 and 5.1 F cm-2), good rate capability (82.98% capacitance retention at 20 A g-1 vs 1 A g-1), superior reversibility, and cycling stability (92.70% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 20 A g-1), which successfully overcomes the tremendous challenge for pseudocapacitor electrode materials. The asymmetric supercapacitor of CNG@NCH//reduced-graphene-oxide-film exhibits good rate capability (74.85% capacitance retention at 10 A g-1 vs 0.5 A g-1) and high energy density (78.75 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 473 W kg-1). The design of this interwoven 3D frame architecture can offer a new and appropriate idea for obtaining high comprehensive performance electrode materials in the energy storage field.
