Output power of photovoltaic array is directly affected by the illumination intensity. In the actual operation, clouds, trees and other obstructions will form partial shading on the photovoltaic array, resulting in multiple peaks in the power output curve of the photovoltaic array. So this paper provides a solar cell supercapacitor device (SCSD) to reduce the influence of the shadow. First, the paper presents the structural framework of SCSD, and then analyzes the mathematical model and working characteristics of ordinary photovoltaic cells and SCSD under normal and variable illumination. Lastly, it is verified that the SCSD proposed in this paper has stronger shadow adaptation ability than ordinary solar cells, and can solve the problem of multiple peaks of photovoltaic array under shadow based on Matlab simulation.
