Testing supercapacitors due to the high capacitance, and therefore time constants, requires considerable modification and adaptation of classical electrochemical methods and instrumental techniques. This chapter provides the mathematical analysis which defines the parameters of the experimental methods (galvanostatic, potentiostatic, tilting excitation current, Diracpulse excitation, ALSV and EIS). The hardware and software description of the specially developed measuring system based on PC and LabVIEW package is also provided in this chapter. All of the methods are applied to several electrochemical systems, however the development of a new type of supercapacitors based on natural minerals of copper-chalcocite (Cu2S) is specially emphasized. Comparative analysis of methods in terms of efficiency and accuracy is given in this chapter.
