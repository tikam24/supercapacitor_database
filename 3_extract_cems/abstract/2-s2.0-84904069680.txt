α-MnO2 nanowire was prepared by hydrothermal method. The structure of as-prepared manganese oxide demonstrated tetragonal crystalline in X-ray diffraction pattern. Scan electron microscopy (SEM) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the nanowire morphology of as-prepared α-MnO2. The band gap of α-MnO2 was estimated at about 2.06 eV via UV-vis spectrum. As the electrode active material for supercapacitor, the electrochemical specific capacitance of α-MnO2 nanowire achieved 156.5 F/g, which possessed typical capacitive behaviors and good cycling stabilities. Based on the preferable electrochemical performances, as-synthesized α-MnO2 nanowire may be a potential alternative as electrode material for supercapacitor. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
