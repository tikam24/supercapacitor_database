A new hybrid of NiS/CoO porous nanosheets was synthesized on Ni foam by one-step electrodeposition method and used as an electrode for high-performance pseudocapacitance. The as-synthesized NiS/CoO porous nanosheets hybrid shows a high specific capacitance of 1054 F g<sup>-1</sup> at a high current density of 6 A g<sup>-1</sup>, a good rate capability even at high current density (760 F g<sup>-1</sup> at 20 A g<sup>-1</sup>) and a good long-term cycling stability (91.7% of the maximum specific capacitance after 3000 cycles). These excellent properties can be mainly attributed to the unique hierarchical porous structure with large surface area and interspaces which facilitate charge transfer and redox reaction. The enhancement in the interface contact between active material and substrate results in excellent conductivity of the electrode and a strong synergistic effect of NiS and CoO as individual constituents contributed to high capacitance of the hybrid electrode.
