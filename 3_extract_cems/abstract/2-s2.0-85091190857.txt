The synthesis of controllable hollow graphitic architectures can engender revolutionary changes in nanotechnology. Here, we present the synthesis, processing, and possible applications of low aspect ratio hollow graphitic nanoscale architectures that can be precisely engineered into morphologies of (1) continuous carbon nanocups, (2) branched carbon nanocups, and (3) carbon nanotubesâ€“carbon nanocups hybrid films. These complex graphitic nanocup-architectures could be fabricated by using a highly designed short anodized alumina oxide nanochannels, followed by a thermal chemical vapor deposition of carbon. The highly porous film of nanocups is mechanically flexible, highly conductive, and optically transparent, making the film attractive for various applications such as multifunctional and high-performance electrodes for energy storage devices, nanoscale containers for nanogram quantities of materials, and nanometrology.
