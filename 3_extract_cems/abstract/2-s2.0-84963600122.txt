Standalone/grid-tied wind energy generating system under intermittent wind velocity and changing load condition is a challenging task. The objective of this paper is to develop a Hybrid Power System (HPS) integrating a renewable energy source, namely, a Wind Turbine (WT) coupled with Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) and a hybrid energy storage system, i.e., a battery bank and super-capacitor in the proposed architecture. The proposed system is connected to the national grid to increase reliability and continuity of power. In the proposed system, the WT is taken as primary energy source to satisfy the domestic load demand. The battery is added to regulate the output power of WT under unpredictable power fluctuations. The super-capacitor overfills the slow response of battery under rapidly changing load condition due to its high power density. The power management and regulation is performed by Coordinated Energy Management System (CEMS). The performance of the presented design is tested under different wind speed and load conditions for the Matlab simulation of 48 Hrs. The proposed system demonstrates excellent performance in terms of grid stability, voltage and frequency regulation.
