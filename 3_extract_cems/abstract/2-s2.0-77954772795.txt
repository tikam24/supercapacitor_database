In order to meet with the requirement of absorbing the braking energy recovery of urban rail transit system (URTS) for supercapacitors (SC) management system, a complete design, including the management system module structure, management module unit with power-bus isolation, and voltage-balancing circuits based on high-frequency transformer, was developed. It is verified that the supercapacitor management system operates steadily and accurately, and can make sure of the efficient use of supercapacitors in practical applications. This system can be also used in other high power systems.
