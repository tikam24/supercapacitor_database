Pollution from diesel engines is much increased, and fuel used up, by truck drivers idling their engines to provide power for electrical loads. Many US states have enacted legislation to prevent it. A supercapacitor developed by Nanotecture takes its place. The company deals in self-assembly of low-cost surfactant molecules to fabricate nanomaterials by template deposition. It can thus make an anode of nanoporous nickel hydroxide that, with carbon forming the negative cathode, provides a uniquely powerful high-energy, low-cost supercapacitor. Emissions of 20 ton/yr of CO2 from each of 2 million trucks are eliminated, saving 40 million ton/yr.
