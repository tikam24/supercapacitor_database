In this work, stabilized Al-substituted α-Ni(OH) 2 materials were successfully synthesized by a chemical coprecipitation method. The experimental results showed that the 7.5% Al-substituted α-Ni(OH) 2 materials exhibited high specific capacitance (2.08×10 3 F/g) and excellent rate capability due to the high stability of Al-substituted α-Ni (OH) 2 structures in alkaline media, suggesting its potential application in electrode material for supercapacitors. To enhance energy density, an asymmetric type pseudo/electric double-layer capacitor was considered where α-Ni(OH) 2 materials and activated carbon act as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. Values for the maximum specific capacitance of 127 F/g and specific energy of 42 W·h/kg were demonstrated for a cell voltage between 0.4 and 1.6 V. By using the α-Ni(OH) 2 electrode, the asymmetric supercapacitor exhibited high energy density and stable power characteristics. The hybrid supercapacitor also exhibited a good electrochemical stability with 82% of the initial capacitance over consecutive 1,000 cycle numbers. © Springer-Verlag 2009.
