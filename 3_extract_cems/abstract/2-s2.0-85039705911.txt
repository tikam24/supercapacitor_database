We report highly porous CeO 2 nanostructures (CeO 2 NSs) suitable for supercapacitor applications, synthesized using a fast and cost effective combustion approach. Due to its prominent valence states of Ce 3+ /Ce 4+ , CeO 2 has emerged as a promising pseudocapacitive material. The drawback of using CeO 2 as a supercapacitor electrode is its poor electrical conductivity. We overcame this drawback of CeO 2 by creating oxygen vacancies on its surface, which act to enhance its electrical conductivity. The physical interpretation of the as-synthesized CeO 2 NSs shows that they have dense active sites and diffusion pathways that enhance the performance of the electrode in a supercapacitor. Electrodes prepared using the synthesized CeO 2 NSs exhibited the initial specific capacitance of 134.6 F g −1 and superior cycling stability of 92.5% after 1000 cycles at a constant current density of 1 A g −1 , indicating their potential suitability for use as efficient electrode for supercapacitor devices. The facile synthesis method used herein would help to reduce the cost and time required to synthesize CeO 2 particles and also would avoid the need to research and/or synthesize beneficial composite structures for enhancing the electrochemical properties of CeO 2 based electrodes.
