An electrochromic supercapacitor (ESC) not only has energy storage properties but also directly indicates the energy storage level by the colour difference at various applied voltages. Electropolymerization of active monomers can provide polymer films with porous structures for electrode materials with both electrochemical properties and electrochromic properties. However, the low molecular weight and undefined structure of the electropolymerized film, as well as the related electrode defects, limit its application in an ESC. Employing conjugated polymer rather than the small molecule monomer as the initial electroactive moieties of the electropolymerization for ESC electrodes ensures the desirable conjugation length and relatively planar structure, which is expected to improve the conductivity and stability and hence the ESC performance. Here, we have designed and synthesized a novel conjugated polymer, PCZBDTCZ, with a side chain, terminal-modified carbazole group, which can be electrically polymerized to yield a crosslinked polymer film. Furthermore, different crosslinking agents have been introduced in the electropolymerization process, and seven new crosslinked conjugated polymer films have been prepared. The effects of cross-linking agents with different structures and mixed cross-linking agents on the morphology and electrochemical and electrochromic properties of the films were systematically investigated. The results indicated that the electropolymerization of the polymer PCZBDTCZ can produce electrode films with porous morphologies, and the loose pore structure can accelerate the transport of the electrolyte and shorten the response times of the materials, while the large-area cross-linked lattice structure can alleviate the volume change during cycling and hence improve the stability. Moreover, the crosslinked conjugated polymer PCZBDTCZ-D3P1-3 obtained by the introduction of two cross-linking agents had the best colouring efficiency and the maximum area ratio capacitance, demonstrating that tuning multiple crosslinking agents with excellent electrochemical active groups had a positive effect on the electrochemical and electrochromic properties of the materials.
