Nanosheets of MoO3 that consist of only a few layers have been prepared by using four methods, including the oxidation of MoS2 nanosheets, intercalation with LiBr, and ultrasonication. These nanosheets have been characterized by atomic force microscopy and other techniques. Besides showing a blue-shift of the optical absorption band compared to the bulk sample, few-layer MoO3 exhibits enhanced photocatalytic activity. In combination with a borocarbonitride, few-layer MoO3 shows good performance characteristics as a supercapacitor electrode. Â© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
