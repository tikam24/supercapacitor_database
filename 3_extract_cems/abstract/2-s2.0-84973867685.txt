A simple and fast electrochemical polymerization method is used to prepare polyaniline nanofibers supported on carbon paper. The composition and morphology of the obtained composites are characterized by infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. It is found that an aligned polyaniline nanofiber array is uniformly supported on carbon paper substrate. This unique array architecture provides good electrochemical supercapacitor performances for the obtained composites. A specific capacitance as high as of 531 F g-1 at a current density of 3 mA cm-2 is achieved. The research data show that acceptable electrochemical properties can be attained by controlling the structure of supercapacitor electrode.
