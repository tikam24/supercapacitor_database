Electrochemical Energy Storage (EES) technologies are playing a significant role in the aspirations to decrease the usage of fossil fuels and move toward an environmentally conscious society. Due to the importance of EES technologies, more researchers are looking for an efficient and effective electrode material, which is the most important part of the EES system that possibly could result in much-needed advancements in the field. However, incoming researchers have a diverse backgrounds and as newcomers to the electrochemical community, they sometimes lack familiarity with the core concepts, well-established procedures, and methodologies that define the standards of the discipline. This issue's importance has been acknowledged, and various publications have been written to guide researchers in doing accurate evaluations. However, to the best of our knowledge, even though these publications demonstrate the methodologies and procedures for approaching the existing challenges none of them address the offered topic with an actual example. To address this gap, we present a step-by-step procedure for the electrochemical analysis of polypyrrole, a widely utilized conducting polymer with significant potential as an electrode material for supercapacitors and batteries.
