In this paper, a coordinated control scheme for wind turbine generator (WTG) and supercapacitor energy storage system (ESS) is proposed for temporary frequency supports. Inertial control is designed by using generator torque limit considering the security of WTG system, while ESS releases its energy to compensate the sudden active power deficit during the recovery process of turbine rotor. WTG is modeled using the fatigue, aerodynamic, structure, turbulence (FAST) code, which identifies the mechanical loadings of the turbine and addresses electro-mechanical interactions in the wind energy system. A damping controller is augmented to the inertial control to suppress severe mechanical oscillations in the shaft and tower of the turbine during frequency supports. Furthermore, the result of small-signal stability analysis shows that the WTG-ESS tends to improve the stability of the whole multi-energy power grid. The major contributions of this paper will be validated by utilizing the proposed control method that combines the grid support capability and maintaining the integrity of structural design of the turbine for normal operations.
