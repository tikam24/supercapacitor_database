3D cubic-ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs) are prepared by nanocasting approach using silica KIT-6 as the template, furfuryl alcohol as the carbon precursor and subsequently carbonized at the temperature of 500 °C, 600 °C and 700 °C. The physicochemical and electrochemical properties of the as-prepared OMCs are investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm, Fourier infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cycle life measurement in 6 mol L-1 KOH electrolyte. The results demonstrate that the synthesized technology is a crucial factor impacting the characteristics of OMCs. With the change of carbonization temperature, the OMC-600 exhibits the honeycomb-like morphology with high specific surface area (1257.8 m2 g-1), large pore volume (1.56 cm3 g-1), and high capacitance of 221.8 F g-1 at the current density of 1 A g-1. In addition, the supercapacitor using OMC-600 as the active material shows high specific capacitance and excellent cycle stability, which exhibits a specific capacitance of 52.8 F g-1 at the charge/discharge current density of 0.5 A g-1. Moreover, the OMC-600 supercapacitor delivers high energy density of 6.53 Wh kg-1 at the power density of 5000 W kg-1, indicating a promising application for the high performance supercapacitors.
