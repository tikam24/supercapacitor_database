We developed a facile hydrothermal route to synthesize hexagonal shaped CuS/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composite for high performance supercapacitors. The as-obtained products were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectra, Transmission electron microscope, Energy dispersive spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectra, and Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) analysis. XRD and TEM results suggest that CuS crystalline with hexagonal shaped particles are uniformly distributed onto the surface of rGO or wrapped in the rGO. The Lattice parameter of bare CuS was found to be a = b = c = 3.631Å and volume = 47.83 Å3, further it was decreased to a = b = c = 3.591 Å and volume = 46.26 Å3 for CuS/rGO composite. The XPS result confirms that presence of C and valance state of Cu2+ in the CuS/rGO composite. The BET analysis confirms that CuS/rGO composite shows high specific area (122 m2g-1) and lower pore size 8-10 nm compared with bare CuS (surface area = 71 m2g-1 and pore size = 12-15 nm). Remarkably, the electrochemical performance of the CuS/rGO composite electrode exhibits a maximum capacity of 1604 Fg-1 at a specific current of 2 Ag-1 and results in good long term cyclic stability 97% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles. Furthermore, the fabricated CuS/rGO//AC based asymmetric supercapacitor showed outstanding cyclability (capacitance retention of 99.5% after 5000 cycles at 2 Ag-1), and high-energy density (21 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 315 W kg-1).
