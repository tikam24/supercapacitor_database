Exfoliated graphene oxide (GO) and polysiloxane were blended and pyrolyzed to synthesize free-standing SiOC-graphene composite papers. Characterization techniques reveal a layer-by-layer stacking of GO sheets and an increase in interlayer spacing due to the functionalization of SiOC with GO. This unique structure of the SiOC-graphene composite paper makes it suitable for energy storage applications in batteries and supercapacitors. A reversible electrochemical capacity ∼750 mA h g-1 which is stabilized to ∼400 mA h g-1 after 5 cycles was recorded when tested as a battery electrode. Also, a maximum specific capacitance of 75.72 F g-1 at a current density of 6.7 A g-1 was observed while studying its electrochemical performance as a supercapacitor.
