In this paper, we have successfully prepared MnNi2O4 micro/nano multiporous spheres via a subsequent simple impregnation and calcination. Lithium storage performance of the as-prepared MnNi2O4 has been firstly investigated, with a stable capacity of 669.2 mAh g−1 after 70 cycles at 1.0 A g−1. Cyclic voltammograms data indicate that discharge-charge process is synergistically controlled by both the dominate diffusion and the secondary capacitive behavior. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy evidences low resistance and high Li+ diffusion coefficient (3.4 × 10−15 cm2 s−1). Furthermore, an excellent supercapacitor behavior is also achieved. All that can be benefited from the unique micro/nano multiporous structures which can effectively facilitate electrolyte penetration and diffusion of tiny particles, alleviate the volume swelling and the electrochemical agglomeration, suggesting a prospective application in energy storage devices.
