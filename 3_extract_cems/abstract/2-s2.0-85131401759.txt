Tin selenide-based materials (SnSe/SnSe2) have been considered as one of the most promising electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage applications such as lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), potassium-ion batteries (KIBs), and supercapacitors (SCs). The presence of a unique 2D-layered structure makes it capable of easy ion storage and higher theoretical capacities compared to traditional electrodes like graphite. Further, tin selenide is abundant in the earth's crust. However, tin selenide-based electrodes suffer a significant volume change during ion storage, resulting in poor cycling stability and rate capacity. Hence, there is a need to understand and systematically modify tin selenide-based electrodes in various aspects to improve their performance. This review discusses properties, synthesis methods with multiple nanostructures of SnSe/SnSe2, and their applications in rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors. The major goal of this review is to highlight the strategies to overcome poor cycling stability and rate capacity of SnSe/SnSe2, like suitable synthesis methods, morphology, phase control, and designing hybrid composite materials.
