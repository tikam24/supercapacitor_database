Owing to the nanometer size range, Quantum Dots (QDs) have exhibited unique physical and chemical properties which are favourable for different applications. Especially, due to their quantum confinement effect, excellent optoelectronic characteristics is been observed. This consid-erable progress has not only uplifted the singular usage of QDs, but also encouraged to prepare various hybrid materials to achieve superior efficiency by eliminating certain shortcomings. Such issues can be overcome by compositing QDs with polymers. Via employing polymer composite with QDs (PQDs) for supercapacitor applications, adequate conductivity, stability, excellent energy density, and better specific capacitance is been achieved which we have elaborately discussed in this review. Researchers have already explored various types of polymer nanocomposite with different QDs such as carbonaceous QDs, transition metal oxide/sulphide QDs etc. as electrode material for supercapacitor application. Synthesis, application outcome, benefits, and drawbacks of these are explained to portray a better understanding. From the existing studies it is clearly confirmed that with using PQDs electrical conductivity, electrochemical reactivity, and the charge accumulation on the surface have prominently been improved which effected the fabricated supercapacitor device performance. More comprehensive fundamentals and observations are explained in the current review which indicates their promising scopes in upcoming times.
