In this work, nickel oxide/sulfide nanoparticle-embedded porous carbon (NiO-NixSy @KC) is successfully constructed using kelp as a starting material by an impregnation and vulcanization method. Such 3D porous structure endows the NiO-NixSy @KC-800 electrode with fast ion transport and low interface resistance for supercapacitor application. The NiO-NixSy @KC-800 electrode delivers a high specific capacitance of 3160.33 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and a capacitance retention of 83.24 % after 10,000 cycles at 5 A g−1. An asymmetric supercapacitor device assembled by NiO-NixSy @KC-800 and kelp-derived porous carbon pyrolyzed at 800 °C (KC-800) exhibits a maximum energy density of 68.58 W h kg−1 at a power density of 375.01 W kg−1. Benefitting from the structural and compositional advantages of NiO-NixSy @KC-800, the composite shows a minimum reflection loss (RL) of − 38.2 dB at a thickness of 3.0 mm. The prepared material presents a great potential for supercapacitors and microwave absorbers.
