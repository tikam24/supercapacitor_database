This paper presents a working solid-state coaxial carbon fiber micro supercapacitor with more than 100X smaller diameter as compared with the state-of-art, including: (1) an overall size of 10Î¼m in diameter; (2) well-controlled electrodeposition and mechanical pulling processes for electrolyte and electrode coatings toward high volumetric energy density and power density; and (3) scalable and low-cost processes. As such, we believe this technology can lead to direct integration of energy storage devices in fabrics for future wearable electronic systems.
