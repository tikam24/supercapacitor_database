Template synthesis of porous carbon with rich functionalities by a scalable strategy without using any solvents and activators will be a green and promising route. Herein, we reported an all-solid-state synthesis strategy by mixing glucose and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) by milling and then undergoing a segmented carbonization in which first at low temperature of 573 K to polymerize sucrose onto g-C3N4, then at high temperature of 973 K to carbonized the composite to obtain a porous carbon (denoted as GNC) with abundant nitrogen species over 20 atom% and large packing density (0.91–1.25 g cm−3). Due to the features of large packing density and rich electrochemically-active N species, as electrode for supercapacitive energy storage, the developed GNC exhibit a comparable energy storage level with both high gravimetric energy density of 26.8 Wh kg−1@1000 W kg−1 and volumetric energy density of 30.8 Wh L−1@1150 W L−1, suggesting a potentiality in energy storage field. Importantly, the present strategy owns characteristics of ease of operation, green and scalable, which would be a promising synthesis route towards the fabrication of functional carbon utilizing in many fields like sorption & separation, catalysis, energy storage and so on.
