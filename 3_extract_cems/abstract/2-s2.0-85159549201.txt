With the increasingly serious environmental pollution and depletion of natural resources, it is necessary to develop efficient and environmentally friendly energy storage equipments to alleviate the problem of resource shortage. In this study, a novel MnSe2/Co0.85Se (MCSe) electrode was successfully prepared using a simple, green and environmentally friendly electrodeposition method. The MCSe electrode exhibited good electrochemical performance, and possesses a high specific capacity (Cs) of 1380C/g at a current density (CD) of 1 A/g. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) assembled using a positive electrode (the MCSe electrode) and a negative electrode (active carbon (AC) electrode) delivered a high specific energy density (Es) of 49.63 Wh/kg at a specific power density (Ps) of 750 W/kg. Hence, this study provides a new approach for designing metal selenides for energy storage and conversion.
