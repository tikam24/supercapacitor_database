γ-Cyclodextrin (γ-CD) is a pollution free and renewable biomass carbon source. Porous carbon spheres (PCS) can be prepared by the soft template method and hydrothermal treatment of γ-cyclodextrin. By combining PCS and the conductive polymer polyaniline (PANI), a composite with good electrochemical energy storage can be obtained. The electrochemical properties of the PANI/PCS composite are studied. In the three-electrode system, the specific capacitance of PCS reached 110.0F·g−1 at 1 A·g−1, whereas the specific capacitance of the PANI/PCS composite reaches a maximum specific capacitance of 339.6F·g−1, which is a significant improvement of 208.7% compared to that of PCS. Therefore, PANI/PCS composites have broad application prospects in supercapacitor energy-storage devices.
