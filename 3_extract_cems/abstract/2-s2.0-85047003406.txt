We report a new hybrid super capacitor by integrating a nano-structured transition metal and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to form electrical double layer (EDL) and redox layer on both cathode and anode electrodes to improve the specific capacitance of fiber supercapacitors. NiCo2O4 nano-needles were formed on the surface of a current collector. Also, CNTs were applied on the nano-needles layer to obtain high capacitance. In addition, the electrostatic capacity was maximized through the application of silver nanowires (Ag NWs) on the CNT layer. As a result, the specific capacitance of the device was measured as 73 F/cm3.
