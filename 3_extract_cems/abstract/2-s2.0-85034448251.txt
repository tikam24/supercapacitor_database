This paper deals with development procedure of EDLC module's (multi-cell battery system) thermal simulation model and consequential simplification targeting as lowest simulation time as possible, together with achievement of high model's accuracy. On the other side, one of most important requirement is possibility of model's utilization almost on standard personal computer (nor multi-core computation machine). First the problematic according development of supercapacitor thermal simulation model will be described. After it the process of geometrical model development of proposed EDLC module is shown. Consequently the description of optimization steps of simulation model's geometry (simplifications) targeting shortening of simulation time will be described. Finally simulation experiments which are confirming proposed design procedure have been provided.
