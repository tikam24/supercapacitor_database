Tri-ethanolamine-ethoxylate assisted hydrothermal method has been adopted for synthesis of MnCo2O4 nanostructures. The XRD pattern reveals the successful synthesis and spinel FCC structure of assynthesized MnCo2O4. The spherical morphology of as-synthesized nanostructured MnCo2O4 has been analyzed by FE-SEM analysis. The cyclic voltammetry and the galvonostatic charge discharge analysis of the as-fabricated MnCo2O4 electrode revealed excellent electrochemical performance in 1 mol L-1 Na2SO4 liquid electrolyte in aqueous solution. The nanostructured MnCo2O4 demonstrated highest specific capacitance of 2014 Fg1 at a current density 5 Ag1 and high energy density of 102Wh kg1. Moreover, nanostructured MnCo2O4 shows low values of electrolyte resistance and charge-transfer resistance. Thus, these excellent electrochemical properties demonstrated by as-synthesized MnCo2O4 nanostructures reveals that these are the promising electrode material for high energy density supercapacitor application.
