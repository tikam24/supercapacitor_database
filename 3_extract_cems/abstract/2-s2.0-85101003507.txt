Energy storage is one of the critical challenges and researchers are finding sophisticated ways to meet this challenge. To cope with this major need, the pure and W-doped NiO nano-sheets with different doping ratios (0â€“6%) were synthesized by facile hydrothermal route. Influence of W content on structural and capacitive properties was studied by employing XRD, SEM, TEM, EDS, BET, CV, GCD and EIS techniques. The tuning of morphology from micro-structures to nano-sheets is achieved by doping various contents ratio of tungsten in NiO. The pseudocapacitive behavior has been shown by nano-sheets and the 4 at. % W-doped NiO has shown maximum specific capacitance equal to 872.32 F/g which is suggestively greater in comparison to several reported NiO based materials. These nanosheets exhibited excellent charging-discharging retention (84.38%) and reasonable cyclic stability (87.5%) after 3000 CV cycles at 5 mV/s scan rate. High capacitance and stability of these nano-sheets have shown their promising application in supercapacitors.
