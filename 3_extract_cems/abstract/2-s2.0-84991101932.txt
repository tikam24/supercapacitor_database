This study reports a facile hydrothermal synthesis of Copper tungsten oxide (CuWO4) and CuWO4-reduced graphene oxide hybrid nanoparticles and its application as an electrode for supercapacitor application. The morphology and composition has been characterized using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and EDAX. The supercapacitive behavior has been studied from cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests. The CuWO4-reduced graphene oxide hybrid nanoparticles show highest specific capacitance of 35.71 F/g at a current density of 0.25 A/g with excellent cycling stability.
