Supercapacitors as novel energy storage devices between conventional capacitors and batteries, with more specific capacitance and energy densities than conventional capacitors and more power densities than batteries are to be used in many fields. Supercapacitor is regarded as one of good alternatives for meeting the requirement of market with excellent power performance and high cyclability. This paper deals with the characteristics of charge and discharge behavior of supercapacitor module for developing 42V hybrid energy storage system with lead acid battery and supercapacitor in order to adopt to 42V power net for vehicle. An analysis performed in this paper indicates that supercapacitor storage system may be cost effective for high cycle applications.
