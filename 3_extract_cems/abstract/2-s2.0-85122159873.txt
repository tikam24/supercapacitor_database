To develop special structure nanomaterials from nature with large specific surface areas and conduct appropriate doping may be effective ways to improve the performance of carbon-basing energy storage devices and mobile power supplies. Pure Gram-positive bacteria carbon material with dense microporous structure and properly self O, N-doping was developed towards highly performance supercapacitors for the first time. The structural characterization and electrochemial survey show that carbon derived from Gram-positive bacteria can bring unexpected material properties for its layered and nitrogen, oxygen containing peptidoglycan cell wall structure. Specifically, bifidobacterium yogurt starter powder as a representative of Gram-positive bacteria was employed and pre-carbonized at 450 °C, then re-carbonized at 700, 800 and 900 °C with KOH activated, respectively. The as-prepared Gram-positive bacteria carbons (GpBCs) have inherited the bacteria's cell wall structure to some extent, which makes the specific surface area as high as 2877 m2/g. When the mess ratio of the precursor to KOH was 1: 2 and re-carbonized at 800 °C, the sample named GpBC-800-2 exhibited a medium specific surface area (2436 m2/g), and possessed proper oxygen(11.20%) and nitrogen(0.56%) doping. For further electrochemial measurement, GpBC-800-2 delivered a specific capacitance of 220 F/g and a 94.5% retention after 10000 cycles in 6 M KOH at the current density of 1 A/g in three-electrode system. For further assessment on symmetry devices, 30 F/g specific capacitance was obtained and 97.8% retention after 10000 cycles were achieved in 6 M KOH at the current density of 1 A/g for symmetry devices. The constructed devices presented an energy density of 4.2 Wh/kg at the power density of 0.5 kW/kg, and still remained 3.19 Wh/kg at the power density of 5 kW/kg. Results of this work have given a first glance for pure Garm-positive bacteria carbon materials in supercapacitor application.
