Constructing three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical bimetallic pseudocapacitive materials with abundant opening channel and heterojunction structures is rather promising but still challenging for high-performance supercapacitors. Herein, a self-sacrifice-template epitaxial growth strategy was proposed for the first time to construct 3D hierarchical bimetallic pseudocapacitive material. By using this strategy, NiCo2O4 nanowires (NiCo2O4NW) arrayed randomly to form a porous shell via in-situ epitaxial growth fully enclosing a MnO2 tube core, forming multiple transport channels and nano-heterojunctions between MnO2 and NiCo2O4NW, which facilitates electron transfer, i.e. exhibiting high electronic conductivity than any single component. As a result of the self-sacrifice-template epitaxial growth method, special hollow tectorum-like 3D hierarchical structure with considerable inter-nanowire space and hollow interior space enables easy access of electrolyte to NiCo2O4NW surface and MnO2 core, thereby resulting in highly exposed redox active sites of MnO2 core and NiCo2O4NW shell for energy storage. Comprehensive evaluations confirmed MnO2@NiCo2O4NW was a supercapacitor electrode candidate, delivering a superior energy density of 106.37 Wh kgâˆ’1. Such performance can be ascribed to the synergistic coupling effect of 3D hierarchical tube and nano-heterojunction structures. The proposed self-sacrifice-template epitaxial growth strategy provides important guidance for designing high-performance energy storage materials.
