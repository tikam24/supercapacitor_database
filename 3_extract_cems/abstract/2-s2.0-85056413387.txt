The uncertainties which occur in wind energy generation system (WECS) due to fault causes severe effects on the grid stability and potentially degrades the reliability of system. These suspicions make the generating system to be disconnected from grid. However, disconnection of WECS is not allowed under such scenarios as it shares a significant portion of grid load. Modern grid code puts some constraint on the system which defines blue print for continuity of wind system operation. Not only the grid code but even the wind system based doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) indicate rotor over current, DC-Link over voltage situations. These abnormalities must be carefully examined and properly handled. To accomplish these objectives, this paper proposes a combined scheme incorporating supercapacitor energy storage system (SCESS) and DC-super conducting fault current limiter (DC-SFCL). The SCESS will be able to manage the surplus power during fault condition at DC-Link capacitor and hence restricts the DC-Link over voltage. It also helps to improve the power quality under normal steady state operation. The DC-SFCL will be able to restrict the rotor over current, electromagnetic torque oscillations under prescribed threshold limits. The restriction of fault resulting from the proposed scheme ensures the generator safety and allows continuous operation of system even in case of severe grid fault. The proposed scheme is validated by using MATLAB/SIMULINK based environment.
