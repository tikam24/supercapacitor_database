Nowadays,zeolite imidazolate frameworks are proving themselves as a promising material for pseudocapacitive material but their preparations are time consuming and tedious. Therefore, we introduce here a simple and commercially used electrodeposition method to remove the barrier in enhanced characteristics of supercapacitors. Here preparation of zeolite imidazolate frameworks (Co@ZIF8) is successfully prepared with different deposition times of 200 s, 300 s and 400 s. We showed that a change in the deposition time of MOFs can significantly affect the mass loading of the electrodes and hence enhances the electrochemical performance of pseudocapacitors. We found that capacitance for Co@ZIF8 with a deposition time of 300 s(Co@ZIF8/2) is highest than the other two. Co@ZIF8/2 shows a capacitance of 1282.31 Fg−1 at a current density of 2 Ag−1 in a three electrode. The fabricated device for Co@ZIF8/2 shows an excellent capacitance of 155.53Fg−1 with 99.85 % capacitance retention over 8000 cycles. These results show that the designed Co@ZIF8 electrode augments the performance of metal organic frameworks for supercapacitors applications.
