One of the isolated PV set power supply disadvantage is the low level of energy, which considerably limits the powered applications. The aim of this paper deals with supercapacitor utilization in such installations so to solve the power limitation problem. The study shows that this idea worth going into, but not yet mature considering the economic point of view. Supercpapacitor technology is improving rapidly nowadays, we are confidant that in the near future, this application should be viable.
