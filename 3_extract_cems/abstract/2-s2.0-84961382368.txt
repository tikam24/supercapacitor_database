Here, we present a one-step hydrogen reduction synthesis of Ni3S2 nanoplatelets on graphene surface by using NiSO4Â·3N2H4/GO as precursor. In this process, we have demonstrated that hydrazine molecule, which can coordinate with NiSO4 in the form of pink precipitation, not only contributes to the formation of Ni3S2 nanoplatelets structure, but also enhances the efficiency of SO42- to S24- conversion compared with NiSO4/GO. Supercapacitors made from the obtained Ni3S2/rGO composite exhibits a specific capacitance of 912.2 F g-1 at 2 mV s-1 scanning rate, and 875.6 F g-1 at galvanostatic discharge current density of 1 A g-1, along with exceptional rate capability of 83.2% at discharge current density from 1 A g-1 to 10 A g-1 as well as good cycling stability. We attribute the excellent performance from the improved contact between graphene and the planar Ni3S2 structure, which strengthens the synergistic effect with graphene as conductive support and Ni3S2 nanoplatelets as the pseudocapacitive materials. This method allows the direct and efficient preparation of Ni3S2, and provides a simple route to integrate them with graphene for energy storage applications.
