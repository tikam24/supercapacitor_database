This paper deals with supercapacitor modeling. Electrochemical phenomena inside an element and their effects on electrical signals are first analyzed. A fractional linear model, valid only around voltage operating points is then proposed. A fractional nonlinear model is then deduced and a method for the model identification is described. Accuracy of this nonlinear fractional model is evaluated on real signals. Â© 2013 IFAC.
