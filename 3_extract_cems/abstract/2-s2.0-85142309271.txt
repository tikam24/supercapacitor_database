Here, utilising easily available precursor, we technologically advanced a modest and affordable way to form carbon-grounded material interlaced with metal oxides to form a controlled structure. As a hard substrate, interconnect microstructures were built via the in-situ creation of rGO/MnO2-rod/CuO-sphere (MCR) nanoparticles, which could significantly enhance capacitive active sites and encourage electrolyte transport during the electrochemical process. The modified sample showed excellent cycling stability with capacitance retention of 83.74 % after 5000 cycles at 10 A/g and a high specific capacitance of 658.97 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g. Additionally, at an energy density of 118.61 Wh/kg, the supercapacitor made of MCR electrodes demonstrated a power density of 1.5 kW/kg. This research presents a viable method for creating supercapacitor electrodes with great performance.
