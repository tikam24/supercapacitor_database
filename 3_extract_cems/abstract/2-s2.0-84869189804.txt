Supercapacitors are a strong candidate for high-power applications such as electric/hybrid vehicles due to their high power densities and high efficiency. In these applications, supercapacitors are used in large stacks (modules) to provide the peak-power requirement. They are subject to heavy duty cycling conditions, which results in significant heat generation inside each cell. Under such conditions, natural convection air cooling is found to be an ineffective method for removing heat from the supercapacitor modules. Therefore, utilizing an appropriate forced convection cooling system becomes necessary for the lifetime and performance of supercapacitor modules. The objective of this paper is to study the cooling of supercapacitor modules under high velocity impinging fan flow. A three-dimensional computational model was developed using the commercial FEM software package COMSOL. The κ-ε two equation turbulence model is employed to account for turbulent transport. The supercapacitor module studied in this paper was composed of 18 cells, which were connected in series. The parameters studied include the Reynolds number of the impinging flow, the spacing between cells and the impingement distance. The results show how the forced convection cooling varies with the Reynolds number and that the Nusselt number increases with the Reynolds number. In addition, the variation of the temperature profile within the module with the spacing arrangement between cells was investigated. Copyright © 2011 by ASME.
