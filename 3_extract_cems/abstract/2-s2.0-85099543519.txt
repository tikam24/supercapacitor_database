This work reports the fabric-based supercapacitors (FSCs) using silver coated textile as the current collector. The electrochemical properties of the device in PVA-KCl gel electrolyte was studied. The performance of the device was further improved by printing an inhouse formulated graphite paste as the active electrode. The graphite printed Berlin fabric-based supercapacitor (BGr-FSC) shows an areal capacitance (CA) of 13.1 mF.cm-2, which is almost 4 times higher than the capacitance (3.53 mF.cm-2) of Berlin based FSC i.e. the one without graphite paste.
