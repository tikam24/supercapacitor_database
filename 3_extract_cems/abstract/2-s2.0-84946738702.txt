Electrochemical performance of electrode material has been greatly influenced by the surface structures in supercapacitor applications. Conductive layer such as carbon coating on electrode material effectively improve the surface chemistry, electrode conductivity and protect the electrode material, resulting enhanced electrochemical behavior with remarkable cyclic stability. However the production of nanostructured materials with environmental benignity remains challenge for researchers. Here we report a simple greener route and one-pot synthesis of carbon coated V2O5 with flowery architecture. The structural, morphological and electrochemical properties of carbon coated V2O5 have been studied. The carbon coated flowery V2O5 exhibits maximum specific capacitance of 417 F g-1 with 100% capacitance retention even at 2000 continuous charge-discharge cycles. Two electrode symmetric device has been fabricated to evaluate the electrochemical performance. The symmetric supercapacitor exhibits the maximum specific capacitance of 101 F g-1 at the sweep rate of 2 mV s-1.
