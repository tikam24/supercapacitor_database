In this paper, the modeling of the ultracapacitor using fractional order model is shown. The derivation of time domain response of the ultracapacitor and system with the ultracapacitor is presented. The results of frequency domain identification were used to validate the response of the ultracapacitor in time domain. All theoretical results are compared with the response of the physical system with the ultracapacitor. Then the issue of capacity for the ultracapacitors is shown and discussed. Â©2010 IEEE.
