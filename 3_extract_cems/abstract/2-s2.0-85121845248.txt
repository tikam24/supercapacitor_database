In this study, hydrated (HNMO), calcined (NMO), Fe-doped nickel molybdate (FHNMO), and hydrated NiMoO4/reduced graphene oxide (HNMO/G) powders were synthesized through the hydrothermal process followed by investigation and comparison of their supercapacitive properties. In order to obtain a supercapacitor with optimal performances, there are several parameters that must be studied including specific capacitance, cyclic stability, rate performance, electron transfer, and charge/discharge kinetic at the surface of active material. Results show the electrochemical properties of the HNMO are higher than that of the NMO. According to this, the calculated specific capacitance of the HNMO electrode material is 718 F g−1 which is about 63% higher than the NMO. Raman spectroscopy, XRD, FESEM, and HRTEM studies show that graphene plates act as a basal network for nucleation and growth of the HNMO nanorods, and there is an electrostatic interaction between these two parts of the hybrid powder. The XPS results of the FHNMO powder confirm its surface chemical composition contains Ni2+, Fe3+, and Mo6+ ions. The electrochemical performance of the powders was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and EIS. The specific capacitance of the HNMO/G reached to 983 F g−1, and in addition, cyclic stability and rate performance of the HNMO/G sample were improved to 84% and 31% than the HNMO, respectively. The HNMO/G electrode exhibits the highest cycling stability and rate performance among all the samples. A two-electrode asymmetric device (HNMO/G//AC) was prepared, concluding a specific capacitance of 142.2 F g−1, a maximum energy density of 50.55 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 671 W kg−1, along with a good cycling stability of 82.3% of the initial capacitance after 1000 cycles. The resulting supercapacitive properties demonstrate the HNMO/G has a great potential for implementation in real applications.
