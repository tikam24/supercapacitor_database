The supercapacitors have relative higher power density than batteries. Utilizing the supercapacitors with batteries is effective to reduce peak currents of the batteries and increase the batteries lifetime. Furthermore, it is beneficial to achieve better power and energy performance. So, hybrid energy storage systems are widely used in recent years. In order to have insight about interaction of the supercapacitors with batteries, having suitable models for them is necessary. Several models have been proposed for the supercapacitors. There are different methods to identify the parameters of the models. This paper presents a method to identify the parameters of three branches model of the supercapacitors. The model with the calculated parameters can represent terminal behavior of the supercapacitors, properly. The simulation results for the model with the identified parameters by the proposed method and another similar method are compared to evaluate the performance of the suggested approach. The results confirm accuracy of the model to represent operation of the supercapacitor in different conditions.
