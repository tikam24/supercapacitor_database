In recent years, supercapacitors and alkaline Ni-Zn batteries have attracted increasing attention owing to the advantages of high energy density, excellent rate performance, low price, environmental protection and safety. In this study, a ZnCoNi-MOF precursor was prepared on nickel foam (NF) by the solvothermal method, and then a robust transition metal oxide ZnCo2O4-NiO nanosheet array material was formed by calcination. As a supercapacitor cathode material, the self-supported ZnCo2O4-NiO nanosheet array electrode exhibits a high mass-specific capacitance of 196.67 mA h g−1 (1573.66 F g−1) at a current density of 1 A g−1; even when the current density is increased by 20 times, the electrode still maintains 75.5% of the initial capacity. In addition, the electrode exhibits an excellent performance rate, and the retention rate can still maintain 69.6% of the initial capacity after 10 000 cycles, which indicates that the electrode material has excellent electrochemical performance and cycle stability. When a ZnCo2O4-NiO//Zn battery was assembled, the potential platform was impressively extended to 1.70 V. The ZnCo2O4-NiO//Zn battery delivers a high capacity of 191.67 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1. After 6000 cycles at a high current density of 8 A g−1, the capacity retention rate is 63.33%, which is promising for constructing an alkaline Ni-Zn battery with a long life span.
