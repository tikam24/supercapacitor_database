1,4- diaminoanthraquinone (DAQ) grafted graphene oxide (DGO) is prepared by the ring opening reaction of epoxy group on GO surface with -NH2 in DAQ. DAQ-GO/PPy composites (DGPs) have been prepared by a facile chemical oxidative polymerization method with different DGO weight loadings (3wt%, 5wt%, 9wt% and 15wt%). The introduction of redox active DGO thus endows DGPs with improved electrochemical per-formances. Among the DGPs, DGP5 provides the best electrochemical performances due to the delaminated DGO sheets as well as interconnect composite microstructure, which is desirable for superior charge storage. The specific capacitance of DGP5 can reach 389 F g-1, which is more than two times as much as that of pristine PPy. The high specific capacitance, enlarged window (as much as 1.4 V) as well as the good cycle stabil-ity, which are ascribed to the synergistic effect as well as the redox activity of DGO could be benefit for DGP5 as promising supercapacitor elec-trodes.
