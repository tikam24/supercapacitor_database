Aiming at stabilizing the DC bus voltage and optimizing the working process of the batteries, this paper presents a control strategy of hybrid energy storage systems in DC microgrid based on voltage droop method. The control strategy makes use of the ultracapacitor compensating the high-frequency components of bus power according to the DC bus voltage, indirectly compensates low-frequency components of bus power through the energy supplement of the batteries on the ultracapacitor, and takes advantage of the unable mutation characteristics of ultracapacitor voltage to achieve the smooth control of battery current. The control system can automatically switch work mode according to the conditions of DC bus voltage, ultracapacitor voltage and the state of charge (SOC) of battery. The experiments show that the control strategy can automatically adjust the output of batteries and ultracapacitor, maintain light fluctuation of DC bus voltage around rating, effectively reduce the frequency of battery charging and discharging and extend its using life.
