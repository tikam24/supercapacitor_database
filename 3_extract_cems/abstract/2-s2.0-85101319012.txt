The transition metal sulfide is a novel electrode material with superior performance in supercapacitor due to its great variety, low price, multiple oxidation states and high theoretical specific storage. It was first described in this article that the approaches of preparing transition metal sulfides, such as hydrothermal and electrochemical method. Furthermore, the pathways about enhancing the electrochemical property of transition metal sulfide in supercapacitors were introduced from two aspects. On the one hand, nanomaterials with porous structures and large surface area were controlled synthesized, which increased the efficiency of ion transmission through structural control. On the other hand, doping transition metal sulfide with other materials of energy storage including carbon materials, metal oxides, conductive polymers, synergetic effect of these materials could be presented completely. Finally, combined with the current research progress, it was proposed the developmental direction and challenges on the electrode materials of transition metal sulfide, which provided a guidance for their investigation in depth.
