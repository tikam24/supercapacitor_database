A Cobalt disulfide-reduced graphene oxide (CoS2-RGO) nanocomposite was prepared by a simple hydrothermal method and the prepared nanocomposite was characterized using various techniques like XRD, SEM and FTIR. The results of these techniques indicated the uniform deposition of CoS2 nanoparticles on Graphene sheets. Further, the prepared nanocomposites were tested for its activity towards energy storage and the test results showed a specific capacitance of 28F/g in an aqueous 20% KOH electrolyte at a current density of 0.5A/g. All these materials showed highly reversible charge-discharge cycles. The overall electrochemical performance of this composite is shown to be drastically improved when compared to bare CoS2 nanoparticles. Thus with the good electrochemical properties, CoS2-RGO nanocomposites could be effectively used as an electrode material for supercapacitors.
