A facile method was developed for the fabrication of electrochemically exfoliated graphite (EG) intercalated with polyaniline (PANI) via one-step interfacial polymerization at room temperature to produce a conductive EG-PANI composite. The grafting of PANI nanoparticles on the EG surface was confirmed by microscopy and analytical tests. The EG-PANI exhibited higher areal capacitance (C A ) and better electrochemical performance than either EG or PANI. A solid-state asymmetrical supercapacitor (SASc) device was fabricated to evaluate the energy-storage potential of EG-PANI using EG as negative electrode and EG-PANI as positive electrode. The SASc device exhibited high C A (80.4 ± 2.3 mF/cm 2 ) at current density of 1 mA/cm 2 and excellent capacitance retention (90.2%) after 1000 galvanostatic charge–discharge cycles at 5 mA/cm 2 . The specific power and energy density were as high as 4.14 mW/cm 2 at current density of 5 mA/cm 2 and 9.07 μWh/cm 2 at current density of 1 mA/cm 2 , respectively. After charging just for 10 s at 3.5 V, the output of two SASc devices connected in series illuminated different forward-voltage LEDs for over 5 min without diminished brightness. This work represents a new direction for developing EG intercalated PANI to enhance capacitive efficiency of graphite materials for fabrication of supercapacitors.
