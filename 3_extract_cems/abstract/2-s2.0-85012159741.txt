Our work presents a binder-free electrode with large area cobalt oxide composited on a carbon nanostructure in a three dimensional (3D) architecture. This unique 3D electrode successfully demonstrates extraordinary pseudocapacitor performance with ultrahigh specific capacitance at high current densities.
