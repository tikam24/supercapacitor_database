In the present study, copper oxide thin films are deposited using modified successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (modified SILAR) method on stainless steel (SS) substrates. These deposited CuO films are characterized by different characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD pattern reveals that CuO films exhibit polycrystalline phase with monoclinic structure which is highly feasible for supercapacitors. The surface morphology was studied by using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) which shows deposited CuO exhibits popcorn-like morphology. The surface wettability study shows prepared CuO is hydrophilic in nature. The electrochemical supercapacitive properties of CuO thin films are evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Which exhibits the maximum specific capacitance of 184 F/g at the scan rate of 50 mV/s also, it shows 83% capacitive retention after 5000 cycles. The values of specific energy and power are gained to be 14.1 and 3 kWk/g, respectively. In addition, impedance measurements of the CuO electrodes show that CuO is the promising material for supercapacitor application.
