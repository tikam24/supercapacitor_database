Polydopamine modified reduced graphene oxides (PDA-rGO) are synthesized by a facile dopamine polymerization reaction. As-prepared PDA-rGO shows a capable electrochemical performance as an electrode material for supercapacitors. A capacitance of 120 F g −1 is achieved at current density of 2 A g −1 . PDA-rGO also presents a superior cycling performance with capacitance retention of ∼99% after 10000 cycles. The remarkable electrochemical performance is attributed to the addition of PDA, which prevents the stacking of rGO and enhances the wettability of composite. Meanwhile, the rGO with high conductivity promise fast electronic transport.
