In this paper, a simple solvothermal method accompanied with a post annealing process was used to synthesize porous and hierarchical MgCo2O4 microflowers (MFs), which were composed of many tightly connected nanosheets. The entire synthesis process was accomplished without any surfactant or template participation. The specific surface area of MgCo2O4 MFs with mean pore size of 29.6 nm was as high as 71.58 m2 g−1. A typical three-electrode system was used to investigate the electrochemical properties of MgCo2O4 MFs-based electrode in 2 M of potassium hydroxide aqueous solution as electrolyte. The results demonstrated that such working electrode delivered a specific capacity of 313.3 C g−1 at 1 A g−1, and still remained 189.4 C g−1 even at the current density increasing to 16 A g−1. In addition, the capacity retention reached 74.5% after 5000 cycles at 5 A/g, suggesting its excellent long-term stability. MgCo2O4 MFs with highly specific surface area as well as mesoporous microstructures are significantly beneficial to rapid Faradic reaction, in that it ensures sufficient contact of electrolyte/electrode materials and shortens diffusion paths for ions/electrons, as well as maximizes the number of active sites. The synthesis procedure of MgCo2O4 MFs proposed in this work is simple and cheap, and is expected to be employed for the preparation of other binary metal cobaltite as well.
