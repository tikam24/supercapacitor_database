This paper deals with an energy management improvement based on frequency sharing approach for an electric vehicle. In order to satisfy the traction/propulsion system requirement, the Fuel cell (FC) system is assisted by lithium-ion batteries and Supercapacitors (SC). Bidirectional Buck Boost converters link the batteries and Supercapacitors to the DC-Bus. The FC stack is connected to the DC-Bus by an interleaved Boost DC-DC converter. The traction/propulsion motor is a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) coupled to a DC motor in order to emulate the vehicle's load and energy requirements during the driven cycle. The DC-Bus feeds the permanent magnet synchronous motor via a bidirectional DC-AC converter. The contribution of this study involves EV's energy effort sharing between Supercapacitors, Fuel cells and Lithium-ion batteries, taking into account the dynamic responses and electrical performances of each energy sources. The effectiveness of the control is verified through simulations performed on Matlab/Simulink software.
