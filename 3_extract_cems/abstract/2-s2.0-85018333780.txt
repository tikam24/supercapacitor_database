This work reports the synthesis of Ni(OH)2 aerogels incorporated in situ with polypyrrole (PPy) for application as electrodes in high-capacity energy storage devices. Ni(OH)2 gels were prepared by the sol–gel method from NiCl2 as precursor and propylene oxide as gelling agent in ethanol. Pyrrole monomer was added prior to gelling of the sol and in situ polymerized using ammonium persulfate as oxidant agent. After solvent exchanges from ethanol to acetone, the gels were dried in a CO2 supercritical point drier. Powdered aerogels were deposited onto both sides of a poly(vinyl alcohol)/H3PO4 film (electrolyte/separator) and the contacts were closed with copper foils, resulting in a complete device. Through cyclic voltammetry and charge/discharge curves, the performance of the supercapacitors was evaluated by the specific capacitance, power and energy densities and series resistance. The specific capacitance was increased by 43% with the incorporation of 0.2 mol/L PPy (276 F/g) and the series resistance obtained decreased by 79% (46.5 Ω/cm2), which reflects the enhanced performance and electrochemical properties of Ni(OH)2 aerogel- based devices incorporated with PPy.
