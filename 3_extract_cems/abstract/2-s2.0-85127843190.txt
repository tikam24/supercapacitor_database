The nature and concentration of electrolyte used play a vital role in the performance of supercapacitors. It is known that the performance of the active material will be optimum for a specific concentration of electrolyte. Herein, we report a study on the effect of electrolyte concentration on the electrochemical performance of Reduced Graphite Oxide – sodium sulfate supercapacitor. The supercapacitor achieves a maximum specific capacitance of 176 Fg−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 with energy and power density values of 47 W h kg−1 and 700 Wkg−1. The kinetics of charge storage reveals the combinations of the surface phenomenon and intercalation process lead to maximum specific capacitance.
