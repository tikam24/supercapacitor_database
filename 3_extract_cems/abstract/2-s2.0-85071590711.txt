While the textile based stretchable supercapacitors have been demonstrated as efficient charge storage devices, challenges in developing self powered wearable devices still exist. The present work describes a screen printed flexible and stretchable supercapacitor that can act as an energy buffering element for powering wearable fitness monitoring devices. The supercapacitor possesses interdigitated shaped intrinsically stretchable electrodes with free-standing serpentine interconnects. The symmetric supercapacitor relies on carbon nanotube and poly(aniline) as active materials and polyurethane as a stretch enduring binder. Such in-plane supercapacitors are realized by initially printing on a paper substrate, pre-coated with a water soluble layer, and then transferred onto a pre-strained elastomeric substrate. The supercapacitor showed excellent mechanical resiliency even though subjected to intense mechanical deformations. The electrode possessed highest areal capacitance of 167 mF/cm2 at a current density of 0.4 mA/cm2 and showed appreciable areal energy and power density of 14.9 Î¼Wh/cm2 and 0.29 mW/cm2, respectively. The supercapacitor showed conformal integration with the stretchable sweat band and which (3 devices, in series) can independently power a red light emitting diode. In combination with a flexible solar cell and a custom-made low power booster, the supercapacitor can continuously powers the wearable pulse rate sensor even in the presence of poor sunlight intensity.
