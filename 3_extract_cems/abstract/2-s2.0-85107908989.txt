The work reported here, demonstrates the synthesis of pristine WO3 and Manganese (Mn)-doped through the hydraulic acid-assisted precipitation method. Structural, morphological, compositional, optical and electrochemical properties of the synthesized samples were analysed. The structural analysis through X-ray diffraction studies confirmed the monoclinic phase of WO3 as well as the substitutional incorporation of Mn inWO3 lattice. A bandgap value of 2.9 eV was estimated from Optical analysis using Kubelka-Munk model. The defect centered luminescence as a consequences of Mn doping was analyzed using photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). FT Raman Spectroscopic data also reconfirmed the monoclinic structure of the sample and incorporation of Mn into the lattice of Mn-doped WO3. The surface morphological study was performed using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM), which exhibits the development of mesoporous networks. The Conductivity, dielectric and electrochemical studies were performed on these mesoporous structures to inveterate the impact of Mn doping. A dynamic increment in AC conductivity was observed with doping even at room temperature. Most significantly, we prove that Mn doped WO3 for the first time, Nanoparticles are an outstanding candidate for applications for supercapacitors. Pure and Mn doped WO3 electrochemical properties cyclic voltammetry measurements have been used to analyze samples. The results showed the excellent electrochemical efficiency on 1 wt% Mn doped WO3 electrode (1178 F/g specific capacitance at 2 mA/cm2 and charge transfer ability) for supercapacitors.
