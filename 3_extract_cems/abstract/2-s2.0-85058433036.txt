To improve the ineluctable agglomeration and weak inherent conductivity of MgAl2O4 electrode materials, MgAl2O4/rGO composite is synthesized by a facile method and it shows large specific surface area and enhanced conductivity. Its particular framework can availably hold back the aggregation of MgAl2O4 and restacking of rGO, and accelerate reversible redox reactions. The MgAl2O4/rGO composite shows a specific capacity of 536.6 F/g at 1 A/g (257.3 F/g at 40 A/g) and retains 96.9% after 10,000 cycles at 5 A/g. An asymmetric supercapacitor is developed with MgAl2O4/rGO composite and activated carbon. An energy density of 16.2 Wh/kg is obtained at a power density of 400 kW/kg. Additionally, this device has successfully lighted up a LED, demonstrating its promising application in energy storage.
