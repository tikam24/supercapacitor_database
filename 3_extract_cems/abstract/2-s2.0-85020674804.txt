Two-dimensional transition metal carbides (MXenes) have aroused considerable attention as promising electrode materials for supercapacitors owing to their superior electrochemical performance. In this study, we have synthesized a novel nitrogen-doped Ti3C2 (N-Ti3C2) nanosheets by a facile one-step hydrothermal reaction using low-cost industrial material urea as nitrogen source. The as-received N-Ti3C2 exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 156 F g-1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1 with high cycle stability in 6MKOH electrolyte. It indicates that the new kind of N-Ti3C2 can be deemed as an excellent electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.
