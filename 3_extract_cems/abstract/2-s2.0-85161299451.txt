Electrochemical energy technology demands highly proficient and stable systems which ultimately rely upon the discovery and development of promising electrode materials. Here, we report a two-dimensional conductive nickel- metal organic framework (Ni-MOF) for energy storage application. A novel Ni- based MOF was synthesized by utilizing a distinctive ligand 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP termed as Ni3(HHTP)2. The highly conductive, porous and stable two dimensional Ï€-conjugated structure of HHTP makes Ni3(HHTP)2 an auspicious contender for energy storage applications. We characterize the Ni3(HHTP)2 developed through hydrothermal route for its structural properties and then explore its energy storage profile by fabricating the hybrid energy storage device. The Ni3(HHTP)2 based asymmetric device exhibits the capacity of 194 C/g providing the energy (Es) and power density (Ps) of 43 Wh/kg and 2400 W/kg, respectively. We then scrutinize its capacitive and diffusive components by calculating regression parameters k1 and k2 using Dunn's model to bring further insight into the electrochemical characteristics of the electrode material. Ni3(HHTP)2 is an appealing member of 2D conductive MOFs to utilize for energy storage applications.
