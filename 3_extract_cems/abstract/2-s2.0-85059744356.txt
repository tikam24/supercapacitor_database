Fe-doped NiMnO 3 nanosheet electrode material was successfully synthesized by convenient and efficient microwave-assisted hydrothermal method. The crystal structure, chemical composition, morphology, and specific surface area of the electrode material were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and Brunner–Emmet–Teller testing. Results showed that Fe doping changed not only the crystal structure but also the morphology of the NiMnO 3 nanosheet electrode material. Moreover, the electrode material exhibited a high specific surface area and outstanding conductivity. Electrochemical performance was analyzed by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The outcome of these experiments demonstrated that the Fe-doped NiMnO 3 electrode material exhibited optimum electrochemical performance when the mass ratio was 15 wt%. The specific capacitance reached 732.7 F g −1 at a current density of 1 A g −1 , and capacitance retention was approximately 78.3% after 10,000 cycles at 3 A g −1 . The Fe-doped NiMnO 3 electrode material is thus a promising next-generation supercapacitor material because of its high specific capacitance and long cycle life.
