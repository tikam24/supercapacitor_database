A core-shell hybrid material of amorphous hydrous RuO2-coated carbon nanotubes (CNT-RuO2) with a RuO2 loading as high as 82.4wt% was prepared by a solution method using RuCl3 and NaHCO3 aqueous solutions. The effect of preparation conditions, especially the dripping speed of the NaHCO3 solution, on the formation of the core-shell structure was investigated, and the corresponding mechanism was discussed. Supercapacitive properties of the CNT-RuO2 and amorphous hydrous RuO2 electrodes with a thickness of over 200μm were studied and the crucial factors to govern their rate capability were analyzed. For the thick CNT-RuO2 electrode, a comparison of its specific capacitance before and after subtracting the effect of the voltage drop of discharge curves caused by the inner resistance of the CNT-RuO2 symmetrical supercapacitor indicates that electronic conductivity is more important than proton diffusion in determining its rate capability. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
