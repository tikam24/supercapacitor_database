To break though consumption bottlenecks of new energy caused by the fluctuation of the connected tie-line power of the hybrid AC/DC micro-grid, and to optimize of the interaction power between the AC subnet and DC subnet, we propose an capacity optimal configuration method of hybrid energy storage system. The protocol power of the tie-line and the total power of the hybrid energy storage system are determined by net-load power and time-of-use tariff. The total power of the hybrid energy storage system is analyzed by the ensemble empirical modal decomposition. According to the charge and discharge power command of the lithium battery and the super capacitor under different filter orders, the particle swarm optimization algorithm with adaptive inertia weight is used to solve the optimal configuration model of hybrid energy storage capacity by taking the rated power and rated capacity of the lithium battery and the super-capacitor as the optimal variables. By sorting the annual cost of system with different filter orders, the final filter order and the optimal configuration scheme of the hybrid energy storage system are determined. A case study based on a hybrid AC/DC micro-grid is used for verification and analysis. The results have verified that the hybrid energy storage system configured by the proposed method can effectively suppress the fluctuation of the connected tie-line power of the hybrid AC/DC micro-grid, reduce the commutation loss between the AC and DC subnets, and improve the economics of the hybrid AC/DC micro-grid.
