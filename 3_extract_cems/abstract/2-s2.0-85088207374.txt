Flexible electronic devices with strain sensing and energy storage functions integrated simultaneously are urgently desirable to detect human motions for potential wearable applications. This paper reports the fabrication of a cotton/carbon nanotube sheath-core yarn deposited with polypyrrole (PPy) for highly multifunctional stretchable wearable electronics. The microscopic structure and morphology of the prepared sheath-core yarn were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry. A mechanical experiment demonstrated its excellent stretchable capacity because of its unique spring-like structure. We demonstrate that the sheath-core yarn can be used as wearable strain sensors, exhibiting an ultrahigh strain sensing range (0-350%) and excellent stability. The sheath-core yarn can be used in highly sensitive real time monitoring toward both subtle and large human motions under different conditions. Furthermore, the electrochemical performance of the sheath-core yarn was characterized by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The measured areal capacitance was 761.2 mF/cm2 at the scanning rate of 1 mV/s. The method of spinning technology may lead to new exploitation of CNTs and PPy in future wearable electronic device applications.
