Zn-Al double layered hydroxide (Zn-Al-LDH) was synthesized by a facile coprecipitation method. The morphology and microstructure of samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning electron microscope (SEM), respectively. The results show that the sample is uniform nanosheet with the diameter of ∼400 nm and the thickness of ∼80 nm. XRD characterization confirms that it is Zn6A12(OH)16CO3.4H2O and belongs to Rhombohedral crystallographic system. Electrochemical performances of the sample were investigated by cyclic voltammery (CV) and charge/discharge. The Pure Zn-Al-LDH nanocomposites achieves a specific capacitance of 37.0 F g-1 at the current density of 1.0 A/g.
