The sodium ion pre-intercalation manganese dioxide (NaxMnO2) is supported on titanium nitride (TiN) substrate to form electroactive NaxMnO2/TiN electrode through an electrodeposition process in Mn(CH3COOH)2/Na2SO4 precursors with high Mn/Na ratio. MnO2 has a tiled leaf-like structure with a wrinkling morphology. NaxMnO2 has a cross-linking nanorod structure with a nanoporous morphology, which is beneficial for electrolyte ion diffusion. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation results indicate that NaxMnO2 reveals the enhanced density of states (DOS) and the lowered band gap than MnO2, which is consistent with higher cyclic voltammetry current response due to superior electroactivity of NaxMnO2. The Faradaic process involves Na+ adsorption/desorption on the surface of MnO2 by contributing to electrochemical capacitance and Na+ intercalation/deintercalation on the deep interlayer of pre-intercalation NaxMnO2 by contributing to pseudocapacitance. Concerning the electrolyte ion size effect, both MnO2/TiN and NaxMnO2/TiN electrodes have higher capacitive performance in Li2SO4 electrolyte than that in Na2SO4 and K2SO4 electrolyte due to more feasible Li+ diffusion. When MnO2 is converted into NaxMnO2, the capacitance at 2.5 mA cm-2 increases from 351.3 mF cm-2 to 405.6 mF cm-2 in Na2SO4 electrolyte and from 376.3 mF cm-2 to 465.1 mF cm-2 in Li2SO4 electrolyte. The conductive TiN substrate leads to high rate capacity retention ratio of 50.7% for MnO2/TiN and 49.5% for NaxMnO2/TiN when current density increases from 0.5 mA cm-2 to 5 mA cm-2. So, NaxMnO2/TiN with sodium ion pre-intercalation exhibits the improved capacitive performance in Li2SO4 electrolyte to act well as the promising supercapacitor electrode.
