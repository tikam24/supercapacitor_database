The control of an ultracapacitor (UC)-based dc-dc power supply is crucial to provide reliable energy backup to critical loads in the case of momentary power main failures. In this regard, smooth and seamless transition between charging and discharging controls of UC stack is of paramount importance. For ride-through applications where charging and discharging times are critical, provision of different control structures for charging and discharging subsystems is crucial. The conventional control techniques, though ensure seamless mode transition, does not allow different control structures for both the subsystems. This paper proposes an independent switch control strategy, which ensures seamless transition between charging and discharging control modes. The proposed control is based on pulse-width modulation blocking and is shown to ensure the fastest mode transition between control modes. The proposed control also elucidates an accurate method for identification of control modes, which is important to independent switch control. The advantages of the proposed control compared with conventional controls is presented in this paper. The proposed control strategy has been verified in simulations and experimentation, and the mode identification algorithm is found to work well.
