Progress in the chemical sciences has formed the world we live in, both on a macroscopic and on a nanoscopic scale. The last decade has witnessed the development of high performance materials that store charge in many ways: from solar cells to fuel cells, and from batteries to supercapacitor devices. One could argue that inorganic hybrid materials have played a central, starring role for the assembly of various electrochemical energy conversion systems. However, energy conversion systems fabricated from biopolymers has just emerged as a new prospect. Here, we summarize the main research results on the attractive use of biohydrogels for the fabrication of either conductive electrolytes or electrodes for battery science and technology.
