The study of the graphene oxide (GO)/tetra-(para-aminophenyl)porphyrin (H2T(p-NH2)PP)/Nylon 66 (Nylon) composite as an electrochemical supercapacitor was subjected to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charging-discharging measurement techniques, in a 1 M H2SO4 electrolytic solution. The results of the analysis showed an increase in the specific capacity of the system by modifying the percentage by weight of GO to 60%, 80% and 90%, making this effect more evident after performing an activation in NaOH, due to the increase in surface area of the electrode, as well as interactions with the center of the porphyrin macrocycle, reaching maximum specific capacitance values of 328 F/g. This system combines the formation of the electrochemical double layer and pseudocapacitor phenomena as energy storage mechanisms.
