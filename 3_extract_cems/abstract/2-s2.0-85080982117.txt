Lightweight and elastic carbon materials have attracted great interest in pressure sensing and energy storage for wearable devices and electronic skins. Wood is the most abundant renewable resource and offers green and sustainable raw materials for fabricating lightweight carbon materials. Herein, a facile and sustainable strategy is proposed to fabricate a wood-derived elastic carbon aerogel with tracheid-like texture from cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) and lignin. The flexible CNFs entangle and assemble into an interconnected framework, while lignin with high thermal stability and favorable stiffness prevents the framework from severe structural shrinkage during annealing. This strategy leads to an ordered tracheid-like structure and significantly reduces the thermal deformation of the CNFs network, producing a lightweight and elastic carbon aerogel. The wood-derived carbon aerogel exhibits excellent mechanical performance, including high compressibility (up to 95% strain) and fatigue resistance. It also reveals high sensitivity at a wide working pressure range of 0â€“16.89 kPa and can detect human biosignals accurately. Moreover, the carbon aerogel can be assembled into a flexible and free-standing all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor that reveals satisfactory electrochemical performance and mechanical flexibility. These features make the wood-derived carbon aerogel highly attractive for pressure sensor and flexible electrode applications.
