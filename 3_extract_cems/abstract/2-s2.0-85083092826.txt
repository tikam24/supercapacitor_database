Microgrids are the perfect solution for sustained increase in incorporation of grid connected renewable and non-conventional energy sources. The ever increasing energy demand and depletion of fossil fuels have lead to increased research in this area. When renewable energy is integrated to the power system its intermittent and varying nature imposes challenges which can be overcome by including energy storage systems with it. This combination of non-conventional energy sources, energy storage system, loads etc., in power generation system is known as microgrid. This paper presents a review of fundamental knowledge of energy storage devices that can be used with renewable energy to overcome the reliability, stability and power quality issues associated with it. A consolidated statement of applications of each type of storage device is tabulated from literature survey. A comprehensive study is done on the working and constituents of different energy storage systems.
