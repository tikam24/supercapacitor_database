Tannins are complex phenolic substances that can be extracted from many kinds of plants, especially from dicotyledonous ones (Constabel et al., 2014), and distributed in different parts of the plant structure, depending on the species: roots, trunk, barks, seeds, fruits, and leaves at diverse concentrations (Feng et al., 2013). Because of their bioactivity, tannins are essential products for plants to combat pathogens and herbivores. Moreover, tannins are bitter, and most herbivorous predators are disinclined to consume them (Constabel et al., 2014). Tannins bind to and precipitate proteins and various other organic compounds including amino acids and alkaloids, and they have been traditionally used in the tanning of animal skins.
