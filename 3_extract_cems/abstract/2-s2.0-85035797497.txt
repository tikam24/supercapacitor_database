In this paper, we present a strategy to prepare the sulfur and nitrogen co-doped porous graphene electrode, in which, three main procedures—the pore-formation in the natural graphite, the preparation of sulfur doped porous graphite intercalation compounds (S-PGIC) and the construction of the sulfur/nitrogen co-doped porous reduced graphite oxide (SN-PRGO) are included. The as-prepared SN-PRGO sample can behave relatively high specific surface area (SSA) and simultaneously provide through-plane and in-plane diffusion paths for electrolyte ions, thus exhibiting an outstanding capacitive performance. Its specific capacitance at the scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte can reach up to 438 F g−1, which is, to the best of our knowledge, among the highest values so far reported for heteroatoms doped carbon materials. Besides, SN-PRGO also exhibits an excellent cycling stability with almost 94% of its initial capacitance being retained after the long-term consecutive cycling. This work suggests that constructing the doped graphene-based materials by generating the pores in the graphite sheets and using the intercalated substances among the graphite layers as the dopant sources can be considered as a promising strategy for the development of high performance electrodes in supercapacitors.
