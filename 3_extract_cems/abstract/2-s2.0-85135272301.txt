Supercapacitors appear to be attractive options for energy storage due to their high power density and lengthy cycling life. This work is focused on the design of reduced graphene oxide/hexagonal boron nitride (rGO/h-BN), via a hydrothermal method, as electrode materials for supercapacitor applications. Interestingly, the composite with rGO/h-BN 50:50 showed good capacity when compared to other ratios. Similarly, asymmetric supercapacitor devices were made up of rGO/h-BN and rGO as positive and negative electrodes, respectively, and nickel foam and stainless steel were used as a substrate. The nickel foam as substrate exhibits a high capacitance retention of 90% after 1000 cycles in a coin-cell configuration compared to stainless-steel substrate (71% after 500 cycles). Interestingly, a significant enhancement in the capacitance of Co3O4 was observed when incorporated with rGO/h-BN composite. The asymmetric supercapacitor made up of rGO/h-BN/Co3O4 delivered a good capacitance retention of 78% at 150 mA/g, after 5,000 cycles. As a result, h-BN/rGO-based composites with superlattice were synthesized using a hydrothermal approach as prospective materials for next-generation supercapacitor applications.
