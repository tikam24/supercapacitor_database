Supercapacitors are deemed as reliable power sources for portable devices and electric vehicles. Electrode materials with high energy and power densities are greatly needed. Herein, we designed reduced-graphene-oxide supported nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxide nanosheets (NiCo-LDH/rGO) as electrode materials. The introduction of graphene could largely enhance the conductivity, and the supported NiCo-LDH could effectively prevent graphene from self-aggregation. Thanks to the synergistic effect of conductive graphene and electro-active LDH, the nanocomposites delivered a capacitance of 1675 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and decent rate performance (capacitance retention of 83.8% at 10 A g−1); while NiCo-LDH could only exhibited a capacitance of 920 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 81.5% of the capacitance remained at 10 A g−1. The asymmetric supercapacitors assembled with NiCo-LDH/rGO and activated carbon (AC) delivered high energy density and power density, up to 49.9 Wh kg−1 and 3747.9 W kg−1, respectively. The appealing electrochemical performance indicates its huge application potential in supercapacitors.
