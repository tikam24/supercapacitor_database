A laboratory prototype of 800 V/30 A active superconducting current controller (SCC) is developed. The SCC is composed of an air-core superconducting transformer and a compensation voltage source. Based on the principle of series voltage compensation, the SCC can limit the fault currents effectively during fault conditions. Besides, it can actively control the power flow of the transmission lines within a certain extent. Due to the characteristic of higher energy density and high power density, the supercapacitor module is adopted to compensate the dynamic power during controlling the system current. To evaluate the dynamic characteristic of the SCC, a series of experiments are carried out in the laboratory. This paper presents parts of the important test results, including the capability of voltage regulation of the compensation voltage source, and the characteristic of system current control in a simulated power system.
