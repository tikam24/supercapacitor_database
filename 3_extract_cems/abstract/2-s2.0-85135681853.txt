Flexible supercapacitors are gaining considerable attention because of their wide range of applications in the area of flexible electronics. Significant opportunities exist and will continue to exist for the development of flexible energy storage devices through intensive research. The level of R&D activity in the general field of energy storage technology has been rising considerably all over the world during the last two decades, because of the growing recognition of the commercial potentialities of energy storage technology. This chapter focuses on the different types of conducting polymer-based supercapacitors, incorporating polymers such as polyaniline, polypyrrole, polythiophene, and the derivatives of polythiophene. Emphasis is given to the methods of fabricating flexible supercapacitor devices. The different electrolytes employed for the development of flexible supercapacitors are discussed. In the beginning, a brief account of the principles and classification of supercapacitors is described. The chapter concludes with a consideration of the prospects for flexible supercapacitor. To compile this chapter and to provide adequate information to the readers, we have explored all the possible materials available in the literature.
