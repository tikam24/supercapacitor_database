Conjugated microporous polymers with active functional groups have attracted more and more attentions in energy conversion systems. However, their low electrical conductivity results in low capacitance, thus limiting their practical application. Herein, conjugated microporous polymer with triphenylamine aldehyde linked to metal phthalocyanines (MNC) is synthesized and then compounded with high-conductivity carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (denoted as CoNCCs) by vacuum filtration. Moreover, CoNCCs exhibit flexibility, which could be served as a self-standing and binder-free flexible electrode of supercapacitors. As a result, the optimized CoNCCs as the flexible electrode show high specific capacitance of 213.4 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. In addition, the higher capacity retention rate 85.3% can be retained after 1750 cycles at 20 A g−1. The good electrochemical properties can be attributed to the synergistic effect and strong dual-phase interaction between MNC and CNTs. This work opens the way to develop high-performance and low environmental footprint organic electrode materials for SCs.
