Flexible energy storage devices are in great demand since the advent of flexible electronics. Until now, flexible supercapacitors based on graphene analogues usually have had low operating potential windows. To this end, two dissimilar electrode materials with complementary potential ranges are employed to obtain an optimum cell voltage of 1.8 V. A low-temperature organic sol-gel method is used to prepare two different types of functionalized reduced graphene oxide aerogels (rGOA) where Ag nanorod functionalized rGOA acts as a negative electrode while polyaniline nanotube functionalized rGOA acts as a positive electrode. Both materials comprehensively exploit their unique properties to produce a device that has high energy and power densities. An assembled all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor gives a high energy density of 52.85 W h kg-1 and power density of 31.5 kW kg-1 with excellent cycling and temperature stability. The device also performs extraordinarily well under different bending conditions, suggesting its potential to meet the requirements for flexible electronics.
