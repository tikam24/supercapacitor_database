Modern society's biggest challenges are affordable, clean energy production and storage. Thus, recent research aims at the discovery of novel electrode materials for enhanced energy production and storage. Herein, nitrogen-implanted carbon particles were synthesized for the first time from the Acorus Calamus for the symmetric supercapacitor application. The KOH-activated carbon particles at 750 °C (C-750) under a nitrogen atmosphere revealed the better structural, textural, morphological, and electrochemical performance. The BET analysis confirmed that the C-750 carbon nanoparticles tremendously enhanced the surface area of about 3551.07 m2/g. Further, the pore size and pore volume were obtained from BJH analysis that showed 3.70 nm and 0.51 cc/g, respectively. The high surface area along with the mesoporous nature of the C-750 sample effectively enhanced the specific capacitance to 354.44 Fg−1 at 1 Ag−1 using a 6 M KOH electrolytic solution. Further, the enhancement of energy and power density of the C-750 was observed at about 47.2 Whkg−1 and 16,000 Wkg−1, respectively.
