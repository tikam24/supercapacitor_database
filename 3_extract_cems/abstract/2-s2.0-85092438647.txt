Supercapacitors were constructed with graphene as electrodes and ionic liquid N-methyl-N- propylpyrrolidinium cyanate ([C3mpyr][OCN])/propylene carbonate (PC) as the mixed electrolytes. The electrochemical properties of constructed supercapacitors were tested at 50, 60 and 70℃ by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD). The results indicated that the constructed supercapacitors exhibited good electrochemical properties at high operating temperatures. The supercapacitors gave the specific capacity of 295 F·g-1 and delivered an energy density as high as 118 W·h·kg-1 at 70℃ with the current density of 0.5 A·g-1. Additionally, the constructed supercapacitors showed a good cycling stability.
