2D carbon nanomaterials such as graphene, carbon nanosheets, and their derivatives, representing the emerging class of advanced multifunctional materials, have gained great research interest because of their extensive applications ranging from electrochemistry to catalysis. However, sustainable and scalable synthesis of 2D carbon nanosheets (CNs) with hierarchical architecture and irregular structure via a green and low-cost strategy remains a great challenge. Herein, prehydrolysis liquor (PHL), an industrial byproduct of the pulping industry, is first employed to synthesize CNs via a simple hydrothermal carbonization technique. After mild activation with NH4Cl and FeCl3, the as-prepared activated CNs (A-CN@NFe) display an ultrathin structure (≈3 nm) and a desirable specific surface area (1021 m2 g−1) with hierarchical porous structure, which enables it to be both electroactive materials and structural support materials in nanofibrillated cellulose/A-CN@NFe/polypyrrole (NCP) nanocomposite, and thus endowing nanocomposite with impressive capacitance properties of 2546.3 mF cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2. Furthermore, the resultant all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor delivers a satisfactory energy storage ability of 90.1 µWh cm−2 at 250.0 µW cm−2. Thus, this work not only opens a new window for sustainable and scalable synthesis of CNs, but also offers a double profits strategy for energy storage and biorefinery industry.
