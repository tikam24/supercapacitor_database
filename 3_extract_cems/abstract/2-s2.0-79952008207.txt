An activated carbon was prepared from a polyaniline base using K 2CO 3 as an activating agent. The morphology, surface chemical composition, and surface area of the as-prepared carbon materials were investigated by scanning electron microscope, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller measurement, respectively. Electrochemical properties of the as-prepared sample were studied by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements in 6 mol L -1 KOH aqueous solution. Compared with the non-activated carbon, activated carbon showed superior capacitive performance. The activation carbon presented a high specific gravimetric capacitance of 210 F g -1. The good electrochemical performance of the activated carbon was ascribed to well-developed micropores, high surface area, the presence of nitrogen and oxygen functional groups, and larger pore volume.
