In this study, we examined the porous activated carbon prepared from Couroupita guianansis (CG) flower as an electrode material for supercapacitor applications. The texture characteristics of the material were performed by BET analysis. The structural properties were observed by XRD and XPS, respectively. The morphology of the sample was characterized by FESEM and TEM. Further, the surface functional groups as well as the degree of graphitization of the samples were analyzed by FTIR and Raman spectral studies. The electrochemical studies were performed in an electrochemical workstation with 1 M aqueous KOH. The prepared CG derived activated carbon electrode (CG-800) showed an excellent specific capacitance value (711 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 ). It also displayed excellent cycle performance, because the specific capacitance was noted to be 92%, even after 5000 charge and discharge cycles. Thus the highly porous CG-800 AC electrode was proved to a promising candidate for high-performance supercapacitors.
