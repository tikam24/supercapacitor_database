The Li4Ti5-xZrxO12 (x = 0, 0.15, 0.3, 0.45 and 0.6) anodes were prepared using a simple solid-state method. We investigated the electrochemical performance of hybrid supercapacitor using Zr4+ doped Li4Ti5O12 anode and activated carbon cathode. When Zr entered Li4Ti5O12, the higher lattice parameters and conductivities of Li4Ti5-xZrxO12 (x = 0.15, 0.3, and 0.45) obviously improved the electrochemical performance of hybrid supercapacitor. Among them, the Li4Ti4.55Zr0.45O12 anode has a superior specific capacitance of 69 Fg−1 at 0.5 Ag−1 rates. Also, the power and energy densities were 212.3W kg−1 and 65.2Wh kg−1, respectively.
