An electrochemical discharge machining process to produce zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs) under varying voltage and duty factors has been investigated. The morphological and optical characterizations of the generated ZnO NPs were carried out. It was observed that the production rate of NPs and their size increased with an increase in voltage. The ZnO NPs produced at 120 V showed the maximum production rate larger NPs. The field-effect scanning electron microscope images of the NPs revealed a nanorod-like structure, large conical shape rods and hexagonal wurtzite-like structures. The ZnO NPs generated at 120 V and 20% duty factor presented less agglomeration of NPs compared to other NPs generated by varying electrical parameters. The crystal size of the ZnO NPs were found to vary from 31.08 nm to 50.37 nm. The ZnO NPs were also tested for use in a supercapacitor electrode, and the results showed that the specific capacitance of the electrode was 708.75 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g and a retained capacity of 90.42%.
