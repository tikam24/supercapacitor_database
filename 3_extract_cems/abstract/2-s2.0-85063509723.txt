Herein, we proposed a desirable strategy for the synthesis of graphene-wrapped NiCo 2 Se 4 microspheres (positive electrode) and petal-like iron disulfide (FeS 2 ) (negative electrode) on nickel foam substrates. The positive electrode represents a substantial specific capacitance of 2112.30 F g -1 and excellent durability (6.8% loss after 5000 cycles). Furthermore, the negative electrode reflects good electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 321.30 F g -1 and a satisfactory rate capability of 47% capacitance retention. Considering the notable properties of the electrodes, a flexible asymmetric all-solid-state device based on graphene-wrapped NiCo 2 Se 4 microspheres (positive electrode) and petal-like iron disulfide (negative electrode) was assembled. Our flexible device exhibits the high specific capacitance of 221.30 F g -1 , the significant energy density of 78.68 W h kg -1 and excellent flexibility.
