One of the most effective tactics to promote the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors is to design and synthesize hybrid binder-free electrodes with core-shell structures. In this work, hierarchical ZnCo2O4@ZnWO4 core-shell nanowire arrays grown on nickel foam are successfully fabricated via a facile two-step hydrothermal route and subsequent thermal treatment. The ZnCo2O4 nanowire arrays supported on nickel foam serve as the backbone for anchoring ZnWO4 nanosheets. When tested as binder-free electrodes for supercapacitors, the as-prepared ZnCo2O4@ZnWO4 hybrid electrode exhibits an ultrahigh specific areal capacitance of 13.4 F cm−2 at a current density of 4 mA cm−2 and superb cycling stability (98.5% retention after 5000 continuous cycles at a current density of 100 mA cm−2). Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor based on ZnCo2O4@ZnWO4//active carbon is successfully designed. The as-designed asymmetric supercapacitor can achieve a maximum energy density of 24 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 400 W kg−1. Moreover, two as-prepared asymmetric supercapacitor devices in a series connection are able to light up a white light-emitting diode over 30 min. The outstanding electrochemical properties of the hybrid electrode demonstrate that it holds great potential for next generation energy storage applications.
