α-MnO2 has been prepared by mechanochemical method, starting from equivalent KMnO4 and Mn(CH3COO)2. The electrochemical performance of MnO2 electrode was investigated by cyclic voltammograms, A.C. impedance, etc. The charge-discharge process of MnO2 supercapacitor in 6mol/L KOH was studied within 1.2V, at 200mA/g. The results suggest that the supercapacitor displays double layer capability at low potential, while pseudocapacitance properties at high potential; the electrochemical inert Mn3O4 formed mainly during the initial 40 charging and discharging processes. In the charge-discharge cycling, the pseudocapacitance properties disappeared gradually; the discharge curves were close to be linear, which indicating the characteristic of double-layer capability; the maximum capacitance of MnO 2 electrode was as high as 416F/g, retained 240F/g after 200 cycles; the equivalent series resistance (ESR) increased from 17Ω to 41Ω.
