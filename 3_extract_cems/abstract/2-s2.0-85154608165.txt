In this study, heterostructured dual Z-scheme Sm2O3-WO3-La2O3 nanocomposite (NC) and bare Sm2O3, WO3, and La2O3 nanostructured (NSs) were prepared using a co-precipitation approach. The comparative electrochemical, photocatalytic, and antimicrobial properties of NC and NSs were studied. The XRD spectrum exhibits the formation of bare NSs and NC having cubic-Sm2O3, monoclinic-WO3, and hexagonal-La2O3 phases. FESEM results showed mesoporous morphology of NC. The higher electrical conductivity 261.33 mho-cm−1 and lower optical energy bandgap 2.55 eV were obtained for NC. The photodegradation tests exhibited that NC photocatalyst has degraded 99% (methylene blue), 96% (Methyl orange), 99% (safranin-O), 48% (p-nitroaniline), and 98% (methyl red) dyes pollutants in 40 min sunlight radiation and showed strong inhibition activity against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, P. Vulgaris, and P. aeruginosa bacterial strains with zones of inhibition (ZOI) 31 mm, 30 mm, 30 mm, 28 mm, and 31 mm, respectively. Electrochemical studies revealed the excellent capacitive characteristics of NC with a specific capacitance 532F/g at a scan rate 5 mV/s, energy density 48.0278 W h Kg−1, and power density 0.3782 KW Kg−1 at 0.006 A/cm2 current density. Furthermore, the present study revealed a novel composition for environmental remediation and energy storage applications.
