For the use of supercapacitors in electric vehicles it is very important to accurately model the supercapacitor for calculating the energy requirement. A supercapacitor model that takes into account the effect of change in the current rates on the capacitance- voltage relation is developed. The model was developed using Matlab/Simulink. Different charging and discharging tests are performed on the supercapacitor to extract the model parameters. All the tests are done at the same (room) temperature. The model predicts the behaviour of the supercapacitor at different current rates. Analysis of data shows that during rest period the supercapacitor behaves as battery. It was found that not only the main capacitance has the self-discharge tendency but the branch capacitance too has self-discharge tendency. Detailed dynamic as well as static behaviour of the supercapacitor are studied in this paper to extract the one branch (R-C) model instead of two branch model with little modification. The model was verified experimentally.
