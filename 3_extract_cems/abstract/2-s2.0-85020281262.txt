MnOxS2−x nanofiber arrays is successfully prepared by one-step electrochemical deposition at 343 K on Ti substrates. The as-prepared MnOxS2−x fibers are amorphous structure, which is confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) results, and the stoichiometry is checked by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The highest specific capacitance (Cs) of 278.22 F/g is obtained by cyclic voltammogram (CV) in a scan rate of 1 mV/s, and 214.78 F/g by galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) technique at 1 mA/cm2 current rate, which is higher than that of pure MnO2.
