The improvement in the electrochemical performance of flexible electrodes for supercapacitors depends on adequate doping level of pseudocapacitive prototypes incorporated into truly flexible devices. The interaction of graphene nanoplatelets, carbon dots and polypyrrole on flexible supports of eggshell membranes offers an adequate combination in which redox reactions and fast charge separation contribute to the reversible storage of energy. The mutual incorporation of carbon dots and graphene nanoplatelets in overall structure of PPy-based electrodes returned a capacitive retention of 96.3% (after 2000 cycles of use) and areal capacitance of 173.81 mF cmâˆ’2. Superior mechanical resistance and good performance at different bending conditions are additional advantages related to the chemical modification of eggshell membranes as supports for electrodes of supercapacitors.
