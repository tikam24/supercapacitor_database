To assemble compact energy storage device, it is necessary to prepare electrode material with balanced mass and volume specific capacitance. Herein, the selected precursors calcium gluconate (CG) and chitosan (CS) are first co-pyrolysed and then activated with KOH to tailor micro/mesopore ratio and bulk density of the resultant biochars. When the mass ratio of CG to CS is fixed at 1:2, the biochar CG1CS2-K activated at 700 °C shows a specific surface area of 1449.0 m2·g−1, a heteroatom content (N 3.3 at.%, O 14.1 at.%), and high electroactive specific surface area (35 %). In the three-electrode system with the electrolyte 1.0 M H2SO4 at the current density of 0.5 A·g−1, it shows balanced mass specific capacitance (386.3 F·g−1) and volume specific capacitance (320.6 F·cm−3), respectively. Moreover, its energy density can be as high as 16.23 Wh·kg−1/13.47 Wh·L−1 at the power density of 152.16 W·kg−1/126.29 W·L−1, which facilitates to assemble compact energy storage device. Interestingly, a high energy density of 9.90 Wh·kg−1/8.22 Wh·L−1 is also achieved at power density of 150.06 W kg−1/124.55 W L−1 in the system with the electrolyte KOH. After 10,000 cycles of charging and discharging, the capacitance retention rate is still above 88 %. In addition, two pieces of button-type supercapacitors in series can power 13 red LED lights for about 2.0 min, indicating a good potential of practical application.
