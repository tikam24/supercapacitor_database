As a new developed energy storage device, lithium ion hybrid capacitors (LIHCs) satisfy the prospective applications requiring relatively high energy and power densities simultaneously. Here, we employ the ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid tetrasodium salt as a single precursor through a facile calcination method to prepare interconnected N-doped carbon network (INC). As the anode material, INC exhibits high reversible capacity and good electrochemical kinetic property for lithium ion storage. For the homologous strategy consideration, superhigh specific surface area activated carbon (AC) with high capacitance has been derived from activation of the INC. Hereafter, the dual-carbon based LIHCs have been assembled by using INC as battery-type anode and AC as capacitor-type cathode. The obtained LIHCs display high energy density (172 Wh kg−1 @ 260 W kg−1) and high power density (26 kW kg−1 @ 108 Wh kg−1). This work explores a new way to prepare the lithium storage carbon materials and construct high performance dual-carbon LIHCs.
