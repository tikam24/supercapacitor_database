Electrochemical behavior of electrodes on the basis of CH900-20 activated carbon (AC) cloth has been studied in concentrated sulfuric acid solution. Cyclic voltammetric curves have been studied in the reversibility range (from 0.1 to 0.9 V RHE) and in the deep cathodic charging potential range (from -0.8 to 1 V RHE). It has been shown that electric double layer (EDL) charging occurs in the reversibility range, while faradaic processes of hydrogen intercalation into AC carbon take place in the range of negative potentials (←0.1 V). The intercalation process is governed by slow solid-phase hydrogen diffusion. The specific charge value grows at an increase in concentrated sulfuric acid solution. The mechanism of double intercalation of sulfuric acid and hydrogen into the AC material is suggested. On the basis of the reached specific discharge capacitance of 1,560 C/g (or 1,110 F/g) and Faraday's law, it has been concluded that the compound of C6H is formed in the limiting case of deepest cathodic charging. The obtained data have been used in a mathematical charge-discharge model for an AC electrode taking into account the EDL charging and the hydrogen intercalation. The galvanostatic recharge curves have been calculated in the diapason of currents by the developed model. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
