Sodium lanthanum cyclometaphosphate (Na2La2P4O12) material was synthesized using the flux method as high performance electrochemical supercapacitors. Rietveld refinement of x-ray pattern confirms that the Na2La2P4O12 material crystallizes in triclinic crystal structure with P-1 space group. The refined unit cell parameters of triclinic structure are a = 6.28124 Å, b = 6.59774 Å, c = 9.66396 Å, α = 93.2354°, β = 103.4630° and γ = 106.7750°. Na2La2P4O12 material reveals excellent electrochemical performance with high specific capacitance of ~400 F/g using 1 M NaClO4 electrolyte.
