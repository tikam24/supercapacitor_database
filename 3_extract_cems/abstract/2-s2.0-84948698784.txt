Chemical analysis was carried out before and after the constant voltage hold test that was an acceleration deterioration examination to clarify deterioration factors of electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC). The results showed that the stress testslightly caused the increase of internal resistance. It was also confirmed that the range of fluorochemicals was formed on the electrode surface for approximately 10 nm in depth using electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA). From the chemicalanalysis of the electrolyte using an inductively coupling plasma emission analyzer (ICP-OES), it was confirmed that the electrolyte included silicone which is one of the ingredient elements of an electrode and that the increase in holding voltage in the stress testdecreased the silicone density in the electrolyte.
