Materials need to be engineered to make them device-ready. A mescoporous, a combination of meso- and microporous, nickel titanate-titanium oxide (m-NTTO) complex has been synthesized here using a simple sol-gel method for making a solid-state binder-free supercapacitor from the as-prepared powder. The m-NTTO sample, well characterized using electron microscopy, N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy was tested for its energy storage capabilities. The supercapacitive performance of m-NTTO is investigated through cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD). It shows a dominant electric double-layer capacitance with a total specific capacitance of 195 F/g at 10 mV/s and fast charging and slow discharging. Additionally, it exhibits high specific capacitance, excellent cyclic stability, and high retention. Using this sample, a prototype solid-state symmetric supercapacitor device has been fabricated to demonstrate excellent electrochemical performance with high specific capacitance, energy density, and power density was obtained, which suggests that the m-NTTO is suitable candidate material for energy storage application.
