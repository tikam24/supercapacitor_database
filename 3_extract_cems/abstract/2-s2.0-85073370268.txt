This paper proposes a new bidirectional DC/DC converter for supercapacitor applications. The proposed converter has a parallel structure in supercapacitor side (where voltage is low and current is high) and a series structure in the other side. This structure increases efficiency of the converter. For current sharing in the parallel side of the proposed converter, two different methods are recommended and compared in this paper: Current balancing transformer (CBT) and two separate inductors (TSI). Simulation and experimental results show performance of the proposed converter.
