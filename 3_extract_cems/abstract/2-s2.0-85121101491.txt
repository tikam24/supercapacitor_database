ZnS-Co3S4 Nanoscrubbers were prepared by hydrothermal routes and characterized by advanced techniques. The supercapacitance behavior of crystalline ZnS-Co3S4 nanoscrubber modified electrodes was examined using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) techniques. As-prepared ZnS-Co3S4 nanoscrubbers have a high specific capacitance (Csp) value of 593 F/g at 0.5 A/g. The ZnS-Co3S4 modified electrode was found to be highly stable for 2000 cycles at 0.5A/g.
