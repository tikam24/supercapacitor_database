Grid power interruptions are dominated by short term events, right in the wheelhouse of ultracapacitors Ultracapacitor technology is justifiable as a grid storage technology consideration now and in the future; economics, lifecycle and performance Renewable firming is a primary application for energy storage; ultracapacitors fit the need perfectly Ultracapacitors should be regarded as seriously as Li Ion Batteries and Flywheels in grid energy storage solutions Maxwell is leading in the demonstration of ultracapacitor energy storage on the grid The grid will be big for ultracapacitors, make sure you pay attention!.
