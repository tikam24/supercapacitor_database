Molybdenum dioxide nanoparticles of diameter 100 nm were anchored uniformly to a three-dimensional (3D) graphene foam using an ultrasonication-assisted deposition method. X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy indicated that the molybdenum dioxide nanoparticles had a monoclinic crystal structure. The 3D graphene/MoO2 nanoparticle composite showed excellent pseudocapacitive ability as its specific capacitance reached 404 F g−1 at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 in the negative potential range, −1.0 to −0.2 V, in a neutral solution. Overall, the 3D graphene/MoO2 nanoparticle composite has great potential as an anode material for the next generation of high-performance supercapacitors. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
