In order to design a well-performing hybrid storage system for trams, optimization of energy management strategy (EMS) and sizing is crucial. This paper establishes a mathematical model of battery and supercapacitor, compares the topology used in trams. Using adaptive particle swarm optimization(PSO) to optimize the size of battery and supercapacitor. Simulation calculation based on the operating data of traction calculation curve and analyzes the impact of choosing different EMS and different topologies on the size results.
