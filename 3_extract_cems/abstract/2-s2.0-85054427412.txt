All-solid-state flexible supercapacitors have shown great potential in wearable and portable electronics. In this work, a flexible asymmetric pseudocapacitor (FAPC) is fabricated by using MnO 2 nanosheets-carbon fabric as cathode and Fe 2 O 3 nanowire-carbon fabric as anode in the presence of PVA-LiCl as gel electrolyte. With high area capacitances of MnO 2 and Fe 2 O 3 based electrodes by optimizing the reaction conditions, the device shows high working potential of 1.8 V, high area capacitance of 83.3 mF/cm 2 (119 F/g), stable cycling performance with 82.3% of capacitance retention after 5000 cycles, and a competitive energy density of 53.55 Wh/kg in the broader context of MnO 2 -based supercapacitors. In addition, the FAPC demonstrates excellent mechanical stability and flexibility with negligible degradation of electrochemical performance after numerous bending tests, establishing it as a promising candidate for portable and wearable energy storage.
