NiCo2O4 nanoneedles were grown on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) by a hydrothermal method. Physical characterization and electrochemical tests were performed on the composites. The NiCo2O4/rGO composites possessed a high capacitance of 1757 F g−1 (1 A g−1). The composites possessed 97.3% of initial capacity after 2500 cycles (10 A g−1). Furthermore, the prepared NiCo2O4/rGO//AC asymmetric supercapacitor obtained a well energy density of 32.38 W h kg−1. After 10000 cycles at 5 A g−1, 90.4% of the capacity was retained. Therefore, the NiCo2O4/rGO nanocomposites appear to be excellent candidates for high performance supercapacitors.
