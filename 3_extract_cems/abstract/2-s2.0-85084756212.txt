This study reports a facile and green preparation of heteroatom-doped porous carbon nanosheets derived from deep eutectic solvents (DES). N-doped or N, S-co-doped carbon porous nanosheets are produced by varying the composition of glucose-based DES followed by a simple KOH activation, which show highly improved capacitances. Besides, micro-supercapacitors based on N-doped carbon nanosheets exhibit a specific capacitance of 23.2 mF cm12 at 0.2 mA cm12, which is among the best compared to the results reported in the literature.
