In this paper, we report an electrode architecture of molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 )/nickel sulfide (Ni 3 S 4 ) composite nanosheets anchored on interconnected carbon (C) shells (C@MoS 2 /Ni 3 S 4 ). Electrochemical measurements indicate that the C@MoS 2 /Ni 3 S 4 structure possesses excellent supercapacitive properties especially for long term cycling at high current densities. A specific capacitance as high as ∼640.7 F g −1 can still be delivered even after 10,000 cycles at a high current density of 20 A g −1 . From comparison of microstructures and electrochemical properties of the related materials/structures, the improved performance of C@MoS 2 /Ni 3 S 4 can be attributed to the relatively dispersedly distributed nanosheet-shaped MoS 2 /Ni 3 S 4 that provides efficient contact with electrolyte and effectively buffers the volume change during charge/discharge processes, enhanced cycling stability by MoS 2 , and reduced equivalent series resistance by the interconnected C shells.
