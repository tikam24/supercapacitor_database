A hierarchical FeS/RGO/FeS composite in situ grown on Fe foil was designed and prepared via an Fe foil-involved one-step hydrothermal route, in which Fe foil acted as the Fe source for the lower FeS layer, reductant of GO and subsequent current collector. The as-prepared FeS/RGO/FeS@Fe showed a high specific capacity of 247.5 C g-1 (206.25 F g-1) and good cyclability with 118% capacity retention after 5000 cycles when directly used as an electrode. Additionally, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was assembled using Ni(OH)2 and FeS/RGO/FeS@Fe as the positive electrode and negative electrode, respectively. This ASC exhibited maximum power density and energy density of 20:000 W kg-1 and 34.07 W h kg-1, respectively, suggesting that FeS/RGO/FeS is a promising negative electrode material.
