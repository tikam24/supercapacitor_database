Cobalt sulfide (Co9S8) is a favorable material for supercapacitors, but its capacity and electrochemical cyclability are unsatisfactory, which inhibit its application. Therefore, it is extremely important to combine other materials with a higher theoretical capacity with Co9S8 nanostructures to enhance its electrochemical performance. Here, we report a binder-less electrode material composed of hollow Co9S8 nanotubes and porous FeCo-P nanosheets for a hybrid supercapacitor. The optimized sample is obtained through the electrodeposition of porous FeCo-P nanosheets on the metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived hollow Co9S8 nanotubes, which are supported on nickel foam (NF/CS@FCP). This special heterostructure assembled by porous FeCo-P nanosheets and hollow Co9S8 nanotubes presents improved availability of the redox electroactive sites, increased surface area, and facilitated electron-ion transfer for faradaic reactions in comparison with the single component. Due to its exclusive nanostructure and the synergistic effect of CS and FCP components, NF/CS@FCP presents an excellent capacity of 1590 C g−1 at 1 A g−1 and outstanding cyclability of 92.8% after 6500 cycles. When coupled with an activated carbon-based anode electrode (NF/AC), the hybrid device (NF/CS@FCP||NF/AC) unveils good energy/power density (66.6 W h kg−1/846.5 W kg−1). Therefore, this study highlights a promising strategy for the construction of the heterostructure for supercapacitors.
