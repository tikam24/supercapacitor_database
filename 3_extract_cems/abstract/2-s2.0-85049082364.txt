A facile one-step hydrothermal process was used to prepare MoS2/CoS2 binary composite as electrode material for supercapacitors with outstanding energy storage performance. The microstructure and morphology characterized by XRD, XPS, SEM and TEM analyses reveals that the MoS2/CoS2 binary composite is composed of octahedron-shaped CoS2 and flower-liked MoS2. For comparison, MoS2 was prepared through the same process, and its electrochemical performance was systematically investigated as well. Taking advantage of coupling two metal species, large surface areas and the tunable compositions, the obtained MoS2/CoS2 binary composite electrodes exhibit higher specific capacitance of 549 F/g at 2 mV/s or 434 F/g at 1 A/g than that of MoS2. In addition, the retention of MoS2/CoS2 binary composite is 91.6% after 10,000 cycles at 10 A/g, which manifests the excellent cycling stability. All these merits endow MoS2/CoS2 binary composite a potential supercapacitor electrode material for future application.
