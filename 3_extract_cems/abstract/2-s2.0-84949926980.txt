In this paper, an intelligent control strategy based on combination of the 'flatness based control technique' and the 'perturbation and observation (P&O) MPPT algorithm' is developed and investigated to control a hybrid electric energy source (HEPS). This EHPS is composed of a fuel cell system (FC) and a solar panel (SP), as the main source and a supercapacitor bank (SC), as the auxiliary sources. The main property of this strategy is that the system power flow is managed in different operating modes with the same control algorithm (without algorithm commutation). The power flows between the fuel cell, the SC is controlled by the flatness based control technique while a P&O MPPT technique is developed to control power of the SP. To validate performance of the proposed control of the HEPS, the simulation results are presented.
