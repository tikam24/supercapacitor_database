Using the hydrothermal carbon (HTC) of shaddock peel as precursor, KOH as activator, the shaddock peel-based hierarchical porous carbons were prepared by varying the alkali/carbon ratio (ratio of KOH to HTC), and subsequently used as electrodes of supercapacitor with 3 mol/L KOH electrolyte. SEM and the N2 physical adsorption analyzer were applied to characterize the surface morphologies and porous structures of the carbon materials. The effect of KOH ratio on the electrochemical performance was also investigated. The results showed that a high-performance carbon material with honey-comb structure could be obtained while the alkali/carbon ratio was 1:1. Its specific surface area, pore volume, mass specific capacitance and volumetric specific capacitance achieved 1421 m2/g, 0.7626 cm3/g, 226 F/g and 250 F/cm3 respectively, and the capacitance could retain 91.45% after 1000 cycles. Compared with directly activated (800â„ƒ) shaddock peel, its mass specific capacitance and volumetric specific capacitance had superiorities of 31.40% and 37.36% respectively.
