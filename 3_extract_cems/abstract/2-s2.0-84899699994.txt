Flake-like nanoporous carbon has been synthesized by the direct carbonization of aluminium salicylate coordination polymer that serves as hard templates and carbon sources. It reveals that the carbonization temperature plays a crucial role in the formation of nanoporous carbon. The correlation between specific surface areas, pore structures, surface functionalities and capacitive performances are investigated. The nanoporous carbon synthesized at 900 °C, named as carbon-900, exhibits high surface area of 1162 m 2 g-1 and large total pore volume of 0.80 cm3 g-1. The electrochemical behaviors are measured in a three-electrode system. In details, high specific capacitance of 220.0 F g-1 is achieved at a current density of 0.5 A g-1, whereas it also delivers high energy density of 30.5 W h kg-1, and long cycle stability (∼88.57% retention after 3000 cycles). © 2014 Elsevier B.V.
