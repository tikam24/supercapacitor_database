Supercapacitor-powered electric vehicles have attracted worldwide interest in transportation sector owing to their promising characteristics such as rapid charging cycle (2 min), long durability (up to 1 million cycles), delivering high power during cranking and acceleration of electric vehicles using burst mode power delivery, and free maintenance. Currently, the focusing on design, development, and demonstration of E-bicycle by using commercial Maxwell supercapacitor as an indigenous module for the prototype demonstration. Further, self-discharge of supercapacitor module and data generation of supercapacitor E-bicycle parameters such as motor current, driving range, and energy consumption during various load and speed have been collected. The charge and discharge cycles with voltage booster have been monitored on a regular basis.
