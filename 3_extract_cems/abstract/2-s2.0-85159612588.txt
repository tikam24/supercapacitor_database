Hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs), with a combined chemistry of supercapacitors (SCs) and batteries has become a prime choice among existing electrochemical energy storage devices. Because of high power density, elevated energy density and excellent life cycle, they attained significant attention towards their practical applications. To enhance the entire energy storage capabilities of hybrid supercapacitors, it is essential to design and manufacture such electrode materials having high specific capacitance and rate execution, as well as optimal lifespan. Newly developed crystalline materials, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with absorptive qualities, adjustable composition of chemicals, and flexible structures would result in achieving the desired energy storage capabilities of hybrid SCs. Herein, the categories of SCs and electrode materials were followed by a comprehensive discussion of the latest developments in pristine MOFs, their composites, as well as their derivatives used in HSCs. Moreover, impacts and potential of MOF derived materials for HSCs application were outlined depending upon prior works.
