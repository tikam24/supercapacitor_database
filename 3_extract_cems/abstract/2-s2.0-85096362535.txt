This work puts forth a strategy for energy management in an electric hybrid vehicle (EHV) with diverse power sources, comprising fuel cell (FC) as the primary source of energy while battery and supercapacitor (SC) as the secondary sources of energy. The electric vehicle draws its required energy from fuel cell, whereas the secondary sources of energy come to the rescue in compensating for the deficient power during acceleration or in absorbing the excess power during braking operation. The synergetic use of the secondary sources proves its effectiveness in improving vehicle efficiency, reducing the consumption of hydrogen appreciably, and bringing in robustness and reliability in the operation of the system as a whole. The proposed strategy coordinates the power share among the diverse energy sources in a way to optimally fulfill the power requirement of the vehicle. MATLAB/Simulink is utilized as the platform for simulation runs.
