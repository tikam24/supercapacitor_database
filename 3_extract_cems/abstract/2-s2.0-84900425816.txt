A simple template route was used to prepare hierarchical Ni(OH)2 hollow spheres. The product was composed of nanosheets and displayed high specific surface areas and low crystallinity. The particular structure endows it with high capacitance and good stability as supercapacitor material, which maybe due to its large amount of electroactive sites, good ion diffusion and electron transport.
