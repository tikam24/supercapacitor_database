Flexible supercapacitor electrodes have been fabricated by simple fabrication technique using graphite nanoflakes on polymer lapping films as flexible substrate. An additional thin layer of conducting polymer polypyrrole over the electrode improved the surface conductivity and exhibited excellent electrochemical performances. Such capacitor films showed better energy density and power density with a maximum capacitance value of 37 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> in a half cell configuration using 1 M H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> electrolyte, 23 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> in full cell, and 6 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> as planar cell configuration using poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/phosphoric acid (H<inf>3</inf>PO<inf>4</inf>) solid state electrolyte. Moreover, the graphite nanoflakes/polypyrrole over polymer lapping film demonstrated good flexibility and cyclic stability. (Graph Presented).
