The aim of this study was to synthesize CuFe2O4 together with g-C3N4 and GNPs in various combinations on the surface of Ni foam for use as anode materials in supercapacitors. The fabricated electrodes were investigated by XRD, FTIR, XPS, BET, SEM and TEM for content and by CV, GCD and EIS analysis for electrochemistry. The characterization results showed that CuFe2O4 was successfully synthesized together with g-C3N4 and GNPs in a nanosponge-like geometry. The highest value of specific capacitance was found to be 989 mF/cm2 at 2 mA measurement in the triple combination. Moreover, the stability of this electrode was measured to be 70% after 1500 cycles at 16 mA, while the energy and power densities were calculated to be 27.8 mWh/cm2 and 300 mW/cm2, respectively. The EIS results show that the carbon-based component increased the Cs value by decreasing the charge transfer and diffusion resistances of the electrodes. Compared to its counterparts in the literature, its Cs value is quite high, but its stability is low, so it can be used in low-cycle applications.
