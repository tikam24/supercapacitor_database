The Ni/Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) composites for supercapacitor electrode have been synthesized by electroless deposition method. The morphology and structure of Ni/CNTs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The nano-size Ni particles coated the surface of carbon nanotubes. Electrochemical performances of the synthesized composites were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurement. The specific capacitance of prepared electrode is up to 281 F/g, which is much higher than acetylene black electrode and pure carbon nanotubes electrode, indicating an effective path for increasing specific capacitance of carbon materials for the appplication of supercapacitors.
