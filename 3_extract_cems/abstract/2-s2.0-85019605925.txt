The high power density of Supercapacitors (SCs) make them good elements for Hybrid Energy Storage Systems (HESSs). In order to increase the amount of energy of their high power bursts, they should operate with large voltage variations. This paper presents the design equations of a 3-switch bidirectional DC-DC converter with a tapped inductor that can be used for interfacing SCs to DC buses. Some of its key features are possible operation with V1>V2 and V1<V2, high voltage ratios (V1/V2) and also the choice of operating in three modes (Buck, Boost and Buck-Boost), which offers the potential for switch power loss balancing. Experimental results obtained with a 1-kW prototype are presented.
