The impacts of the Stabilized Lithium Metal Powder on the whole system of lithium ion capacitor have been discussed in this paperwork. The optical microscope was involved to observe and analyze the changes of pre-inserted lithium negative electrode after adding electrolyte. Half cells and full cells with different pre-inserted lithium negative electrode were compared to analyze the effects of pre-inserted lithium process on the capacity and power density of lithium ion capacitors. As a result, capacitor with 14% SLMP have comparatively superior properties than the others.
