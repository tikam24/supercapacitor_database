Supercapacitors have been widely recognized as a promising device for the storage of renewable energy. Herein, a facile electrochemical oxidation strategy is described to construct a nickel sulfide/oxide heterostructure which enhances the specific areal capacitance of Ni3S2 electrodeposited on nickel foam. The resulting heterostructure electrode exhibits high areal capacitance, 65 times that of the as-prepared Ni3S2 electrode (2035 mF cm-2vs. 31 mF cm-2 at a current density of 8 mA cm-2), while still maintaining great stability, showing no performance degradation after 5000 charge-discharge cycles. Its exceptional capacitance, advanced rate capability, and superior cycling stability are attributed to the transformed composition and unique nanostructure achieved during electrochemical oxidation, which can provide a large electrochemically active surface area, fast electron/electrolyte ion transport, and robust structural stability. Such a low-cost and facile strategy can be potentially applicable to prepare many other materials for supercapacitor applications.
