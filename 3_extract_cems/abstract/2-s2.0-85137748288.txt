In this study,the facile hydrothermal synthesis of Magnesium–cobalttite MgCo2O4 spinel with different morphologies, such as nanosheets and nanospheres has been investigated. The structural, morphological, textural, and chemical composition of the materials were examined using powdered X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Transition electron mictroscopy (TEM), N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The produced materials have heterostructure morphology with a nanospherical surface-coated nanosheet-like morphology that is clearly visible in the results of FESEM and TEM. The results of N2 adsorption–desorption reveal that MgCo2O4@PPy has a larger specific area of 103 m2 g−1 than MgCo2O4, which has a specific area of 73 m2g−1. The synthesized electrode material with inventive nanoarchitectures showed attractive electrochemical performance in a variety of applications. The heterostructure MgCo2O4@Ppy electrode produced an impressive capacitive retention of 93% at current density 5 Ag−1 and a high specific capacitacne of 988 Fg−1 after 10,000 cycles. The assembled ASC cell MgCo2O4@Ppy//AC provided remarkable high capacitance retention of 84% after 10,000 cycles at 5 Ag−1, intensely high energy density of 40 Whkg−1, and power density of 1544 Wkg−1.
