NiMoO 4 nanorods of different properties were synthesized via facile and scalable hydrothermal route by varying the reaction time and temperature and the effect of synthesis parameters on their electrochemical performances was investigated. Optimization of the synthesis parameters was carried out based on the electrochemical performance. Experimental analysis revealed that NiMoO 4 nanorods synthesized at 150 °C for 6 h showed optimum electrochemical performance with specific capacitance, as high as 594 Fg −1 at 1 Ag −1 current density due to greater mesoporous nature and optimum crystallinity index. NiMoO 4 //activated carbon asymmetric supercapacitor device was fabricated using the optimized NiMoO 4 nanorods and characterized for the electrochemical performances. Specific capacitance of 66 Fg −1 was obtained for the fabricated supercapacitor device at 1 Ag −1 current density and 56% retention of the specific capacitance was observed after 1000 cycles. An energy density of 18 Whkg −1 and power density of 704 Wkg −1 were achieved at 1 Ag −1 current density which offer great promise for supercapacitor application of this material.
