Hollow carbon nanosphere (HCNS) with a microporous shell was explored to be used as electrodes for supercapacitor. The supercapacitive performances of HCNS in various kinds of neutral aqueous electrolytes (e.g., K2SO4, Li2SO4 and Na2SO4 aqueous solution) were investigated through using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. It was found that the HCNS electrode in the neutral aqueous electrolytes showed excellent rate performance and highly efficient electrochemical accessible surface area, which was probably attributed to its unique hollow core and microporous shell nanostructure. The as-evidenced good capacitive property endowed HCNS with great application potential to carbon-based supercapacitor.
