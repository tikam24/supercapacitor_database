A facile and mild route to synthesize C-coated SiC nanosheets (SiC/C NSs) via wet-chemical etching in hydrofluoric acid (HF) at 60 °C for 48 h using carbon aluminum silicate (Al4SiC4) as raw materials is reported for the first time. HF molecule leads to the breaking of C-Al bonds in Al4SiC4, which eventually results in the formation of two-dimensional SiC nanosheets. A carbon layer with a thickness of approximately 1.5 nm is formed on the surface of SiC nanosheets due to the excess carbon. The prepared SiC/C NSs possess a smooth and rectangular sheet with a mean 150 nm in width, 500 nm in length and 10 nm in thickness, respectively. The crystallographic characterization indicates that 3C-SiC and 2H-SiC coexist and the parallel plane relationship of 3C/2H-SiC heterojunction is (111)3C-SiC//(001)2H-SiC. Due to the formed 3C-SiC/2H-SiC heterojunction and graphitic carbon, the fabricated electrode based on SiC/C NSs exhibits prolonged cycling stability and high specific areal capacitance as a promising supercapacitor candidate. It remains 91.2% retention even after 20,000 cycles and 734 μF/cm2 at a scan rate of 10 mV/s.
