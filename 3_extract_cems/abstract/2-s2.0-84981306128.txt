The emergence of supercapacitors as an environment friendly energy storage device has generated a lot of interest in industry and academia. Carbon electrodes used in this device can be derived from biomass. This study tries to use dried banyan tree leaves and rose petals as a precursor to produce activated carbon. The activated carbon is then used to develop supercapacitors in the symmetrical and asymmetrical arrangement. In the latter case, one of the electrodes of the supercapacitor works on the principle of pseudocapacitance employing manganese dioxide as active material. A high value of specific capacitance was obtained by the asymmetric arrangement.
