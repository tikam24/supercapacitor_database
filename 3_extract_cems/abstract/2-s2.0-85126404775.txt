Supercapattery (SCAP) deals with electrochemical characterization of battery-type charge storage materials. These battery-type materials do possess an intermediate ion intercalation between pseudocapacitive and battery materials. The application of SCAP deals with the fabrication of a supercabaterry (asymmetric supercapacitor) consisting of SCAP electrodes as cathode and carbon-based materials as anode. This chapter deals with the recent developments and research progress in supercabattery and critically analyzes its possibility for commercialization. Different supercabatteries involving the SCAP cathodes such as metal oxides/hydroxides, ternary metal cobaltites, and chalcogenides are detailed. The energy storage capability of the supercapacitors available in the present market are described and the need for alternative materials for energy storage markets is focused upon.
