Supercapacitors are energy storage devices with high electrical power densities and long spanlife. Therefore, supercapacitor-based energy storage systems have been employed for a variety of applications. The modelling and simulation of SCs have been of great interest to this objective. This paper presents an electrical schema and mathematical modelling of three models of supercapacitors. The first is the RC model, the second is the two-branch model and the third is the multi-branch model. The objective of this modelling is to choose the best model that can respect the same behaviour of the experimental model. These models are compared with an experimental model. This comparison prove that the response voltage of the multi-branch model correctly describes the behaviour of the experimental model of Belhachemi. The disadvantage of this model is the slow simulation duration in MATLAB/Simulink. The RC model represented the faster model in terms of simulation. The choice of 15 branches in parallel in multi-branch models gives good results and correctly describes the reel model. The automatic charge and discharge voltage of SCs reduce by reducing the charge current.
