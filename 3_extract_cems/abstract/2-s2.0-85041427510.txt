Nitrogen and oxygen enriched hierarchically porous carbons (NOHPCs) derived from biomass have been successfully prepared by rapid microwave carbonization coupled with molten salt synthesis method in only 4 min. ZnCl 2 plays important roles as microwave absorber, chemical activation agent and porogen in this process. NOHPC-1:10 sample possesses the maximum specific surface area of 1899 m 2 g −1 with a pore volume of 1.16 cm 3 g −1 and mesopore ratio of 70%, as well as nitrogen content of 5.30 wt% and oxygen content of 14.12 wt%. When evaluated as an electrode in a three-electrode system with 6 M KOH electrolyte, the material exhibits a high specific capacitance of 276 F g −1 at 0.2 A g −1 , with a good rate capability of 90.9% retention at 10 A g −1 . More importantly, the symmetric supercapacitor based on NOHPC-1:10 in 1 M Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte exhibits a high energy density of 13.9 Wh kg −1 at a power density of 120 W kg −1 in a wide voltage window of 0–1.6 V, an excellent cycling stability with 95% of capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles. Our strategy provides a facile and rapid way for the preparation of advanced carbon materials derived from biomass towards energy storage applications.
