In this work, a simple sonochemical route was followed to synthesize cobalt stannate (Co2SnO4) nanocubes using stannous and cobalt chlorides as the precursors in alkaline medium at room temperature. The structure, composition and surface morphology of synthesized Co2SnO4 nanocubes have been characterized by using X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) indicates that the Co2SnO4 nanocubes are crystalline, single-phase without any impurity phase; the sizes of nanocubes are ∼100 nm. The cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling test, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements are carried out for the Co2SnO4 nanocubes shows a specific capacitance 237 F g−1 at 0.5 mA cm−2 current density and in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Co2SnO4 nanocubes exhibit long cycling life with 80% retention of initial capacitance after 2000 cycles and the excellent rate capability at 15 mA cm−2 as much as 70% of that at 0.5 mA cm−2 suggest its potential use for supercapacitor applications.
