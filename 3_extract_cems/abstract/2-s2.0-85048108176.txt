A three-dimensional (3D) MoS2 coated CoS2-nitrogen doped graphene (NG) (CoS2@MoS2-NG) hybrid has been synthesized by a one step hydrothermal method as supercapacitor (SC) electrode material for the first time. Such a composite consists of NG embedded with stacked CoS2@MoS2 sheets. With a 3D skeleton, it prevents the agglomeration of CoS2@MoS2 nanoparticles, resulting in sound conductivity, rich porous structures and a large surface area. The results indicate that CoS2@MoS2-NG has higher specific capacitance (198 F g-1 at 1 A g-1), better rate performance (with about 56.57% from 1 to 16 A g-1) and an improved cycle stability (with about 96.97% after 1000 cycles). It is an ideal candidate for SC electrode materials.
