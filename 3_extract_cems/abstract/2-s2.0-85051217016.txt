This review article on synthesis of various carbonaceous and transition metal oxide based supercapacitor electrode materials and their electrochemical performance shows that though a potential method, the sol-gel process needs to be extensively explored and practiced on a large extent. The carbonaceous materials possess high electrochemical stabilities but they demonstrate lower capacitance compared to the ruthenium-based materials. Overall excellence in electrochemical behaviour was exhibited by a binary metal oxide NiCoO4 in thin film form with a value of 2157 F/g.
