Nitrogen and fluorine co-doped three-dimensional(3D) graphene-like material, MP-700, is successfully prepared using a one-pot method by directly pyrolyzing melamine and PTFE in N2 flow. This 3D graphene-like material has a high specific surface area (1309 m2 g−1) and the N and F contents are is 19.03 and 0.41 at.%, respectively. Furthermore, it shows the high specific capacitance of 230 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1; and exhibits long-term stability. After 10,000 cycles, the capacitance retention rate is 86.3% at 20 A g−1, which has a good prospect in the electrode materials of supercapacitors.
