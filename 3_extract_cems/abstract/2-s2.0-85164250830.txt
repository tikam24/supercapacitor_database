The primary issues with wireless power transmission for electric vehicles using solar power are charging times and power transfer efficiency. In this study, the transformer induction theory and adaptive robotics are used to address both problems. A receiving coil-carrying more efficiency method for wireless power transfer during charging E-Vehicles. The suggested design's viability is evaluated using a prototype, which can achieve unity power factor moreover an air gap of 8 centimeter and a most of the sliding distance of 10 centimeter down a variety of power settings while producing an output voltage of around 15 Volts Electric voltage is produced by solar power. Dynamic Wireless Power Transfer, which eventually eliminates the need for static Wireless Power Transfer and connect charging, allows for an electric vehicle's overall runtime to be endless. An EV (electric vehicle) may be charged while being driven, saving time and effort when recharging it. By using this technique everywhere, electric vehicle batteries will eventually be able to be removed as well. The electric vehicles have the coils it transmits and receives f or wireless charging, two different kinds of coils are needed and reception coil will absorb energy from the transmitter coil as it passes through it thanks to mutual induction. However, wireless power transmission is impacted by the difference in distance between two nearby coils (WPT). Ansys Maxwell simulation software is used to construct and simulate vertically and horizontally and that will be has no proper alignment for the system of two copper coils of architecture median in order to examine the variance in WPT.
