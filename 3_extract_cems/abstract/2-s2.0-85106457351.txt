The present work is about the preparation of silver (Ag)-doped manganese oxide (MnO2)/graphene oxide (GO) composite thin films are deposited by a facile and binder-free successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method for the first time. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) study revealed the nanosheets of MnO2–Ag3/GO exhibit high specific surface area of 192 m2 g−1. The tailored flower-like morphology and interconnected nanosheets of MnO2–Ag3/GO electrodes achieved high electrochemical performance. The maximum specific capacitance (Cs) of 877 F g−1 at the scan rate of 5 mV s−1 is obtained for MnO2–Ag3/GO electrode tested in 1 M sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) electrolyte with capacity retention of 94.57% after 5000 cycling stability. The MnO2–Ag3/GO composite-based flexible solid state symmetric supercapacitor (FSS-SSC) device delivered Cs as 164 F g−1 with specific energy of 57 Wh kg−1 at specific power of 1.6 kW kg−1 and capacitive retention of 94% after 10,000 cycles.
