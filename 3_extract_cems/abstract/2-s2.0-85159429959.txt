In this paper, the boron (B) and nitrogen (N) are added into carbon (C) structure named BCN. The BCN was used as electrode materials in supercapacitor cell, which shows good performance in electrochemistry test. The research results show that the performance of the BCN based-supercapacitor can be up to 806.1 mF at current density of 3 mA in KOH electrolyte. Besides, the capacity of supercapacitor cell in DLC301 electrolyte can be up to 782.9 mF at current density of 5 mA and the voltage increases to 2.7 times compared with KOH electrolyte.
