In this paper, we reported a facile route for the fabrication of TiO2/Fe2O3 composite on the surface of Ti-15Fe alloy foil prepared by arc melting through simple high-temperature oxidation, which was used as an electrode for supercapacitor. TiO2and Fe2O3 grew together and in coarse short rod shape. The electrode exhibited excellent electrochemical performance with areal capacitance of 840 mF cm−2 at current density of 1 mA cm−2 as well as superior long-term cycling life of 120% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles. These results demonstrate the potential of oxidation products of Ti alloys as high-performance electrode materials for supercapacitor applications.
