The nano-sized amorphous α-MnO2-dispersed carbon aerogels (CAs) were prepared by liquid phase co-precipitation technique. Different MnO2 contents and heating temperatures were taken to prepare the composites. The composites prepared were used to make electrodes of electrochemical supercapacitors. Electrochemical properties of the electrodes were studied by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge. The specific capacitances of the MnO2-dispersed CAs and the nano-MnO2 ingredient in the composite are up to 219 F g-1 and 401 F g-1 at 5 mA.cm-2, 1.6 times and 5.0 times greater than that of neat CA and MnO2, respectively. © 2009.
