In the energy storage systems, hybrid supercapacitor has a promising in the future, making up performance disparity between traditional capacitors and lithium ion batteries. In this work, a novel Nickle oxalate (NiC2O4) based composite by inducing reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and nickel foam (NF) has been constructed for battery-type supercapacitors, which exhibits significantly improved electrochemical properties. The NiC2O4/rGO/NF (NGN) composite possesses a superior capacity of 305 mAh g-1 and better cycling stability which the specific capacitance of sample retained 91.32 % after 30,000 cycles. The NGN hybrid supercapacitors (NGN-HSC) assembled by NGN as the anode and the activated carbon (AC) as the cathode exhibits high energy density of 54.75 Wh kg−1 at 1800.05 W kg−1 power density, also outstanding cycling stability (72.07 % capacity is retained after 10,000 times). The work supplies a new approach to design electrodes with ultrahigh cycling stability.
