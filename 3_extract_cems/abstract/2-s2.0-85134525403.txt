Graphene and its derivatives with high specific surface area and superior conductivity have broad application foreground for zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZIHSs), but so far, their electrochemical behaviors are still far from satisfactory. Herein, we report an efficient and affordable method for boosting the energy storage properties of graphene oxide (GO), the most important precursor of graphene, by chemically bonding it with 2, 3-diamino-1, 4-naphthoquinone (DANQ), a novel naphthoquinone derivant. Effects of the DANQ dosage are revealed, and results depict that, as the DANQ dosage is 72 mg (120 mg of GO), the GO-DANQ-72 presents a dramatically better performance in contrast to the other three counterparts (raw GO, GO-DANQ-48, and GO-DANQ-96). Specifically, the GO-DANQ-72//Zn has a remarkable specific capacitance of 116.3 F g−1 (corresponding to a specific capacity of 51.7 mAh g−1) at a current density of 0.5 A g−1, and a decent energy density of 41.3 Wh kg−1 at 399.9 W kg−1. Furthermore, great cyclic stability with a capacitance retention of 88.2% after 5000 cycles is shown. This study may provide a new chance for the development of GO-based carbon cathode for high-performance ZIHSs.
