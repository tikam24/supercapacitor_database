Lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) are promising energy-storage devices owing to their high energy densities and power densities that can well bridge the gap between lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors. However, their energy-storage performance suffers from electrochemical capacity and kinetics imbalances between capacitor-type cathodes and battery-type anodes. Here, an electrode framework matching strategy is reported that can minimize these disparities between the counter electrodes. Based on a biomimic microphase separation mechanism, anode and cathode materials with the same interconnected mesoporous carbon framework but different assembled active sites have been fabricated. Due to the optimized integration of abundant active sites and functional electron/ion transport architectures in both electrodes, the assembled LICs deliver high energy densities up to 257 and 124 Wh kg-1 at power densities of 53 and 10 010 W kg-1, respectively, exceeding previously reported LIC counterparts. The work provides a framework-based design strategy as well as a scalable fabrication method of nanostructured electrode materials toward high-performance LICs.
