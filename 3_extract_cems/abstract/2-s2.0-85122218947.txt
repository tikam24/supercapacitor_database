A woven carbon fiber (WCF)-based triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG)-cum-structural supercapacitor is an excellent multifunctional device for clean energy harvesting and storage. This type of device has high load-bearing capacity and functions smoothly under severe outdoor conditions. Herein, WCF-based multifunctional TENG is reported that generated 8.9 W m−2 power with 84% energy conversion efficiency. The energy generated by the TENG was simultaneously stored in a connected supercapacitor that provide 1.93 Wh kg−1 of energy density and delivers 39.23 W kg−1 of power density. The specific surface area of the WCF was enhanced several hundred-fold by coating with an N-doped Zn–Cu selenide nanoporous material, thereby enabling higher energy generation and elevated storage capacity of the device. The TENG use a polyester-based solid polymer electrolyte as the negative electrode and polydimethylsiloxane-coated WCF as the positive electrode. The device has a very high coulombic efficiency with high mechanical strength and ability to resist massive impact. An application of the multifunctional device was demonstrated. These types of multifunctional devices have great potential in the self-charging automobile, aerospace, sensor, and electronics sectors.
