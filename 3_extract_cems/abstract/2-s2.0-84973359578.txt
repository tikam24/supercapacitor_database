Graphene has been obtained at atmospheric pressure and low temperature on exhausted activated carbon-derived SiC nanoparticles. The graphenes growth, traced by online analyzers, has been obtained from an external source of carbon, in particular by methane/hydrogen chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Recycled SiC has been chosen as growth substrate to carry out a convenient process and to increase the added value of the recycled, combining the favorable properties of different substances. Therefore, the SiC powder and the composite material obtained have been carefully characterized by the combined use of different techniques and tested as supercapacitor electrodes. The results show a very high capacitances up to 114.7 F/g for SiC alone and three times higher in the presence of graphene with an excellent cycle stability.
