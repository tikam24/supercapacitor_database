The urgent demand for portable electronics has promoted the development of high-efficient energy sources. A typical portable device requires a low power input that can be supplied by a supercapacitor (SC), which are high-power energy-storage devices enabled by reversible ion adsorption at electrolyte/electrode interface with superior properties such as long cycling life and high-power. However, current SCs using aqueous electrolytes possess the safety hazard of liquid leakage meanwhile solid polymer electrolytes can address this issue, and offers advantages such as simple assembly, low cost and flexible packages, and possible high-voltage operation. In this paper we report a flexible SPEEK supercapacitor used simultaneously as solid-state electrolyte, and ion-conducting surfactant.
