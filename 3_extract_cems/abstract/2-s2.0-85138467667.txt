Functional materials are required to address social needs such as environmental protection, energy storage and conversion, integrated goods production, and biological and medicinal treatments. Nanoarchitectonics is a research concept that logically develops functional materials from nanoscale units by combining nanotechnology with other fields of study including supramolecular chemistry, materials science, and biological sciences. In this review article, we discuss the fundamentals and types of nanoarchitectonics, synthesis of zero-dimensional (0-D), one-dimensional (1-D), two-dimensional (2-D), and three-dimensional (3-D) nanomaterials from bottom-up and top-down methods, and conversion of these materials into functional materials. Various physical and chemical methods for producing nanomaterials are also discussed briefly. Then, applications of functional materials in numerous fields such as energy storage, supercapacitor, sensors, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, water purification, and other bio-related applications such as anticancer therapy, drug delivery, and tissue engineering are discussed. Finally, future challenges of materials nanoarchitectonics concepts for the advancement of functional nanomaterials are explained briefly.
