Self-supported NiMoO 4 nanowire arrays (NNAs) are successfully grown on nickel foam (NF) via a simple one-step hydrothermal method and anneal treatment. Importantly, the in-situ growth method can reduce the contact resistance between the active material and current collector. It also can prevent the binder/conductive agent from “area of the deactivation” phenomenon. So, the design can effectively improve the electrochemical performance of electrode materials. In addition, a highly flexible carbon nanotubes (CNTs) film is also prepared by vacuum filtration step. Finally, an all-solid asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) based on the optimized NiMoO 4 nanowires electrode and carbon nanotube film (CNF) is assembled with PVA/KOH gel electrolyte. The ASC device presents outstanding electrochemical performance with a high energy density of 54.3 Wh kg −1 at a power density of 4344 W kg −1 . The specific capacitance of the NNAs//CNF ASC remains 91.6% after 6000 cycles with a current density of 14 A g −1 . At the same time, it also can continue to work under different bending states with almost constant performance. These results reveal that the NNAs//CNF ASC has great application prospect for flexible electronic fields.
