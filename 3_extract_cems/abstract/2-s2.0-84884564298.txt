The mechanoelectrical properties of a supercapacitor-like ionic electroactive polymer laminate with carbide-derived carbon-based electrodes are investigated using a special rig, which bends the laminate following a well-defined bending profile. The bending device is characterized by homogeneous and sinusoidal changes in curvature in a wide frequency range (1 mHz-3 Hz), and very high curvature amplitudes (up to ±121 m-1). During bending, the curvature of the laminate remains uniform. The parameters recorded during bending include the generated voltage, electric current and charge. The results show a nonlinear frequency response of the tested material in the whole investigated frequency range. Electric current and charge are found to be directly proportional to the area of the bent laminate, and are therefore advantageous for motion sensing. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.
