Zeolite imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) derived high surface area materials have been established as the promising electrode materials in supercapacitors due to their tunable morphology and abundance heteroatom based electroactive sites. In this work, manganese doped ZIF-67 derived nitrogen doped carbon based sulfide Mn/Co/NC/S electrode is synthesized for augmented performance in supercapacitors. The manganese doped ZIF-67 is synthesized by the simple co-precipitation method followed by heat treatment and hydrothermal sulfidation. The synthesized Mn/Co/NC/S (CS_8/1) electrode exhibits porous 2D sheet like morphology with high surface area of 971 m2 g−1. The CS_8/1 electrode exhibited ultra-high specific capacitance of 1194 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and specific energy of 214.89 Wh kg−1 at 1080 W kg−1. Furthermore, the CS_8/1 electrode has exceptional cyclic stability with specific capacitance retention of 82% after 5000 cycles. This improved performance is attributed to the synergistic impact of Mn ions paired with Co ions, as well as increased redox reaction and structural rearrangements.
