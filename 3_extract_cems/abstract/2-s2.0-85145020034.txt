Polyoxometalates (POMs) are emerging redox active materials having great potential for energy storage. Normally, POMs are directly anchored to substrates, however we looked into a novel feature of POM chemistry by employing them as precursor for metal sulphide 3D microflower arrangements without the use of a template. High surface area, outstanding electrical conductivity, and exceptional structural stability are all characteristics of 2D materials like MXenes; nevertheless, their direct use is constrained by poor specific capacitance as a result of layer restacking. Transition Metal sulphides (TMDs), on the other hand, have a high surface area but a poor conductivity. Layer restacking will be prevented by an MXene-TMDs nanocomposite, which will also increase TMDs' conductivity. Here, we report MXene-TMDs nanocomposite (MV) with MXene intercalated vanadium molybdenum sulphide (VMD) microflowers using 10-molybdo-2-vanadophosphoric acid. Due to faster ionic diffusion, higher electrochemically active surface area, and more active sites, MV exhibits good electrochemical performance. Additionally, the MV||MV cell offers outstanding cycling stability (96 % capacitance retention after 8000 cycles @ 2 A g−1) and performs well up to 0.9 V, delivering a maximum energy density of 28.96 Wh kg−1 @ 232.35 W kg−1. This research investigates how POMs affect the atomic ratio and morphology of final product.
