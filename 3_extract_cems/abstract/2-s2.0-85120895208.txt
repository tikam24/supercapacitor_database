The present work explores the electrochemical energy storage performance of Ti3C2Tx (MXene) and 1T-VS2 nanosheet hybrids synthesized by a simple in situ hydrothermal method. Different analytical methods such as X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared, Raman spectroscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller were employed to explore the structural and morphological properties and composition of electrode materials. Furthermore, the electrochemical characterization of 1T-VS2/MXene hybrid electrode materials with different concentrations of MXene was investigated systematically. The all pseudocapacitive asymmetric supercapacitor cell was fabricated by combining the best performing 1T-VS2/MXene and MXene, which displayed the highest specific capacitance of 115.7 F/g at a current density of 0.8 A/g in an expanded potential range of 1.6 V. Additionally, the highest energy density achieved was 41.13 W h kg-1 at a maximum power density of 793.50 W kg-1. The asymmetric supercapacitor was able to achieve a high capacitance retention of 85% and a coulombic efficiency of 100% after 5000 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles. Moreover, the synergistic effect and charge storage kinetics of the 1T-VS2/MXene hybrid pseudocapacitive electrode material were investigated in detail using experimental and density functional theory calculations. Based on the results, we have further demonstrated the usage of 1T-VS2/MXene and MXene as a high-performance energy storage material for supercapacitor application with the dominating intercalation mechanism. The lower diffusion energy barrier for electrolytic ions in the case of hybrid 1T-VS2/MXene supports the higher charge storage. The enhanced density of states and lower diffusion barrier justify the superior charge storage performance for hybrid 1T-VS2/MXene.
