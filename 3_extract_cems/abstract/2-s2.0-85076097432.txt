One of the most serious problem in the world, Fine dust issue is going to happen in whole world. 'Fine dust' is defined under these standard, if its diameter particle is less than 10um, it is called as 'fine dust', 2um, it is cal led as 'super fine dust'. Actually, 'Fine dust' is assigned as 1st level hazardous substances by WHO (World Health Organization). In this paper, I suggested new way to solve this kinds of problem by using Li+ batteries and high-performance supercapacitor. A lot of kinds energy source such as fossil fuel, one of the reason of environment problem can be changed to eco-friendly energy such as solar power. We can solve two factors o(cause / result) of fine dust by using eco-friendly energy source.
