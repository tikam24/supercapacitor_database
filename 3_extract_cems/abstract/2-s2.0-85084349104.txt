It has attracted increasing interest that creating a series of novel supercapacitor electrode materials with promising property. Among many kinds of electrode materials, transition metal silicates and metal oxides have been widely developed as electrode materials for supercapacitors because of their structural stabilization and extremely high theoretical capacity. In our work, manganese dioxide (MnO2) coated on cobalt silicate (Co2SiO4) nanobelts core-shell composites (Co2SiO4 nanobelts@MnO2, abbreviated as CoSi NBs@MnO2) as the improved electrodes for hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) have been designed and fabricated by a template method. These two electrode materials complement each other and display an excellent synergistic effect. Thanks to the special nanostructures and the capacitance contribution of the two materials, the capacitance value of CoSi NBs@MnO2 can achieve 490.5 F·g−1 at 1 A·g−1 and the capacitance retention with ca. 80% after 5000 cycles. Furthermore, the HSC device fabricated by activated carbon (AC) and CoSi NBs@MnO2 shows the areal capacitance of 328.1 m F·cm−2 at 1 mA·cm−2. Meanwhile, the energy density and power density of the CoSi NBs@MnO2//AC HSC device measure to be 0.89 Wh·m−2 and 42 W·m−2, respectively. The novel and reasonable structural design allows Co2SiO4 and MnO2 to make the contributions in the direction of electrode materials for supercapacitors.
