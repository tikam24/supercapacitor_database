Graphene, a sp2-hybridized 2D atomic crystal, is one of the most important materials of the twenty-first century. Graphene and graphene-based materials have garnered a lot of interest from researchers because of their potential as superior electrode materials for energy storage systems on account of their high electrical and thermal conductivity, low resistance to corrosion, and high surface area. In the last ten years, there has been a huge increase in research into graphene-like carbon compounds made from biomass that can be used in new ways to store energy. Graphene-like structures can be made from biomass at a low cost and with almost no carbon emissions. This is a promising step towards a more sustainable energy future. Furthermore, due to their sustainability and good performance for high-power and short-term energy needs, they are perfect candidates for carbon-based supercapacitor devices, which are seen as the key to the future electrification of green transportation. Graphene is thus used in a variety of applications, such as polymer composites, energy storage, fuel cells, and biomedical applications. Bio-waste products are considered to be a superior source of carbon generation. However, bio-waste materials are numerous, and adequate disposal methods are required. This chapter has focused on the production of graphene using various bio-sources such as rice husks, paper cups, hemp, chitosan, banana peels, and peanuts, along with its applications as a suitable electrode material in the field of supercapacitors.
