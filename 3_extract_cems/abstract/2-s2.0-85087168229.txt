Supercapacitors can be used for portable energy storage applications. In this study, machine learning techniques are applied to optimize the process of preparation of supercapacitor electrodes from chemically activated carbon made from jackfruit seeds. Experimental trials were carried out using statistical design of experiments. Artificial neural network was employed to generate the process model and a multiobjective optimization was attempted by means of swarm intelligence and the Derringer's desirability function. The optimized electrode demonstrated high capacitance and low resistance making it suitable for supercapacitors. The algorithm developed in the study can be adopted by process engineers for efficient optimization.
