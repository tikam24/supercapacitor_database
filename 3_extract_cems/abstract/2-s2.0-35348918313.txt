The paper introduces a simplified model, named "two branches mode", to characterize the electrical behaviour of the DLCs (Double Layer Capacitors). The new model is very similar to many others in literature from the circuital point of view, however the process of identification of its parameters is easier and faster. This new identification process can be followed in other some model proposed in literature. Experimental charge tests have been executed on supercapacitors of two different labels (Epcos and Maxwell) and size (between 100F to 600F). The experimental results and the performed simulations have been reported in order to verify the validity of the new identification proposed method. Â© 2007 IEEE.
