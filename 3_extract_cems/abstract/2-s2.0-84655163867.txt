In this paper, the effects of several experimental conditions, such as electrode layer binder content, conducting carbon content, electrode layer thickness, as well as electrolyte concentration, on both the specific capacitance and energy density of a BP2000 carbon-based supercapacitor are investigated using both cyclic voltammetry and a galvanic charging-discharging curve. The electrode layer studied contains Super C45 carbon as the conducting additive, PTFE as the binder, and Na 2SO 4 as the aqueous electrolyte, respectively. With the purpose of optimizing the electrode layer structure, 15 wt% of Super C45 and 5 wt% of PTFE in the electrode layer with a thickness of 100 μm, are found to be the best composition in terms of improving both specific capacitance and energy density. Regarding the effect of electrolyte concentration in the range of 0.1-1.0 M, 0.5 M of Na 2SO 4 gives the best performance. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
