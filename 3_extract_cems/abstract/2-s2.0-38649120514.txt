Polyaniline (PANI) powders were prepared by interfacial polymerization which utilized the interface between HCl and CCl4. Symmetric redox supercapacitor was assembled with the PANI nanofibers as active electrode material and 1 mol/L H2SO4 aqueous solution as electrolyte. The electrochemical performances of the supercapacitor were tested with galvanostatic charge-discharge, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results show that the PANI powders are composed of highly uniform nanofibers whose average diameter is 50-100 nm and the lengths range from 500 nm up to several micrometers. The specific capacitance of the PANI nanofiber electrode is about 317 F/g and 300 F/g, respectively when the charge-discharge current is 5 mA and 20 mA, respectively; Meanwhile, the PANI nanofiber electrode shows that the capacity decay is less than 4% after 500 charge-discharge cycles. Compared with PANI particle prepared by conventional chemical polymerization, the PANI nanofiber material has better power characteristic and cycle performance in the application of supercapacitor.
