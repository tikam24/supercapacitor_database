Supercapacitors have drawn our attention exceptionally in the last few decades due to their substantial applications, but the majority has focused on different metal oxides/metal hydroxides composite electrode materials. Here, we have synthesised spherical honeycomb like ZnMn2O4@Ni(OH)2 (ZMN) core–shell electrode material by a facile, substrate free and cost-effective hydrothermal protocol. The novel electrode material, such as spherical ZMN exhibits high specific capacitance of 2577.44F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with incredible cyclic stability of 94.8% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles a 1 A g−1. Additionally, a solid-state asymmetric device has been fabricated by using ZMN and activated carbon (AC) as positive and negative electrodes, respectively. This asymmetric device exhibits a high energy density of 43.17 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 374.98 W kg−1 and retains a very high energy density of 15.18 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 5972.9 W kg−1. More importantly, this device holds a long-term cycling stability, with ≈ 90.46 % capacity retention after 10,000 cycles at 1 A g−1. These results reveal high potential for making an ASC device with high energy and power densities for electronic applications.
