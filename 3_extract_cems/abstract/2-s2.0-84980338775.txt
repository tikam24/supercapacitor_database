The first step in automotive industry, to make the transition between internal combustion engines and electrical vehicles, was finding a method to make a hybridization of electrical sources. In this paper we propose to study the behavior of the batteries and supercapacitors on EV's, in different conditions of temperature in a pack of cell combined with supercapacitors sources. Considering that the autonomy of electrical vehicles is related to the cycle life of the electrical source, we are going to use the Simscape toolbox, to simulate the internal variations of temperature, current, voltage for to estimate the state of charge/discharge of a system consisting in a battery pack, made of lithium-ion and a supercapacitors. For battery model, several parameters must be taken into consideration, the rate of charging/discharging, internal resistance, resistive heat variations inside the cells, electrochemical polarization capacitance. Also a supercapacitor is very suitable for this kind of application since the main advantage is high power density, high charging speed and high cycling capability, which can lead to a high power source with very fast power source response and high specific power of supercapacitors which can be used to complement slower power output of the main source.
