Highly porous nanorod-PANI-Graphene composite films were prepared by in situ electrochemical polymerization onto an ITO substrate in a reverse micelle electrolyte. The morphology and microstructure of the composite films were analyzed by using a field emission scanning electron microscope. It was observed that the films were highly porous and the nanorod PANI films were inserted by graphene nanosheets. This indicated that a good conductive network between PANI nanorods and graphene sheets was formed. Further electrochemical tests involved cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 1 mol L-1 HClO 4 solution. The results showed that the composite film had a favorable capacitance with a high electron transfer rate and low resistance. The highest specific capacitance that could be achieved was as high as 878.57 F g-1 with the charge loading of 500 mC at a current density of 1 A g-1. The GCD at different charge loadings showed good cycle stability with a low fading rate of specific capacitance after 1000 cycles. The results demonstrated that the nanorod-PANI-Graphene composite was proved to be of great potential as an electrode material for supercapacitors. Â© 2012 the Owner Societies.
