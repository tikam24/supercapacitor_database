MWCNTs-PANi nanocomposite thin film has been prepared by using alternating current electrophoretic deposition (AC-EPD) technique. The AC-EPD technique is used in aqueous suspension to avoid damage film deposited caused by the decomposition of water. The frequency and the waveform used in EPD process were 1 kHz and rectangular signal respectively. AC electric field applied in EPD process produced a smooth deposit of MWCNTs and MWCNTs-PANi nanocomposite on nickel foils. The films produced also have been evaluated for its potential application of supercapacitor electrode. Results show AC-EPD is a promising technique for successful MWCNTs-PANi nanocomposite film deposition and its potential application as supercapacitor electrode.
