The present paper discusses the modeling and analysis of a diesel–wind generating system capable enough to cater to the electrical power requirements of a small consumer group or society. Due to high variations of the load demand or due to changes in the wind speed, the frequency of the diesel–wind system will be highly disturbed, and hence to regulate the frequency and power deviations of the wind turbine system, an effective controller design is a necessary requirement, and therefore this paper proposes a novel controller design based on PID scheme. The parameters of this controller is effectively optimized through a new snake optimizer (SO) in an offline manner to minimize frequency and power deviations of an isolated diesel–wind system. The performance of SO-PID for the diesel–wind system is evaluated by considering the integral of time multiplied absolute error (ITAE), integral absolute error (IAE), and integral of time multiplied square error (ITSE). The results were calculated for a step change in load, step change in wind speed, load change at different instants of time with diverse magnitude, and for random load patterns, and they were compared with some of the recently published results under similar working conditions. In addition, the effect of an ultracapacitor (UC) and redox flow battery (RFB) on SO-PID was investigated for the considered system, and the application results demonstrated the advantages of our proposal over other studied designs.
