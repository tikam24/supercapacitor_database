Zinc oxide/carbon (ZnO/C) composite is synthesized by self-propagating solution combustion method using dextrose as fuel and carbon source. By this method, carbon is added in-situ to the metal oxide. The powders are characterized by XRD, SEM, CHNS analysis and cyclic voltammetry. Electrochemical capacitive behavior of ZnO/C is studied in aqueous KNO3 solution. In dilute 0.1 M KNO3 solution, ZnO/C showed a specific capacitance of 21.7 Fg-1 at a scan rate of 50 mVs-1 and further increase in concentration of electrolyte solution decreased the electrochemical capacitances. A comparative evaluation of ZnO/C with pure nano ZnO (synthesized) and commercial ZnO (microsize particles) is also done. Â© 2008 by ESG.
