Graphene oxide (GO) powders have been synthesized via improved method (also called Tour's method) by varying concentration of H2O2 and the effect of H2O2 concentration on its properties has been studied extensively. The synthesized samples were characterized by XRD, TEM, Raman, FTIR and UVâ€“Vis. spectroscopy. The degree of oxidation level in the synthesized samples was estimated from obtained results and the fundamental aspects of correlation between their properties and the degree of oxidation is discussed exclusively. Our results demonstrate that the use of different concentrations of H2O2 can control the surface and molecular structures of GO, resulting in the tunable structural, optical and electrochemical properties which could be useful for supercapacitor applications.
