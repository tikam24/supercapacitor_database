In order to improve the fast dynamic response characteristic and the reliability of the converter, which is needed by the electric equipments, a new kind of control strategy for Buck/Boost converter with composite energy storage system is put forward using polynomial control method. The Boost work mode of 2-phase interleaving magnetic integration Buck/Boost converter is analyzed and the dynamic small signal modeling is built using perturbation method. Thus, the open-loop transfer function of Boost converter inductor current to the duty cycle is obtained. The corresponding polynomial energy management controller is designed and its parameters were tuned correctly. The results show that compared with the traditional PI control strategy, the polynomial control strategy can optimize energy and power distribution between the main power and auxiliary power supply, and can improve the system dynamic characteristic and the stability, which also contribute to the effective control of bidirectional conversion system.
