Abstract: The formation of nanocrystalline Co3O4 by chemical precipitation has been studied. The validation of the obtained semiproduct has been carried out using simultaneous thermal analysis, infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray powder diffraction analysis. The process of thermal decomposition of the semiproduct with the formation of the target oxide, which is a highly dispersed powder (the average CSR size was about 17 ± 2 nm), free of impurities has been investigated. An approach to microplotter printing of miniature planar Co3O4 nanostructures of different geometries on the surface of silicon substrates with the use of functional inks made on the basis of the obtained nanopowder has been proposed. The features of the morphology of the formed thin-film structures have been investigated. It is shown that there is practically no “coffee ring” effect. As part of the local electrophysical characteristics study of the obtained samples, the distribution maps of surface potential and capacitance contrast have been built, and the value of the electronic work function has been calculated. As a result of the study, the possibility of using the developed technology for the manufacturing of electrode structures Co3O4 for supercapacitors of planar type has been shown.
