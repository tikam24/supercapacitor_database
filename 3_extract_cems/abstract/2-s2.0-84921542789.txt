Hierarchical NiMoO4 architectures assembled from well-aligned uniform nanosheets or nanorods are successfully grown on various conductive substrates using a facile and effective general approach. Importantly, the nanostructures of NiMoO4 can be easily controlled to be nanosheets or nanorods by using different solvents. By virtue of their intriguing structure features, NiMoO4 nanosheets as integrated additive-free electrodes for supercapacitors manifest higher Faradaic capacitance than NiMoO4 nanorods. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is constructed using the as-prepared NiMoO4 nanosheets as the positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as the negative electrode. The optimized ASC with an extended operating voltage range of 0-1.7 V displays excellent electrochemical performance with a high energy density of 60.9 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 850 W kg-1 in addition to superior rate capability. Furthermore, the NiMoO4//AC ASC device exhibits remarkable cycling stability with 85.7% specifi c capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles. The results show that these NiMoO4-based nanostructures are promising for high-energy supercapacitors.
