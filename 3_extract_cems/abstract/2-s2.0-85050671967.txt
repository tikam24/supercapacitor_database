The lignin-based biochar/graphene composites were effectively obtained via an easy and rapid co-precipitation method. The chemical structure, microstructure, electrochemical properties of lignin/graphene oxide composites before and after carbonization were investigated by Fourier transformation infrared spectrum (FTIR), Scanning electron microscope (SEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). FTIR results confirmed that the oxygen-containing groups of lignin, GO and their composites were partly removed after 800 °C carbonization and GO had a positive impact on the formation of graphitic structure for lignin. XRD results showed that lignin could completely block the restacking of GO sheets. The electrochemical test presented that lignin/graphene oxide composites exhibited a typical CV curve and the specific capacitance reached ∼103F/g at a scan rate of 20mv/s.
