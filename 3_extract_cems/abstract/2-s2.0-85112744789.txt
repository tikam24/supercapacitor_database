A heterogeneous photocatalyst exhibits more significant potential for the conversion of photon energy into chemical energy. In this work, we have been successfully synthesized multifunctional heterogeneous photocatalyst bismuth tungstate (Bi2WO6) nanoparticles by solution combustion route employing jackfruit extract as fuel. Structural characteristics of nanoparticles were investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR), and UV–Visible (UV–Vis) spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. In contrast, surface morphologies were studied by SEM analysis. Further, the material's bandgap was found to be 2.8 eV, indicating the semiconducting nature of prepared nanoparticles. The Bi2WO6 nanoparticles were subjected to photoluminescence, photocatalytic, antioxidant activity, and it has also been used to detect Dopamine at the tracer level and act as stimulating electrode material for supercapacitors. Furthermore, we also report that Bi2WO6 nanoparticles are an efficient heterogeneous photocatalyst for the degradation of industrial dye in polluted water under visible light irradiation.
