Nanorods/fibers, nanosheet and nano-flower like structure were effectively synthesized from sulphur-reduced graphene oxide (RGO-S) and sulphur-reduced graphene oxide/manganese dioxide (RGO-S/MnO2) composites for supercapacitor applications. Structural, chemical composition and morphological analysis reveal an effective synthesis of the RGO-S and RGO-S/MnO2 composite. Electrochemical measurements of the optimized mass loading of MnO2 on RGO-S in a three electrode configurations revealed a specific capacitance of 180.4 F g−1 compared to 75.2 F g−1 of the pristine sample at 1 A g−1 in 2.5 M KNO3 electrolyte. An assembled asymmetric device consists of optimized RGO-S/MnO2 as positive electrode and activated carbon from peanut shell (AC-PS) as a negative electrode delivered a high specific energy of 71.74 Wh kg−1 with its corresponding specific power of 850 W kg−1 at 1 A g−1. It was observed that even at high specific current of 5 A g−1 the device was able to maintain a specific energy of 55.30 Wh kg−1. An excellent stability with capacitance retention of 94.5% and columbic efficiency of 99.6% up to 10, 000 cycles was recorded for the device at 5 A g−1. The device demonstrated a very good stability after being subjected to a voltage holding of up to 90 h and an outstanding self-discharge of about 1.45 V was recorded within the first 10 h and 1.00 V after 72 h from its maximum potential of 1.7 V.
