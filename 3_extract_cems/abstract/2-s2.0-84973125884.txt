This paper deals with the energy management problem of a Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) with Supercapacitor (SC) hybrid system. An innovative Interconnection and Damping Assignment Passivity-based Controller (IDA-PBC) with multi-equilibrium states is proposed in this paper. The hybrid system is first modeled as a Port-controlled Hamiltonian (PCH) system by considering the PEMFC and the SC as external voltage signals. Moreover, the IDA-PBC is designed using the techniques of energy shaping and damping injection, and the multi-equilibrium states of the hybrid system in different operating modes are analyzed. Simulation studies are carried out in Matlab/Simulink software to validate the proposed control strategy. The results show that the proposed IDA-PBC with multi-equilibrium states optimally balances power flow distribution in the hybrid system and ensures the stability of the hybrid system in different operating modes.
