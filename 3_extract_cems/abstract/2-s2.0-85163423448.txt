As the climate crisis intensifies, the development of zero-waste biorefineries, which fully utilize all biomass components for value-added fuels, materials, and chemicals, has gained momentum. Traditional biorefineries primarily employ cellulosic and hemicellulosic elements of biomass as carbon sources for microbial fermentation. However, utilizing biorefinery waste, including lignin (i.e., residual biomass), poses a significant challenge for achieving a circular bioeconomy due to its recalcitrance. Exploring innovative approaches for utilizing residual biomass is crucial to address this issue. This review examines the potential of biomass-derived electrode materials for energy storage devices (ESDs). We introduce suitable biomass sources for electrode fabrication and discuss the requirements of electrode materials for ESDs. Furthermore, we delve into recent advances in biomass-derived supercapacitors, lithium-ion, and sodium-ion batteries. The findings presented in this review offer valuable insights for fostering a low-carbon circular bioeconomy and improving our response to the climate crisis.
