Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-assisted Bi25FeO40 microcubes have been synthesized through hydrothermal technique and the effect of morphology on the electrochemical energy storage and energy conversion is investigated. The crystalline structure, phase, morphology, and quantum states of the samples are characterized and analyzed by X-ray diffraction, Raman Spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively. According to galvanostatic charge–discharge results, 7 wt% PVP in Bi25FeO40 has a greater specific capacitance of 232 F g−1 at 4 A g−1 and a maximum capacitive retention of 84% after 1000 cycles. The synthesized samples are also utilized as a counter electrode (CE) for Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs) against the TiO2/N719/iodolyte redox pair. The Cyclic Voltammetry, Tafel polarization, and electrochemical impedance spectra of the Bi25FeO40 CEs are described in depth, as are their electrocatalytic activity. It is discovered that Bi25FeO40 is not only a viable supercapacitor candidate, but also an option for CE in DSSCs. The energy conversion and storage characteristics of Bi25FeO40 are essential for the future development of photo-integrated supercapacitors.
