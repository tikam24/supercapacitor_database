In the present work, a new strategy is proposed to simultaneously enhance the toughness and electrochemical performance of the hydrogel with conductive microgel to form microgel-reinforced double network hydrogel. In this hydrogel, the conductive microgel is cross-linked to form the first network, which can dissipate energy to improve mechanical performance and stabilize the conductive network to improve the electrochemical performance. These hydrogels show excellent mechanical properties and good conductivity. When these hydrogels are assembled to all-gel-state intrinsically flexible and stretchable supercapacitor, they deliver outstanding capacitance. The strategy put forward here can extend the application scope of the hydrogel with multifunction.
