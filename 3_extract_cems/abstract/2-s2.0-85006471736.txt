The study focuses on the materials and small supercapacitor cells manufactured in the first period of AUTOSUPERCAP project. The supercapacitor cells presented in this paper are of the type of symmetrical, electrochemical double layer capacitor (EDLC) cells with organic electrolyte TEABF4 dissolved in propylene carbonate (PC) or acetonitrile (AN). Different active electrode materials have been investigated, including novel activated carbon, graphene and carbon nanotubes produced in this project, as well as combinations of these materials. Supercapacitor cells of 2â€“4 cm2 area were fabricated and tested in impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and charge-discharge tests. Ragone plots of energy density against power density were constructed from the charge-discharge test data at different current densities. Furthermore, the results of a cost analysis are presented for the main types of supercapacitors investigated.
