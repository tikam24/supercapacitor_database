In this work, NiO/ZnO nanocomposites with different Ni/Zn ratio are grown on nickel foam by a hydrothermal and subsequent calcination process. The nanocomposites have sheet-like morphology, and the size of the nanosheets varies with the change of Ni/Zn ratio. The NiO/ZnO nanocomposits can be used as electrode material for supercapacitors. The specific capacitances of NiO/ZnO nanocomposits are higher than NiO and ZnO alone, and the NiO/ZnO nanocomposits with a Ni/Zn ratio of 3:2 show the highest specific capacitance. This work demonstrates that the construction of binary oxide nanocomposites is a strategy to develop high performance supercapacitor electrode materials.
