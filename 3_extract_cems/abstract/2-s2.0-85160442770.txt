In this research study, the triplumbic tetroxide (Pb3O4)/tricobalt tetroxide (Co3O4) nanocomposites (NCs) were synthesized by using the modified process of inverse microemulsion for electrochemical applications. The cyclic voltammetry results indicated that the NCs exhibited excellent results in terms of the capacitance (with the highest specific capacitance and energy density values of 892.01 F g−1 and 60.70 W h g−1 respectively) for electrochemical applications. Moreover, after 4000 cycles, more than 89% capacitance was sustained for Pb3O4/Co3O4 composite representing their excellent stability. The enhanced supercapacitive properties of these NCs were ascribed to the development of the nanomaterials having a high surface area to volume ratio, enhanced conductivities, and good specific capacitance values acquired by modulating the Co3O4 content in the NCs.
