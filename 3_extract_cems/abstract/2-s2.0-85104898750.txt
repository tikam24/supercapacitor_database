Polypyrrole (PPy) was deposited onto carbon fiber felt (CFF) by in-situ polymerization to prepare CFF/PPy composite textile as free-standing and flexible electrode for supercapacitor. Electrochemical performance was characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance (EIS) and constant current charge-discharge technology. The results show that the doping of organic sulfonic acid further improved the electrochemical performance of electrode materials. Areal capacitance, energy density and power density of the CFF/PPy/TsOH are as high as 5943 mF·cm−2, 1739 µWh·cm−2, 1450 µW·cm−2, respectively (at a current density of 0.8 mA·cm−2). Overall, this flexible textile electrode is promising to be used as wearable electronic device.
