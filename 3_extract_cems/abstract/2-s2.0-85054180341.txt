Carbon dots-doped polyaniline nanotubes (CDs@PANI-0.5 T) have been synthesized under an applied magnetic field (MF) of 0.5 T. Not only the applied MF has improved the morphology, crystallinity, and conductivity of PANI nanotubes, but also the doped CDs with large specific surface area increase the electron mobility and electron density of the PANI nanotubes. Which eventually reduce both the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and internal resistance (Rs) of the electrode materials, and thus enhance the supercapacitance behavior of the electrodes. The supercapacitor assembled from CDs@PANI-0.5 T electrodes shows a superior specific capacitance, high energy density, and cycle stability to control samples of PANI-0.5 T, CDs@PANI-0 T, and PANI-0 T.
