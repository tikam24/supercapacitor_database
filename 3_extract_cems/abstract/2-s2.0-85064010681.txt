Sodium was used as reductant to break the C-Cl bond and C-H bond in the solvent, trichloroethane(C2H3Cl3) and dichloroethane(C2H4Cl2), under solvothermal condition(100-150℃) to prepare carbon nano-spheres(CNSs). The X-ray diffraction pattern shows that the sample has a graphite-like structure. The diffraction signal of the sample is wide and weak, indicating that the sample has a poor crystallinity and an amorphous structure. The Raman spectra shows that the sample has a relative high degree of disorder. The results of SEM and TEM show that the CNSs have better monodispersion at higher reaction temperatures. The particle size of the CNSs increases with increasing temperature, and the results of electron diffraction in the selected area indicate that the CNSs are internally amorphous graphite structure. The results of the lithium-ion battery test using the CNSs as the negative electrode material show that the specific capacity after 50 cycles is 941 mA•h/g, and the Coulomb efficiency is close to 100%, the discharge capacity retention rate is 103.7%, indicating that the CNSs have good cycle stability. The performance of CNSs prepared at different temperatures as supercapacitor material was tested. The CNSs prepared under 120℃ show higher specific capacitance and lower internal resistance. The specific capacitance is up to 130 F/g. The attenuation of specific capacitance is less than 14% after 1000 cycles, which shows higher stability.
