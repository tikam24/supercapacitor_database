In this work, CoSe2/carbonized foam hybrids are fabricated. The effects of selenization temperature on the composition and morphology of CoSe2/carbonized foam hybrids are investigated. Results show that the selenization temperature affects the particle size of CoSe2 and the resulting electrochemical performance. And the sample obtained at 900Â°C shows good properties as supercapacitor electrode material. Even after 5000 cycles, 132.8 % of the initial specific capacitance can be remained. The outstanding stability may be ascribed to its unique morphology and carbon skeleton.
