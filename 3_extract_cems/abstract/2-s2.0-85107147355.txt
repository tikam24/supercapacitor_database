Hybrid supercapacitors, due to the synergistic effect of each composition, show higher specific capacitance and improved cycle stability compared with most traditional supercapacitors. In this work, multicomponent compound NiCo pyrophosphate/nitrogen doped carbon (NiCoPN/C) is elaborately designed and applied as the electrode for hybrid supercapacitors. The obtained sample possesses a hierarchically porous structure with surface area of up to 341.7 m2 g−1. In the electrochemical test, the sample gives a specific capacitance of 1240 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1. The asymmetric supercapacitor NiCoPN/C-5//AC exhibits a high specific energy of 44.68 W h kg−1 when specific power is 715 W kg−1. After 10000 cycles, the specific capacitance retention of the capacitor remains at 83.7%.
