In this article, Mn3O4 nanoparticles are prepared directly on a commercial high conductive carbon black (CB) to form a Mn3O4/carbon black composite (Mn3O4/CB) by a chemical synthesis method. The TEM results indicate that the microstructure of the Mn3O4 nanoparticles in the Mn3O4/CB composite is in good order, and they are distributed on the surface of carbon black uniformly. The electrochemical properties revealed from the rectangularity of the cyclic-voltammogram loops of the composite electrode are satisfactory. These results indicate the almost-ideal capacitive behavior of the Mn3O4/CB composite. The electrochemical tests indicate that the specific capacitance of the Mn3O4/CB composites reaches 720 F/g at the current density of 0.1 A/g in 2 M Na2SO4 solution, which is approximately 4.36 times than that of the pristine Mn3O4 (165 F/g). The Mn3O4/CB composite electrode shows excellent capacity retention (91.6%) after 5000 cycles at the current density of 30 A/g.
