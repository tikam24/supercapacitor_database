Graphene nanosheet/carbon nanotube/polyaniline (GNS/CNT/PANI) composite is synthesized via in situ polymerization. GNS/CNT/PANI composite exhibits the specific capacitance of 1035 F g-1 (1 mV s-1) in 6 M of KOH, which is a little lower than GNS/PANI composite (1046 F g-1), but much higher than pure PANI (115 F g-1) and CNT/PANI composite (780 F g-1). Though a small amount of CNTs (1 wt.%) is added into GNS, the cycle stability of GNS/CNT/PANI composite is greatly improved due to the maintenance of highly conductive path as well as mechanical strength of the electrode during doping/dedoping processes. After 1000 cycles, the capacitance decreases only 6% of initial capacitance compared to 52% and 67% for GNS/PANI and CNT/PANI composites. Â© 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
