This article presents a new modular dc-dc converter topology. As a modular topology, the converter can be used for several energy sources. Each converter module is based on a three-level dc-dc converter, which contains two output capacitors. The first module shares the second capacitor in common with the first capacitor of the next module. In this way, the N-module can be utilized for an N-energy source. The output capacitor voltages are balanced due to the proposed topology and the controller. The controller is based on the indirect sliding mode controller, where the input current of each energy source and the capacitor voltage balancing are taken into account. One of the aims of this article was to obtain the general system relationships for the N-module system. The process of obtaining recurrence equations for the duty cycles of the system is provided for the desired number of modules. Simulation and experimental results are provided to validate the topology.
