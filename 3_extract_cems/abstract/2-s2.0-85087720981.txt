MnFe2O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are prepared by simple chemical oxidation method with optimized experimental conditions. The particle size is reduced by introducing the ferric ions as a size reducing agent during the chemical reaction. The saturation magnetization of the MnFe2O4 MNPs are tuned between 45 and 67 emu/g. The shift in the particle size distribution is confirmed from the transmission electron microscope (TEM) micrograph. The highest specific capacitance of 415 F/g is achieved for the smaller sized MnFe2O4 MNPs prepared with higher concentration of ferric ions. The results suggest that the ferric ions could be used for the size control of ferrites through chemical oxidation method and the sized reduced MnFe2O4 MNPs could be a suitable choice for the electrochemical supercapacitor applications.
