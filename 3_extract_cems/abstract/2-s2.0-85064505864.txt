Nickel-cobalt oxide as a class of transition metal oxide has been extensively recognized as an excellent pseudocapacitive material for supercapacitor due to its high specific capacitance and good rate capability compared with single components. Herein, porous rod-like NiCo2O4 nanostructures have been obtained through water-glycol mixed solvothermal method with subsequent calcination treatment. The as-prepared NiCo2O4 electrode materials exhibit high specific capacitance of 417.1 C g−1 at 1 A g−1, high capacitance retention of 73.4% ranging from 1 to 10 A g−1, and excellent cycling stability with 130% (340.9 C g−1 at 10 A g−1) of initial capacitance after 10,000 cycles. These outstanding performances reveal that NiCo2O4 nanorods can be considered as promising candidates in the field of energy storage.
