The high-crystalline perovskite oxide BaMnO3 particles were synthesized by a simple solid-state reaction, followed by high-energy ball milling to study the particle size dependence for supercapacitor electrodes. The specific capacitance of nano-sized BaMnO3 is approximately seven times higher than that of micro-sized BaMnO3. The micro-sized BaMnO3 have a rice-like nanostructure transition that enhances its specific capacitance up to 1300% and tends to increase after 3000 cycles. This suggests a cost-effective and simple technique for high performance perovskite-based supercapacitor electrodes by achieving the desired performance.
