Standard fabrication of soft electronic devices with both high controllability and yield is highly desirable but remains a challenge due to the modulus mismatch of component materials through a one-step process. Here, by mimicking the freeze-section process of multicomponent biological tissues containing low-modulus muscles and high-modulus bones, for the first time, a hydrogel cryo-microtomy method to continuously making soft electronic devices based on a sol-solid-gel transition mechanism is presented. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) electrolyte and aligned nitrogen-doped multi-walled carbon nanotube (N-MWCNT) array electrode are demonstrated as low- and high-modulus components to fabricate soft supercapacitors with high performances. Stable interfaces form between frozen PVA electrolyte and N-MWCNT electrodes with matched moduli at subzero temperature and are well maintained during cryo-microtomy process. The resulting soft supercapacitors realize controllable patterns, tunable thicknesses from 0.5 to 600 Î¼m, high yields such as 20 devices per minute even at lab scale, and high reproducibility with over 75% devices in 15% performance fluctuation. This cryo-microtomy method is further generalized to fabricate other soft devices such as sensors with high sensing properties.
