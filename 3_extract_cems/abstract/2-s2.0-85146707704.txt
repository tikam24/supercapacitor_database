In this paper, a novel high-performance active switched quasi-Z-Source inverter (HP-AS-qZSI) dual-source for fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle (FC-HEV) is proposed. In order to eliminate extra dc-dc converters, dual-energy sources based on FC and lithium-ion capacitors (LiCs) are integrated into the Z-source network (ZSN). By adding an anti-parallel power switch, the proposed topology enables to deal with the uncontrollable and distorted dc-link voltages in FCEV applications-based broad-range of loads over the traditional AS-qZSI. The modeling and the operation modes analysis are firstly presented. Real-time simulation based on Opal-RT is then implemented to validate the operation and performance of the proposed topology. As a result, it provides a higher average efficiency (3.06%) and lower component size and volume of passive elements for the EV system. Furthermore, this topology also indicates improved aging performance indexes of high specific-energy sources under the studied Artemis-long driving cycle, compared to the hybrid energy storage system conventional two-stage inverter.
