Highly active polypyrrole electrodes for redox supercapacitors were prepared by electrodeposition on Ti foil via cyclic voltammetry at a scan rate of 200 mV/s in oxalic acid solution and subsequently characterized in 1 M KCl. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the polypyrrole has a highly porous nanostructure leading to a very high specific capacitance of about 480 ± 50 F/g. The electrode exhibted a high stability during cycle life test. The effects of the mass of polypyrrole electrode materials on the specific capacitance were also investigated. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.
