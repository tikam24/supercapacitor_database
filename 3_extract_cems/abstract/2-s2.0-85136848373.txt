Electric double layer capacitors can be used in broad applications, including portable electronics, high power tools, and transportation. However, such systems require more sustainable materials and a boosting of their electrochemical performance. In this study, starfish, as an unusable destroyer of marine ecosystems, are transformed into functional nitrogen-doped carbon materials with high porosity toward high-performance EDLC electrodes. The synthesized starfish-derived carbon exhibits a surface area of up to 3122 m2 g-1, a specific capacitance of up to 295.7 F g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1, and capacitance retention of 81.5% upon an increase in current density from 0.5 to 10 A g-1.
