Hydroxides produced from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) offer a promising platform for high performance as supercapacitor electrode materials. By alkalinizing the precursor MoS2/MnNi-MOF-74, a novel MoS2/manganese-nickel double hydroxide (MoS2/MnNiDH) with a spindle shape has been successfully prepared. The composite material MoS2/MnNiDH exhibits a high specific capacitance of 2194.4 F/g at 1 A/g, and good capacity retention of 87.1% after 5000 charge/discharge cycles in a three-electrode system. Impressively, an asymmetric supercapacitor (MoS2/MnNiDH//AC, ASC) delivers a high energy density of 56.1 Wh/kg at the power density of 931.0 W/kg and more remarkable cycling stability retention of 95.0% after 10000 cycles in a two-electrode system. Finally, two assembled ASC connected in series can keep a blue LED blazing for more than 10 min, demonstrating that the MoS2/MnNiDH is a promising electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.
