We have prepared nanocomposite films of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and nickel cobalt oxide quantum dots (NCO-QDs) by chemical method, and these are represented by NCO-rGO. Different nanocomposite films have been formed by varying the ratio of NCO-QDs and rGO. The obtained value of the specific capacitance of the nanocomposite (NCO5-rGO1.5) is 265 F g−1 (260 C g−1) at 0.73 A g−1 which is much higher than rGO alone (96 F g−1 at 0.33 A g−1). As the asymmetric/hybrid configuration also enhances the potential window, so in this work, we have fabricated an asymmetric supercapacitor with NCO5-rGO1.5 as the positive electrode and rGO as a negative electrode using 1 M Na2SO4, neutral aqueous solution, as the electrolyte. The assembled supercapacitor delivered the specific capacitance value of 131 F g−1 (197 C g−1) at an energy density of 47 W h kg−1 and a power density of 631 W kg−1 within a wide potential window of 1.6 V. The potential window of the device can be extended up to 2.4 V, but in that case, its coulombic efficiency decreases. The device retains a specific capacitance of 69% after 1000 cycles of charge-discharge. Also, a solid-state device has been fabricated, which displays a potential of 3.4 V after charging 20 s. All these results may prove fruitful for the design of high energy density supercapacitors in the future.
