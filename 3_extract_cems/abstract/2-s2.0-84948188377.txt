A Ni(OH)2/Vulcan XC-72 (XC-72) composite has been synthesized by a microwave assisted method; it demonstrated a high specific capacitance of 1560 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 with carbon nanotubes as conductive agents. Ni(OH)2/XC-72, activated carbon (AC) and non-woven fabric were, respectively, used as a positive electrode, a negative electrode and a separator to assemble an asymmetric supercapacitor. This AC//Ni(OH)2/XC-72 supercapacitor achieves a remarkable capacitance of 92.2 F g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1, a maximum energy density of 36 W h kg-1 and a power density of 490 W kg-1 based on an active material in a 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte with a negative/positive electrode mass ratio of 1.75 within a voltage window of 1.6 V. Furthermore, the capacitance of the unit supercapacitor remains 85% after 1000 charging-discharging cycles. These results indicate that the AC//Ni(OH)2/XC-72 supercapacitor is promising to be applied in a practical device for energy storage.
