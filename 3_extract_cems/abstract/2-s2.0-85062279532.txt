Nickel cobalt sulfide is widely applied to energy storage and electrocatalysis owing to its high electrical conductivity and multiple oxidation states. This study proposes NiCo 2 S 4 and NiCo 2 O x S y @NiMoO 4 core-shell structures as energy storage materials and electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction. A higher specific capacity of 2.22 mA h cm -2 (168.18 mA h g -1 ) at 10 mA cm -2 is obtained for the NiCo 2 O x S y @NiMoO 4 electrode which is applied as the battery-type electrode in the battery supercapacitor hybrid, but a better electrocatalytic activity is achieved for the NiCo 2 S 4 electrode with a smaller overpotential of 1.567 V RHE at 0.12 A cm -2 and a smaller Tafel slope of 86.1 mV dec -1 . The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) is larger for NiCo 2 S 4 due to the nanoparticle-assembled nanotube wall, whereas NiCo 2 O x S y @NiMoO 4 shows higher electrical conductivity owing to the presence of molybdenum. Different performances in energy storage and electrocatalysis for NiCo 2 S 4 and NiCo 2 O x S y @NiMoO 4 nanomaterials are caused by different potentials applied for driving the electrochemical reactions. This study for the first time proves that the trade-off between ECSA and electrical conductivity is important for designing nanomaterials applied in different electrochemical fields.
