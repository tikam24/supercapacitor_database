An electrical double-layer capacitor (EDLC) is a device that stores energy through interfacial electrostatic adsorption between the electrolyte ions and the charges present on the porous carbon electrode. The molecular mechanism of charge storage is critical to achieve rational designed device yet it is still less understood due to the complex pore structure of carbon materials used in such devices. In this study, we have selected activated microwave expanded graphene oxide (AMEGO) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) as the electrode material due to their promising EDLC performance and abundant pore structure, to investigate the effect of pore structure on the ion transport process by electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) analysis. The mass changes of the carbon electrodes were acquired simultaneously during the electrochemical charge-discharge process. The electrode mass change with respect to the stored charge indicates that ion transport in RGO that contains only pores of diameters >1 nm (or mesopores) follows the ion-exchange model, while ion transport in AMEGO includes the ion-exchange model happening in the mesopores, which is superimposed with the counter-ion-adsorption model occurring in the subnanopores (<1 nm).
