The exploration of advanced electrode materials with high specific capacitance is of considerable crucial for supercapacitors but need to be further explored. In this article, nickel sulfide (NiS) nanocrystals decorated carbon quantum dots (CQDs), assisted with the active agent of hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), are rationally designed and successfully synthesized by a facile and simple hydrothermal method. As supercapacitor electrode material, the resulting nonomaterials of NiS-CQDs with the presence of CTAB exhibit a high specific capacitance of 1956 F/g at a current density of 1 A g−1 and a remarkable rate capability of 57% at 8 A g−1, much higher than that of the NiS, NiS-CQDs and NiS(CTAB) samples. The enhanced electrochemical performance of NiS-CQDs(CTAB) eletrode should be ascribed to the synergistic effect with the CQDs and CTAB.
