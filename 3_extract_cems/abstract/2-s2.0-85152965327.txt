In this research, a double laser pyrolysis method was used to create nitrogen and phosphorus co-doped laser-stimulated graphene. This method has proven to be both versatile and cost-effective. There was a significant impact on the Graphene – Laser Induced Nitrogen(N) and Phosphorous(P) Graphene performance, dopant absorption, and laser power. In the N and P -Laser Induced Graphene (LIG) optimized with 3 wt% Si (OH)4 and laser power of 3.6 W (Nitrogen and Phosphorous – Laser induced graphene-3.6), a specific areal capacitance (CA) of 165.8 mF/cm2 was achieved in the next pyrolysis process, while 1 M H2SO4 is employed as dissolved electrolyte. LIG-NP demonstrated a capacitance of 70.1 mF/cm2 at a density of 0.6 mA/cm2, which is four times and 16 times more than that of N-doped LIG and single pyrolyzed LIG NPs, respectively, using a gel electrolyte. Cycling stability was good (capacitance retention of 84%), Coulombic efficiency was around 100%, and area energy density was 9.67 N/cm2 with 10,000 cycles. Flexible and wearable electronics could benefit from a simple fabrication method for heteroatom-coated LIG electrodes.
