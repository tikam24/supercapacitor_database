To improve technical and economic characteristics of storage systems, a new approach is proposed. It consists in development of a hybrid storage, using both an accumulator battery and a battery of supercapacitors. A hybrid energy storage (HES) system is proposed to ensure stable and steady operation of decentralized and non-conventional sources of energy operating both autonomously and within power systems. The hybrid power storage system with rated power of 200 kW and energy capacity of 200 kWh was developed and tested. A bench was developed to test power storages with capacity of up to several megawatts. A set of hybrid power storage tests was carried out, in process of which additional advantages of using the hybrid system were discovered:-accumulator battery charge and discharge current is characterized by smooth rise and drop compared to its operation without supercapacitors. This favorably impacts the system of balancing (voltage rectification) of battery cells;-the opportunity to implement a short-term forced mode of the storage with power output, which is twice higher compared to the rated power, was proven. It was shown that hybrid energy storage systems are quite an effective regulation facility for MV and HV grids to cover peak loads with duration of up to 1 hour, as they provide a quick response to disturbances of different types and functional flexibility in compensation of strong fluctuations of frequency, active and reactive power. Impact of hybrid energy storage systems at operation of power systems and microgrids was evaluated.
