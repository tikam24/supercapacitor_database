The fuel cell is generally coupled with the hybrid energy storage system (HESS) to improve power system dynamic performance and prolong the fuel cell lifetime. Therefore, the sizing of HESS and design of energy management strategy (EMS) have already become key research points. Based on support vector machine and frequency control, a novel EMS is proposed. As the sizing of HESS and the design of energy management strategy have a strong inner link, a multi-objective optimization method for the HESS and EMS is proposed. After that, simulations are used to compare the performance of the optimal hybrid power system. Compared with the different hybrid power system structures, the optimal HESS can meet power demand and reduce the cost of the energy storage device. Compared with the rule-based energy management strategy, the energy consumption of the optimal hybrid power system reduces 5.4%, and improves power quality and prolongs the device life. The results indicate that the proposed method can achieve excellent performance and is easily applied.
