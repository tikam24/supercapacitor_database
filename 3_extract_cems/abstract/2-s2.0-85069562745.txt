Li2TiO3/Ni foam composites were prepared by a solid-state reaction process. They crystallized in the monoclinic Li2TiO3 structure with C2/c space group. SEM images show that the Li2TiO3 particles are monodispersed crystallites of average size 49 nm, infused into porous scaffold Ni foam. As an anode in lithium battery, the composite delivered a discharge capacity of 153 mAh g−1 in an aqueous electrolyte and retained 95% of its initial capacity after 30 cycles. Moreover, the Li2TiO3/Ni foam composite as a negative electrode of pseudo-supercapacitor delivered a specific capacitance of 593 F g−1 and retained 95% of its initial capacitance after 1000 cycles. The enhanced capacity of Li2TiO3/Ni composite is due to porous scaffold Ni foam, which provides high conductivity to the Li2TiO3 particles and high effective surface area for redox reactions. The performance of the Li2TiO3/Ni foam as an electrode material for both lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and supercapacitors (SCs) shows that this composite is promising for energy storage devices.
