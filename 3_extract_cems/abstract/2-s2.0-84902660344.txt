Three-dimensional (3D) Co3O4-Ni3(VO 4)2 heterostructured nanorods on nickel foam with excellent electrochemical behavior were synthesized by a facile strategy. A growth mechanism was proposed to explain the formation of the composite. The composite combined separately the advantages of the good rate capability of Co3O4 and the high specific capacitances of Ni 3(VO4)2, and showed higher specific capacitances than Co3O4 and better rate capability than Ni3(VO4)2. A maximum specific capacitance of 1401 F g-1 and energy density of 31.2 Wh kg-1 were achieved at a current density of 0.5 A g-1, and 70.3% of this value was retained at a high current density of 8 A g-1. After 1000 cycles, 98.3% and 90.9% was retained at 0.5 A g-1 and 8 A g-1, respectively. The excellent electrochemical performance renders the composite a promising electrode for supercapacitors.
