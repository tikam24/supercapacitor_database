This report shows the inexpensive synthesis of in-situ evolution of NiO nanosheets on 3D-Ni-foam as an outstanding binder-free and self-supported electrode for supercapacitors. The NiO//NiO supercapacitor shows a high specific capacitance (159.3F g−1) at 6.7 A g−1, energy density (22.1 W h kg−1), and excellent power density (15250 W kg−1). It unfolds superb stability (93.9%) after 10,000 GCD cycles and (95.4%) after 14 h voltage holding tests (VHTs). Also, it shows a low leakage current of 0.09 mA during 2 h VHTs.
