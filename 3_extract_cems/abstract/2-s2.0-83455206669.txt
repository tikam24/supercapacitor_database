Mohanty Pravansu examines in-situ plasma synthesis and deposition platform for energy storage devices. To address these issues, the Additive Manufacturing Process Laboratory of the University of Michigan-Dearborn developed a plasma/laser in-situ synthesis and deposition technology, which offers a high speed, cost effective and scalable 'platform' approach to the synthesis of supercapacitor components, battery components, and novel Li-ion cell architectures. Porosity is required in film based electrodes to facilitate facile diffusion of ions during the electrochemical oxidation and reduction processes. This porous microstructure, uniformly enriched with fine-sized nanopartides and readily altered to meet specific application demands, is one of the many unique advantages of this solution-based plasma spray approach. The University of Michigan's Office of Technology Transfer recently licensed this promising technology platform to CSquared Innovations Inc., a startup company launched by Pravansu Mohanty and colleagues from the University of Michigan.
