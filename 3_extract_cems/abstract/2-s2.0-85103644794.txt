Through a simple two-step solvothermal method, MgCo2O4@MMoO4 (M = Co, Ni) nanosheet arrays were grown on nickel foam. In a 1 M KOH aqueous solution, the two battery-type electrode materials showed high specific capacities up to 1089.94 and 1111.57 C g-1 at a current density of 1 mA cm-2. When these battery-type electrode materials are applied to ASC devices, they exhibit high specific capacity, stable cycle life, and high energy density. The excellent electrochemical performance of the MgCo2O4@MMoO4 electrode material is due to the reasonable combination of MgCo2O4 and MMoO4, so that the electrochemically active site of the electrolyte-electrode interface is greatly increased. At the same time, the morphology and thickness of the MMoO4 layer also affect the penetration of the electrolyte solution and the electron/ion transport process. Practical application of these materials in the field of electrochemical energy storage has great prospect.
