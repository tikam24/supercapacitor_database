Solar electrical energy has been collecting a big power in countries' energy. The most difficult problem of solar PV is the sudden changes in power due to cloud cover, power changes in the shape of a 'mountain' during the day, so it causes difficulties in power loss and overload of the transformer, so the difficulty in stable operation of the solar power system is not small. Currently, countries are restricting the installation of more solar power plants because there are no effective measures of the power to keep stabilization of voltage and frequency. In this time, it is necessary to operate the generating capacity of solar PV in a reasonable manner to ensure the interests of solar power plants, and at the same time ensure the stabilization of power distribution on the grid. This paper presents a study on the application of sliding mode fuzzy logic control to control storage of the supercapacitor and battery energy stored system (CBESS) of solar power plants, which always change power by problems caused by outside. This is the current situation of countries' solar networks in order to meet the requirements set forth. The simulation results confirm that the optimization of the control algorithm is appropriate and has practical applicability
