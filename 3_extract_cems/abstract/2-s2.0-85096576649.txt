Bimetallic transition metal sulfides (TMSs) are one class of promising electrode materials that have attracted wide attention for energy storage applications. Herein, we have presented a moderate and efficient synthetic methodology to rationally design and construct hierarchical honeycomb-like manganese cobalt sulfide nanosheets (MnCo2S4 NSs) as integrated cathodes for hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs). The anion-exchange process performed in the sulfidation reaction has significantly improved the electrochemical performance of the MnCo2S4 NSs, resulting in a superior areal capacity of 0.837 mA h cm−2 at 3 mA cm−2, a superb rate capability, and an admirable cycling lifespan with 92.3% of the initial capacity retained after 10,000 cycles. Moreover, MnCo2S4 NSs are directly used as integrated cathode and iron oxide particles encapsulated in reduced graphene oxide (Fe2O3@rGO) is employed as the anode to assemble the HSC. The as-assembled MnCo2S4 NSs//Fe2O3@rGO HSC delivers a superb energy density of 61.4 Wh kg−1 with an admirable cycling lifespan of 90.4% of capacity retention after 10,000 cycles. Besides, two HSC modules connected in series can power a homemade light-emitting diode (LED) device for 23 min, highlighting its potential practical prospects in energy storage systems.
