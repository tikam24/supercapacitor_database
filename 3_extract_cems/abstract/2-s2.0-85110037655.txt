In this paper, we propose for the first time the synthesis of α-MoO3 nanorods in a one-step procedure at mild temperatures. By changing the growth parameters, the microstructure and controllable morphology of the resulting products can be customized. The average diameter of the as-prepared nanorods is about 200 nm. The electrochromic and capacitance properties of the synthesized products were studied. The results show that the electrochromic properties of α-MoO3 nanorods at 550 nm have 67% high transmission contrast, good cycle stability and fast response time. The MoO3 nanorods also exhibit a stable supercapacitor performance with 98.5% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles. Although current density varies sequentially, the nanostructure always exhibits a stable capacitor to maintain 100%. These results indicate the as-prepared MoO3 nanorods may be good candidates for applications in electrochromic devices and supercapacitors.
