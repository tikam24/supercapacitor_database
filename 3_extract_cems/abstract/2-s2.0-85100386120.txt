To meet the requirement of modern society, supercapacitors with long cycle life and excellent energy density are urgently required. Herein, a facile electrodeposition method was used to fabricate a suite of coral-like nickel cobalt hydroxysulfide nanosheet arrays (NiCo-SOH) on nickel foam (NF), which was expected to be a binder-free positive electrode for supercapacitors. NiCo-SOH (Ni:Co=1:1) nanosheets with layered double hydroxides structure display an excellent specific capacitance and superior rate capability (2092.7 F·g−1 at 1 A·g−1; 1696 F·g−1 at 10 A·g−1). Moreover, a NiCo-SOH (Ni:Co=1:1) electrode and active carbon (AC) was utilized to fabricate an asymmetric supercapacitor, which exhibits remarkable cyclic stability (98% capacitance retention after 9000 cycles) and excellent energy density of 34.3 W·h·kg−1. The considerable electrochemical performances and the ease of large-scale production make electrodeposited nickel cobalt hydroxysulfide hold great potential for commercialized supercapacitor applications.
