In order to eliminate adverse impacts of instantaneous power loads, configurations, working principle and distributed power characters of on-board DC microgrid were analyzed. To maximize the function of this structure, a hierarchical control strategy was established based on wavelet transform strategy and fuzzy control strategy. And then, examples of application were carried out in MATLAB/Simulink based on a certain driving test cycle and simulation model to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The final results showed that the proposed strategy had an advantage in meeting demands of power loads. In the meantime, electric energy quality and battery service life could be significantly improved.
