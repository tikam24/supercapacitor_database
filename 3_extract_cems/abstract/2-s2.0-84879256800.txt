Graphene-based all-solid-state supercapacitors the using ionic liquid gel polymer electrolyte have been fabricated and characterized. The gel polymer electrolyte has been prepared by immobilizing ionic liquid 1-butyl-3- methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMIBF4) with poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene). Cyclic voltammetry studies show highly capacitive behavior under fast scan rates. Impedance analysis show nominal charge transfer and ion diffusion at pores related resistance contributions. The graphene-based solid-state supercapacitor shows optimum capacitance of 80 mF cm-2 (equivalent to the single electrode specific capacitance of 76 F g -1). This corresponded to the specific energy of 7.4 Wh kg -1 and specific power of 4.5 kW kg-1. The supercapacitor cell shows stable cyclic performances for up to 5000 cycles and possibly beyond.
