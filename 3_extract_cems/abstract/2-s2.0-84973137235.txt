Mesoporous molybdenum dioxide (MoO2) nanoparticles were successfully synthesized on a flexible carbon cloth by a facile hydrothermal method, which were monoclinic phase with the size of 100 nm in diameter. The nanoparticles were characterized by series of techniques and directly functionalized as the supercapacitors (SCs). The measurements on cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge and alternating current impedance were carefully studied with 1 M H2SO4 solution as electrolyte, and the experimental results showed that as-made MoO2 exhibited higher specific capacitance of 310 F g-1 compared to 93 F g-1 of the annealed.
