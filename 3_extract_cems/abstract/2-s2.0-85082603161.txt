Multiport converters (MPC) are the cost-effective and efficient solution for integrating multiple energy sources and loads. This paper presents an isolated four port bidirectional multiport structure for interfacing Solar PV and storage devices with DC microgrid (DCMG). Solar PV is used as the preliminary energy source whereas the battery along with the supercapacitor (SC) work as an energy buffer for the system. The converter is based on a triple active bridge, which is coupled with an additional half bridge bidirectional switching cells to form the four port topology. In the developed scheme, a decoupled phase-shifted control strategy is employed to control the power flow between the ports. The decoupled control strategy eliminates the manipulation of possible interdependency in the control of different converter ports. The MPC and the control strategy has been validated through simulation studies under various conditions.
