Production of activated carbon from natural resources has been a hot topic in the recent few years. We could obtain carbon from the tree bark of Tamarindus Indica through anaerobic burning process. The obtained carbon was chemically activated using KOH solution. The prepared activated carbon was studied towards the application of supercapacitors. Structural studies confirm the presence of carbon. The activated carbon yields a maximum specific capacitance of 288 F g-1 at a specific current of 5 A g-1 with an exceptionally small charge transfer resistance of 0.25 Ï‰. The electrochemical results seem to indicate that the prepared activated carbon is a sustainable candidate for effective supercapacitor applications.
