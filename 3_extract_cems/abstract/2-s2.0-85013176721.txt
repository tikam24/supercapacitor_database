By referring to the green, efficient hydrogen storage mode, a power coordinated control of photovoltaic and hydrogen hybrid power generation system is proposed. Hydrogen storage includes the electrolyzer, hydrogen storage tank and proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). Considering the slow dynamic response characteristics of PEMFC and electrolyzer, a supercapacitor with high power density and good transient performance is used to make up for the power imbalance of the hydrogen energy storage device during its dynamic response. Photovoltaic, supercapacitors and hydrogen storage units collect and allocate electric energy to the DC bus through the DC/DC converter and power coordinated control strategy, and connect to the AC system by using DC/AC inverter. Simulation analysis shows that the proposed power coordinated control storage is correct and effective.
