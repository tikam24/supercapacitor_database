Transition metal sulfides have emerged as promising materials in supercapacitor. In this work, we firstly developed an interface-induced superassembly approach to fabricate NiSx and CoSx nanoparticles, which based on ordered mesoporous carbon-graphene aerogel composites for supercapacitor electrodes. The obtained multi-component superassembled nanoparticles-carbon matrix composites have controllable 3D porous structure of multi-stage composite. The two-dimensional graphene interlaced to form a 3D framework with large sponge-like pores, and then the graphene surface was loaded with mesoporous carbon with mesoporous pore size and vertical orientation. The composites display high specific capacitance of 958.1 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1. The capacitance retains about 97.3 % after 3000 charging-discharging cycles at 2 A g−1. These results indicate that the obtained OMC−GA−Ni3S2/Co4S3 is a promising material for electrochemical capacitors, which providing new technical methods and ideas for the research of new energy and analytical sensor materials in the fields of energy storage, photocatalysis, point-of-care testing devices and other fields.
