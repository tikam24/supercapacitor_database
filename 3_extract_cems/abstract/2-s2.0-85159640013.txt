Bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3) is regarded as an important ABO3 perovskite in the areas of energy storage and electronics. A high-performance novel MgBiFeO3-NC nanomagnetic composite (MBFO-NC) electrode was prepared using a perovskite ABO3-inspired method as a supercapacitor for energy storage. The electrochemical behavior of the perovskite BiFeO3 has been enhanced by magnesium ion doping in the basic aquatic electrolyte as the A-site. H2-TPR revealed that the doping of Mg2+ ions at the Bi3+ sites minimizes the oxygen vacancy content and improves the electrochemical characteristics of MgBiFeO3-NC. Various techniques were used to confirm the phase, structure, surface, and magnetic properties of the MBFO-NC electrode. The prepared sample showed an enhanced mantic performance and specific area with an average nanoparticle size of ∼15 nm. The electrochemical behavior of the three-electrode system was shown by cyclic voltammetry to have a significant specific capacity of 2079.44 F/g at 30 mV/s in 5 M KOH electrolyte. GCD analysis at a 5 A/g current density also showed an enhanced capacity improvement of 2159.88 F/g, which is 3.4× higher than that of pristine BiFeO3. At the power density of 5284.83 W/kg, the constructed MBFO-NC//MBFO-NC symmetric cell showed an exceptional energy density of 730.04 W h/kg. The MBFO-NC//MBFO-NC symmetric cell was employed as a direct practical application of the electrode material to entirely brighten the laboratory panel, which had 31 LEDs. This work proposes the utilization of duplicate cell electrodes made of MBFO-NC//MBFO-NC in portable devices for daily use.
