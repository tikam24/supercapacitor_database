The phosphorus-doped carbon materials were pyrolyzed by MOFs possessing unparalleled qualities and have been extensively reported as competitive candidates in the field of supercapacitor. In this work, the phosphorus doped and sheet-like porous carbon materials (P-C-600) are prepared through thermal treatment of Co-MOF powders. The carbon materials were explored as supercapacitor electrode synergistically benefit from sheet-like microstructure and originally abundant phosphorus in precursor, showing good rate performance because of its fast ion transmission paces. The phosphorus-doped porous carbon microsheets give rise to a higher supercapacitor capacitances 168 F·g−1 at the current densities of 1.0 A·g−1, after 3000 charge-discharge cycles at 20 A·g−1, the P-C-600-based electrode preserves about 97% capacitance of the first cycles.
