The cotton-based graphene supercapacitors are of great importance mainly due to their high stability, low cost, fast charging/discharging, and high efficiency, properties that render them value for developing fully flexible and lightweight devices. At recent, some researchers have reported on the cotton@graphene-based composites used for flexible electrodes obtaining good capacitance, excellent mechanical flexibility, and good stability which considered it as a potential candidate for flexible supercapacitor application. In this chapter, the different synthesis methods of cotton@graphene-based nanomaterials have been described and the previously reported works on lightweight flexible supercapacitor electrodes based on cotton@graphene composite were overviewed. Further, the morphology, chemical bonding, composition, defects, and electrochemical properties of cotton@graphene composite fabrics obtained from different characterization techniques were also presented.
