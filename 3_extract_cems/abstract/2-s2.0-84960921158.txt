In this study, hollow carbon/FeOOH hybrid composites were fabricated. Hollow carbon was prepared via modified Stober reaction, vapor thermal deposition, and etching SiO2. The FeOOH was introduced to hollow carbon by hydrothermal method. The oxygen functional groups on hollow carbon shell provide anchoring sites for the deposition of FeOOH. The structural and composition of as-prepared samples were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffractometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. The hollow carbon/FeOOH composites exhibit enhanced electrochemical performance relative to pristine hollow carbon and FeOOH electrodes, attributed to the high conductivity, short diffusion pathway for electrolyte ions, and high pseudocapacitive contribution. The proposed hybrid composites may be potentially useful for the fabrication of high-performance electrodes.
