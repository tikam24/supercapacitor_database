One-dimensional supercapacitor yarns have shown exciting potential for application in wearable and miniaturized electronics, given their great flexibility and lightness in weight. We rationally designed a multistep process to fabricate hierarchical graphene-metallic-polymer composite electrodes based on stainless steel yarns. Remarkably, an ultra-high specific capacitance of 92.76 F cm3 was obtained. Composite electrodes were also synthesized by blending pure reduced graphene oxide fibres with stainless steel fibres. The specific capacitance was increased eightfold from 4.92 to 42.80 F cm3. The incorporation of pseudocapacitive materials and carbon materials with a large surface area improved the capacitance. The overall promising electrochemical performance of as-made electrodes should be ascribed to the synergistic effect between different layers and tailored porous structures to facilitate ionic transport.
