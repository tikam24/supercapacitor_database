NH3 annealing effects on V4C3Tx MXene have been investigated. The nitrogen concentration varies with the annealing temperatures. Through the ammonia treatment at 350 °C (NH3-V4C3Tx-350 °C), nitrogen atoms can incorporate into V4C3Tx MXene, leading to a loss of F. The NH3-V4C3Tx-350 °C electrodes exhibit a higher specific capacitance of 210 F g−1 than that of the pristine V4C3Tx at the scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in 1 M H2SO4. Additionally, superior rate performance and excellent cycling stability are demonstrated. This new type of nitrogen-doped V4C3Tx could be a promising electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.
