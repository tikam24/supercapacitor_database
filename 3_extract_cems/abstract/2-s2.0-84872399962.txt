The following paper is a study on an electrical system which is using a Electrochemical Double-Layer Capacitor (EDLC) battery pack and an electronic system with minimal electromagnetic interference for use in automotive applications. The design of the electronic control module incorporated into the system, which represents an original solution for assuring minimal conducted and radiated electromagnetic disturbances, emphasizes the importance of taking into consideration the nonideal behavior of electronic components and the necessity of including electromagnetic interference suppression components as well as filtering. The device enables communication with a computer system through a graphical user interface. Electromagnetic compatibility assessment has been conducted in a semi-anechoic chamber and a TEM-cell and compared with the specifications of the current standards. Â© 2012 IEEE.
