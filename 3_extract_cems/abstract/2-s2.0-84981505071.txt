Graphene aerogel has attracted great attention as a new and efficient electrode material for supercapacitors. It can be expected that function alization of graphene aerogels can further improve their capability. In this study, graphene aerogel functionalized with different amount of p-phenylenediamine (PPD) and the effect of PPD amount on the super capacitive performance of functionalized graphene aerogel (FGA) was investigated. Structural characterizations showed that PPD molecules initiated graphene aerogel sheets assembly into three-dimensional structures and also increasing PPD amount led to increase in surface area. Electrochemical investigations proved that the FGA with larger pore size showed enhanced super capacitive performance compared with the FGA with smaller pore size. The optimized FGA-based electrode exhibited outstanding specific capacitance (SC) of 385 F g-1 at a discharge current density of 1 Ag-1, good rate capability (215 F g-1 at 20 Ag-1), and exceptionally high cyclic stability by displaying 25% increase in SC after 5000 cycle.
