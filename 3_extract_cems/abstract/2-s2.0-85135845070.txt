A simple hydrothermal reaction of Ti3C2Tx and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets to adjust the pore size of activated biomass materials (pleurotus eryngii) is presented. The unique structure produced is favourable for the ion transmission and reducing the restacking of Ti3C2Tx and rGO nanosheets. The effect of the addition quantities of Ti3C2Tx/rGO hydrogel on the specific capacitance is investigated. Under the optimal condition, the best specific capacitance of 403 F g−1 is observed at 2 mV s−1, which is approximately 1.5 times higher than that of the pure activated pleurotus eryngii. Our work possesses a technological strategy to reuse the commercial activated biochar as it can lead to broad industrial applications.
