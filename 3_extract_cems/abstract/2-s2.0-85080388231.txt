The massive diffusion of electric vehicles can only be achieved if the energy performance and driving comfort remain equivalent to traditional combustion vehicles. Nowadays, Li-ion battery single sources used in the automotive sector are too limited compared to the energy density of fossil fuels. One of the ideas to overcome this problem is to use a Li-ion battery / Supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system. In this paper, the interest of smart energy management in terms of sizing, cost, weight and volume of the storage system is detailed. The proposed energy management strategy uses the supervision of the supercapacitorâ€™s energy as a decisive factor to ensure a better sharing of power flow in a hybrid energy storage system.
