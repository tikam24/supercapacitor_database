A novel type of composite electrode based on multiwalled carbon nanotubes coated with nano nickel oxide particles has been used in supercapacitors. Nickel oxide cathodically deposited from Ni(NO 3) 2 solution with carbon nanotubes as the matrix exhibited large pseudocapacitance of 25F/g in 6 mol/L KOH. The morphology of composites was examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM). To characterize the CNTs/nickel oxide composite electrode, a charge-discharge cycling test for measuring specific capacitance, cyclic voltammetry, and ac impedance test is executed. The nickel oxide composite exhibiting excellent pseudocapacitive behavior (i. e. high reversibility, high specific capacitance, and low self-discharge rate) has been demonstrated to be a potential candidate for the application of electrochemical supercapacitors.
