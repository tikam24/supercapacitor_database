Flexible and transparent supercapacitors, as advanced energy storage devices, are essential for the development of innovative wearable electronics because of their unique optical and mechanical qualities. However, all previous designs are based on carbon-based nanostructures like carbon nanotubes and graphene, and these devices usually have poor or short cycling lives. Here, we demonstrate a high-performance, flexible, transparent, and super-long-life supercapacitor made from ultrafine Co3O4 nanocrystals synthesized using a novel process involving laser ablation in liquid. The fabricated flexible and transparent pseudocapacitor exhibits a high capacitance of 177 F g-1 on a mass basis and 6.03 mF cm-2 based on the area of the active material at a scan rate of 1 mV s-1, as well as a super-long cycling life with 100% retention rate after 20000 cycles. An optical transmittance of up to 51% at a wavelength of 550 nm is achieved, and there are not any obvious changes in the specific capacitance after bending from 0° to 150°, even after bending over 100 times. The integrated electrochemical performance of the Co3O4-based supercapacitor is greatly superior to that of the carbon-based ones reported to date. These findings open the door to applications of transition metal oxides as advanced electrode materials in flexible and transparent pseudocapacitors.
