High penetration of wind power into the power grids is subjected to a great limitation due to power fluctuations as well as fault ride-through (FRT) performance of wind turbines. Recently, supercapacitor energy storage devices are successfully used to mitigate the issue of power fluctuations. However, for increasing the effectiveness of using supercapacitors with wind turbine generators, it is proposed in this paper to use them for enhancing FRT capability. The considered wind turbine generator is the doubly fed induction generator (DFIG). The supercapacitor is connected at the dc link of the DFIG converters. Simulation studies are performed using PSCAD/EMTDC software. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated through the voltage profile, the stator current, and the active and reactive powers. Results verify the superior effect of supercapacitors in improving FRT capability and dynamic behavior of the DFIG-based wind turbine.
