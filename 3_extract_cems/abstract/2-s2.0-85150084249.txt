Quantum dots (QDs) are nanocrystalline semiconductor particles with a diameter of few nanometers. By changing the size of bulk material to about 1-6nm, their electrical and optical properties can be engineered. The behavior can be understood by quantum confinement. However, QDs size is material dependent as the exciton Bohr radius relies on the type of semiconductor as already described. In this chapter, the role of QDs and their importance in energy conversion and storage, QD materials suitable for energy conversion and storage by providing appropriate examples and versatile applications of QDs in the field of energy are discussed. The tunable bandgap and possibilities for upconversion downconversion are imperative to improve efficiency in energy conversion devices over the theoretically estimated limits. The QDs are used as conductive agents to the electrode in energy storage devices such as supercapacitors due to their high conductivity, large specific surface area, and ease of doping and modification. Up to date, many articles on the biomedical photocatalytic and environmental applications of QDs have been published. However, the applications of QDs in energy conversion and storage devices are imperative.
