Increasing global energy demand associated with depletion of nonrenewable energy sources and related environmental concerns have motivated eco-friendly materials for energy storage and harvesting technologies. Energy conversion and storage devices such as solar cells, batteries, and supercapacitors are considered promising candidates for their better conversion efficiency and storage capacity. The most investigable aspect of these technologies is the development of electrode materials with high electrochemical capabilities. Due to their unique features (low toxicity, oxidation resistivity, biocompatibility, excellent morphology, good thermal stability, larger surface to volume ratio, greater electron mobility, and higher chemical reactivity) metal nanoclusters has enormous potential applications in energy storage and conversion technology. Metal nanoclusters consider a good opportunity because of their tremendous role in storage and conversion technologies such as enabling additional reactive sites and enhance catalytic activities, increase flexibility and improving cycle life, reduce inner resistance and ohmic loss and shorten electron transport path lengths. This chapter describes the general overviews of energy conversion and storage technologies particularly solar cells, supercapacitors, and batteries. The application and roles of metal nanoclusters in energy storage and conversion device are also highlighted. Recent advancements of metal nanoclusters and their possible practical applications are also reviewed.
