Using a simple hydrothermal procedure, cobalt oxide (Co 3O 4) nanowires were in situ synthesized on three-dimensional (3D) graphene foam grown by chemical vapor deposition. The structure and morphology of the resulting 3D graphene/Co 3O 4 composites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy. The 3D graphene/Co 3O 4 composite was used as the monolithic free-standing electrode for supercapacitor application and for enzymeless electrochemical detection of glucose. We demonstrate that it is capable of delivering high specific capacitance of ∼1100 F g -1 at a current density of 10 A g -1 with excellent cycling stability, and it can detect glucose with a ultrahigh sensitivity of 3.39 mA mM -1 cm -2 and a remarkable lower detection limit of <25 nM (S/N = 8.5). © 2012 American Chemical Society.
