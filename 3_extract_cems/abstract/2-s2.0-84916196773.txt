In this work, an active regenerative braking converter using a bidirectional Buck-Boost converter is implemented in order to improve the overall efficiency of modern building lifts. The converter is connected in parallel to the inverter DC-bus. Energy is stored in a set of supercapacitors during regeneration and it is transferred back to the DC-bus when the elevator accelerates. In order to test the effectiveness of the proposed converter, a simulation model of the whole lift has been developed and simulation tests have been carried out. To illustrate operation of the whole system, characteristic results are presented and discussed.
