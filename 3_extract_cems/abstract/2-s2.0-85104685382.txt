Research and design a super capacitor as the energy storage core, to achieve fast wireless charging, power management, self starting and path planning of energy-saving car model car. Through the design and optimization of capacitor, charging circuit and mechanical structure of energy-saving vehicle. Finally, an energy-saving vehicle with full load charging power of 30W, charging time of 8.2s and completion of 65m track distance has been made. The performance and indicators of the vehicle have been greatly improved. It can even be applied to the field of unmanned transportation, storage and handling, and household appliances. At present, new energy vehicles mainly use lithium battery pack as energy storage unit. The design ideas of energy-saving vehicles combined with the current exploration and research of new energy vehicles also have great significance
