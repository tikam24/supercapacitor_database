In this work, the structural and, morphological properties and electrochemical supercapacitor electrode application of manganese ferrite (MnFe2O4) thin films deposited onto glass and stainless-steel substrates using chemical spray method are explored. For confirming the spinel structure and nodule-type morphology of obtained MnFe2O4 film X-ray diffraction pattern and scanning electron microscopy measurements are used. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectrum reveals presence of tetrahedral and octahedral peaks. The specific capacitance values, obtained using cyclic-voltammetry plots of as-deposited ferrite electrode in 1 M KOH, NaOH, Na2SO3, Na2SO4 aqueous solutions at scan rate of 5 mV s−1 are respectively 313, 295, 146.02, 180.51 Fg−1. The electrochemical impedance spectrum supports for pseudocapacitance behavior in as-deposited MnFe2O4 film electrode.
