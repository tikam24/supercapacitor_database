Rare earth is a group of elements with unique properties. Discovering the application of rare earth elements in advanced energy storage field is a great chance to relate rare earth chemistry with the energy storage technology. This review presents current research on electrode material incorporated with rare earth elements in advanced energy storage systems such as Li/Na ion battery, Li-sulfur battery, supercapacitor, rechargeable Ni/Zn battery, and cerium based redox flow battery. Furthermore, we discuss the feasibility and possible application of rare earth elements in future energy storage research.
