Abstract—: C/KCoHCF-1, C/KNiHCF-2, C/KNiCoHCF-3, and C/KCoNiHCF-4 composite materials have been produced via surface modification of activated carbon. Structural characteristics of the electrodes have been studied using X-ray diffraction and elemental analysis. Their electrochemical properties have been investigated using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements, and impedance spectroscopy. The results demonstrate that the specific capacitance of the composites exceeds that of carbon electrodes. The molar ratio of the reagents involved and the order in which they are added to the starting mixture have been shown to have a strong effect on the structure, surface morphology, and electrochemical performance of the resultant composite materials. The C/KCoNiHCF-4 composite, with the smallest particle size (38 nm), has excellent electrochemical properties.
