Batteries have been used frequently by researchers to eliminate the effect of weather variation in solar water pumping systems which can reduce battery life. Supercapacitors and battery energy storage technology complement one another. The supercapacitor has a high power density, while the battery has a high energy density. Integration of a supercapacitor may enhance the performance of a photovoltaic (PV)/battery system. In this work, a PV/Battery/Supercapacitor water pumping system is tested experimentally under variable weather conditions (sunny day, partly cloudy day, and fully cloudy day) using a centrifugal pump. The experiment uses a 40 Wp solar module to power a 12 V, 14.4 W centrifugal pump, as well as a 12 V, 9 Ahr battery and a 210 F, 12 V supercapacitor bank. The distribution of current between the battery and supercapacitor is demonstrated. The effect of the sunlight radiation fluctuation on flow rate and battery/supercapacitor charging-discharging characteristics are investigated. This system is effective in operation on partly cloudy days, hence improving the performance of the water pumping system. This water pumping system boosts the efficiency of PV systems in agricultural applications.
