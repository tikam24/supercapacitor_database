Distributed generation (DG) is nowadays increasing in the power sector at a level that it is reducing the conventional power generation. The increased usage of these systems near to the load centers has several power quality aspects to deal with. In order to elicit the maximum power from the renewable energy sources (RES) many control algorithms are available, but these methods lack the impact of sudden load changes and unpredictable behaviour of RES. To support the system during these dynamic changes additional power units are necessary to meet the condition of overall power balance. A combination of battery and supercapacitor based hybrid storage can be employed in this scenario. Also with these abnormalities of RES and loads, the voltage and frequency profiles at the customer end will also be affected. Under such a condition of grid, RES and loads an appropriate algorithm with all these conditions taking into consideration need to be formulated to operate the RES, storage based converters and grid interfacing converter to act as per the situation of the system. This improves the reliable operation of the interconnected system under any kind of variations. Hence an adaptive control algorithm is proposed and it is implemented on the grid integrated RES system along with the energy storage devices (ESD) in the MATLAB/Simulink and the various cases validate the results.
