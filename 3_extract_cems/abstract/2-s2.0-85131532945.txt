The energy demand is fulfilled by non-renewable, expensive, and non-eco-friendly sources, which are not only depleting with time but also inducing environmental concerns. An expedition is in progression to seek renewable, economic, and eco-friendly energy sources. Innovative electrocatalytic materials are in considerations to seek cogent energy alternatives which are renewable, affordable, and widely available. In these perspectives, nickel organic frameworks (Ni-MOFs) and its derivatives are reasonable, effective, and eco-friendly electrocatalysts with futuristic physiognomies due to porous topography, extensive durability, chemical functionality, high surface area, and extensive varieties. Cost effective, simple, and efficient synthetic strategies, namely hydrothermal and solvothermal, have been followed to design Ni-MOFs and its derivatives of various compositions. The synthesized metal Ni-MOFs electrodes are preferred for electrocatalytic solicitations with owing synergetic effects to explore HER, OER, and super capacitance. Reviewing these synthetic strategies and catalytic features of Ni-MOFs could be persuasive to strive for novel, eco-friendly, and renewable energy resources.
