With respect to the advancement in electronics and other related technologies, in this current era of industrial revolution there exists a higher demand for efficient energy storage devices which possess properties such as low cost, flexibility, longer life, etc. 2D layered materials have received significant attention in the current century due to its physical, mechanical and optical properties that are suitable for the fabrication of high-performance energy storage devices. Among various 2D materials, transition metal nitrides/carbides collectively known as MXenes got profound interest in material science owing to its smaller thickness, bandgap tunability, good conductivity, better mechanical properties, hydrophilicity, availability of abundant active edge sites and tunable electrochemical properties, etc. Due to these advantages, MXene based materials are demonstrated to be act as a suitable electrode for high performance energy storage devices especially in supercapacitors. But, MXenes have some demerits due to the aggregation and restacking of its layers which stand as a hurdle for its further exploration. Herein, in the present audit, an in-depth study on the supercapacitor applications of MXenes and its hybrids with carbonaceous materials, conducting polymers, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), transition metal oxides (TMOs), etc., is deliberated thoroughly and the fundamental properties, synthesis tactics and etching procedures comprising various kind of MXenes is also highlighted. Likewise, we primarily focus on the current developments, challenges and the future perspectives of MXenes based hybrid materials for supercapacitor applications. This review not only includes the pioneering studies but also comprises of very recent intriguing ones along with the research gap which is conversed through the future perspective discussions.
