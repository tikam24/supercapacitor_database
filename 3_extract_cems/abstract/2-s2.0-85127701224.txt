Nanostructured crystalline metal oxides are in great demand in industrial processes due to their unique physicochemical properties and ionic liquids (ILs) are promising solvent for synthesizing such materials. Herein, we report an IL-assisted, facile, and environmental benign approach to synthesize rutile phase of ruthenium oxide (RuO2) nanoplatelets (NPLs) structure with a size distribution of a few tens of nm. The key to this synthesis methodology is the use of imidazolium-based ILs as solvents and binder in the ionothermal process. The obtained RuO2 phase is thoroughly characterized by spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. Further, the material is used as electrocatalyst toward electrochemical energy storage and conversion in an alkaline solution. The platelet morphology of RuO2 exhibits excellent supercapacitor performance and its capacitance value is ~ 200 F gâˆ’1 in 1 M KOH solution. Besides, the as-synthesized RuO2 NPLs shows superior water oxidation and chlorine evolution processes at a minimal overpotential, i.e., 1.47 V in 1 M KOH and 1.5 V in 3 M KCl (pH 3) electrolyte, respectively, exhibiting its tri-functional electrochemical behavior toward production of renewable energies. The present study demonstrates that single-step production of the NPL morphology of RuO2 has potential implications in the field of electrolysis and supercapacitors.
