Having an interesting requirement for reliable energy storage, the search for materials capable of providing perfect electrochemical performances is going on at a great rate. Scientists are making momentous attempts toward developing renewable energy and green energy. Batteries, fuel cells, and supercapacitors (SCs) are the most efficient and suitable tools for electrochemical alteration and energy storage. Current research and development of attention mainly on how to improve the performance of the SC by developing new hybrid capacitors. Blend or hybrid SC conveys high capacitance in contrast with the current electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC) and pseudo-capacitors building material of superconductors. The utilization of ruthenium in supercapacitors either as a direct electroactive material or as a conducting agent has been widely analyzed in the last few decades due to the rapid reversible redox process and a variety of valence options, and flexible environmental adaptability. In this review, we studied various aspects of ruthenium (Ru)-based superconductors, their types, metal/non-metal/polymer doping, as well as oxides and reduced oxides of ruthenium incorporated. We summarize the morphologies and structures of various studies of Ru-composites followed by the researchers' suggested characterization methods and find out the promising electrochemical performance.
