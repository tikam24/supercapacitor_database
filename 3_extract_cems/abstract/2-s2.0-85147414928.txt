In order to meet the demand for an alternative source of energy, researchers are conducting a focused research-based study. This is due to the ongoing growth and breakthroughs in the development of self-charging (SC) supercapacitors. Numerous research-based studies have been published in the recent years, and numerous fabrication methods for piezoelectric material-based self-charging supercapacitors have been used (SCPSCs). Due to their efficiency in energy conversion, storing, and harvesting, SCPSCs are becoming more and more common. A wonderful method has been developed that combines two devices (energy storage and energy harvesting) into a single SC supercapacitor in order to meet the demands of the energy deficit. This is accomplished using the two separate independent units, a piezoelectric nanogenerator and a Li-ion battery. These two are employed in the process of electrically transforming mechanical energy into chemical energy and storing the same. This integrating technology has a wide range of applications in monitoring devices, SC devices (i.e., wearable electronics), and at the micro-and macroscale. The present study is a modest attempt to inform readers about recent developments in SCPSCs by reviewing these developments in SCPSCs, their mechanisms, the piezoelectric phenomena, and their fabrication techniques. In terms of design, fabrication, and materials employed, several difficulties, restrictions, and future research directions have also been outlined.
