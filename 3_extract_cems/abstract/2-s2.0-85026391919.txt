To improve electrochemical energy storage performance of Ni-Al layered double hydroxide (Ni-Al LDH) as supercapacitor electrode, ultrathin Ni-Al LDH nanosheets were prepared by simple hydrothermal method. The surface area of the ultrathin structure with broad pore size distribution is high to 64.9 m2 g−1. The ultrathin Ni-Al LDH nanosheets exhibit excellent pseudocapacitance performance with a maximum specific capacitance of 1919 F g−1 and a capacity retention of 433 F g−1 after 3000 cycles at a current density of 2 A g−1. Furthermore, a reversible capacity of 1665 F g−1 was obtained at a much higher current density of 30 A g−1. The fascinating performances can be attributed to the improvement of pseudocapacitive reaction by the ultrathin structure of Ni-Al LDH. The impressive results may pave the way for promising applications in high energy density storage systems.
