The concepts of distributed power generator and its operation modes with respect to reliability, stability, and power quality have been presented. We have proposed to use the principle of power balance on the DC bus or/and the AC grid to improve power quality. The control strategies of converters have been evaluated in Matlab simulation, A DC/AC inverter based prototype system of distributed power generator has been realized. The experimental results have shown that high power quality can be achieved in the presence of nonlinear loads and large scale integration of dispersed and renewable energy source into distribution networks.
