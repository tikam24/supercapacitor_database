Microporosity is an important factor for Activated carbon fibers. Because of good porosity, activated carbon fibers have been used as adsorbents, electrode materials of supercapacitors and hydrogen storage. Pitch-based carbon fibers were classified into high performance carbon fibers. In this work, we studied the electrochemical performance of the pitch-based activated carbon fibers (SACFs) prepared by physical activation. The microporous structure and surface area properties of activated carbon fibers were developed by steam activation at different temperatures. Activated carbon fibers were investigated as electrode for supercapacitors in KOH electrolyte solutions. The experimental results indicated that the physical activation increased the specific surface area of activated carbon fibers. And the electrochemical performance was considerably enhanced by increase of specific surface area and micropore volumes.
