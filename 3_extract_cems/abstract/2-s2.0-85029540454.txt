This paper uses a simple pulse electrodeposition method to synthesize PANI/MnO2/Graphene composite. The structure and composition of the complex was characterized by XRD and FT-IR. The morphology of the complex was characterized by SEM. The electrochemical performance was tested by electrochemical workstation. The results show that specific capacity can reach 1019F·g-1 under the current density of 0.5A·g-1. The stability is as high as 98.1% after a 500-cycle. The composite may have a good performance for its applications in supercapacitors.
