Light weight and porous polypyrrole (PPy)/Ti3C2Tx/alginate (Alg) aerogels were prepared via a sacrificial template strategy, which were used as the electrode material in symmetric supercapacitors. PPy and Ti3C2Tx endow the aerogels with high specific capacitance, and the porous structure is in favor of the transfer of electrons and electrolyte ions. The aerogels display high energy density (64 μWh cm−2) and power density (0.97 μW cm−2) when used in symmetric supercapacitors. In addition, the aerogels also display high cyclic stability owing to the inhibited volume change of PPy during the repeated charge/discharge process.
