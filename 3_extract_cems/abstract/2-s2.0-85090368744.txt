Supercapacitors have attracted a lot of attention because of their unique quality of fast charging and discharging capability, high-power density, and long service life. Easy fabrication and lightweight make supercapacitors suitable for a wide range of applications as electrical energy storage devices. Supercapacitors are taking place of batteries and conventional capacitors in many applications. They possess higher power density than batteries and fuel cells and higher energy density than conventional capacitors. In most applications, hybrid battery/supercapacitor energy storage systems are used to utilizing the higher rate capability, better cyclability, and it also extends the battery life. Supercapacitors have been designed in various ways like flexible, foldable, self-charging, electrochromic, microbial, etc. They are used in portable electronics, backup power supply, smart grid, memory backup, hybrid vehicles, transportation, and wearable electronic fields. This chapter provides a brief insight into the commercially available supercapacitors and the applications in various fields.
