Transformation of biomass wastes into sustainable low cost carbon materials is now a topic of great interest. Here, we describe porous carbon from biomass derived waste shrimp shells and its application in two different energy storage systems. The unique porous structure with the presence of heteroatoms (O, N) makes it promising material for both lithium ion batteries and supercapacitors. When applied as anode materials for lithium ion batteries, the as-prepared carbon showed a specific capacity as high as 1507 mA h g−1 and 1014 mA h g−1 at current densities of 0.1 A g−1 and 0.5 A g−1, respectively, good rate performance and superior cycling stability. The porous carbon-based supercapacitor also delivered a specific capacitance of 239 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte. The specific capacitance retention is 99.4% even after 5000 charge-discharge cycles, indicating excellent cycling stability. The superior electrochemical performances for both lithium ion batteries and supercapacitors could be ascribed to the high specific surface area, porous structure and nitrogen doping effect.
