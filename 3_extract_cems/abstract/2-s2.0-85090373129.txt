Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are considered as potential electrode material for electrochemical supercapacitors for the past few decades and attracting increasing attention owing to their unique structure with narrow distribution of size, highly accessible surface area, superior electrical conductivity, excellent mechanical properties, and high stability. However, the electrodes composed of pure CNTs have quite low energy density and specific capacitance. Therefore, the integration of redox-active pseudocapacitive materials with CNTs is the best solution to get the ideal supercapacitor electrodes by the synergistic effect of both materials. Recently, transition metal oxides and CNTs composite materials have been widely investigated and demonstrated impressive energy and power densities values and maintain long-term stability in supercapacitors. Therefore, a detailed analysis of CNTs-transition metal oxides-based-nanostructured materials as supercapacitor electrodes have been critically reviewed in this chapter. The chapter provides decent and updated coverage on the synthesis, structure, properties, and supercapacitor performance of CNT and transition metal oxide composites.
