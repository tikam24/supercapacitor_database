Nitrogen-containing groups functionalized graphene has been synthesized via the reaction of graphene oxide with 1, 8-diazoicyclo (5, 4, 0) undecene-7, trimethylamine (DBU) through epoxide-ring-open reaction without high temperatures. Samples were analyzed by x-ray diffraction spectroscopy, Raman, N2 adsorption-desorption, transmission electron microscope, galvanostatic charge/discharge, and cyclic voltammetrys. Results show that the amount of added DBU has great influence on the structure and properties of the resultant graphene. The DBU modified graphene with appropriate N content and low charge transfer resistance exhibits 190 F g-1 at 5 mV s-1 in 6 M KOH aqueous solution. This will also provide a new strategy for configuring nitrogen-containing groups functionalized graphene electrode materials for supercapacitors and other energy storage devices.
