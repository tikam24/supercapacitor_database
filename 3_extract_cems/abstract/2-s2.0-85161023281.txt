Novel silver/molybdenum bimetallic metal-organic framework (AgMo-MOF) was synthesized using the solvo-hydrothermal method and then converted to Ag2MoO4 nanoparticles by calcination process. The cubic spinel structure of Ag2MoO4 was confirmed by XRD. The valence states of Ag, and Mo are +1, and + 6, respectively, according to the XPS spectra. The specific surface area was evaluated to be 24.52 and 56.58 m2 g−1 for the AgMo-MOF and Ag2MoO4, respectively, using BET analysis. The optical band gap of Ag2MoO4 was estimated to be 3.38 eV. The GCD analysis revealed the superior specific capacitance of 652.5 and 1468.7 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 for AgMo-MOF/NF and Ag2MoO4/NF electrodes, respectively. The cyclic stability after 5000 cycles at 20 A g−1 revealed that the AgMo-MOF/NF and Ag2MoO4/NF electrodes are stable with capacitance retention of 86 % and 90 %, respectively. Furthermore, Ag2MoO4//AC asymmetric supercapacitor devices provide a terrific energy density of 72.1 Wh kg−1 at 1123.6 W kg−1 and capacitance retention of 88 % over 5000 cycles.
