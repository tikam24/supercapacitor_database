This work used a simple electrochemical reduction method to secondary construct the reduced nickel base (rNi Base) on nickel foam with a nano-core structure. The secondarily constructed base has a large specific surface area, which can increase the mass utilization of the active material. The rNi Base was used as a base for the reduction of nickel on Na+, K+, andNH4+, respectively. MnO2 was electrodeposited under three different cation pre-intercalation treatments, and the mechanism of the effect of different monovalent cations to guide the growth of MnO2 materials was investigated. Finally, rNi/MnO2&Na+ electrode with a special nano cauliflower structure was obtained. The special nanostructure of the electrode enhances its electrochemical performance, possessing 598 F g− 1 ultra-high specific capacitance at a current density of 1 A g− 1 and a high specific capacitance of 307.5 F g− 1 at a high current density of 20 A g− 1, and high specific capacitance maintenance rate of 92.7% after 500 cycles of charging and discharging at a current density of 2 A g− 1. In addition, the symmetrical supercapacitor assembled with this electrode has a very high specific capacitance (401.1 F g− 1 at a current density of 1 A g− 1) and energy density (80.22Wh kg− 1 at a power density of 599.99 W kg− 1).
