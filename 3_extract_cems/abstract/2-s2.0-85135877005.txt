Layered double hydroxide (LDH) has attracted extensive attention as the potential electrode materials used in asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) because of its adjustable elemental composition and microstructure. In this work, a series of NiCoFe-LDH with different element ratios and morphology was synthesized by a facile hydrothermal treatment. A special interlaced structure assembled by nanorods and nanosheets surprisedly emerged. The nanorods and nanosheets have same chemical composition. The corresponding NiCoFe-LDH with interlaced structure exhibits much excellent electrochemical performance than that with single structure. Especially, the Ni2Co1Fe1-LDH material has the highest specific capacitance of 1772.26 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 due to the suitable specific surface area and pore structure, faster electron transportation and dynamic Faradaic redox reactions. The Ni2Co1Fe1-LDH//AC ASC based on the Ni2Co1Fe1-LDH and active carbon (AC) reveals a better specific capacitance of 256.19 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and an excellent energy density of 91.09 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 809.68 W kg−1. The change of metal element proportion effectively adjusted the interlaced structure of NiCoFe-LDH and extremely enhanced the electrochemical performance of the resulted electrode materials.
