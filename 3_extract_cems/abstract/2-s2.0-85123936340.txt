Bio-derived activated porous carbon is readily used because it exhibits high surface area, excellent electrical conductivity, high stability, environment-friendly nature, and easy availability. All of these properties make it a unique and a perfect applicant for energy storage devices. Biowastes such as corncobs, walnut shells, human hair, jute, oil seeds, and bamboo are utilized as precursors in manufacturing porous carbon. The use of bio materials is preferred because of their abundance and biodegradable nature. The production of porous carbon was carried out through pyrolysis with the help of acid, primarily KOH, as the active substance. The ambient temperature for conducting pyrolysis is 400 C-800 C. Pyrolysis can be either fast or slow, with fast pyrolysis being helpful in most experiments. Food wastes like peels and shells are among the most significant biowaste sources alongside farm waste like rice husks, coconut shells, etc., which are not just waste and can be utilized for sustainable living. The porous carbon is formed from food waste from toxicity reducer in wastewater to for a supercapacitor or a bio anode in a microbial fuel cell. It is oneway sustainable development and is now highly economical. Moreover, in scientific aspects, their validity in a field and lowered expenses in some cases, the benefits of their usage may vary. This paper aims to extensively review all of the research conducted for Bio-waste utilization and its conversion to porous carbon for further use in super capacitance applications.
