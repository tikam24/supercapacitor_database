Considering a large amount of expired foods such as expired bread are generated in the world every day, expired sliced bread activated carbon (EBAC) was prepared from expired sliced bread by carbonization, activation with 1 mol•L-1 KOH, neutralized with dilute hydrochloric acid, and then washed with deionized water and ethanol. The surface morphology, phase structure, surface functional groups, specific surface area and pore size distribution of expired sliced bread activated carbon were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nitrogen adsorption and desorption (BET). The electrochemical properties of activated carbon electrode materials were tested in a three-electrode system with the 3 mol•L-1 KOH electrolyte. The charge-discharge curves show that the specific capacitance of the electrode material reaches 352 F•g-1 at 0.5 A•g-1 current density. After 1000 cycles at 5 A•g-1 current density, the specific capacitance remains 99.87%, which shows good cyclic stability. At last, the Nyquist and Bode diagrams obtained by AC impedance measurement also shows that the expired sliced bread activated carbon has good supercapacitor performance.
