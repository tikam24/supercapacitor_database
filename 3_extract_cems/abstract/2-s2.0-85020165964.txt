Thumb-ring-like α-Fe2O3 and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composites, α-Fe2O3/rGO, have been synthesized via a simple hydrothermal method accompanied by surface potential tuning. The obtained samples exhibit good electrochemical performance with a wide negative potential window of -1-0.2 V vs Ag/AgCl when serving as supercapacitor electrodes. There is only about 10% decay after 11 000 cycles of galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) test. After a few tens of cycles of cycling activity, the capacitance achieved a stable value of 255 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 and 174 F g-1 at 5 mV s-1 75% of the capacitance was retained when the scan rate increased to 200 mV s-1, indicating satisfactory power density. Most attractively, along with cycling, the α-Fe2O3 particles begin to be well-wrapped by rGO gradually from prior stacked structure, which is supposed to be the key factor for the exceptional high cycling stability.
