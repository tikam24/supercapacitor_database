Ni(OH)2 with a high specific surface area was synthesized by a facile fast precipitation method. Porous nano-NiO was obtained by calcining Ni (OH)2 at 300Â°C. The NiO sample possesses a fine porous distribution at around 3-10 nm. The BET specific surface area and pore volume of this sample are 218.1 m2/g and 0.31 cm3/g, respectively. The electrochemical characteristics of the sample were studied by cyclic voltammetry and constant current charge/discharge. The specific capacitance of the NiO sample is about 255 F/g in the 2.0 mol/L KOH solution. The sample also has a fine electrochemical stability.
