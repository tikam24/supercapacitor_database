Two-dimensional (2D) layered materials are widely applied in energy devices including lithium-ion battery and supercapacitor due to their unique properties, such as tunable interlayer structure, numerous active sites, large aspect ratio versatile interlayer chemistry. In this work, 2D layered tungstate acid-linked polyaniline (TALP) presented a fluid-in-solid structure, which allowed facile exchange of the interlayer fluid from moisture to conventional Li+ containing electrolyte. With fast and stable dual ion storage (Li+ and PF6−), TALP demonstrates high-rate volumetric capacity (39 mAh cm−3 at 2000 mA g−1) and good stability (2000 cycles at 200 mA g−1) within the working potential window of 1.5–4.5 V versus Li+/Li.
