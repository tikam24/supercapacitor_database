Electrochemical supercapacitance performance of a ternary nanocomposite composed of mesoporous indium oxide (In2O3) nanocube crystals (size 350 nm) embedded in carbon nanotubes (CNT) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) prepared by hydrothermal method is reported. A glassy carbon electrode modified with the In2O3/CNT/RGO nanocomposite material exhibited excellent electrochemical performance with a large specific capacitance of 1273 F g11 at 5 mV s11 and 948 F g11 at 1 A g11. The composite electrode showed excellent cyclic stability without any capacity loss after 5000 charge/discharge cycles. Furthermore, 375% capacitance retention was observed at high scan rate of 200 mV s11. These results indicate that the novel mesoporous In2O3 cubes composited with Ï€-electron rich conductive nanocarbons CNT and RGO would be useful as electrode material for advanced supercapacitors.
