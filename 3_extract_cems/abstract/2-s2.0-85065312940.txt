Hierarchical micro-mesoporous carbon (denoted as HPC-2 in this study) was synthesized by pre-carbonization of biomass Sichuan pepper followed by KOH activation. It possessed well-developed porosity with the specific surface area of 1823.1 m 2 g -1 and pore volume of 0.906 cm 3 g -1 , and exhibited impressive supercapacitive behaviors. For example, the largest specific capacitance of HPC-2 was tested to be ca. 171 F g -1 in a three-electrode setup with outstanding rate capability and stable electrochemical property, whose capacitance retention was near 100% after cycling at rather a high current density of 40 A g -1 for up to 10,000 cycles. Furthermore, a two-electrode symmetric supercapacitor cell of HPC-2//HPC-2 was constructed, which delivered the maximum specific capacitance and energy density of ca. 30 F g -1 and 4.2 Wh kg -1 , respectively, had prominent rate performance and cycling stability with negligible capacitance decay after repetitive charge/discharge at a high current density of 10 A g -1 for over 10,000 cycles. Such electrochemical properties of HPC-2 in both three-and two-electrode systems are superior or comparable to those of a great number of porous biomass carbon reported previously, hence making it a promising candidate for the development of high-performance energy storage devices.
