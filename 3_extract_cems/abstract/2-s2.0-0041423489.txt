Electrochemical properties of carbon nanofiber web as an electrode for supercapacitor prepared by electrospinning were investigated. The webs were oxidatively stabilized and activated by steam resulting in activated carbon nanofibers (ACNFs). It was found that the elevated volume fraction of mesopores gave maximum specific capacitance at high current density.
