A micrometer-thin solid-state supercapacitor (SC) was assembled using two pieces of porous carbon nanofibers/ultrathin graphite (pCNFs/G) hybrid films, which were one-step synthesized by chemical vapor deposition using copper foil supported Co catalyst. The continuously ultrathin graphite sheet (âˆ¼25 nm) is mechanically compliant to support the pCNFs even after etching the copper foil and thus can work as both current collector and support directly with nearly ignorable fraction in a SC stack. The pCNFs are seamlessly grown on the graphite sheet with an ohmic contact between the pCNFs and the graphite sheet. Thus, the accumulated electrons/ions can duly transport from the pCNFs to graphite (current collector), which results in a high rate performance. The maximum energy density and power density based on the whole device are up to 2.4 mWh cm-3 and 23 W cm-3, which are even orders higher than those of the most reported electric double-layer capacitors and pseudocapacitors. Moreover, the specific capacitance of the device has 96% retention after 5000 cycles and is nearly constant at various curvatures, suggesting its wide application potential in powering wearable/miniaturized electronics.
