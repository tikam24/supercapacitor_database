In this study, novel ternary synthesis of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets via intercalation of Ag nanoparticles (Ag) and polypyrrole (PPy) was obtained for supercapacitor evaluations. The synthesis procedure of nanocomposite is simple, cheap, and ecologically friendly. The nanocomposites were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared-attenuated transmission reflectance (FTIR-ATR) and scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersion X-ray analysis (SEM-EDX). In addition, electrochemical performances of electrode active materials (rGO/Ag/PPy) of the samples were tested by means of galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The highest specific capacitance and energy density of rGO/Ag/PPy nanocomposite were obtained as Csp = 1085.22 F/g and E = 36.92 Wh/kg for [rGO]o/[Py]o = 1/5 at 4 mV/s in 1 M H2SO4 solution. Under the optimized preparation conditions in different initial feed ratios ([rGO]o/[Py]o = 1/1, Â½, 1/5, and 1/10) of rGO/Ag/PPy, nanocomposites acquired a high Coulombic efficiency, and a retention of 66% of its initial capacitance for [rGO]o/[Py]o = 1/10 after 1000 cycles. GCD and EIS measurements of rGO/Ag/PPy nanocomposite electrode active material allowed for supercapacitor applications.
