The wearable and flexible supercapacitors (FS) have great consideration in a wide range of applications such as industry, medicine, and the military. Various researches were conducted to develop and enhance the properties of FS using different fabrication methods and materials. In this work, we explained some recently reported works regarding FS. The routes of fabrication along with active materials and characterization are discussed thoroughly. Herein, we classified FS according to flexible material used. It is envisioned that this review will provide a short overview and guide for beginners who intend to work in FS.
