Electrochemical energy storage using pseudocapacitive mode is under intense research owing to their potential in fabricating high performance renewable energy devices at a lower cost. In this paper we characterize nickel oxide (NiO) nanowires developed by electrospinning an aqueous polymeric solution containing nickel precursor for its application as a pseudocapacitors electrode. The wires are of diameter ∼50-70 nm containing densely packed cuboidal grains (∼10-20 nm) with less degree of crystal defects. Electrochemical properties of the electrodes fabricated on a nickel foam substrates are evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and charge-discharge cycling (CDC), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. The best performing electrode showed a specific capacitance (CS) of ∼670 Fg-1 with high cycling stability (∼100%) for over 1000 cycles and Coulombic efficiency ∼98%. Lower electrochemical equivalent resistance (∼0.76 Ω), charge transfer resistance (∼0.45 Ω), and charge relaxation time (43 ms) are observed which are attributed to the defect free nanowire morphology that give rise to the superior performance. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.
