We demonstrate a simple wafer-scale process by which an individual silicon wafer can be processed into a multifunctional platform where one side is adapted to replace platinum and enable triiodide reduction in a dye-sensitized solar cell and the other side provides on-board charge storage as an electrochemical supercapacitor. This builds upon electrochemical fabrication of dual-sided porous silicon and subsequent carbon surface passivation for silicon electrochemical stability. The utilization of this silicon multifunctional platform as a combined energy storage and conversion system yields a total device efficiency of 2.1%, where the high frequency discharge capability of the integrated supercapacitor gives promise for dynamic load-leveling operations to overcome current and voltage fluctuations during solar energy harvesting.
