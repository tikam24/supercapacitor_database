Novel zinc molybdate–graphene nanocomposite is prepared for the first time in a fast, facile and eco-friendly microwave synthesis route as an electrode material for electrochemical supercapacitors. The as-prepared sample is investigated by X-ray diffraction, FTIR, Raman, scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope techniques. The studies have confirmed the formation of ZnMoO4 and its composite with graphene. The synthesized materials are subjected to electrochemical characterization studies in 2M KOH electrolyte solution which prove that ZnMoO4-graphene as an effective electrode material for supercapacitor applications. ZnMoO4 in its composite behavior has exhibited a specific capacitance of 272.93 F g− 1 at 0.5 A g− 1 with good cyclic stability for 1000 cycles.
