Modern world has an unparalleled focus on science and technology as an energy storage device as a promising alternative sources to tackle the growing energy crisis and play an important role in economic development. Thus, new approaches and novel promising electrode materials are trying to overcome high energy density without reducing supercapacitors power density and a long lifetime stability. Accordingly, rational flower like structural control of rare earth nickelate-based composite electrodes is also important but very challenging. The role of carbon composites such as single walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) and multi walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) with samarium nickelate (SmNiO3) is studied. Herein, the perovskite rare earth SmNiO3, SmNiO3/MWCNT and SmNiO3/SWCNT composites are prepared as potential electrode materials by solvothermal method and never reported before as electrode for supercapacitors. An asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor (SmNiO3/SWCNT//CNT) was fabricated and presented specific capacitance, energy and power density of 170.58 F/g, 53.30 Wh/kg and 749.88 W/kg at 1 A/g. The assembled asymmetric hybrid device exhibited 79.34 % of capacitance retention and 97.52 % of coulombic efficiency even after the continuous 20,000 long cycles. These superior electrochemical properties make the hybrid microflower rare earth nickelate as a good candidate for next generation electrodes in hybrid supercapacitors.
