Nitrogen-doped graphene decorated by iron-nickel alloy is introduced as a promising electrode material for supercapacitors. Compared to pristine and Ni-decorated graphene, in acid media, the introduced electrode revealed excellent specific capacitance as the corresponding specific capacitance was multiplied around ten times with capacity retention maintained at 94.9% for 1,000 cycles. Briefly, iron acetate, nickel acetate, urea, and graphene oxide were ultrasonicated and subjected to MW heating and then sintered with melanin in Ar. The introduced N-doped FeNi@Gr exhibits remarkable electrochemical behavior with long-term stability.
