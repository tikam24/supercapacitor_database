We describe in this work the synthesis and the characterization of homogeneous, carbon-coated lithium titanium oxide micro spheres and demonstrate their use for the fabrication of an active negative electrode combined with a high surface area, activated carbon positive electrode to form an advanced non aqueous, hybrid supercapacitor. We show that this activated carbon/carbon coated-Li 4Ti 5O 12 device retains 95% of its initial capacity after 1000 cycles with a maximum volumetric energy and power density of 57 Wh L -1 and 2600 W L -1, respectively. Due to this unique performance, the hybrid supercapacitor developed in this work is expected to be a very promising energy storage device suitable for applications that require high energy levels and fast charge and discharge cycles, such as those requested in the EV sector.
