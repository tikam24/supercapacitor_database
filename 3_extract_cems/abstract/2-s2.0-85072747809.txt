Neodymium and manganese oxide-based nanocomposites (Nd2O3/Mn3O4-0, Nd2O3/Mn3O4-1, and Nd2O3/Mn3O4-2) along with pure nanoparticles of Nd2O3 have been synthesized by the hydrothermal process. X-ray diffraction analysis presents that nanocomposites exhibit the mutual effect of hexagonal and tetragonal crystal structures of Nd2O3 and Mn3O4 respectively. Field emission scanning electron microscopic results display the interconnected Nd2O3 nanoparticles and irregular nanograins of Mn3O4. Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy proves the presence of constituting elements in the prepared materials. A type IV isotherm with H3 type hysteresis loop and pore size in the range of 30–45 Å, confirms the mesoporosity of all the prepared materials by nitrogen adsorption/desorption analysis. Electrochemical results display that Nd2O3/Mn3O4-1 electrode with mass ratio 63:37, owns excellent specific capacitance of 205.29 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 as compared to other electrodes. This pseudocapacitance of Nd2O3/Mn3O4-1 electrode is likely ascribed to the pragmatic synergistic effects among the redox-active Nd2O3 and Mn3O4 metal oxides. The cycling stability of 67% over long cycles at 50 mV s−1 as well as high-coulombic efficiency of 99.64% at 5A g−1, making the Nd2O3/Mn3O4-1 electrode as an auspicious electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
