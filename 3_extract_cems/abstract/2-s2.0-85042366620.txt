Here, a controllable ZFO/rGO hybrid is prepared with high SCs performance by controlling the ZFO particle size and ZFO mass ratio. Small ZFO nanoparticles (∼15 nm) can be fully utilized and facilitated fast ion transport during electrochemical reactions, whereas the high mass ratio of ZFO (82.3%) will improve the specific capacitance of the ZFO/rGO hybrid electrode. The specific capacitance of this hybrid reach 352.9 F g−1 at current densities of 1 A g−1, which is higher or comparable to other ZFO based electrodes. It also exhibits remarkable cyclic stability (92.3% retention after 10000 cycles) and good rate performance. In addition, the energy density of symmetric supercapacitor based on ZFO/rGO hybrid can reach 6.7 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 300 W kg−1 within a voltage of 1.2 V in a 2 M KOH aqueous electrolyte.
