Metal-organic-frameworks have grasped increasingly attention owing to their exceptional porosities and tunable structure, being extensively utilized as anodic material for energy applications. Herein, manganese MOF has been synthesized with multi organic linkers and studied their electrochemical properties in both three and two electrode assembly. The Mn- BTC (Benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid) sustains superior performance compared to Mn-BDC (1,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid) in three electrode setup. Owing to considerable outcomes of Mn-BTC, it was further assembled in two electrode configuration to fabricate a hybrid device. The Mn-BTC//AC operated at a wider potential window of 1.7 V with relatively better discharging time which indicates its potential for industrial applications. Apart from this, the assembled device also revealed noticeable specific energy and power. Dunn's model was employed to further scrutinizethe capacitive and diffusive contributions in the hybrid device of Mn-BTC//AC. This as-described strategy is applicable broadly for energy storage applications.
