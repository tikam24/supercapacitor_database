The novel material CuZnCdO metal nanoparticles have been synthesized with different concentrations through green synthesis using fresh A. heterophyllus leaf extract as a reducing agent and graphene oxide derived from A. heterophyllus dead leaves. XRD, FESEM, EDAX, FTIR and FT-RAMAN analysis confirms the structural properties of rGO/CuZnCdO nanoparticles. BET has been used to investigate the surface area of the nanoparticles. It is a very challenging material that shows the highest specific capacitance of 882.5 F/g with non-hazardous and eco-friendly. Without any decay, the charge carrier concentration has performed up to 5000 cycles which indicates the material has good stability. The energy density and power density has been calculated by Ragone plot. This illustrates that the material has high capacitive behavior.
