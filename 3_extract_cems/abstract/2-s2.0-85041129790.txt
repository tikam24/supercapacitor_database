In this study, zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs) have been synthesized at room temperature by co-precipitation method. It has been used as an electrode material by making composite with activated charcoal (AC) powder for its application in energy storage devices such as a supercapacitor. For synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles, zinc nitrate hexahydrate {Zn(NO3)2} and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) have been used as an initial precursor. The ZnO nanopowder obtained by using co-precipitation has been calcined at 400, 500, and 600 °C for 2 h. The nanoparticles have been characterized using Synchrotron radiation based angle dispersive X-ray diffraction (ADXRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Supercapacitor cells have been fabricated by using of zinc oxide nanoparticles-activated carbon (AC) nanocomposite electrode in different composition (weight ratios) from 1:1 to 1:2. Electrochemical properties of the prepared nanocomposite electrodes and fabricated supercapacitor cells have been characterized using a.c. impedance, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and charge discharge (CD) techniques by using 6 M KOH and 1 M NaOH as an electrolyte. The ZnO–activated carbon nanocomposite electrode with 6 M KOH showed a maximum capacitance of 479.6 mF cm−2, which is equivalent to single electrode specific capacitance of 342.6 F g−1. Similarly, the ZnO–activated carbon nanocomposite electrode with 1 M NaOH showed a maximum capacitance of 456.5 mF cm−2, which is equivalent to single electrode specific capacitance of 326.1 F g−1. The electrochemical behavior of the neat ZnO nanoparticles has also been studied. The specific capacitance of the supercapacitor is stable up to 2000 cycles at 100 mV cm−2, which shows that the device has good life cycle and electrochemical reversibility with 6 M KOH and 1 M NaOH electrolyte.
