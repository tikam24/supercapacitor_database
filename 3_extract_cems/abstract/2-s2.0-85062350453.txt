The fabrication of fully printable, flexible micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) with high energy and power density remains a significant technological hurdle. To overcome this grand challenge, the 2D material MXene has garnered significant attention for its application, among others, as a printable electrode material for high performing electrochemical energy storage devices. Herein, a facile and in situ process is proposed to homogeneously anchor hydrous ruthenium oxide (RuO 2 ) nanoparticles on Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene nanosheets. The resulting RuO 2 @MXene nanosheets can associate with silver nanowires (AgNWs) to serve as a printable electrode with micrometer-scale resolution for high performing, fully printed MSCs. In this printed nanocomposite electrode, the RuO 2 nanoparticles contribute high pseudocapacitance while preventing the MXene nanosheets from restacking, ensuring an effective ion highway for electrolyte ions. The AgNWs coordinate with the RuO 2 @MXene to guarantee the rheological property of the electrode ink, and provide a highly conductive network architecture for rapid charge transport. As a result, MSCs printed from the nanocomposite inks demonstrate volumetric capacitances of 864.2 F cm −3 at 1 mV s −1 , long-term cycling performance (90% retention after 10 000 cycles), good rate capability (304.0 F cm −3 at 2000 mV s −1 ), outstanding flexibility, remarkable energy (13.5 mWh cm −3 ) and power density (48.5 W cm −3 ).
