Nanocrystalline MnFe2O4 having a spinel structure with Mn and Fe ions randomly distributed over the tetrahedral and octahedral sites have been found to exhibit capacitive characteristics in organic electrolyte containing 1M LiPF6 in the mixture of ethyl carbonate + ethylene methyl carbonate. As characterized by cyclic voltammetry and in-situ synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy, the material show reversible pseudocapacitance behavior over a potential window from 1.75V to 4.5 V versus Li/Li+ with a specific capacitance of ̃125 F/g. Asymmetric supercapacitors consisting of LiMn2O4 cathode and MnFe2O4 anode and Li organic electrolyte has thus been developed and characterized for their electrochemical performance in a three-electrode configuration in order to independently reveal the behaviors of the battery cathode and pseudocapacitive anode. © The Electrochemical Society.
