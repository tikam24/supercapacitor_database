This paper presents a fully electric propulsion system with supercapacitors (SC) as the only power storage element, for a quick charge in the minibus stations. A bidirectional DC-DC Converter is used, as the interface between the SC and the drive. The traction is implemented by a single interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM), fed by an inverter, with vector control strategy. Analytical description and extended simulation results for a synthetic and a measured urban driving cycle profile are presented, confirming the initial theoretical considerations and proposed technical solutions.
