Due to the boom of miniaturized electronic devices in the last decade, there are great demands for ultrathin and flexible on-chip rechargeable energy storage microdevices. Supercapacitor, as one of the most hopeful appearing energy storage devices, can provide a wonderful alternative to batteries or electrolytic capacitors, owing to its fast charge and discharge rates, high power density, and long cycling stability. Especially for the recently developed micro-supercapacitors, the unique in-plane interdigital electrode architecture can fully meet the integration requirements of rapidly developed miniaturized electronic devices, and improve the power density of the unit via shortening the ionic diffusion distance between the interdigital electrodes. This concept introduces the recent advances on the design, fabrication, and application of planar micro-supercapacitors for on-chip energy storage from an overall perspective. Moreover, challenges and future development trends are discussed.
