With the goal of improving the mechanical properties of porous hierarchical carbon, cellulosic fiber fabric was incorporated into the resorcinol/formaldehyde (RF) precursor resins. The composites were carbonized in an inert atmosphere, and the carbonization process was monitored by TGA/MS. The mechanical properties, evaluated by nanoindentation, show an increase in the elastic modulus due to the reinforcing effect of the carbonized fiber fabric. It was found that the adsorption of the RF resin precursor onto the fabric stabilizes its porosity (micro and mesopores) during drying while incorporating macropores. The textural properties are evaluated by N2 adsorption isotherm, which shows a surface area (BET) of 558 m2g−1. The electrochemical properties of the porous carbon are evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronocoulometry (CC), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Specific capacitances (in 1 M H2SO4) of up to 182 Fg−1 (CV) and 160 Fg−1 (EIS) are measured. The potential-driven ion exchange was evaluated using Probe Bean Deflection techniques. It is observed that ions (protons) are expulsed upon oxidation in acid media by the oxidation of hydroquinone moieties present on the carbon surface. In neutral media, when the potential is varied from values negative to positive of the potential of zero charge, cation release, followed by anion insertion, is found.
