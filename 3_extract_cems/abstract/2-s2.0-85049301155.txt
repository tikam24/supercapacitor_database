Owing to its unique physicochemical properties, graphene has attracted much attention as electrode material for electrochemical energy-storage devices including supercapacitors and batteries. Tremendous progress has been achieved on the functionalization of chemically derived graphene (CDG) to maximize the capacitive performance of supercapacitors. In this chapter, we summarize the recent advances on the design and fabrication of CDG-based supercapacitor electrodes with emphasis on the functionalization methods and their impact on the electrochemical performance. Various CDG-based electrodes, including porous graphene, graphene aerogels and foams, and CDG hybridized with carbon, metal oxides, and conducting polymers are presented and analyzed, along with a discussion of the structure, properties, and capacitive performance of these electrode materials. Perspectives on the future development of high-performance CDG-based supercapacitors and their challenges are also outlined.
