This work reports the effects of activation temperatures on the porous development and electrochemical performance of activated carbons. Herein, activated carbons were prepared from the biowaste of mangosteen peel by using KOH activation at temperatures of 400, 600, and 800 ​°C. The results demonstrate that the specific surface area increases with increasing the activation temperatures in which the well-developed porous structure after KOH activation at 800 ​°C provides the highest specific surface area of 1039 ​m2 ​g−1. At 600 ​°C, the activated carbon delivers the highest specific capacitance value of 182 ​F ​g−1 ​at a current density of 0.5 ​A ​g−1 in 3 ​M KOH aqueous electrolyte. This is correlated well with its high micropore fractions (99%). Moreover, it was found that the activation temperature changes the major contribution of oxygen-containing functional group on surface of activated carbon, which is beneficial for the enhancement of the specific capacitance value of activated carbon at the temperature of 600 ​°C. This work suggests that the activation temperature is a key to optimizing the electrochemical performance of activated carbons. Overall, our activated carbons can be considered as a strong candidate for use as electrode materials in supercapacitors.
