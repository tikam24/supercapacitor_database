We report on preparation of Carbon-Nano-Sphere (CNS), by facial sublimation of Formosa (1,7,7-trimethyl-bicycloheptan, C 10 H 16 O, camphor), to integrate directly as an efficient electrode medium with superior value of specific capacitance, C SP . The synthesized CNS were subjected to Raman, UV–vis spectroscopy, BET and electron microscopy to reveal the structure-property relationship. In analysis, CNS consisted of hetro-structured sp 2 carbon ∼ 1–3 nm, embedded within the sp 3 network. They formed 3D interconnected network of spheres having higher surface area, S A , ∼ 791 m 2 g −1 with electron rich surface environment. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed in 1 M HCl electrolyte for different scan rates. The estimated value of the C SP was 540 Fg −1 at 10 mVs −1 with cyclic stability maintained ∼ 97% at 1000 cycles. The Galvanostatic charge-discharge (CD) measurements, carried out at 1 Ag −1 , indicated the value of C SP ∼ 551 Fg −1 with energy, E D , and power density, P D , 20 Whkg −1 and 250 Wkg −1 , respectively. The process of fabricating active electrode material was simple, environmentally compatible, time and cost effective to achieve effective electrochemical parameters. The double layer charge storage mechanism and nearly no presence of any redox reaction, made CNS suitable candidate for rechargeable supercapacitor application. Details are presented.
