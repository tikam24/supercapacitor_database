The demand for high-performance energy storage devices such as supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries has been increasing to meet the application requirements of renewable energy systems. Here, high energy density aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is assembled based on carbon nanofibers (CNF) network positive electrode and tungsten trioxide (WO3) nanorod bundles negative electrode. Polyaniline-based CNF are prepared by direct carbonization of polyaniline nanofibers. WO3 nanorod bundles are synthesized via a simple sodium chloride assisted hydrothermal process. The CNF//WO3 ASC device operates with a voltage of 1.6 V and achieved a high energy density of 35.3 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 314 W kg-1. Furthermore, the device shows an excellent cycling performance with capacitance retention of 88% after 1000 cycles.
