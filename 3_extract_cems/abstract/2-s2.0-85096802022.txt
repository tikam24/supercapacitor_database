Spinel structure NiCo2O4 suffers from poor electric conductivity and the resulted electrochemical properties in battery/supercapacitor system are still unsatisfied. In this paper, a free-standing electrode based on in-situ growth NiCo2O4 on carbon cloth has been synthesized by a surfactant-assisted solvothermal method (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS). The functional carbon cloth substrate makes unexpected contribution to the electrochemical lithium-ion storage. The assembled supercapacitor possesses ultrahigh pseudocapacitive properties with high mass loading. The specific capacitance of 2832Fg-1 has been obtained at 1Ag-1 current density with maintaining the high rate capability of 1620Fg-1 at 20Ag-1. The obtained nanoneedle NiCo2O4/carbon cloth electrode also maintains a specific capacity of 2000mAhg-1 at 40mAg-1 and exceptional rate performance (1504mAhg-1 at 400mAg-1) when tested as anode material in lithium ion batteries.
