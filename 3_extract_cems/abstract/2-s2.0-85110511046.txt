Developed in this work are the principles for creation of a system to control and governing the energy efficiency of solar panels providing power supply for LED luminaires. Realization of these principles allows the most efficient using the electric power generated by solar panels, to save in a real-time scale the data about system functions as well as provide a complex analysis of these data. Optimization of using the electric energy generated by solar panels will enable to determine the maximum possible power in each specific moment and to automatically tune its consumption. The complex data obtained with this system can be further used for not only statistical fixation of the produced and consumed electric energy in fact but also for prediction of the energy amount that will be generated by these solar panels in future. The analysis of results will enable to optimize the area of solar panels and more exactly determine parameters of electronic components both for illumination systems and designing solar photoelectric stations of various purposes.
