The novel 3D nanoporous nickel molybdate-molybdenum trioxide (NiMoO4/MoO3) was fabricated by a facile template free method to exploit the synergistic effect for charge storage performance. The physicoelectrochemical properties of the composite and pristine materials such as NiO, MoO3, and NiMoO4 electrodes were studied and compared together by using XRD, SEM, BET, HRTEM, XPS, CV, EIS, etc. The analysis showed that the NiMoO4 structure prepared a good substrate for MoO3 particles and resulted in an increase in the optical absorption of the composite electrode. According to electrochemical results, the NiMoO4/MoO3 nanostructure has higher electrical conductivity than other materials with the specific capacitance calculated about 720 FÂ·g-1. The results indicated that, by NiMoO4/MoO3 heterojunction formation, the charge transfer and electrochemical performance were strongly increased. Continuous charge/discharge experiment proved the stability of the NiMoO4/MoO3 electrode during 1000 cycles. However, other electrodes lost their stability sharply; the composite one kept its electrochemical performance during continuous cycles. 3D NiMoO4/MoO3 is a good candidate for using as active material in the structure of supercapacitor devices.
