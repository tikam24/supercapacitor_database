The supercapacitor (SC) and Li-ion battery(BT) hybrid energy storage system(HESS) electric vehicle(EV) is gaining universal attention. The topology is of importance for the SC/BT HESS. A new SC/BT topology HESS with a rule-based energy management strategy for EV was proposed. The BT pack is connected directly to the DC link via a controlled switch. The SC pack is connected to the DC link via a controlled switch. A uni-directional DC/DC converter is connected between the SC pack and the BT pack. The braking regeneration energy is all harvested by the SC pack. The output power of BT pack is limited. The different SC/BT configurations with varied BT maximum Ah capacity factor and SC maximum capacity factor are simulated in ADVISOR. Simulation results show that BT maximum Ah capacity factor has little impact on vehicle acceleration performance and maximum speed. SC maximum capacity factor has significant impact on vehicle acceleration performance and maximum speed. The fuel economy isn't affected.
