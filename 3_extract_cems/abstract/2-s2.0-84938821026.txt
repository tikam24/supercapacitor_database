The discovery of drawable carbon nanotube (CNT) forests opened up the possibility of constructing a wide range of pure CNT macrostructures and sparked interest in developing applications from these structures, especially pure CNT yarns. This chapter reviews the various facets of the drawable CNT forests, synthesis and drawability and their resulting yarns, structures, production methods and properties. It then discusses the potential of the CNT yarns in wearable electronics applications, in particular as flexible sensors and power storage devices.
