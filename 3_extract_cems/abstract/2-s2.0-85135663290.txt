Supercapacitors (SCs) have been widely used in electric vehicles, uninterrupted power supplies, portable electronic devices, aircrafts and so on. The ideal SCs have high energy and power densities, long life cycle and fast charging and discharging rates. Recently graphene and their composites were used as the electrode material to achieve these properties. For the flexible and lightweight SCs, graphite paper was used as the substrate for the graphene electrode. The flexible SCs have maintained its original properties even after bending, rolling and twisting. In the chapter we discussed about the recent developments in graphene-based flexible SCs, fabrication methods for flexible graphene-based electrode, the structural morphology of the fabricated electrode and the electrochemical performance of the device.
