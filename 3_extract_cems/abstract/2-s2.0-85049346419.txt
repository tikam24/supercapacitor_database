We demonstrate an effective approach to increasing supercapacitor energy and power density by fabricating an aqueous symmetric supercapacitor using polyaniline (PANI)/vertical graphene (VG)/Ti electrodes. The network structure of the PANI nanowires and the porous structure of the VG nanosheets facilitate rapid charge/ion migration and provide additional active sites for ion adsorption/exchange to improve electrochemical performance. The fabricated PANI/VG/Ti electrodes demonstrate high specific capacitance (535.7 F g−1 at 40 A g−1 and 461.2 F g−1 at 50 mV s−1) and good rate performance in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. In an aqueous electrolyte, the as-fabricated symmetric supercapacitor exhibits a high energy density of 26.1 W h kg−1 at a power density of 383 W kg−1, a high power density of 4.2 kW kg−1 at an energy density of 6.95 W h kg−1, and excellent long-term cycling stability with approximately 86% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles. These results suggest that devices incorporating the proposed PANI/VG/Ti electrode will have significant potential for use in energy storage applications.
