Manganese oxides have been received increasing interest due to their potential application in supercapacitor electrode material. In this paper, a new metal–organic framework Mn3(MA)(H2O)2(ipa)3 (1) (H2ipa = isophthalic acid; MA = melamine) was synthesized via hydrothermal reaction; it presents a 3D network structure which can be simplified as an unusual non-interpenetrated pseudo-primitive 6-connected cubic topology. The Mn-MOF was regarded as a precursor to prepare variety of manganese oxides via calcination in different environments. Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements were employed to characterize the electrochemical performance of MnOX materials in Na2SO4 electrolyte. The results show that the MnOX materials reveal excellent long-term cycling stability with enhanced capacitance after charge–discharge cycles. The optimum specific capacitance can be 150 F g−1 with a current density of 1.0 A g−1.
