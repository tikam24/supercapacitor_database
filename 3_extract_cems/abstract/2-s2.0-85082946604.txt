The structural design of electrode material plays a vital role in the development of supercapacitor. Here we propose a binder-free bimetallic sulfide (NiCo2S4) nanosheet thin-film electrode with the cross-linked structure synthesized via a robust one-step potentiostatic electrodeposition. The microstructure and morphology are optimized by adjusting the deposition potential (vs Ag/AgCl). Particularly, the 3D cross-linked NiCo2S4 nanosheet thin-film electrode prepared at − 0.9 V delivers the best electrochemical performance, demonstrating a specific capacitance of 1410 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, and high capacitance retention of 98.02% after 2000 cycles at 5 A g−1. The excellent capacitance retention of the electrode from 1 to 10 A g−1 confirms the good rate capability of the prepared sample. This study reveals that the one-step potentiostatic electrodeposition is an effective route for designing and preparing 3D structured thin-film electrode materials by electrodeposition.
