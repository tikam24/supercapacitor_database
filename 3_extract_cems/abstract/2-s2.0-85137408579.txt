Electrochemical energy storage devices are ubiquitous for personal electronics, electric vehicles, smart grids, and future clean energy demand. SCs are EES devices with excellent power density and superior cycling ability. Herein, we focused on the fabrication and DFT calculations of Na3-δ-MnO2 nanocomposite, which has layered MnO2 redox-active sites, supported on carbon cloth. MnO2 has two-dimensional diffusion channels and is not labile to structural changes during intercalation; therefore, it is considered the best substrate for intercalation. Cation pre-intercalation has proven to be an effective way of increasing inter-layered spacing, optimizing the crystal structure, and improving the relevant electrochemical behavior of asymmetric aqueous supercapacitors. We successfully established Na+ pre-intercalated δ-MnO2 nanosheets on carbon cloth via one-pot hydrothermal synthesis. As a cathode, our prepared material exhibited an extended potential window of 0–1.4 V with a remarkable specific capacitance of 546 F g−1(300 F g−1 at 50 A g−1). Moreover, when this cathode was accompanied by an N-AC anode in an asymmetric aqueous supercapacitor, it illustrated exceptional performance (64 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 1225 W kg−1) and incomparable potential window of 2.4 V and 83% capacitance retention over 10,000 cycles with a great Columbic efficiency.
