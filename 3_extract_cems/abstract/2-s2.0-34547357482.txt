Ultracapacitors, also referred to as supercapacitors, are being used into a wide range of applications, where their high power density enables them to supplement or replace batteries. They find use in consumer electronics devices, lighting, power tools, UPSs, windmills, hybrid vehicles, buses and trains, and industrial equipment and perform a variety of energy-storage and power-delivery functions. Maxwell Technologies is developing a high-voltage ultracapacitor module targeting burst power and UPS application, which is highly robust and will find application in the pitch system market as part of wind energy machines. Meanwhile, Advanced Analogic Technologies (AnalogicTech) has introduced a chip as the first supercapacitor charger IC. The AAT4620 is a P-channel current-limited MOSFET power switch for high-side load-switching applications in PC modem cards. The device integrates all the circuitry required to limit current, protect the PC card connector, continuously charge the capacitor, and notify the system.
