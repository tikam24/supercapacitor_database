We demonstrated a facile and scalable synthesis of crystalline hexagonal ZnO nanoflowers/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite (ZnO-NFs/RGO NCs) via direct chemical decomposition of zinc hexacyanoferrate (ZnHCF) over reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanosheets. The phase formation and degree of functionalization of as-synthesized ZnO-NFs/RGO NCs was confirmed from XRD and FT-IR spectroscopic analysis, respectively. The hierarchical ZnO nanoflowers consist of 2D nanosheets wrapped with RGO nanosheets was confirmed from FE-SEM and HR-TEM images. The synthesized ZnO-NFs/RGO NCs exhibits a high specific capacitance of 203 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1 with good rate performance and also showed an excellent electrochemical stability of 98% for 10,000 cycles at high current density of 20 A g−1.
