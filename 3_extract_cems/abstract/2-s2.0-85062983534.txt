Since the development of preparing vanadium oxide-graphene nanohybrids holds great promise recently, we report an HV x O y /rGO nanocomposite with novel microstructure assembling V 3 O 7 ·H 2 O/V 12 O 26 nanobelts and rGO nanosheets by a green facile one-step hydrothermal approach. The HV x O y nanobelts are self-assembled onto surfaces of rGO nanosheets intimately to develop a unique 3D microstructure through the in-situ and self-assembly growth mechanism. By taking full advantages of individual components, synergy has been created that HV x O y nanobelts offer abundant active sites whereas high conductive rGO nanosheets provide conductive bridges for charge transfer and act as conductive support skeletons to keep a robust structure. Evaluated as electrodes for SCs in a two-electrode system, the nanocomposite exhibits an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 813 F·g −1 at 0.5 A·g −1 , a maximum power density of 3000 W·kg −1 , a maximum energy density of 40.7 W·h·kg −1 as well as an ultralong lifespan up to 10,000 cycles with only 7% capacitance decline. As far as we know, the specific capacitance that we have obtained is higher than any of vanadium oxide-related materials which have been used for SCs in previous reports.
