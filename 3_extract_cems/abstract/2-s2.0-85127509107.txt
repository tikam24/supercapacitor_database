Developing high-efficiency bifunctional materials for electro-catalysis and supercapacitors are urgently needed but challenging. Herein, we develop a self-supporting Co–Ni LDH electrode prepared by in-situ growing ZIF-L(Co)@ZIF-L(Co, Ni) on carbon paper followed by a pseudomorphic transformation. The optimized Co–Ni LDH/carbon paper electrodes (CN-2/CP) exhibit excellent electrochemical activity and stability in oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and supercapacitors. The CN-2/CP electrode displays a low overpotential of 230 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and superior stability at 40-h chronopotentiometry for OER. For supercapacitor, the CN-2/CP electrode delivers a high specific capacitance of 1346 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and maintains a capacitance of 88.5% after 7000 charge/discharge cycles at 20 A g−1. Based on the physical and chemical characterization results, the high performance originates from the in-situ electrochemical conversion of metal hydroxide, improved conductivity, fast charge transfer at the interface and unique layered cross morphology providing more active sites.
