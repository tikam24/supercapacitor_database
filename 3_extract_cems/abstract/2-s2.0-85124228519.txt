In modern electric grid system easy integration with renewable energy sources (RES), energy storage systems (ESSs) and electric load is an attractive technology of DC microgrid. This chapter presents with a comparative analysis of proportional integral (PI) and model predictive control (MPC) of multiple input bidirectional DC-DC converter (MIPC) for hybrid energy storage systems (HESS) in DC microgrid applications. The contrasting characteristics of battery and supercapcitor (SC) is the perfect combination of HESS. This MIPC, provides decoupled control of battery and SC power along with energy exchange between storage devices. A controller is designed for DC microgrid applications, modified operation of controller made it possible for both HESS charging and discharging operation thus make it a unified controller. When batteries are used as energy storage, their rate of charge and discharge is very low. So there are current stresses on the battery and reduced life cycle, SC have high power density and can react immediately to sudden load variations. SC alone can’t be used as energy storage device, because it can’t supply power to the load for longer duration. The simulation results are developed for comparative performance of MPC over the PI control schemes. The proposed MPC was better DC grid voltage restoration to step change in PV generation and load demand over traditional PI control scheme.
