The present chapter highlights the fundamentals of supercapacitors (SCs), their classification with the main emphasis on the fabrication of hybrid SC using nanostructured transition metal oxide (TMO) based electrodes. The TMO based electrodes have grabbed the attention of researchers to point out a significant role in the enhancement of the SC device performance such as fast charging-discharging, energy density, power density, and cyclic stability. The tuning of valence charge and dominance of pseudocapacitive behavior is the key to achieve the superior performance of supercapacitors. In this article, we have focused on the hybrid approach to configuring the SC device and obtained enhanced electrochemical performance as compared to symmetric/non-hybrid supercapacitor. Consequently, this chapter provides insights about hybrid supercapacitors along with strategies to enhance cell performance. Furthermore, a glimpse of different TM based electrode material for the Hybrid SC device is also reported.
