Supercapacitors are emerging as a competitive candidate for electrochemical energy storage owing to their greater power outputs and longer cycle life than rechargeable batteries. In this work, a chloropropyl grafted zeolite-NaY modified with imidazolium chloride ionic liquid (Im-Cl IL@ZY) has been successfully synthesized by a chemical method. Notably, the imidazolium chloride ionic liquid enhances the electrical contact between zeolite network and conductive polymer film (poly ortho aminophenol) because of its high conductivity and good compatibility with different substances. The synergistic effect of the most efficient composite endows the hybrid electrode with a high specific capacitance of 665 F/g F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and reliable cycling stability of 88 % capacitance retention after 8000 cycles. Moreover, a symmetric supercapacitor based on the composite electrodes achieves a high energy density of 36.7 W h kg−1 at a power density of 485 W kg−1. Results highlight that POAP/Im-Cl IL@ZY composites are promising materials for energy storage devices with long cycling stability.
