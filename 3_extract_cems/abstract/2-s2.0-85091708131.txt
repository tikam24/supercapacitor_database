Next-generation technologies in the development of energy storage devices are the need of current forefront research to surmount the depletion of fossils. The supercapacitor is one of the most promising energy storage devices with fast charging-discharging within second and exhibit excellent cyclic stability owing to their high power density with high mechanical compliance making them suitable electronic devices as power back-ups for stretchable electronic devices. The numerous options have been explored to increase the functionality of electrode or finding suitable and reliable electrolyte for high energy density and power density. Although it is a challenge for the scientific community and R&D sector to find the appropriate material/electrolyte for the development of supercapacitor. Under these circumstances, the two dimensional (2D) materials including quasi graphene, MXene and transition metal dichalcogenides owing high electrochemical performances attract immense interest towards the supercapacitors. These materials under the virtue of its unique physical and chemical behaviour owing to excellent electrical and mechanical properties with high surface area are well suited for supercapacitor applications. In this review, we briefly present current evolution, comparison of methods and materials in high range, a brief discussion on future directions, challenges and opportunities in the development of electrode material for supercapacitor.
