Fuel cells offer attractive solutions in energy converters. Some fuel cells have been used in large scale vehicles, eg, buses, and others are expected to penetrate a variety of markets. Such fuel cells also benefit small-size, low-power demands, such as wireless MEMS (micro-electromechanical systems), including remote sensors, wearable electronics, and environmental monitoring. This chapter introduces miniaturized fuel cells for wireless MEMS, analyzes their technologies, compares their performance parameters, and discusses a specific device, namely the supercapacitor, to utilize miniaturized fuel cell technologies.
