Two-dimensional transition metal carbide (MXene) is a promising electrode material for supercapacitors because of its excellent electrochemical properties. Here, we report a controllable and facile strategy to prepare a freestanding and flexible N-doped Ti3C2Tx (N–Ti3C2Tx) film electrode with a hydrothermal method using hydrazine hydrate (N2H4∙H2O) as a nitrogen source. At a scan rate of 2 mV s−1, the N–Ti3C2Tx film electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 340 F g−1 and no capacitance degradation after 10,000 cycles in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. These results show that the N–Ti3C2Tx film could be used as an outstanding electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors. The operation of hydrazine treatment provides a more practical and convenient experimental method for N-doping.
