Composites of boron nitride (BN) and carboxylated graphene are prepared for the first time using covalent cross-linking employing the carbodiimide reaction. The BN<inf>1-x</inf>G<inf>x</inf> (x ≈ 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75) obtained are characterized using a variety of spectroscopic techniques and thermogravimetric analysis. The composites show composition-dependent electrical resistivity, the resistivity decreasing with increase in graphene content. The composites exhibit microporosity and the x ≈ 0.75 composite especially exhibits satisfactory performance with high stability as an electrode in supercapacitors. The x ≈ 0.75 composite is also found to be a good electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction in fuel cells. Covalently cross-linked composites of BN and graphene prepared using amide bond chemistry are characterized and their functional properties are investigated. BN<inf>1-x</inf>G<inf>x</inf> (x ≈ 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75) composites show tunable resistivity that is dependent on the composition. The composites are microporous and show satisfactory performance as supercapacitor electrodes and as catalysts in the oxygen reduction reaction.
