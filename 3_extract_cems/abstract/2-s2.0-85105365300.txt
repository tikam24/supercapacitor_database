Potassium iodide (KI) has been added to aqueous-based electrolyte (sulfuric acid/H2SO4) has succeeded in showing the pseudo-capacitance properties that can increase the specific capacitance of supercapacitor cells. The carbon electrodes for supercapacitor cell made from bamboo stems. As supporting data, surface morphology and crystallinity of carbon electrodes have also been analyzed by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization. Whereas in determining specific capacitance of supercapacitor cells, it was carried out using the cyclic voltammetry (CV) method. The CV test results present the addition of KI 0.05 M in 1 M H2SO4solution has increased the specific capacitance from 159F g-1to 200F g-1
