Micron-porous metal wires have attracted great attention because of their important application for fiber-shaped biosensor, energy and catalysis devices. Herein, we report a novel direct-flame approach for in-situ sculpturing micron-porous structures on the surfaces of Ag wire precursors. The heat and H2–CO–O2 mixed gas generated by the flame of ethanol ascribe to the fast creation of micron-pores on the Ag wires. This process is simple, green and cost-effective, avoiding the use of sacrificial materials or templates required by conventional techniques. The obtained micron-porous Ag wire (MPAW) is useable as a high performance self-supported microelectrode for fiber-shaped electrochemical supercapacitors. Moreover, the MPAW is applicable as a highly active and reusable microprobe for surface-enhanced Raman scattering.
