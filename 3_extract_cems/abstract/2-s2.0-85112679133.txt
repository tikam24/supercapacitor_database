Metal-Organic frameworks (MOFs) are the promising electrode materials for the supercapacitors application due to their porous structures and large specific surface area. Here hydrothermal method has been used for the preparation of Ni-MOF for their application as electrode material in supercapacitors. The prepared Ni-MOF material is characterized structurally by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The electrochemical performance of the prepared Ni-MOF material has been studied by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) in 1M KOH aqueous electrolyte solution. We obtained the different values of specific capacitance at different scan rates and current densities. The prepared Ni-MOF material shows a maximum specific capacitance of 234 F g-1 at a current density of 0.43 A g-1.
