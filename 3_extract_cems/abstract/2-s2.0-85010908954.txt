The development of cost- and time-effective methods to synthesize graphene materials is very urgent in order to promote its large-scale application in electrochemical energy storage devices. Herein, graphene materials were synthesized by the electrochemical exfoliation (electrochemical oxidation) of graphite-clay rods with different clay:graphite ratios in aqueous solution and in short reaction time (1 h). The dual role of electrochemical oxidation reaction was presented: (1) the electrochemical oxidation reaction facilitates the exfoliation of pencil graphite leads and in-situ forms functional groups on graphene; (2) the electrochemical oxidation reaction enhances the Faradaic reaction in supercapacitor. The in-situ electrochemical oxidation and functionalization methods can transform low purity graphite to high-value graphene electrode materials for supercapacitors and lithium ion batteries. The specific capacitances of exfoliated graphene are 20-time larger than that of graphite-clay composites. This work provided a value-added way that can transform the low-purity graphite resources to high performance graphene electrode materials.
