Electric vehicles (EVs) have recently received a lot of attention, as has the advancement of battery technology. Despite substantial advancements in battery technology, the existing batteries do not fully match the energy demands of EV power usage. One of the major concerns is non-monotonic energy consumption, which is accompanied by rapid variations during the battery discharge process. This is extremely damaging to the battery's electrochemical process. A viable approach is to combine the battery with a super capacitor, which is essentially an electrochemical cell with a similar design but with a greater rate capability and improved cyclic stability. In this arrangement, the super capacitor may supply the extra energy needed when the battery fails. Aside from the battery and super capacitor as independent elements, creating the architecture of the related hybrid system from an electrical engineering perspective is important. This article goes through the various energy storage technologies for hybrid electric vehicles as well as their advantages and disadvantages. It demonstrates that hybrid energy system technologies based on batteries and super capacitors are best suited for electric vehicle applications. In these paper lead acid battery is used as energy storage device in electric vehicle. In addition of super capacitor with battery, increases efficiency of electric vehicle and life of electric vehicle. This paper also examines the hybrid energy storage system's basic parallel design.
