As a large amount of fluctuated power source connect to power grid, not only the operation and dispatching become more difficult, but also the security and stability become weaker. It is very important and necessary to smooth the fluctuated injection with energy storages, such as being used in a large-scale wind farm. An optimization smoothing method based on hybrid energy storage system (HESS), which is use battery and super capacitor as the storage media, is proposed in this paper. The model of HESS is established as well as the model of dispatching system. Then, the model of short-term optimization dynamic control is established, and the algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is designed. Simulation indicates that the model of dispatching system with HESS in wind farm is reasonable and accuracy enough, the wind power injection is smoother, and the HESS is of higher efficiency.
