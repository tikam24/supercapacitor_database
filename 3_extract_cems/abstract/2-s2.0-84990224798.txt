This work coined a one pot synthesis method for the preparation of sandwiched like Mg/Al layered double hydroxide anchored reduced graphene oxide (RGO@MgAl LDH) nanocomposite for supercapacitor electrode. XRD, FTIR and XPS analysis along with FESEM, AFM and TEM confirmed the sandwiched like structure. Morphological analysis revealed that Mg2+/Al 3+ LDH plates are uniformly grown on the surface of reduced graphene oxide nanosheet. Electrochemical characterization of developed nanocomposites, in 1 M aqueous KOH, gives rise to a specific capacitance of 1334 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 in three electrode cell set up. However, in two electrode configuration, a specific capacitance of 1092.5 F g−1 has been achieved with 1 M TEABF4 (in acetonitrile) as electrolyte at a current density of 2 A g−1. The cyclic stability test shows about 87% retention of specific capacitance after 10000 consecutive charge–discharge cycles at a steady current density of 5 A g−1 in 2 electrode organic electrolyte system. The energy density of the nanocomposite also shows a high value of 388.26 W h Kg−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1 and a power density of 3198.48 W Kg−1 in two electrode organic electrolyte configuration.
