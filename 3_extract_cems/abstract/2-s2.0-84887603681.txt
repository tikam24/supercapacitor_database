Nanosheet-assembled NiO microstructures have been synthesized via a hydrothermal method. The presence of anionic surfactant in the fabrication process initiates the formation of lamellar micelles and a self-assembling process. This leads to the formation of NiO nanosheets and organizes it into microstructures. The effect of preparation temperature on the morphological, structural, and electrochemical properties and stability upon continuous charge/discharge cycles has been examined for supercapacitor applications. Electrochemical analysis demonstrated that NiO nanosheets prepared at 160 C are capable of delivering a specific capacitance of 989 F g-1 at a scan rate of 3 mV s-1 for the potential window of 0-0.6 V. The nanosheets exhibit excellent capacity retention, 97% retention after 1000 continuous charge/discharge cycles, and an energy density of 49.45 W h kg-1. Â© 2013 American Chemical Society.
