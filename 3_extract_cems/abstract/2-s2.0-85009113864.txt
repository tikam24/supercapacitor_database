Polyaniline-tungsten oxide composite films (PANI-WOx) were prepared through concurrent electropolymerization of aniline and electrochemical deposition of tungsten oxide on partial exfoliated graphite (Ex-GF) for pseudocapacitive materials. The influence of aniline to WOxprecursor ratio on pseudocapacitive properties of the afforded PANI-WOx/Ex-GF composite was investigated. PW-2:1/Ex-GF made from the solution containing aniline and WOxprecursor in 2:1 ratio displayed a high specific capacitance (408 F g−1/408 mF cm−2at 1 A g−1/1 mA cm−2) in a wide charge storage potential window of −0.6–0.7 V vs. SCE, leading to a high energy density of 95.8 Wh kg−1at 650 W kg−1. Due to the synergistic effect between WOxand PANI, the composite showed much improved cyclic stability (91.6% capacitance retention after 5000 galvanostatic charge–discharge cycles) compared to similarly prepared PANI/Ex-GF (69.1% capacitance after 5000 charge–discharge cycles). The assembled symmetric model supercapacitor, by using PW-2:1/Ex-GF as both of the electrodes, also displayed good stability and high energy density, demonstrating that the PANI-WOxcomposite is promising electrode material for high-performance supercapacitor.
