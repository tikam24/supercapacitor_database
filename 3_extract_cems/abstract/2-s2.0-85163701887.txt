The paper presents the synthesis of Polyaniline (PANI), it's investigation and complete characterization. In this work the PANI is synthesized with the help of chemical route method and it's morphological, structural, vibrational and electrochemical analysis has been done. The analysis confirms that the PANI is synthesized as required and the same may be used for supercapacitor application. The XRD characterization of PANI showed a wide-ranging peak at 2θ = 24.73° showing the amorphous nature of PANI. The FTIR spectra obtained exhibits all the major peaks of PANI giving the confirmation of successful synthesis. Furthermore, to investigate and to confirm the superior capacitance behavior of PANI, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) analysis was done. The CV curve of PANI revealed distorted rectangular shape and couple of redox peaks confirming the pseudocapacitive behavior. The specific capacitance value obtained was 283.7 Fg-1 at 0.1 Ag-1 current density.
