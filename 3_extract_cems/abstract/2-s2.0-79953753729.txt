An activated carbon (AC)/MnO2 composite electrode material (MAC) was prepared by vacuum impregnation and chemical precipitation methods. The as prepared MAC was characterized by means of SEM, EDS and XRD and its electrochemical performance was investigated by cyclic voltammetry, A. C. impedance and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests. Test results showed that AC particles were coated with Î³-MnO2. Under a current density of 200 mA/g, the specific capacity of the composite reached 417 F/g at first cycle, and declined to 337 F/g after 100 cycles, which was 116% higher than AC. The composite also showed specific capacitances 231 F/g at a higher current density of 200 mA/g, which is 99% higher than AC, exhibiting a better rate performance.
