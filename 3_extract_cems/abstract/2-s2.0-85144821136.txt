In the modern world, miniaturization of electronic devices for various applications is becoming more common. In particular, the development of flexible energy storage devices have received much attention since they have a superior role in the development of newer technologies such as in public wearables, portable electronic devices, and electronic skin proceeds. Considering the high power density, long cycle life, and shelf life as well as outstanding mechanical strength, flexible supercapacitors are one of the integral parts of these new technologies. In the recent past, researchers have developed innumerable nanomaterials to develop supercapacitors. Among these, MoS2 has received much attention due to its several physical and chemical properties, which are more favorable for energy storage applications. Their sheet-like structure, high surface-to-volume ratio, ease of synthesis, flexibility, high mechanical strength, and pseudocapacitive storage mechanism make them potential candidates for flexible storage applications similar to graphene. This review provides recent applications and scope of MoS2 in flexible supercapacitors in both composite forms with other carbon nanomaterials, metal oxides, and polymers as well as MoS2 itself. Also, we will discuss some MoS2-based self-standing devices, which can generate and store energy in a single device.
