In the study, Co3S4/NF@NiCo-LDH nanocomposites were successfully synthesized on nickel foam (NF) by a simple and cost-effective hydrothermal method. The supercapacitors with Co3S4/NF@NiCo-LDH as electrode materials exhibited an ultra-high specific capacitance of 3480.0F g−1 at a current density of 1 A/g. Co3S4/NF@NiCo-LDH//activated carbon (AC) all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (ASS) was assembled with PVA/KOH as the electrolyte. The ASS device exhibits excellent cycling stability of 77.97 % capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 10 A/g. The maxmum energy density of Co3S4/NF@NiCo-LDH//AC ASS was 275.2 Wh kg−1, with the power density of 5760 W kg−1. Especially, the ASS devices connected in different manners presented the typical performances of integrated circuits: voltage enhancement for series devices and current enhancement for parallel devices. Therefore, the study presented great practical potentials for new energy storage devices in integrated circuits.
