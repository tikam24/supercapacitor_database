The rational design of metal-organic framework (MOF)-based materials with a huge specific surface area, high redox activity, and favorable conductivity is currently a hot subject for their potential usage in supercapacitor electrodes. Herein, novel bimetallic MOFs with a flowerlike nanosheet structure grown on the electrospun nanofibers (PPNF@M-Ni MOF, M = Co, Zn, Cu, Fe) have been prepared by controlling the incorporation of various types of metal ions, which display superior electrochemical performance. For example, PPNF@Co-Ni MOF possesses a large specific capacitance of 1096.2 F g-1 (specific capacity of 548.1 C g-1) at 1 A g-1 and excellent rate performance. In addition, an asymmetric solid-state device composed of PPNF@Co-Ni MOF (positive materials) and KOH-activated carbon nanofibers embedded with reduced graphene oxide (negative materials) reaches a maximum energy density of 93.6 Wh kg-1 at the power density of 1600.0 W kg-1 and long cycling life. This work may greatly advance the research toward the design of supported MOF-based electrode materials for a promising prospect in energy conversion and storage.
