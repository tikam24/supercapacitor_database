Polyaniline-manganese dioxide (PAni-MnO2) composites of varying compositions were prepared by in situ chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline monomer in aqueous acidic medium in the presence of different amounts of MnO2 formed in situ by the reaction of MnSO4 with KMnO4. PAni was also synthesized from aniline in acidic solution using ammonium peroxydisulfate as an oxidant for use as a reference material. PAni and PAni-MnO2 composites were characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). FT-IR spectra revealed the formation of PAni and PAni-MnO2 composites. SEM images showed different morphologies of PAni and PAni-MnO2 composites and spherical MnO2 particles were distributed in the PAni matrix. Modified graphite electrode was prepared with PAni and PAni-MnO2 composites using solvent casting technique. Supercapacitive performance of PAni and PAni-MnO2 composites in 0.5M aqueous Na2SO4 electrolytic solution was investigated using cyclic voltammetric and chronopotentiometric techniques. The specific capacitance (Cs) of PAni-MnO2 composites as high as 242Fg-1 could be obtained which was stable up to 1000 cycles at a current density of 0.25Ag-1. Electrochemical capacitors were developed by fabricating graphite electrodes modified with PAni and PAni-MnO2 composite electrodes in the range of 0.0-0.8V. The Cs of the materials was found to be 99 to 242Fg-1 at a current density of 0.10Ag-1 in the potential range of 0.0 to 0.8V. These results indicate that PAni and PAni-MnO2 composites have potential for application in supercapacitors.
