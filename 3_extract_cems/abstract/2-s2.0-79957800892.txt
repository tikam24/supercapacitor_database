Nanoflakes β-Ni(OH)2 microspheres were successfully synthesized by a facile hydrothermal. The microstructures and morphology were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Electrochemical properties studies were carried out using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostaitc charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy methods, respectively. The results exhibited that the β-Ni(OH)2 single electrode had high specific capacitance in KOH electrolyte. A maximum specific capacitance of 1929 F/g could be achieved in 6 M aqueous KOH with 0 to 0.4 V potential at a charge-discharge current density of 6 mA/cm2. Therefore, the obtained nanoflakes β-Ni(OH)2 microspheres can be a potential application electrode material for supercapacitors. © 2011 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
