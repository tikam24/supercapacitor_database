The achievement of excellent electrochemically active materials integrating bifunctional hydrogen evolution and supercapacitor performance is very promising in practice. Herein, metallic 1T′-MoTe2 nanoparticles immobilized on reduced graphene oxide (1T′-MoTe2 NPs/rGO) were constructed by in situ tellurization of uniform MoO2 nanospheres. Benefiting from the interaction between 1T′-MoTe2 NPs and rGO via a C-O-Mo bond, the as-obtained 1T′-MoTe2 NPs/rGO has excellent electrochemical activity and kinetics. As a catalyst, 1T′-MoTe2 NPs/rGO exhibited efficient HER performance, and a high current density (1 A cm-2) has been achieved with an overpotential of 520 mV. Furthermore, the cooperative effect of improved conductivity and increased specific surface areas enables the assembling asymmetric 1T′-MoTe2 NPs/rGO//active carbon supercapacitor to exhibit high energy storage performance (98.8 F g-1 at 1 A g-1), excellent rate capacitance, and high operational stability. This work offers a feasible method to construct a multifunctional nanocomposite for green energy generation and storage.
