A simple strategy of pre-doping lithium ion into carbon negative electrode for lithium ion capacitor was introduced. In this strategy, a kind of Li-containing compound was added directly into the positive electrode of the lithium ion capacitor (LIC). When the lithium ion capacitor was charging first time, the Li-containing compound releases Li+, and the pre-doping of lithium ion into the negative electrode was performed. Here, we developed a lithium ion capacitor using Meso-carbon microbeads (MCMB)/activated carbon (AC) as the negative and positive electrode materials, respectively and use the lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) as the Li-containing compound, which supply the Li+ ions for pre-doping. The results demonstrated that, by adding 20 percent of LiFePO4 into the positive electrode, the efficiency of the capacitor increases from lower than 60% up to higher than 90%, and the capacitor shows good capacitance characteristics and high capacity.
