The research paper is devoted to the development and investigation of the energy storage control system as a part of a frequency-regulated AC drive. The statement of the problem is given and the plant of investigation is described. The structure of a two-loop control system for an energy storage device based on the principles of subordinate control of the coordinates and including the internal loop of the external DC/DC converter current and the external DC-link circuit of the frequency converter is constructed. The research purpose is devoted to the system dynamic properties identification. The structure of control system regulators is disclosed. The results of modeling the control system processes, under the influence of the DC/AC converter test load, simulating the starting and braking modes of a regulated AC drive are presented. The obtained information can be valuable in the control system structure of the energy accumulation device selecting.
