The proceedings contain 21 papers. The topics discussed include: zinc oxide and copper oxide nanostructures: fundamentals and applications; characterization of un-stabilized orthorhombic zirconia synthesized at ambient temperature and pressure; surface physical property of the CrO 2 thin films prepared using a closed chemical vapor deposition method; microstructure dependence of hydrogen sensing properties of palladium functionalized tungsten oxide films; synthesis of ZnO nanowires by hydrothermal technique for integration into chalcopyrite thin films; metal- metal oxide electrode: a promising energy storage candidate for supercapacitor application; resistance change caused by electrochemically induced carrier injection in NiO films; photo-induced changes in the Langmuir adsorption constants of metal oxide layers in self-cleaning cation sensors; and hydrothermally grown nanostructured tungsten trioxide (hydrate) films and their photocatalytic properties.
