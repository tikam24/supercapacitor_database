NiCo2O4/C nanoparticles were prepared by Solid phase sintering method. The structure of synthesized NiCo2O4/C was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), which shows the material belongs to cubic spinel structure. The morphology of NiCo2O4/C by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was proved to be a spherical particle with a uniform size distribution, and the particle size of grain was in the range of 30 to 40 nm. The electrochemical performances of NiCo2O4/C electrodes were investigated by cyclic vohammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge testing in 6 mol/L KOH solution. The results showed that the specific discharge capacitance of NiCo2O4/C electrode was 290.49 F/g between 0 and 0.9 V potential at 50 mA/g current density.
