A simple and effective method for the preparation of water dispersible graphene using sulfonated poly(ether-ether-ketone) (SPEEK) has been described. The SPEEK macromolecules are noncovalently adsorbed on the surface of graphene through π-π interactions. The SPEEK-modified graphene (SPG) forms an aqueous dispersion that is stable for more than six months. An analysis of the ultraviolet-visible spectra shows that the aqueous dispersion of SPG obeys Beer's law and the molar extinction coefficient has been found to be 149.03 mL mg -1 cm -1. Fourier transform infrared, Raman, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses confirm successful reduction and surface modification of graphene. An atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis reveals the formation of a single layer of functionalized graphene. Transmission electron microscopy results are also in good agreement with the AFM analysis and support the formation of single-layer graphene. SPG shows good electrochemical cyclic stability during cyclic voltammetry and charge/discharge process when used as a supercapacitor electrode. A specific capacitance of 476 F g -1 at a current density of 6.6 A g -1 is observed for SPG materials. © 2012 American Chemical Society.
