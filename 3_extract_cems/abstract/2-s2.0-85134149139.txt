It is still a challenge to find an effective solvent system that can simultaneously dissolve the cellulose and lignin in biomass residues to fabricate lignocellulose hydrogels (LHs). Herein, corncob residues from furfural production were pretreated with alkaline peroxide to regulate the lignin content. The lignin/cellulose composites with various lignin content were then dissolved and regenerated by a green and facile ZnCl2/CaCl2 solvent system. The inorganic salt solvents were served as linkers and flexible LHs were obtained. Substrate material containing 10.75% lignin shows the best compressive stress (76.71 kPa). Inspired by its superior ionic conductivity, the hydrogels were assembled into a solid-state electrolyte for a zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitor. This research develops a feasible, simple, and low-cost route for lignin-containing hydrogel preparation and offers insights into the high-value application of agro-industrial lignocellulosic wastes.
