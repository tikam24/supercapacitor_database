Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have gained immense attention as electrode materials for energy storage applications, because of their large porosity as well as high surface area. In this work, a novel needle-like bimetallic MOF (metal = bismuth and molybdenum; BM-MOF) self-assembled in dandelion structure is successfully prepared through a one-pot cathodic electrodeposition route onto nickel foam and directly used as supercapacitor electrode. The fabricated BM-MOF showed a high specific capacity of 476 C g−1 at 10 A g−1, proper rate capability of 43% (from 10 to 100 A g−1) as well as superior cycling performance of 95.1% capacity retention after 8000 cycles at high discharging load of 10 A g−1. These data verified that the fabricated BM-MOF is suitable candidate for charge storage aims. The simple developed electrochemical method is suggested as green synthesis method for fabrication of various bimetallic metal organic frameworks.
