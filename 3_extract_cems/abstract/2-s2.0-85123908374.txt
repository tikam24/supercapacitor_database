Three-dimensional (3D) micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) with superior performances are desirable for miniaturized electronic devices. 3D interdigitated MSCs fabricated by bulk micromachining technologies have been demonstrated for silicon wafers. However, rational design and fabrication technologies of 3D architectures still need to be optimized within a limited footprint area to improve the electrochemical performances of MSCs. Herein, we report a 3D interdigitated MSC based on Si/C/CNT@TiC electrodes with high capacitive properties attributed to the excellent electronic/ionic conductivity of CNT@TiC core–shells with a high aspect ratio morphology. The symmetric MSC presents a maximum specific capacitance of 7.42 mF cm−2 (3.71 F g−1) at 5 mV s−1, and shows an 8 times areal capacitance increment after material coating at each step, fully exploiting the advantage of 3D interdigits with a high aspect ratio. The all-solid-state MSC delivers a high energy density of 0.45 μW h cm−2 (0.22 W h kg−1) at a power density of 10.03 μW h cm−2, and retains ∼98% capacity after 10 000 cycles. The MSC is further integrated on-chip in a low-pass filtering circuit, exhibiting a stable output voltage with a low ripple coefficient of 1.5%. It is believed that this work holds a great promise for metal-carbide-based 3D interdigitated MSCs for energy storage applications.
