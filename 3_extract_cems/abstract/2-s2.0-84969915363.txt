It still remains a big challenge to fabricate a high-energy-density supercapacitor (SC). Herein, an in situ hydrothermal method is developed to fabricate the high-performance MnO2@CoMoO4@Ni electrode, in which the high capacitance of MnO2 and the high electrical conductivity of CoMoO4 nanowires are fully utilized through the closely-contacted core@shell nanostructure. Amazingly, a flexible AC@Ni//MnO2@CoMoO4@Ni asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) has been fabricated, which delivers an ultrahigh energy density (2.63 mW h cm-3) at a power density of 4 mW cm-3; after being charged for 10 s, the device assembled in series by two ASCs can efficiently power 15 light emitting diodes (LEDs, 5 mm-diameter red) for more than 5 minutes. Moreover, the ASC still retains 91.28% capacitance after 10 000 cycles. We hold that a hybrid nanostructure from a high-energy-density material with a high-electric-conductivity material is a promising strategy to acquire high-performance SCs.
