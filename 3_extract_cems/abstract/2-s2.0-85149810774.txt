Increasing energy demands and environmental degradation, have led to augmented demand for the production of cleaner energy. For this purpose, transition metal sulfides along with graphene-based materials have gathered attention as electrode materials for supercapacitor. Herein, manganese-doped chromium sulfide with reduced graphene oxide (Mn-doped Cr2S3/rGO) is synthesized by hydrothermal process as auspicious electrode material due to large specific capacitance, rapid charging and discharging rates, larger energy density and additionally their easy preparatory method, less cost and earth rich resources. Mn-doped Cr2S3/rGO nanocomposite exhibits superb specific capacity of 886.7 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 sweep rate in 1 M KOH electrolyte with outstanding 121.91 Wh kg−1 energy density, as well as 1040 W kg–1 power density. It determines longer cyclic stability having capacitance retention (99.4%) compared to initial capacitance after 3000 cycles. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
