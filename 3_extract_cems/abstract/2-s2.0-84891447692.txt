λ-MnO2 nanoparticles have been successfully synthesized using macromolecules like starch and dextrose. The X-ray diffraction pattern shows the cubic structure of the λ-MnO2. Morphological studies show the synthesized particles to be of nanospherical structure. The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of Mn-O bonds. From the charge-discharge analysis λ-MnO2 was found to exhibit the highest specific capacitance of 384 F g-1 at a specific current discharge of 1 A g-1. The symmetric aqueous supercapacitor device exhibits the 44 F g-1 at a specific current discharge of 1 A g-1. We have obtained higher specific capacitance for λ-MnO2 in three electrode cell configuration and two electrode supercapacitor cells. This is higher than previous reports of λ-MnO2 three electrode cell and two electrode systems. All the three electrochemical measurements (cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and impedance) proved that the λ-MnO2 was a good electrode material for a supercapacitor. © 2013 American Chemical Society.
