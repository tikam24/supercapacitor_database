Ionic conductive hydrogels (ICHs) have received widespread attention as an ideal candidate for flexible electronic devices. However, conventional ICHs failed in widespread applications due to their inability to simultaneously possess high toughness, high ionic conductivity, and anti-freezing properties. Here, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyacrylamide (PAAm) were first dissolved in the zinc chloride solution, in which zinc ions (Zn2+) act as ionic cross-linkers and conducting ions, followed by the introduction of xanthan gum (XG) with a unique structure of trisaccharide side chains into the PVA/PAAm semi-interpenetrating network to prepare a dual-network ICHs (refers as PPXZ). Enabled by the synergistic effect of intermolecular chemical covalent cross-linking and physical cross-linking, PPXZ hydrogels exhibit significantly improved mechanical properties without sacrificing electrical conductivity. Furthermore, PPXZ hydrogels are successfully applied to flexible electronic devices, such as strain sensors and zinc ion hybrid supercapacitors, exhibiting satisfactory sensing sensitivity and cycling stability at a wide temperature range, respectively. Even at a high current density (10 A gâˆ’1), the capacity of the supercapacitor retains 88.24 % after 10,000 cycles. This strategy provides new insight for ICHs in wide temperature-applied flexible electronic devices.
