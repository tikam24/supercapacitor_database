Mesoporous α-Ni(OH) 2 was synthesized by a facile method and investigated as an electrochemical pseudocapacitor material. Structural characterizations reveal that the mesoporous α-Ni(OH) 2 has a narrow pore size distribution of 16 nm and a large surface area of 349 m 2 g - 1. The α-Ni(OH) 2 sample exhibits excellent electrochemical performance at different current densities and good cycling ability, which can be due to its mesoporous structure and large surface area. A maximum specific capacitance of 1718 F g - 1 can be achieved at a scan rate of 5 mV s - 1. These results indicate that the mesoporous α-Ni(OH) 2 is a promising candidate for the supercapacitor electrodes. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
