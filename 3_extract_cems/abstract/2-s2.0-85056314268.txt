A facile, low-cost, and efficient electrochemical exfoliation method is demonstrated to prepare three-dimensional nitrogen-doped graphene frameworks on a large scale. Benefiting from the enhanced specific surface area, increased conductivity and enriched active sites, the nitrogen-doped graphene framework electrode exhibits remarkable capacitance, good cyclic stability, and superior rate capability (65.3% capacitance retention), outperforming most of the reported graphene-based electrodes.
