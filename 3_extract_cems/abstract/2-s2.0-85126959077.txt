Because of the special heterojunction structure, SnO2-NiO has been used as gas sensing material and supercapacitor electrode addition material. But it has been studied less in electrocatalytic oxidation of industrial wastewater. The effect of SnO2-NiO-IrO2 electrode on the electrocatalytic methyl orange solution was studied by adding active oxide IrO2. SnO2-NiO-IrO2/Ti electrodes were prepared by thermal decomposition method. SEM, XRD, XPS, BET, CV, EIS, LSV, TOC, UV, and strengthen life were used to test the microstructure and the catalytic performance. It is shown that the coatings mainly exist in the rutile-phase after adding IrO2. The specific surface area, total pore volume and volt-ampere charge reach the maximum and the oxygen evolution potential and charge transfer resistance reach the minimum value when the IrO2 content is about 23.1mol%. Thus, this electrode has the best degradation effect on methyl orange, which has a maximum degradation rate of 93% and a maximum service life of 678 h.
