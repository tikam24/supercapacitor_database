Supercapacitors are an important energy storage technology that combine the high energy density of batteries with the high power density of capacitors. Freestanding Mn2O3 electrodes fabricated via electrospinning and calcination have the potential to provide high power and energy densities with low fabrication costs. In this work, a theoretical model is produced to describe the effects of the electrospun structure on electrode performance. The model uses theoretical predictions of capacitive and faradaic energy storage, based on system parameters measured from real electrodes to produce a realistic model that can be used for engineering design and optimization of the electrodes. Porosity-controlled discharge time and extremely stable energy densities are predicted by the model. Results are compared to discharge curves of a real electrode to examine model fidelity.
