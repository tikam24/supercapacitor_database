Titanium nitride (TiN) is widely used in electrode materials in fast charging/discharging supercapacitors (SCs) due to its outstanding conductivity. However, the low capacitance of the TiN electrode limits its further application in the SCs. Therefore, the reasonable design of the TiN electrode with high electrochemical and mechanical properties is still a challenge. In this paper, the silicon nanowires/titanium nitride electrode (Si NWs/TiN) is prepared by depositing TiN onto the etched Si nanowires by direct current magnetron sputtering. The Si NWs are prepared by etching silicon in 4.8 M HF/0.02 M AgNO3 aqueous solution for different times (5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min). The mechanism of the effect of etched silicon substrate morphology on the electrochemical performance of Si NWs/TiN electrode was studied. As the etching time increases, the differences of the TiN surface structure, lattice defects and surface chemical composition will change the capacitance performance and charge storage mechanism of the Si NWs/TiN electrode. The prepared Si30 NWs/TiN electrode exhibits an outstanding specific capacitance as high as 113.55 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 with 0.5 M H2SO4 solution as electrolyte. The specific capacitance of the Si30 NWs/TiN electrode is as high as 7.5 times that of the electrode without etching at 100 mV s−1. The Si30 NWs/TiN electrode has an excellent cyclic stability performance, which the electrode has a decay rate of 12.4% after 2000 cycles. This indicates that the electrode has reliable stability. The electrode of the supercapacitor prepared by this method can open up a new way to expand the specific surface area of other transition metal nitride.
