Nitrogen-rich carbon materials attract great attention because of their admirable performance in energy storage and electrocatalysis. However, their conductivity and nitrogen content are somehow contradictory because good conductivity requires high-temperature heat treatment, which decomposes most of the nitrogen species. Herein, we propose a facile method to solve this problem by introducing boron (B) to fix the nitrogen in a three-dimensional (3D) carbon material even at 1000 Â°C. Besides, this N-rich carbon material has a high content of pyrrolic nitrogen due to the selective stabilization of B, which is favorable in electrochemical reactions. Density functional theory (DFT) investigation demonstrates that B reduces the energy level of neighboring N species (especially pyrrolic nitrogen) in the graphene layer, making it difficult to escape. Thus, this carbon material simultaneously, achieves high conductivity (30 S cm-1) and nitrogen content (7.80 atom %), thus showing an outstanding capacitance of 412 F g-1 and excellent rate capability.
