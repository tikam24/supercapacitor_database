This work demonstrates a novel three-dimensional (3D) spiral fiber electrode, fabricated by electrochemically reducing of graphene oxide (GO) on Au wire followed with electrodeposition of CoNi layered double hydroxides (LDHs). The advanced electrode possesses combined features of micro size, good flexibility, high specific capacitance, excellent rate capability, and long cycling life, making it promises great potential as effective energy sources to integrate with other devices for wearable electronics.
