Synthesize the Carbon/nickel oxide compound aerogel with the raw material, such as resorcin, formaldehyde, nickelnitrate and anhydrous sodium carbonate, by sol-gel. It becomes aerogel electrode through supercritical drying from carbon dioxide and subsequent pyrolysis in the inert nitrogen atmosphere at 900°C. This kind of electrode has typical capacitance properties, the specific capacitance is about 263 F/g, and the equivalent series resistance is less than 1Ω by electrochemical testing. The structure topotaxy of the compound materials and its supercapacitor characters have been researched also.
