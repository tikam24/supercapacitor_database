Nanocomposites are gaining high demand for the development of next-generation energy storage devices because of their eco-friendly and cost-effective natures. However, their short-term energy retainability and marginal stability are regarded as hindrances to overcome. In this work, we demonstrate a high-performance supercapacitor fabricated by biocarbon-based MoS2(Bio-C/MoS2) nanoparticles synthesized by a facile hydrothermal approach using date fruits. Here, we report the high specific capacitance for a carbon-based nanocomposite employing the pyrolysis technique of converting agricultural biowaste into a highly affordable energy resource. The biocompatible Bio-C/MoS2nanospheres exhibited a high capacitance of 945 F g-1at a current density of 0.5 A g-1and an excellent reproducing stability of 92% after 10000 charge/discharge cycles. In addition, the Bio-C/MoS2NS showed an exceptional power density of 3800-8000 W kg-1and an energy density of 74.9-157 Wh kg-1. The results would pave a new strategy for design of eco-friendly materials toward the high-performance energy storage technology.
