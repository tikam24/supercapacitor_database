In the developing of wearable electronics and smart textiles, thin, lightweight, and flexible energy storage supercapacitor with high energy density has attracted the attention of many researchers in recent years. In this work, we prepared gel nano-composite electrolyte with the hypergrafted poly (amine-ester) nano-silica (HBPAE-SiO2) as inclusion. The electrochemical properties of the supercapacitor with the alkaline polymer electrolyte were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge behavior, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. It was found that the incorporated HBPAE-SiO2 can greatly increase the specific capacitance of the supercapacitor, which was due to the enhanced ionic conductivity of gel electrolyte as well as good electrode–electrolyte contact. It is pointed out that the electroactivity of the inclusion may be also one reason. The best specific capacitance with 30 wt% HBPAE-SiO2 reached 160 F g−1, which was increased by 36.5 % compared with that of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-KOH system. Moreover, the capacity retention of solid-state supercapacitor can be 88 % after 10,000 cycles. The hypergrafted nano-silica modified polymer gel electrolyte is promising for the application of solid-state supercapacitor.
