The shortage of natural resources due to the progression of the human population and environmental pollution has become crucial concern topics to resolve. One of the best ways to resolve this is to develop renewable energy-based storage systems. Supercapacitors are emerging as promising storage systems via providing rapid charging/discharging and high power delivery, but there is a need to explore low-cost, environment-friendly, non-toxic, abundant, and biodegradable electrode materials for supercapacitors. In this regard, biopolymers are observed to be popular for storage applications as they are of high porosity, cost-effective, easily available, low-weight, and environment friendly and have biodegradability properties. The biopolymer-based electrode has a desirable morphology and high surface area and exhibits admirable electrochemical properties. The focus of this report is to highlight (i) the inclusive details of supercapacitors and their types along with strategies to improve their electrochemical performance, (ii) biopolymers and their types used for supercapacitor applications, (iii) various synthesis routes that could be adopted for designing electrode materials based on biopolymers for supercapacitors, and (iv) challenges and future scope of biopolymers as the electrode material in supercapacitor applications. The detailed study here in this report is found to be a topic of interest for the scientific community to fabricate and prepare low-cost, eco-friendly, high electrochemical performance exhibiting electrode materials for supercapacitor applications.
