Porous polyaniline-ruthenium oxide composite has been synthesized using a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. The result of X-ray diffraction indicates the amorphous nature of polyaniline-ruthenium oxide (PANI-RuO2) composite. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and FT-Raman spectroscopy studies reveal the formation of composite material. The morphology of PANI-RuO2 composite observed using scanning electron microscope (SEM) shows hierarchical nanofibers with small particles grown on the nanofibers. The electrochemical measurement shows that PANI-RuO2 composite electrode material yields specific capacitance of 664F/g and higher capacitance retention (89%) of its initial capacitance after 5000 cycles. The unique structure of PANI-RuO2 composite and the coexistence of conducting PANI with RuO2 are found to be responsible for the superior electrochemical properties. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.
