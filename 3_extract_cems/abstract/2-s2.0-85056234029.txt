Designing nano-composite with elaborate structure is an effective way for enhancing the electrochemical performance. Herein, the nickel sulfide (Ni3S2) nanosheets covered by reduced graphene oxide (rGO) are synthesized directly on the carbon cloth (CC) via an ion-exchange method. The Ni3S2 nanosheets are uniformly arranged on CC matrix, benefitting the electrochemical activity, and the introduced rGO enable the additional ion transport path and prevent Ni3S2 from dissolving into electrolyte during the cycling process. As a result, this elaborately designed rGO@Ni3S2/CC electrode demonstrates a high capacity of 477.37C g−1 at a density current of 2 A g−1 and a decent stability of 88% retention after 5000 cycles. Furthermore, a flexible asymmetric supercapacitor (FASC) is assembled using rGO@Ni3S2/CC as electrode, showing its great potential in portable supercapacitors.
