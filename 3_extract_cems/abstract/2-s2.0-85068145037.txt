Adopting of hydroxides alone as electrode materials exhibit moderate performance due to its poor cycle stability and conductivity. In this study, an ultrathin nanostructure composed of nickel–cobalt layered double hydroxide (Ni–Co LDH) grown on carbon fiber cloth (CFC) has been prepared via a simple and efficient electrodeposition (ED) method without any binder or conductive agent, demonstrating an excellent cycle performance of Ni–Co LDH. The electrode delivers an extraordinary specific capacitance of 1540 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, with excellent rate capability of 1284.5 F g−1 even at 15 A g−1 as well as a great cycling stability of specific capacitance remaining 82.9% after 5000 cycles at 10 A g−1. Then, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device, with Ni–Co LDH as the positive electrode and rGO as the negative one, shows a perfect electrochemical performance. It is believed that in the future, this kind of electrode material will have a widespread application within the realm of electrochemical energy storage.
