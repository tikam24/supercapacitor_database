Two-dimensional Mg-substituted cobalt hydroxides (CoxMgy(OH)z) with different crystal phases were synthesized via a facile reaction of magnesium (Mg) powder and cobalt aqueous solution. The phases of CoxMgy(OH)z (amorphous phase and β phase) were controlled by adjusting the cobalt salt precursors. The obtained hybrid amorphous CoxMgy(OH)z (a-CoxMgy(OH)z) showed excellent specific capacitance (662.2 F g−1, 1 A g−1) than β phase CoxMgy(OH)z (β-CoxMgy(OH)z) and pure Co(OH)2 (p-Co(OH)2). Additionally, the hybrid supercapacitor assembled with a-CoxMgy(OH)z and the activated carbon showed high specific capacitance (77.8 F g−1, 1 A g−1) and ultrahigh cycling stability with 99.7% retention of the first capacitance at 10 A g−1 after 5000 cycles.
