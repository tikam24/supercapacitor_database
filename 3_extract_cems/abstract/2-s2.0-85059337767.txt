CoOâ€“ZnO-based composites have attracted considerable attention for the development of energy storage devices because of their multifunctional characterization and ease of integration with existing components. This paper reports the synthesis of CoO@ZnO (CZ) nanostructures on Ni foam by the chemical bath deposition (CBD) method for facile and eco-friendly supercapacitor applications. The formation of a CoO@ZnO electrode functioned with cobalt, zinc, nickel and oxygen groups was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), low and high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. The as-synthesized hierarchical nanocorn skeleton-like structure of a CoO@ZnO-3h (CZ3h) electrode delivered a higher specific capacitance (Cs) of 1136 F/g at 3 A/g with outstanding cycling performance, showing 98.3% capacitance retention over 3000 cycles in an aqueous 2 M KOH electrolyte solution. This retention was significantly better than that of other prepared electrodes, such as CoO, ZnO, CoO@ZnO-1h (CZ1h), and CoO@ZnO-7h (CZ7h) (274 F/g, 383 F/g, 240 F/g and 537 F/g). This outstanding performance was attributed to the excellent surface morphology of CZ3h, which is responsible for the rapid electron/ion transfer between the electrolyte and the electrode surface area. The enhanced features of the CZ3h electrode highlight potential applications in high performance supercapacitors, solar cells, photocatalysis, and electrocatalysis.
