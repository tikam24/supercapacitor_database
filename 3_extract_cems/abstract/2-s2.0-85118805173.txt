Due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy, energy storage devices are inevitable in DC microgrids to supply reliable power. To limit the use of environmentally unfriendly batteries, a supercapacitor based energy storage is proposed. Uninterruptible power supply capability of a DC microgrid application is achieved through a low frequency switching supercapacitor bank. Supercapacitor charging loss is circumvented by adding a useful load in series to the charging loop. Further the technique eliminates the use of the lossy DC-AC conversion step. Experimental results are provided for LED luminairs, but this concept can be applied to any DC load.
