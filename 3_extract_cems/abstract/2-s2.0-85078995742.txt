2D transition metal carbide (MXene) based flexible films have received increasing attention in the application of energy storage for portable and wearable electronic devices. However, the self-restacking caused by Van der Waals interactions between the layers lead to insufficient access to allow the electrolyte ions to contact the active material. Herein, we rationally utilized the freeze-drying technique to prepare MXene film electrode for alleviating its self-restacking and improving the electrochemical performances. Through freeze-drying treatment, the frozen solvent molecules were removed by sublimation, and alleviating the adverse effect of van der Waals forces and contributing to the enlarged layer space. The constructed freeze-dried MXene (f-MXene) films generate unique porous architecture, which can provide highly efficient ion diffusion and transport channels. Consequently, the typical f-MXene-10 film exhibit good specific capacitance (341.5 F g−1/922.1 F cm−3 at 1 A g−1) and desired capacitance retention of 60.4% from 1 to 10 A g−1. Moreover, the assembled asymmetric device delivered a maximal gravimetric energy density of 6.1 Wh Kg−1, volumetric energy density of 16.4 Wh L−1 and a good capacitance retention of 89.3% after 10,000 cycles. The rationally designed synthesizing route has attractive promise to promote MXene materials for diverse energy and environmental applications.
