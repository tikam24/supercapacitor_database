A novel hybrid nanocomposite consisting of ZnO nanosphere wrapped with VS2 ultrathin nanosheets (cauliflower-like nanoarchitecture) was successfully fabricated by a facile wet chemical method. ZnO nanospheres grew in situ on VS2 nanosheets, which effectively restrained the restack of VS2 nanosheets, leading three-dimensional (3D) nanostructure. With good electrical conductivity, big space void and high specific surface area, the as-prepared ZnO/VS2 nanocomposite presents great potential as high-performance supercapacitor electrode. Detailed electrochemical characterizations show the intriguing structure exhibits extremely excellent supercapacitors performance including high specific capacitance (2695.7 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1) and long term cycling stability (92.7% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles). This study provides the basis for the application of VS2-based hybrid nanoarchitectures in energy storage and other electrochemical devices.
