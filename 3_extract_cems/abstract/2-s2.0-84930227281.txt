Graphene-ceria (CeO2G) nanocomposites were prepared by using a lowerature solution process with different weight percentages of graphene, and their electrochemical properties were investigated. Structural properties of the nanocomposites were studied by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and FTIR spectral analyses. FE-SEM and HRTEM images revealed a "wrinkled paper"-like morphology of the prepared composites. Elemental mapping images were recorded by using the FE-EPMA technique. XPS analyses revealed the binding states of different elements present in the composites. The composite with 5% graphene displayed a specific capacitance of 110 F g-1, according to cyclic voltammetric studies, which is higher than that observed for pure CeO2 (75 F g-1). The significant increase in the specific capacitance suggests that the CeO2G is a promising material for supercapacitor applications.
