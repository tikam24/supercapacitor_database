Asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) with high energy density are assembled based on the pseudocapacitance of both electrodes, which use polyaniline (PANI) nanotubes as positive electrodes and MoO3 nanobelts as negative electrodes in a 1 M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. The assembled novel PANI//MoO3 ASC device with an extended operating voltage window of 2.0 V, in spite of the use of an aqueous electrolyte, exhibits excellent performance such as a high specific capacitance of 518 F g -1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1, reaching an energy density as high as 71.9 W h kg-1 at a power density of 254 W kg -1 and good cycling stability.
