To achieve the autonomous driving, it is essential to adapt Electric power steering (EPS) to 12V system upper size vehicle which mounted Hydraulic Power Steering due to electric power shortage. An auxiliary power supply system using Lithium-ion capacitor has been developed in order to solve the concern. And to mount the system in vehicle with no-cooling system, we improved heat resistance of capacitor. Adding several improvements, JTEKT Lithium-ion capacitor is operated stably under high temperature environment over 100ÂºC.
