Two-dimensional (2D) mesoporous VO2 microarrays have been prepared using an organic–inorganic liquid interface. The units of microarrays consist of needle-like VO2 particles with a mesoporous structure, in which crack-like pores with a pore size of about 2 nm and depth of 20–100 nm are distributed on the particle surface. The liquid interface acts as a template for the formation of the 2D microarrays, as identified from the kinetic observation. Due to the mesoporous structure of the units and high conductivity of the microarray, such 2D VO2 microarrays exhibit a high specific capacitance of 265 F/g at 1 A/g and excellent rate capability (182 F/g at 10 A/g) and cycling stability, suggesting the effect of unique microstructure for improving the electrochemical performance.
