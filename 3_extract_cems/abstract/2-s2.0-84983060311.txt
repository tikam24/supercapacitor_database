As a dual functional redox additive, p-aminophenol (abbr. PAP) simultaneously possessing hydroxyl and amine groups has been incorporated into KOH or H2SO4 electrolyte. It reveals that the PAP concentration and cell configuration play crucial roles in the determination of capacitive behaviors. PAP substance can release two protons and two electrons in KOH solution, whereas one proton and one electron occur in H2SO4 solution. The incorporation of PAP into KOH or H2SO4 solution can markedly elevate the specific capacitance, energy density and both of which remain high cycling stabilities. When designating 15 mmol L−1 PAP in KOH or H2SO4 solution, the increase folds in capacitance are of 2. 2 and 1.4, respectively, and the correlative energy densities can reach up to 7.24, and 8.44 Wh kg−1, respectively. What's more, the redox process in KOH solution is controlled by the surface reaction, while the one in H2SO4 solution indicates the semi-infinite diffusion mechanism.
