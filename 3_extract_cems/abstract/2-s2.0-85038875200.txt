Herein, porous Mn2TiO4/TiO2 composites were successfully fabricated via a facile sol-gel approach. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy results demonstrated that Mn2TiO4/TiO2 composites have pore structure, which not only improves the surface area of the sample but also provide more surface reaction sites. The electrochemical measurements show that such composites electrode possesses a specific capacitance of 98.2 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. Moreover, the capacity retention of the fabricated material is 92.3% after 10,000 cycles in 3 M KOH aqueous electrolyte with a current density of 0.5 A g−1 at room temperature. These excellent results demonstrated that the porous Mn2TiO4/TiO2 composites are promising for high-performance supercapacitors.
