The structural design of transition metal-based electrode materials with gigantic energy storage capabilities is a crucial task. In this work, we report an assembly of thin layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets arrayed throughout the luminal and abluminal parts of polypyrrole tunnels fastened onto both sides of a carbon cloth as a battery-type energy storage system. Electron microscopy images reveal that the resulting electrode (NiCo-LDH@H-PPy@CC, where H-PPy@CC represents carbon cloth-supported hollow polypyrrole fibers) is constructed by combining luminal and abluminal NiCo-LDH nanosheets onto a long polypyrrole tunnel on a carbon cloth. The primary sample shows an excellent specific capacity of 149.16 mAh g-1at 1.0 mA cm-2, a remarkable rate capability of 80.45%, and comprehensive cyclic stability (93.4%). The improved performance is mainly attributed to the strategic organization of the electrode materials with superior Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and conductivity. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor device assembled with NiCo-LDH@H-PPy@CC and vanadium phosphate-incorporated carbon nanofiber (VPO@CNFs900) electrodes contributes a specific energy density of 32.42 Wh kg-1at 3 mA cm-2with a specific power density of 359.16 W kg-1. When the current density is increased by 6-fold, the specific power density reaches 1999.89 W kg-1at a specific energy density of 20.06 Wh kg-1. This is a simple, cost-effective, and convenient synthetic strategy for the synthesis of porous nanosheet arrays assimilated into hollow fiber architectures, which can illuminate the ideal approach for the fabrication of novel materials with an immense potential for energy storage.
