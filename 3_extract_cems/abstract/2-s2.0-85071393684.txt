Electrostatic capacitors have high power density but low energy density. In contrast, batteries and fuel cells have high energy density but low power density. However, supercapacitors can simultaneously achieve both high power density and energy density. Herein, we propose a supercapacitor, in which etched nickel wire was used as a current collector due to its high conductivity. Two redox reactive materials, MnO2 nanoflakes and NiCo2O4 nanoneedles, were used in a hierarchical structure to cover the roughened surface of the Ni wire to maximize the effective surface area. Thus, a specific capacitance, energy density, and power density of 14.4 F/cm3, 2 mWh/cm3, and 0.1 W/cm3, respectively, was obtained via single-electrode experiments. A fiber-shaped supercapacitor was prepared by twisting two electrodes with solid electrolytes made of KOH and polyvinyl alcohol. Although the solid electrolyte had a low ionic conductivity, the energy density and power density were determined to be 0.97 mWh/cm3 and 49.8 mW/cm3, respectively.
