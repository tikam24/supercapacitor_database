In this article, the synthesis of sulfur-doped carbon nanoparticle (S-CNP) by using sulfur powder, carbon disulfide and cow margarine through a simple flame pyrolysis technique, as an efficient energy storage material is reported. The as-prepared S-CNP with a high amount of sulfur atom exhibited excellent electrochemical properties. In electrochemical energy storage application of as prepared S-CNP shows maximum specific capacitance of 337 F g-1 at 1.0 A g-1 current density with excellent specific energy of 37.9 Wh kg-1 and specific power of 1796 W kg-1 in a symmetrical two-electrode cell configuration. The material exhibited magnificent cyclic stability at higher current density of 15 A g-1, retaining up to 89.6% of its initial capacitance after more than 20,000 repetitive chargeâˆ’discharge cycles. This acceptable process of the direct production of sulfur functionalized CNP is a simplistic, inexpensive and bulk production of the nanomaterial prototype for variety of applications together with supercapacitor applications.
