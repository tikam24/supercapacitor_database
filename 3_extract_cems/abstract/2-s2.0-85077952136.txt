A Ni/Co metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and its reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composite has been fabricated through a room-temperature route using simple 3D linker as trimesic acid. The crystalline nature, morphology, functional groups and thermal stability of the prepared materials are characterized via XRD, SEM, Raman and TGA studies. The synthesized Ni/Co-MOF/rGO reveals spherical particles decorated rod-like morphology with a length of ~3–10 μm. The incorporation of rGO into the Ni/Co-MOF enhances conductivity and electrochemical performance. The electrochemical properties of Ni/Co-MOF and its rGO composite are evaluated in 1 M KOH. The produced Ni/Co-MOF/rGO composite (1162 F g−1) exhibits higher specific capacitance than bare Ni/Co-MOF (978 F g−1). The Ni/Co-MOF/rGO composite exposes excellent stability even after 5000 cycles and maintains 109% of its initial capacitance. This result suggests that the fabricated Ni/Co-MOF/rGO composite may be employed as an electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
