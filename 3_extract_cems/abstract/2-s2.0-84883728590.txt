A new type of micro super-capacitor with high working voltage, high over loading, small bulk, and low impedance was fabricated by a new process. The hydrous ruthenium oxide powder was prepared in a solution of RuCl 3·xH2O and NaHCO3. Different composites loaded with certain amount of carbon black were synthesized with this technique. Super-capacitor performance was assessed via cyclic voltammetry (CV), charge-discharge studies (DC), and impedance analysis (AC). The results show that the capacitance and resistivity of ruthenium oxide materials were dependent on the sample annealing temperature. The materials heated at 300° exhibit the highest rate capacitance of 1080 F·g-1. Four to six cells of this capacitor was stacked up in series by conductive films in order to achieve higher working voltage. After packaged in resin, charge/discharge studies and impedance analysis were tested via the electrochemical test system. In the research, super- capacitors with a four-layer structure exhibited fine electrochemical characteristics with high working voltage over 5.5 V and low impedance under 1.5 ohm. Also, it had the ability of high-rate discharge performance and considerable large capacitance. © 2013 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.
