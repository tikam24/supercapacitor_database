In this article, we report the optimization of carrier density of the TiO2 nanotube electrodes for supercapacitor applications. At nanoscale, the properties of metal oxides are impacted to a great extent by the oxygen content in the lattice and the related non-stoichiometry. An ultra high carrier density of 2.73 × 1022 cm−3 is achieved by controlling the fabrication conditions, which is four orders higher than the carrier density of as prepared nanotube electrodes. An in depth analysis has been carried out on every step involved in the fabrication process. A remarkable areal capacitance of 20.09 mFcm−2 is observed at a discharge rate of 0.1 mAcm−2 among the electrodes investigated. The nanotube electrode exhibits a capacitance retention of 68% when the discharge rate is increased ten fold from 0.1 mAcm−2 to 1 mAcm−2 and 90% capacitance after 5000 charge discharge cycles. The enhanced capacitance and stability is attributed to the enhancement in the carrier density by optimization of both the anodization and annealing process.
