Three-dimensional hierarchical honeycomb-like activated porous carbon pillared ultrathin Ni(OH)2 nanosheets (Ni(OH)2 NSs@HAPC) for use as supercapacitor materials were facilely synthesized. With an aid of pine cone flowers as a biomass source, HAPC conducting scaffolds were prepared by the alkali treatment and pyrolysis methods under an inert gas atmosphere. Subsequently, the Ni(OH)2 NSs were synthesized evenly on the surface of HAPC via a solvothermal method. The resulting HAPC and Ni(OH)2 NSs@HAPC composite materials offered free pathways for effective diffusion of electrolyte ions and fast transportation of electrons when employed as an electrode material. The Ni(OH)2 NSs@HAPC composite electrode exhibited excellent electrochemical properties including a relatively high specific capacitance (Csp) value of âˆ¼ 916.4 F/g at 1 A/g with good cycling stability compared to the pristine HAPC and Ni(OH)2 NSs electrodes. Such bio-friendly derived carbon-based materials with transition metal hydroxide/oxide composite materials could be a promising approach for high-performance energy storage devices because of their advantageous properties of cost effectiveness and easy availability.
