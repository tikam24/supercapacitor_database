The PANI (polyaniline) thin films are synthesized on flexible ITO/PET (indium tin oxide/polyethylene terephthalate) substrates by using the drop-casting method. The amount of the PANI for the drop casting varies from 0.04 to 0.16 g. The morphology of the drop-casted PANI films shows a porous vermicular shape. The electrochemical supercapacitor properties of the PANI films are examined in a 0.5-M LiClO4 + PC electrolyte. The PANI films with 0.08 g of PANI show higher current density and considerably higher specific capacitance and capacity retention, compared with other PANI films. The highest specific capacitance of the films with 0.08 g of PANI is found to be âˆ¼120 F/g, and the capacity retention is found to be as high as 70.51% after 100 charge-discharge cycles.
