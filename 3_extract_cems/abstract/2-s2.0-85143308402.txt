The design and fabrication of effective piezoelectric self charging hybrid supercapacitor that efficiently harvest, convert, and store energies in a sustainable and cost-effective way is a cutting edge in the fields of advanced research. However, the output power generated from self charging power devices is insufficient to drive the portable and smart electronic systems. Herein, we fabricated a novel Polyvinyl Alcohol - Potassium hydroxide - Barium Titanate (PVA-KOH-BTO) multifunctional piezoelectrolyte based nanogenerators that potentially convert the mechanical energy to electrical energy. The all-in-one self charging hybrid supercapacitor (SCHSC) was fabricated using two dimensional Bismuthene-hexagonal Boron Nitride nanocomposite (Biene-h-BN NC) as cathode, activated carbon (AC) as anode and the PVA-KOH-BTO as piezoelectrolyte, delivering the specific capacity of 280 C/g at 1 A/g. Moreover, the SCHSC provides the high energy density of 87.5 Wh/kg and the high power density of 11250 W/kg. Remarkably, the self charging performance of SCHSC was investigated by externally applying compressive forces, delivering the maximum self charging potential of 146 mV at the compressive force of 50 N. This research generates a new idea towards the understanding of self charging performance by piezoelectrochemical effect and can be utilized as a potential candidate for the fabrication of futuristic smart electronic devices.
