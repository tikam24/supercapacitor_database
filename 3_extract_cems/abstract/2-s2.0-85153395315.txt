The incorporation of flywheel energy storage system (FESS) is related to competing technologies, in this article. High charge-power may be given while the system is stabilized with the integration of energy storage even with a low-voltage distribution grid. A supplementary advantage with regard to FESS for EV fast charging, that includes a longer lifecycle of the flywheel energy storage, the ability to feed power back into the grid, and easy transportability. As an outcome, the study examined the various types of systems, such as renewable energy systems, AI-assisted Battery Management Systems using FESS, PV -assisted electric vehicles, as well as their comparisons and limitations. The FESS characteristics were discussed and compared to other energy storage technologies, based on recent literatures. The flywheel system's detailed modeling and analysis for backup power and grid support applications will be part of future work.
