The aluminum doped cobalt oxide thin film was prepared through crossed-beam pulsed laser deposition (PLD) of aluminum and cobalt metals in the low-pressure O2/H2 atmosphere. The thin film was etched by NaOH to remove aluminum oxide and then cobalt oxide/hydroxide nanowall array film was obtained. The pseudocapacitive performances of the nanowall array film are tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements in 1 M KOH aqueous solution. When deposited in the atmosphere of O2:H2 = 2:1, the thin film displays a high specific capacitance (690 F g-1) and a superb rate capability (75% capacitance retention from 1 A g-1 to 120 A g-1). In addition, excellent cycling stability is achieved for the film electrode and the specific capacitance degradation is only 0.3% after 1000 cycles. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
