In order to analyze the dynamical characteristics of supercapacitor and predict its state of charge (SOC) and state of health (SOH) correctly, the model of supercapacitor should be built at first. On the basis of analyzing the characteristics of different modeling methods, a system identification method was presented to model the supercapacitor. Because the general error criterion cannot insure the minimal output error, the output error criterion was adopted and a corresponding nonlinear objective function was deduced. Then the particle swarm optimization algorithm was used to solve the problem, and then the model's parameters were obtained. With respect to the structure identification, the final output error (FOE) criterion was introduced. By comparing the value of FOE, the best order of the model was determined. The results of experiments and simulations show that the model presented in the paper can describe the supercapacitor's dynamic characteristics precisely and the modeling method is feasible and valid.
