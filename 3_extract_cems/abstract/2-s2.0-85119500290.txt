In India, e-rickshaws today are an established last-mile commute mode transcending the status earlier held by internal-combustion engine-based auto-rickshaws. With various state governments in India legislating policies in favor of this mode and offering monetary incentives to the e-rickshaw drivers (ERDs) and charging service providers (CSPs), the future of e-rickshaws in India is bright. However, in technical terms this mode falls short of the lifetime it is supposed to sustain. The premature failure of e-rickshaws comes from the technical glitches in the powertrain and the battery which is subjected to constant peak stresses. To resolve this issue of e-rickshaw life, an efficient ultracapacitor/battery-based e-rickshaw system is designed in this article. The system is designed on Matlab/Simulink and simulated with a bidirectional DC-DC converter, valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) battery, ultracapacitor (UC), and a BLDC motor. Moreover, a comparative analysis of two different control strategies namely, Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) and Artificial Neural Network (ANNET) is carried out on the Simulink platform. The results from the analysis of the designed system augment the e-rickshaw system's efficiency and corroborate an increase in its life.
