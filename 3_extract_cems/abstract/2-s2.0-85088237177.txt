Great progress has been made in the preparation and application of mesoporous metal oxide films and materials during the last three decades. Numerous preparation methods and applications of these novel and interesting materials have been reported, and it was demonstrated that mesoporosity has a direct impact on the properties and potential applications of such materials. This Special Issue of Coatings contains a series of ten research articles demonstrating emphatically that various metal oxide materials could be prepared using a number of different methods, and focuses on many areas where these mesoporous materials could be used, such as sensors, solar cells, supercapacitors, photoelectrodes, anti-corrosion agents and bioceramics. Our aim is to present important developments in this fast-moving field, from various groups around the world.
