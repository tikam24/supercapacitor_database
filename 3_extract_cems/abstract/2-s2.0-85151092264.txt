Energy management strategy play a crucial role in the optimal control of energy in pure electric logistics vehicles with hybrid energy storage system (HESS). Aiming at the problem that the energy management strategy of HESS cannot be reasonably allocated according to different slope conditions, this paper adds the road slope coefficient to the input of fuzzy control and designs a fuzzy controller that automatically adjusts the output power of ultracapacitor based on different road slope coefficients. Then, a chaotic particle swarm optimization (CPSO) method is used to optimize the designed fuzzy controller. Finally, the simulation test is carried out under urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS) urban road driving cycle by using Matlab/Simulink. The results show that the improved control strategy can increase the energy utilization by 3.63\% and reduce the battery power consumption by 3.97%. Furthermore, the proposed strategy can improve 30.66% energy utilization and 18.70% ultracapacitor power storage at the downhill situation, and can reduce the energy consumption of the whole vehicle by 5.23%, the average current by 6.19%, and the lithium-ion battery power consumption by 2.20% under the actual urban road gradient.
