A facile, cost-effective synthesis of a Ti3C2Tx (MXene) based polyindole nanocomposite has been explored in detail as both, a cathode and anode, for the fabrication of symmetric and asymmetric supercapacitor devices. The morphological analysis confirmed successful intercalation as well as coating of polyindole on MXene nanosheets. The concentration of polyindole was optimized with respect to MXene for optimum electrochemical performance. Surface area analysis confirmed the highest specific surface area for the MXene-Polyindole composite system with a 3:1 ratio of MXene and polyindole. The high specific capacitance of 226.5 F g-1, at 2 A g-1, current density and excellent cyclic stability of 90.5% after 8000 cycles were achieved for this nanocomposite. The designed asymmetric device with this composite as an anode achieved maximum specific capacitance of 117 F g-1 and energy density of 65.3 Wh kg-1. Most importantly, the MXene based composite displayed excellent electrochemical performance as both an anode and cathode in an asymmetric supercapacitor device. Moreover, the device was used to light up LEDs of different colors and power up a mini fan. With these electrochemical properties, this MXene-based hybrid composite can be considered as a potential candidate for next-generation supercapacitor devices.
