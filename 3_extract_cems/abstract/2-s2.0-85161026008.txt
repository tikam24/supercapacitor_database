Hybrid supercapacitors (SCs) have acquired astonishing features and being recognized as prospective energy storage devices for energy applications. Herein this work, we describe the hydrothermal synthesis of cobalt sulfide and the polymerization of aniline to prepare polyaniline (PANI). Initially, each electrode was tested in three electrode setup in which the CoS/PANI composite showed high electrochemical performance compared to pristine sample. Furthermore, CoS/PANI was studied along with activated carbon (AC) to explore the hybrid SCs application of the prepared composite. In two electrode arrangement, the hybrid device has achieved a remarkable Qs of 123.6 C g-1 at 0.2 A g−1, energy 29.2 Wh kg−1 as well as high specific power 1275 W kg-1. The hybrid SCs also displayed a maximum capacity retain value of 86.4% after 5000 GCD cycles. These results show that the CoS/PANI can be utilized as a best electrode material for the contemporary energy storage devices.
