The large-scale integration of fluctuated power sources makes the operation and dispatch of power system difficult and impacts its secure and stable operation. Therefore the energy storage device is applied to smooth the grid-connecting power. An optimal control method is proposed for the grid-connected large-scale wind farm equipped with the HESS(Hybrid Energy Storage System). With the battery and super capacitor as the energy storage media, a dynamic model of short-term optimal control is built and the corresponding control objectives and constraints are determined. An algorithm based on PSO(Particle Swarm Optimization) is designed to solve the model. The result of a simulation case verifies the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method.
