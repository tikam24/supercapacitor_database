Nickel oxide electrodes, which are promising electrodes for use in energy storage devices, are prepared by cathodic deposition in an ionic liquid containing nickel (II) oxide plating solution. Ni coated steel was annealed in a muffle furnace at 700 K for 30, 45 and 90 minutes. Nickel based steel electrodes were oxidised to NiO with heat treatment and they were transferred to KOH electrolyte to test their electrochemical behaviours. Cyclic voltammograms of NiO coated steel electrode in an alkaline electrolyte have exhibited both rectangular shape and the faradaic peaks between-0.1 V and 0.5 V vs Ag/AgCl reference electrode at sweep rates up to 200 mV s-1. Specific capacitance of nickel film annealed for 45 minutes was greater than that for 30 and 90 minutes. 45 minutes annealed nickel oxide, evaluated by cyclic voltammetry at a scan rate of 10 mV sâˆ’1, illustrates a maximum specific capacitance of 105 mF cm-2.
