Electrical energy plays crucial role for the social and economical development of growing countries all over the world. Now a day's one third area of the whole world's population is facing power crisis. The power crisis can be reduced by implementing renewable energy resources in the power system. This paper provides the information of load frequency control for an interconnected hybrid power system. The proposed hybrid power system comprises of generator of wind turbine (WTG), solar photovoltaic cell (PV), fuel cell arrangement (FC) and ultra capacitor (UC) as energy store house system. The system frequency performance with variation of load has been studied with PI and PID controller. The PID controller is tuned in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment and from simulation results it is observed that the frequency deviation is has been reduced to 22 sec as compared to frequency deviations found in other conventional controllers.
