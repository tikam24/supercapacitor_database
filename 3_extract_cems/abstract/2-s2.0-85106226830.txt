In this work, we used fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) slurry as a carbon source, concentrated sulfuric acid as a sulfur source, and urea as a nitrogen source to prepare N/S-doped carbon material. Preliminary modification of FCC slurry used the oxidizing and sulfonating effects of concentrated sulfuric acid, then urea was added to continue the preparation procedure. Finally, carbonization resulted in a micro/mesoporous carbon material with a high specific surface area (2587 m2 g−1). The doping contents of nitrogen and sulfur in porous carbon materials were 1.46 at.% and 2.33at.%, respectively. Carbonization at 700 °C achieves an optimum balance between specific surface area and heteroatom doping content, which exhibits good electrochemical performance. The carbon electrode prepared in this work was tested in a 6 M KOH and three-electrode system, and the specific capacitance was 326F g−1 (0.5 A g−1). The specific capacitance reached 130F g−1 at 200 A g−1. For a current density of 50 A g−1 over 20,000 constant-current charge and discharge cycles, the specific capacitance retention rate reached 131.4%. The button-type symmetrical supercapacitor assembled with a 6 M KOH solution had an energy density of 15.7 Wh kg−1 at 325 W kg−1.
