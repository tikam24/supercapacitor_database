SuperCapacitors with outstanding features and performance can play the role of an adequate complement to batteries in Electric Vehicles. They allow a significant improvement in their energy efficiency. Since a deep discharge of the SuperCapacitors does not affect their performance, the system proposed in this article allows this deep discharge, even if the cell voltage of SuperCapacitor becomes low. Thus, it is possible to benefit from the maximum energy recovered and stored in the SuperCapacitors. This makes it possible to cover the maximum acceleration's transients by the SuperCapacitor's power. By simulations using Matlab-Simulink and a licensed driving cycle, the system's effectiveness has been verified. Additionally, the usefulness of the system has been proved thought practical tests.
