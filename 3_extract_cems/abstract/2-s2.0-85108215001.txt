Manganese cobalt oxide (MnCo2O4) nanoflakes are synthesized by a simple hydrothermal process. As a supercapacitor electrode material, MnCo2O4 nanoflake exhibits a specific capacitance of 256 Fg−1 at 5 mV s −1 in symmetric two-electrode configuration. The sample shows an outstanding cyclic stability of 85% retention of specific capacitance after 10,000 charge–discharge cycles at 2 A g−1. The MnCo2O4 nanoflake-based supercapacitor material shows an energy density value of 25 Wh kg −1 at a power density of 1 kW kg −1. The present work establishes the suitability of manganese cobalt oxide nanoflakes for supercapacitor electrodes.
