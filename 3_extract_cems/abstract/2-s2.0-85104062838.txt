Herein we show a construction of high-performance supercapacitor electrode made of cerium vanadate uniformly glazed over polypyrrole (CeVO4/Ppy) nanostructures by a simple hydrothermal method, which was characterized by various analytical techniques. Electrochemical studies on CeVO4/Ppy/Ni foam with 1 M KOH show a maximum specific capacitance of 1236 F/g at a current density of 0.75 A/g. These salient features, together with smart interactions between the interconstituents, CeVO4 and Ppy, lead to high conductivity, specific capacitance, and cycling stability with retention of 92.6% capacitance in 10,000 cycles of GCD curves. Additionally, the asymmetric supercapacitor based on activated carbon (AC), AC//CeVO4/Ppy device delivers a high specific capacitance of 116 F/g and energy density of 52.2 Wh/Kg at power density of 675.9 W/kg along with high capacity retention of 77.80% after 10,000 cycles. This system could be scaled up to large-scale production of high power devices, which opens up lot of opportunities in modern electronic industrial applications.
