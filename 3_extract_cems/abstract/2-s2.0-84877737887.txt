Carbon nanotube/Fe3O4 (CNT/Fe3O 4) nanocomposite with well-dispersed Fe3O4 nano-cubes inlaid on the surfaces of carbon nanotubes, was synthesized through an easy and efficient hydrothermal method. The electrochemical behaviors of the nanocomposite were analyzed by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and chronopotentiometry in 6 M KOH electrolyte. Results demonstrated that CNT as the supporting material could significantly improve the supercapacitor (SC) performance of the CNT/Fe3O 4 composite. Comparing with pure Fe3O4, the resulting composite exhibited improved specific capacitances of 117.2 F/g at 10 mA/cm2 (3 times than that of pure Fe3O4), excellent cyclic stability and a maximum energy density of 16.2 Wh/kg. The much improved electrochemical performances could be attributed to the good conductivity of CNTs as well as the anchored Fe3O4 particles on the CNTs. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
