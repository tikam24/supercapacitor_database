Graphene oxide (GO) sheets can form liquid crystals (LCs) in their aqueous dispersions that are more viscous with a stronger LC feature. In this work we combine the viscous LC-GO solution with the blade-coating technique to make GO films, for constructing graphene-based supercapacitors in a scalable way. Reduced GO (rGO) films are prepared by wet chemical methods, using either hydrazine (HZ) or hydroiodic acid (HI). Solid-state supercapacitors with rGO films as electrodes and highly conductive carbon nanotube films as current collectors are fabricated and the capacitive properties of different rGO films are compared. It is found that the HZ-rGO film is superior to the HI-rGO film in achieving high capacitance, owing to the 3D structure of graphene sheets in the electrode. Compared to gelled electrolyte, the use of liquid electrolyte (H2SO4) can further increase the capacitance to 265 F per gram (corresponding to 52 mF per cm2) of the HZ-rGO film.
