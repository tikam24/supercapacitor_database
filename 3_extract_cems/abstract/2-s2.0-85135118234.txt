Supercapacitors are favorable energy storage devices having high energy and power density. Nanostructured metal oxide thin films have become the desired electrode material for energy storage applications due to their higher surface area and appropriate pore size distribution. Herein, a brief literature survey is made regarding metal oxide thin films for supercapacitor application deposited by the spray pyrolysis technique. Many metal oxide films are found with the highest specific capacitance and improved performance in the literature. This approach is a new establishment towards highly needed clean energy, long life, and capable energy-storing performance. It covers energy storage mechanisms, types of supercapacitor, design, development, working, etc. Also, the detailed information on spray pyrolysis, identification of critical spray parameters, and modifying concerns of the parameters to achieve the best performance in a supercapacitor is discussed.
