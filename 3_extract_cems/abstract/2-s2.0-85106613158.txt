Natural wood has become a kind of biomass material with a wide research interest due to its excellent structure, huge quantity, rich variety, and biodegradability. Taking advantages of the unique structure of wood, a series of porous materials with excellent properties such as low density, high specific surface area, high temperature resistance and small expansion coefficient were prepared, and these structures also provided effective space for doping heteroatoms, supporting transition metal oxides and polymers. The composite electrode prepared from wood-based porous carbon and other new conductive materials not only increased the specific surface area, but also had a better electrochemical performance, which provided more new ideas for the optimization of energy storage devices. This paper mainly introduced methods for optimizing the porosity of natural wood, as well as the research progress on the preparation of novel wood-based porous carbon composite materials doped with heteroatoms and supported with transition metal oxides/hydroxides and its application in supercapacitors. Finally, the development prospects were discussed.
