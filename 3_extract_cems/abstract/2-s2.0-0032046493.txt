A control scheme consisting of an artificial neural network (ANN) based-load forecaster, a fuzzy logic based-controller for supercapacitor voltage control, and an expert system for vehicle performance simulation is proposed for the hybrid electric bus. The advantage of the application of artificial intelligence techniques, ANN and fuzzy logic, is mainly due to the computational speed requirement in the real-time environment. Also relevant are the issues of the complex nonlinear dynamics which the classical tools of optimization, regression analysis, harmonic analysis and time-series techniques can barely handle.
