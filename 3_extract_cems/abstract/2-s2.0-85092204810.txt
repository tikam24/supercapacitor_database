With the development of wearable and flexible electronic devices, there is an increasing demand for new types of flexible energy storage power supplies. The flexible supercapacitor has the advantages of fast charging and discharging, high power density, long cycle life, good flexibility, and bendability. Therefore, it exhibits great potential for use in flexible electronics. In flexible supercapacitors, graphene materials are often used as electrode materials due to the advantages of their high specific surface area, high conductivity, good mechanical properties, etc. In this review, the classification of flexible electrodes and some common flexible substrates are firstly summarized. Secondly, we introduced the advantages and disadvantages of five graphene-based materials used in flexible supercapacitors, including graphene quantum dots (GQDs), graphene fibers (GFbs), graphene films (GFs), graphene hydrogels (GHs), and graphene aerogels (GAs). Then, we summarized the latest developments in the application of five graphene-based materials for flexible electrodes. Finally, the defects and outlooks of GQDs, GFbs, GFs, GHs, and GAs used in flexible electrodes are given.
