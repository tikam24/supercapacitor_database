The faradaic redox reaction related to pseudocapacitance that occurs in the bulk of electrode materials can benefit the supercapacitors’ energy storage performance. In this work, a 2D layered α-MnO2 electrode with bulk pseudocapacitance that expands during the electrochemical energy storage process is obtained by a controllable phase transformation of 2D δ-MnO2. This 2D layered material possesses both high capacitance (306.8 F/g at 1 A/g) and superior cycle stability (84.4% after 5000 rounds) owing to its high bulk pseudocapacitance proportion based on the 2D layered structure and stable phase of α-MnO2. Furthermore, a symmetrical device constructed with the 2D layered α-MnO2 electrode also possesses a high energy density of 38.9 W h/kg at a power density of 870.3 W/kg, and it retains 18.1 W h/kg at a power density of 5.8 × 104 W/kg. The results given above reveal that 2D layered α-MnO2, after undergoing phase transformation, can raise the bulk pseudocapacitance utilization and further strengthen the supercapacitors’ energy storage capacity.
