In this work, a series of Bi10Co16O38 (BCO) micro-sheets have been synthesized at different temperatures through a one-step precipitation method. Furthermore, we have investigated the influence of reaction temperature on the capacitive behavior of BCO based electrodes by electrochemical measurements in 2.0 M KOH electrolyte. The results show that BCO based electrodes display favorable electrochemical performances in the potential range from −0.8 V to 0.4 V. In particular, among BCO electrode materials, BCO-3 electrode materials prepared at 50 °C possess the optimal electrochemical performances with higher specific capacity (932.5 C g− 1 at 1.0 A g− 1), excellent rate capability (932.5 C g− 1 at 1.0 A g− 1 and 660.0 C g− 1 at 10.0 A g− 1) and outstanding cyclic stability even at 7.0 A g− 1 after 2000 cycles (up to 83.4% capacity retention). This present work provides a novel electrode material prepared via facile method for highly efficient energy storage.
