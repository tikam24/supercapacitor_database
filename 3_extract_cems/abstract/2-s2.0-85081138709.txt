Energy storage system would play a crucial role in the electric and hybrid vehicle applications. This paper presents modeling, identification and validation of the behavior of two energy storage devices, battery and supercapacitor, used for a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) in electric vehicle applications. Besides of both main storage elements, the HESS includes bi-directional DC/DC power converters suitable for power electronic interface between the battery main energy storage system and the supercapacitor. Design and modeling of the DC/DC power converter is discussed in this study. The electric state-space models of both power sources, battery and supercapacitor, are also developed. And following that lead, the identification of both storage components constituting the HESS is carried out via many optimization methods based on laboratory experimental data of an urban electric vehicle. The obtained results show the good performance of the state space developed models comparing with the experimental results from a test bench developed in our laboratory.
