Molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) and polyaniline (PANI) electrodes were decorated with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) on the basis of a facial hydrothermal and in situ polymerization methods and served in the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC). The MoS 2 and MWCNTs with a mole ratio of 1:1 in MoS 2 |MWCNTs electrode exhibited better electrochemical properties through extensive electrochemical studies, in terms of the highest specific capacitance of 255.8 F/g at 1 A/g, low internal resistance, and notable electrochemical stability with retention of the initial specific capacitance at 91.6% after 1000 cycles. The as-prepared PANI|MWCNTs electrode also exhibited good specific capacitance of 267.5 F/g at 1 A/g and remained 97.9% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles. Then, the ASC with MoS 2 |MWCNTs and PANI|MWCNTs composite electrodes were assembled with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-Na 2 SO 4 gel electrolyte, which displayed good electrochemical performance with the specific capacitance of 138.1 F/g at 1 A/g, and remained the energy density of 15.09 Wh/kg at a high power density of 2217.95 W/kg. This result shows that this ASC device possesses excellent electrochemical properties of high energy density and power output and thus showing a potential application prospect.
