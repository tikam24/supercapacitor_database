N-doped well-aligned thin multiwall carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been prepared by a facile water-assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process using melamine as both the carbon precursor and N-dopant and ferrocene as both the catalyst and carbon precursor. It is shown that the synthetic temperature has strong effects on the growth of carbonaceous structure. Carbon films started to grow at reaction temperature of 700 °C, and the optimal temperature for the synthesis of aligned CNTs, based on the experiment results, was found to be 900 °C. The lengths of the CNTs can be tuned by changing the annealing time of the pyrolysis process, it could reach as long as 40.2 μm. The atomic percentage of nitrogen doping in aligned CNTs could be achieved to 1.71%. It was found that there were many joints and defects in the as-prepared CNTs which may offer more nucleation sites on the chemically inert CNT surface for various specialized applications such as supercapacitor.
