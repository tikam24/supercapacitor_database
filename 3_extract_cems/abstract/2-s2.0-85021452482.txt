Currently, metal molybdates compounds can be prepared by several methods and are considered as prospective electrode materials in many fields because the metal ions possess the ability to exist in several oxidation states. These multiple oxidation states contribute to prolonging the discharge time, improving the energy density, and increasing the cycling stability. The high electrochemical performance of metal molybdates as electrochemical energy storage devices are discussed in this review. According to recent publications and research progress on relevant materials, the investigation of metal molybdate compounds are discussed via three main aspects: synthetic methods, material properties and measured electrochemical performance of these compounds as electrode materials. The recent progress in general metal molybdate nanomaterials for LIBs and supercapacitors are carefully presented here.
