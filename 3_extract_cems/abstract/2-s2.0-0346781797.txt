Amorphous nanostructured ruthenium oxide on carbon was prepared by colloidal method using RuCl 3·xH 2O (39.99wt% Ru) and NaHCO 3 (Aldrich) at pH=5. FTRaman study confirmed that ruthenium complex converted to ruthenium oxide after annealing at 100 °C. The specific capacitance of RuO 2/carbon composite electrode (40wt% Ru) was calculated by using cyclic voltammetry to be 407 F/g. The specific capacitance of RuO 2·nH 2O was estimated to be approximately 840 F/g by subtracting the contribution of double layer capacitance resulting from carbon in the composite. Transmission electron microscopy indicated that the particle size of RuO 2·nH 2O on carbon was approximately 3nm. The observed very high specific capacitance is due to the increase in the utilization of the active material of the amorphous nanostructured RuO 2·nH 2O particles.
