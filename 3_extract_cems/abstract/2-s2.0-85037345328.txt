Nitrogen-enriched porous nanocarbon, graphene, and conductive polymers attract increasing attention for application in supercapacitors. However, electrode materials with a large specific surface area (SSA) and a high nitrogen doping concentration, which is needed for excellent supercapacitors, has not been achieved thus far. Herein, we developed a class of tetracyanoquinodimethane-derived conductive microporous covalent triazine-based frameworks (TCNQ-CTFs) with both high nitrogen content (>8 %) and large SSA (>3600 m2 g−1). These CTFs exhibited excellent specific capacitances with the highest value exceeding 380 F g−1, considerable energy density of 42.8 Wh kg−1, and remarkable cycling stability without any capacitance degradation after 10 000 cycles. This class of CTFs should hold a great potential as high-performance electrode material for electrochemical energy-storage systems.
