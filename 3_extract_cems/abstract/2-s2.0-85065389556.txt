Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a new class of porous organic materials, which are constructed with periodic organic units comprised entirely of light elements (typically C, H, O, N and B) and linked by strong covalent bonds. COFs have been applied in extensive fields, owing to their extraordinary properties in areas such as gas storage and separation, heterogeneous catalysis, sensors, semiconductors, drug delivery, and photoconduction. In particular, the ordered micropore or mesopore structures, high surface areas, and designable structures have enabled COFs to become new candidates for supercapacitor electrode materials. This Minireview focuses on the major progress of COFs as electrode materials for supercapacitors.
