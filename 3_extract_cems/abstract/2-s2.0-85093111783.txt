At present, electric vehicles have a general problem of short battery life and short travel distance. Therefore, introducing supercapacitors and DC/DC converters to form a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) with the battery to make up for the lack of pure battery energy. In this paper, a control strategy for an on-board hybrid energy storage system based on PI control is proposed. First of all, This strategy is through energy management strategy to distribute the required power, and then by changing the duty cycle of the IGBT switch in the DC-DC converter, to control the battery and supercapacitor output currents and to keep the DC bus voltage stable. The simulation results on the build simulation model, Simulink, shows that the proposed control method can accurately track the reference values of battery current and supercapacitor current and stabilize the DC bus voltage, which proves the effectiveness of the control strategy.
