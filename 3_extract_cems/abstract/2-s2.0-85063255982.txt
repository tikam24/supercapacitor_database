The existence of the oxygen-containing functional groups on MXene surface makes it a potential electrode material in supercapacitor based on a redox mechanism. However, the irreversible stacking of MXenes will lead to an insufficient utilization of these functional groups. To solve this problem, we fabricated a composite electrode comprised of 2D delaminated Ti 3 C 2 sheets (d-Ti 3 C 2 ) and 3D Ni foam (NF) by electrostatic self-assembly. In this electrode, d-Ti 3 C 2 nanosheets are adsorbed on the surface of 3D Ni foam skeleton structure, eliminating the need for insulative polymer binders. The self-assembly strategy endows d-Ti 3 C 2 /NF composites with unique 2D/3D structure which possesses the merits of excellent conductivity, sufficient active sites, high charge transfer efficiency and short ions diffusion path. As a result, the d-Ti 3 C 2 /NF composite electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance up to 654 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 and good cycling stability. An asymmetrical supercapacitor with d-Ti 3 C 2 /NF composite as a positive electrode, bulk Ti 3 C 2 (b-Ti 3 C 2 ) as a negative electrode and 6 M KOH as electrolyte, exhibits a maximum energy density of 18.1 Wh kg −1 (at 397.8 W kg −1 ) and excellent cycling stability (80.6% after 5000 cycles). The results indicate that d-Ti 3 C 2 /NF composite is a promising electrode material for practical energy storage devices.
