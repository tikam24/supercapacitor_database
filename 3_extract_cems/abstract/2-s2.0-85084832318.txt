A mesoporous soft carbon has been prepared using a novel method based on aggregation to metal nanoparticles, along with heat treatment of a nitrogen-rich precursor designated as quinolone pitch. From this newly prepared method using quinolone pitch and nickel acetate, mesoporous soft carbon has been prepared. This mesoporous soft carbon exhibits increased capacitance by anodic oxidation in non-aqueous lithium salt electrolyte, even though the activation effect was limited compared with previous reports.
