The emerging CuCo2O4 is a promising electrode material for supercapacitors, while the low conductivity and volume expansion limit the specific capacity and rate performance. Here, a facile solvothermal method is used to synthesize hierarchical flower-like CuCo2O4/CuO. Then the CuCo2O4/CuO that crosslinked with carbon nanotubes could form a 3D conductive network and lead to a superior electrochemical performance. As-prepared material CuCo2O4/CuO/carbon nanotubes exhibit a specific capacitance of 1084 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 and excellent cycling stability of 97.8% retention after 9000 cycles. Moreover, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor coupled with active carbon demonstrates an extraordinary cycling stability (86.8% after 9000 cycles).
