The current paper describes chemically grown polyaniline (PANI) nanofibers on porous three dimensional graphene (PANI/3D graphene) as a supercapacitor electrode material with enhanced electrochemical performance. The chemical and structural properties of the electrode are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy with confirmation of a semi-crystalline nature. The homogeneous growth of PANI on the 3D graphene network is visualized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and shows a nanofibers-based morphology. The maximum specific capacitance of the PANI/3D graphene electrode is found to be ∼1024 F g -1 in 1 M H2SO4 within the potential window of -150 to 800 mV vs. Ag/AgCl at 10 mV s-1 scan rate (∼1002 F g -1 at 1 mA cm-2 discharge current density). The high surface area offered by the conducting, porous 3D graphene framework stimulates effective utilization of the deposited PANI and improves electrochemical charge transport and storage. This signifies that the 3D graphene framework is a proficient contender for high-performance capacitor electrodes in energy storage applications. This journal is © the Partner Organisations 2014.
