In this work, a Co9S8/NiS composite is successfully electrodeposited on Ni foam using a cyclic voltammetry method. This method is one of several effective strategies for the in-situ growth of self-supporting arrays for electrode material, which facilitates the effective combination of Co9S8 and NiS coated on the skeleton of Ni foam without any binder. The presence of wrinkle stripes on the surface of Co9S8/NiS composite provides abundant active sites. As expected, the Co9S8/NiS composite exhibits a high capacitance (2288 F g−1 and 2.52 F cm−2 at 1.0 A g−1). Furthermore, Co9S8-NiS/NF//N-rGO/NF HSCs device delivers a maximum specific energy of 47.41 Wh kg−1 at the specific power of 400 W kg−1. This work demonstrates the great potential of the Co9S8/NiS composite in supercapacitors and provides an effective reference scheme for the preparing the metal sulfide materials with enhanced charge storage performance.
