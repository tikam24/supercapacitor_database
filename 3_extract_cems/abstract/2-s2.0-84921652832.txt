An integrated electrode consisting of hybrid nanonet/nanoflake NiCo2O4grown on stainless steel mesh substrates exhibits a high specific capacitance while maintaining high-rate capability and good cycling stability. The specific capacitance reaches a maximum of 911 F g−1at a current density of 10 A g−1, which can still retain 864 F g−1(94.8 % retention) after 10,000 cycles. These much-improved electrochemical performances are attributed to the unique architecture of NiCo2O4electrode. The interconnected nanonet NiCo2O4with an ultrahigh surface area significantly facilitates the rapid ion/electron transport and guarantees good mechanical adhesion, while the ultrathin nanoflakes further extend the active sites for fast redox reactions for efficient energy storage.
