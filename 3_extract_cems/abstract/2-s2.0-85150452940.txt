Solar energy is set to play a major role in decarbonising the economy and creating a zero-emissions future. However, there is a need to store this abundant energy and, in many instances, supply that energy at a high rate. With large expense and efficiency losses in integration through external circuits, a monolithic two-electrode harvest storage device or photo-supercapacitor with a high-power density and stable life cycles is an exciting challenge. Here we review the most recent advancements in photo-supercapacitors and some approaches to overcoming various challenges to delivering a marketable device.
