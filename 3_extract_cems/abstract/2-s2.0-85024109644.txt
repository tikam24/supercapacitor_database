The appeal of portable electronic devices is growing gradually, which increases the demand for flexible and renewable energy storage devices. Hybrid materials can be used as renewable and flexible electrode material for this kind of devices. Organic-inorganic hybrid materials represent a creative substitute to design new materials and composites by accepting advantages of both materials. This paper reports the possibility of renewable cellulose and graphene composite as an electrode material for energy storage device such as supercapacitor. The morphology and structure of the nanocomposite are studied using scanning electron microscope and Energy-dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy. The performance of the composite as supercapacitor electrode material is evaluated by cyclic voltammograms and galvanostatic charge-discharge curves.
