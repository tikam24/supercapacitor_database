This paper demonstrates excellent capacitive performance of the pulverized graphite in an organic electrolyte. Strong shearing force of ball milling pulverized graphite and resulted in the low crystallinity carbons with high specific surface areas. The obtained carbons were employed as electrode materials in electric double-layer capacitors with an organic electrolyte. They exhibited high volumetric capacitance and excellent rate performance compared to conventional microporous activated carbon. This was attributed to the high density of the electrodes, the high electrical conductivity of the materials, and their mesopore-rich structures. In addition, their durability was comparable to or even better than that of microporous activated carbon.
