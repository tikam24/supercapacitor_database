In the last years the research activity in the ield o real time simulation and virtual testin has ro n very uic ly The reason o this interest, especially y the scienti ic community, is due to the increasin complexity o control systems and the availa ility o lo cost real-time hard are architectures In this paper, the hard are in the loop simulation is used in order to determine the advanta es introduced y the usin o supercapacitor recovery system or elevator as unction o the tra ic schedulin al orithm Â© 2004 IEEE.
