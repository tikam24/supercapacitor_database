To suppress the agglomeration of bare CoNi2S4 during the charging and discharging process, herein, Baoqing lignite has been utilized as the raw material, extracted with KOH and melamine solution, and annealed to nitrogen-doped lignite-based porous carbon (NPC), which was subsequently composited with CoNi2S4 by a facile and efficient hydrothermal method. In the CoNi2S4/nitrogen-doped lignite-based porous carbon composites (CoNi2S4/NPC), CoNi2S4 particles are uniformly dispersed on NPC. The as-prepared CoNi2S4/NPC have displayed excellent electrochemical properties with high specific capacitance and good cycle performance. The composites possess a high specific capacitance of 1534.24 F g−1 at a current density of 4 A g−1. The hybrid supercapacitor assembled by the CoNi2S4/NPC cathode and the activated carbon anode has demonstrated a high energy density of 48.58 Wh kg−1 at 400 W kg−1. Moreover, the capacitance retention of the hybrid supercapacitor is 82.42% after 5000 cycles.
