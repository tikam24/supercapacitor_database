The demand for flexible supercapacitor sustaining green energy can go a long way in mitigating the issue of no power source in wearable electronics. Herein, a novel strategy is used to develop a self-charging supercapacitor using lead-free perovskites as piezoelectrodes and polyvinyl alcohol-potassium hydroxide (PVA-KOH) film as ionogelled electrolyte. This approach is unique as the existing conventional self-powered devices are based only on piezoelectric electrolytes. The all-solid-state supercapacitor is asymmetric, with nickel stannate (NiSnO3) acting as the positrode and ferrous stannate (FeSnO3) as the negatrode. These materials are non-toxic, environment-friendly, and bio-compatible, making them suitable for wearable electronics. The value of specific capacitance of FeSnO3 is 2853 F gâ€“1, the highest among the perovskite-based electrodes. The self-charging characteristics of the fabricated supercapacitor are analyzed by bending, twisting, and subjecting it to compressive forces of varying magnitude. A maximum voltage of 266 mV is recorded through the self-charging phenomenon. All these tests approve that the fabricated perovskite-based supercapacitor is highly flexible, robust, stable, and has considerable electrochemical and self-charging potential. The present study focuses on understanding the piezoelectric effect in self-charging supercapacitors and offering a viable power option for self-powered wearable devices in the future.
