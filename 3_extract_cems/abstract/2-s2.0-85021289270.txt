A ternary composite of PTP/PANI/TiO2 was synthesized using in situ oxidative polymerization. Material design involves the blending of the two polymers namely polyaniline and polythiophene and further incorporating TiO2 particles in the blended polymer matrix. TiO2 being transition metal oxide possesses variable oxidation states leading to excellent pseudocapacitive properties, owing to the synergy of the inorganic filler (TiO2). PTP/PANI/TiO2 ternary composite exhibits improved capacitive performance as compared to its constituents in pristine form. This ternary composite exhibits the maximum specific capacitance of 265 F g−1 as measured by galvanostatic charging-discharging (GCD) at 1 A g−1. Further, the hybrid composite was also characterized to possess an energy density of 9.09 Wh kg−1 at 1 A g−1 and a power density of 3770 W kg−1 at a current density of 10 A g−1.
