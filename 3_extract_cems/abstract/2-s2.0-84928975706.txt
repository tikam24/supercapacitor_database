In this work, we have fabricated a piezoelectric-driven self-charging supercapacitor power cell (SCSPC) using MnO<inf>2</inf> nanowires as positive and negative electrodes and a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)-ZnO film as a separator (as well as a piezoelectric), which directly converts mechanical energy into electrochemical energy. Such a SCSPC consists of a nanogenerator, a supercapacitor, and a power-management system, which can be directly used as a power source. The self-charging capability of SCSPC was demonstrated by mechanical deformation under human palm impact. The SCSPC can be charged to 110 mV (aluminum foil) in 300 s under palm impact. In addition, the green light-emitting diode glowed using serially connected SCSPC as the power source. This finding opens up the possibility of making self-powered flexible hybrid electronic devices.
