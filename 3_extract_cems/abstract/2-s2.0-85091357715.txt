The effect of the presence of Fe (II) or Fe (III) ions in solutions for obtaining thin films of manganese dioxide (MD) on their capacitive properties has been studied by the cyclic voltammetry. Optimal conditions of electrochemical method of producing films on a platinum anode have been established. Incorporation of iron ions in the crystal lattice of MD increased the capacity of the film and improved appearance of cyclic voltammogram which approached a rectangular shape. Films with the thickness up to ~150 nm after 1000 cycles lost about 10% of capacitance and retained their shape whereas for thicker films capacitive properties noticeably deteriorated. It was shown that Fe (II) ions were chemisorbed and Fe (III) ions were adsorbed without charge transfer on the surface of the MD and thus were incorporated in its structure. At the same time, the capacity of MD films obtained in the presence of Fe (III) ions increased compared to films obtained in solutions containing Fe (II) ions. The capacity of the ~50 nm film obtained in the presence of Fe (III) ions, at 20th CV cycle was equal to 460 F/g.
