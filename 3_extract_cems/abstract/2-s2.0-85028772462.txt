A novel strategy has been developed to generate B, N co-doped carbon materials (CNBs) through the pyrolysis of boronate polymer nanoparticles (BPNs) derived from the condensation reaction between catechol and boronic monomers. The morphology, surface area and heteroatom (viz. B and N) content of the CNBs can be easily adjusted by altering the molar ratio between catechol and boronic monomers. The supercapacitor and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance of the CNBs are optimized. CNBs derived from equal molar ratio of catechol and boronic monomers exhibit favorable performance for supercapacitor, featuring a specific capacitance of up to 299.4 F/g at 0.2 A/g, an improved rate capability and excellent cycle stability. Notably, CNBs prepared using 1/2 molar ratio of catechol to boronic monomers show excellent ORR performance, as they demonstrate good electrocatalytic activity, high tolerance for methanol and long durability. Our findings may be of interest in the design of carbon materials with optimized electrochemical properties through the control over surface area and the content of heteroatom.
