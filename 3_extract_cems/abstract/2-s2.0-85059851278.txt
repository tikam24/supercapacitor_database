In order to enhance the performance of supercapacitor and reduce environmental pollution as far as possible, electrode materials especially low-cost and eco-friendly electrode materials with high energy density have attracted a great deal of attention. In this paper, Bi 2 WO 6 /CNOs (CNOs, Carbon Nano Onions) and Bi 2 WO 6 nanocomposites have been synthesized via a hydrothermal method. And the structures and morphologies of samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical performances of the as-prepared samples were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge - discharge measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. At a current density of 2 mA•cm -2 , the specific capacitance of the Bi 2 WO 6 /CN¬Os and Bi 2 WO 6 was 328 F•g -1 and 218 F•g -1 with 1 mol•L -1 KOH served as electrolyte, respectively. After 300 charge-discharge cycles at a current density of 5 mA•cm -2 , the specific capacitance of the Bi 2 WO 6 /CNOs improved 34.37% compared with pure Bi 2 WO 6 . Thus, CNOs can enhance the electrochemical performance of Bi 2 WO 6 obvously.
