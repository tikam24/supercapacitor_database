Thanks to the attractive structural characteristics and unique physicochemical properties, mixed metal selenides (MMSes) can be considered as encouraging electrode materials for energy storage devices. Herein, a straightforward and efficient approach is used to construct multi-shelled nickel-manganese selenide hollow spheres (MSNMSeHSs) as cathode and double-shell nickel-iron selenide hollow spheres (DSNFSeHSs) as anode electrode materials by tuning shell numbers for supercapacitors. The as-designed MSNMSeHS electrode can deliver a splendid capacity of ∼339.2 mA h g-1/1221.1 C g-1, impressive rate performances of 78.8%, and considerable longevity of 95.7%. The considerable performance is also observed for the DSNFSeHS electrode with a capacity of 258.4 mA h g-1/930.25 C g-1, rate performance of 75.5%, and longevity of 90.9%. An efficient asymmetric apparatus (MSNMSeHS||DSNFSeHS) fabricated by these two electrodes depicts the excellent electrochemical features (energy density of ≈112.6 W h kg-1 at 900.8 W kg-1) with desirable longevity of ≈94.4%.
