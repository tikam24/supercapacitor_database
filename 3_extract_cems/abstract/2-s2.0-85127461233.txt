Porous three-dimensional (3D) structures generally improve the performance of electrodes by increasing their active surface area and the diffusion speed of electrolyte ions during charging/discharging. Three-dimensional polypyrrole (PPy) based films were created by electrodepositing PPy in the presence of varying amounts of chloride anions (Cl−) and polyanionic ribbonlike nanoparticles (carboxylated cellulose nanocrystals (CNC-COO−)) as scaffold material. The assembly mechanism of the 3D PPy electrodes combines the effect of different nucleation and growth mechanisms during electropolymerization and deposition of the formed PPy with CNC-COO− and with Cl−. The highest area capacitance of these electrode materials was 1.39 F cm−2 (150.2 F g−1) at a current density of 1 mA cm−2 (0.1 A g−1). More importantly, at a high current density of 20 mA cm−2 (2.2 A g−1), the thick (ca. 130 μm), 3D, and high mass loading (9.2 mg cm−2) Cl−:CNC-COO−/PPy films exhibited an excellent areal capacitance of 0.85 F cm−2 (70.8 F g−1), increasing about 16% over CNC-COO−/PPy films prepared without Cl− present during electrodeposition. In addition, an aqueous Cl−:CNC-COO−/PPy (with Cl−:CNC-COO− = 2.0) symmetric supercapacitor had an outstanding energy density of 41.15 μWh cm−2 (4.46 Wh kg−1) and excellent cycling stability, while even improving on its original areal capacitance (to 111.2% of its original capacitance) after cycling 3000 cycles at 8 mA cm−2, indicating their potential in energy storage devices.
