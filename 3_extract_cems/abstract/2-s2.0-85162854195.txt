The introduction of a energy storage system into the wind farm to form a wind storage combined system may effectively improve the ability of active support to the power grid. While meeting the primary frequency modulation demand, this new system also improves the utilization rate of the wind power and increase the economic benefits of the wind farm. The paper, taking the double fed induction generator (DFIG) and the supercapacitor energy storage as examples, proposes a control strategy of the wind storage combined system participating in primary frequency modulation based on the ability of the frequency modulation of the DFIG under different wind speeds. Considering the three factors of the wind speed, the frequency change rate and the frequency deviation, the multivariable fuzzy logic controller is designed to realize the reasonable distribution of the wind storage power. In addition, the dynamic spare capacity of the DFIG participating in the frequency modulation is configured according to the states of charge (SOC) of the energy storage system. So the primary frequency modulation capability of the wind storage combined system under different wind conditions is improved. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified on the MATLAB/Simulink simulation platform. The results show that the proposed strategy not only improves the primary frequency modulation capability of the wind storage combined system, but also realizes the reasonable distribution of the wind storage frequency modulation power, which solves the problems of wind abandonment and wind turbine output oscillation, improving the frequency stability of the system.
