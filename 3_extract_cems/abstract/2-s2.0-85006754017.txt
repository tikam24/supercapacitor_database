Mesoporous Ni(OH)2/Co(OH)2 electrode materials were synthesized via a simple one-pot procedure by combining homogeneous precipitation and stepwise precipitation method. The configuration of the porous Ni(OH)2/Co(OH)2 electrode materials synthesized provides 3D electron transmission channels through a high conductive Co(OH)2 distributed in the peripheral nanolayer of the composites, which is beneficial to rate capability and cycle stability. The Ni(OH)2/Co(OH)2 electrode materials have a specific surface area of 229 m2 g−1, which is approximately 40% higher than that of Ni(OH)2 (163 m2 g−1). Their specific capacitance is up to 1202 and 1022 F g−1 at the current densities of 10 and 20 A g−1, respectively. Furthermore, the capacitance retention of the electrode materials at the current density of 10 A g−1 is 98% after 5000 cycles. The synthesis method provides a novel simple route to fabricate heterostructure materials for capacitors with high electrochemical performance. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
