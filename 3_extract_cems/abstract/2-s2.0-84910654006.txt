An efficient way to make new type of energy storage electrode is to combine different materials to make full use of their respective characteristics. A ternary supercapacitor electrode consisting of polyaniline, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and carbon fibers (CFs) with high electrochemical performance is reported. A bundle of CFs is wrapped with RGO possessing unique three dimensional porous structure. CFs act as scaffolds in the hybrid materials to ensure a continuous entity, while RGO possesses high specific surface area and provides a large number of pores for the formation of electrochemical double layers. The added polyaniline on RGO sheet surfaces further enhances electrochemical capability of the composite electrode because of its pseudo-capacitance characteristics. Such a ternary supercapacitor electrode takes full advantage of each component and demonstrates the potential as innovative supercapacitors.
