In this paper, the typical structure and operation modes of the super capacitor energy-storage system using in the electric driving system is analysed in detail. Following the principle that the volume of the super capacitor is used fully, the basic operation modes of the system is determined , and the necessity is analysed that the energy stored into the super capacitor is totally generated by the motor during the braking process and the energy consumed during discharging is completely from the super capacitor. The running control target of the system is also determined according to this principle. On the basis of the analysis of the energy-storage converter working characteristic and the regulation of the main parameters, the basic structure and design method of the running controller of the energystorage system are determined, and the controller is designed in detail.
