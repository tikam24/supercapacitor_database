Transition metal compound electrodes are promising in the preparation of high-performance supercapacitors (SCs) due to their significantly enhanced charge mass transfer and rich electrochemical active sites. Possessing a large electrochemical surface area combined with a good conductive copper foam is a way to improve the capacitive performance of the electrode. Here, we report the synthesis of NiCo-P three-dimensional nanosheet structures (expressed as Cu@NCP) on copper foam as a high-performance electrode material for supercapacitors. The presence of multivalent cations in this Cu@NCP electrode material enables abundant redox reactions and promotes synergistic effects. Benefiting from these advantages, the obtained electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 1619 C g−1 (at a current density of 1 A g−1), excellent rate capability (1480 C g−1 at a current density of 20 A g−1), and good cycling stability (retains 90.6 % of the initial capacitance after 10,000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g−1). Using Cu@NCP as the cathode of the hybrid supercapacitor and rGO as the anode, showed that the energy density of 31.22 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 400 W kg−1. Not only that, it shows ultrahigh capacity retention (89.5 %) at a current density of 10 A g−1. It is believed that this finding facilitates the design of electrode materials to improve the performance of fast energy storage materials based on transition metal compounds.
