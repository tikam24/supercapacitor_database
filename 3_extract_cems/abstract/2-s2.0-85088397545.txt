Hierarchical Co3O4@NiCoLDH nanosheets (NSs) were prepared on carbon cloth through a multistep method, containing Metal-organic frameworks (MOF)-templated thermal annealing and electrodeposition. The triangle-shaped Co3O4NSs were firstly obtained by thermal treatment of MOF templates in air. Then, ultrathin NiCoLDHNSs were in-situ electrodeposited on the surface of Co3O4NSs, constructing a core-shell structure. Benefiting the unique hierarchical structure, high conductivity of Co3O4NSs core and large surface area of NiCoLDHNSs shell, the Co3O4@NiCoLDHNSs array served as supercapacitor electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical properties, such as high specific capacitance of 1708 F g−1 (850 C g−1) at a current density of 1 A g−1, good rate capability, and excellent cycling stability. Further, the asymmetric supercapacitor assembled by Co3O4@NiCoLDHNSs and activated carbon, also displays superior electrochemical performance with high energy density and power density. Remarkably, the strategy of constructing core-shell structure based on MOF templates could be extended to other electrochemical fields.
