As the HESS(Hybrid Energy Storage System) has the advantages of both power-based and energy- based energy storage devices, it is suitable for microgrid to smooth the power fluctuation. An HESS with parallel super capacitor and battery is adopted. The battery unit is used to stabilize the DC bus voltage while the super capacitor unit is used to track the reference current, which realizes the dynamic power allocation. A power allocation strategy is proposed based on the power loss model of HESS, which considers the state of charge of super capacitor as well as the power loss of HESS. It is applied to a photovoltaic generation system and the simulative results prove its effectiveness.
