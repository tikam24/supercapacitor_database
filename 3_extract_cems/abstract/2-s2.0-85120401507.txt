Transition metal sulfides (TMSs) have been widely researched as promising electrode materials for supercapacitors because of their high theoretical capacitance and rich redox reactive sites. In this work, tremella-like core-shell Co9S8@NiCo2S4 heterogeneous nanosheets were directly grown on Nickel foamed (NF) through the hydrothermal+electrodeposition method to obtain a self-supporting electrode. Benefiting from its unique tremella-like structure, ultra-thin nanosheets, and the positive synergies between Co9S8 and NiCo2S4, the prepared Co9S8@NiCo2S4@NF electrode presents a high specific capacity of 513 C g−1 (specific capacitance ~1026 F g−1) at 1 A g−1 with superior rate capability (62.8% capacitance retention rate at 10 A g−1). Furthermore, the fabricated Co9S8@NiCo2S4@NF//active carbon (AC) hybrid supercapacitor displays a high energy density of 30 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 731.8 W kg−1 and superior cycling stability. The results prove that the strategy of hydrothermal+electrodeposition is a very effective method for the preparation of energy storage and conversion materials with unique core-shell morphology.
