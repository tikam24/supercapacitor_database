Herein, the composite of Bi 2 O 2 CO 3 microspheres anchored on reduced graphene oxide nanosheets was prepared by hydrothermal treatment of the mixture of graphene oxide and Bi 2 O 2 CO 3 modified by introduction of positively charged functional groups (â€“NH 2 ), and evaluated as electrode materials for lithium ion batteries and supercapacitors simultaneously for the first time. As the anode material for lithium ion batteries, the composite delivers the initial charge capacity of 646.4 mAh/g at 0.05 A/g, and also exhibits a superior cyclability with the first charge capacity of 247.5 mAh/g and 191.9 mAh/g after 100 cycles at 0.7 A/g. When used for supercapacitors, it affords a capacitance of 293 F/g at 0.5 A/g, and good rate capability of 73.7% at 10 A/g.
