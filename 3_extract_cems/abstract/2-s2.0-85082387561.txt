Online temperature observation is very important for the health diagnosis and safe operation of the supercapacitor energy storage system. The paper presents an electro-thermal coupling model to estimate the temperature in supercapacitor. Firstly, an electro-thermal coupling model is built for the purpose of online temperature observation. Secondly, in order to improve the accuracy of the model for online application, a H infinite filter is designed for the model. The results of experiments show that electro-thermal coupling model achieves good accuracy. The absolute error of temperature is less than 1.4°G. Moreover, after adding the H infinity filter to the electro-thermal coupling model, the accuracy of the model is greatly improved, and the absolute error is less than 0.4°C. Furthermore, an online implementation strategy for this electro-thermal coupling model is discussed.
