It is well known improper disposal of tobacco stalks as waste can cause great pollution to farmland and the environment. In this paper, tobacco-stalk-core-based activated carbon was successfully synthesized by pre-carbonization and ZnCl2 activation. The influences of different activator ratios on the microstructure and the electrochemical performance of the activated carbon were systematically investigated. The results showed that while the ratio of the activator to the precursor of carbon was 2:1, the specific capacitance was high to 342.0 F·g-1 at 1 A·g-1 current density. To sum up, an as-prepared carbon material with high capacitance could be obtained by tobacco stalks core. ZnCl2 is an effective activator for the reuse of tobacco stalk, and it provides a new way of technology for synthesizing tobacco waste recycling resources.
