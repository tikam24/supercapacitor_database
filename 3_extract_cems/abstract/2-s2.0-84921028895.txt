Because the complementary characteristics of ultracapacitor and battery, the hybrid energy storage system with these two components will possess better performances, not only power density but also energy density will be upgraded, life time of the system will be prolonged. Aiming at special operation process of stand-alone PV system, a new active hybrid energy storage scheme was proposed based on bidirectional buck converter. Mathematical model was established, and the strategy for energy management and system control were presented. The simulation and experimental results show that the proposed scheme can make most of the advantages of ultracapacitor, optimize the operation process and prolong the lifetime of battery.
