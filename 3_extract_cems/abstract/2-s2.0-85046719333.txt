Hierarchical CuCo2O4@CoMoO4 nanowire/nanoplate hybrid nanostructures are successfully grown on Ni foam via simple methods involving hydrothermal and post-annealing treatment. The hybrid electrode exhibits a high areal capacity of 500 Î¼Ah/cm2 at 2 mA/cm2 and a good cycling stability with 84.1% retention over 2000 cycles at 20 mA/cm2. The assembled hybrid supercapacitor device based on CuCo2O4@CoMoO4 and activated carbon as the positive and negative electrodes achieves a maximum energy density of 49 Wh/kg at a power density of 318 W/kg, showing the great potential of this hybrid materials as advanced electrodes for energy storage devices.
