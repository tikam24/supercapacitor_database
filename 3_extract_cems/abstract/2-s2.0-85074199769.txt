This paper presents an experimental study on a semi-active hybrid energy storage system consisting of a battery pack and a supercapacitor pack for electric vehicle application. First, a real-time energy management control strategy based on a combination of filtering and fuzzy logic controller is proposed. The main advantage of the proposed control strategy is that the peak current of the battery can be obviously reduced while ensuring the voltage of the supercapacitor fluctuates within a certain desired range. Second, a 30 kW rated power experimental platform is constructed, in which only one dc/dc converter is used to regulate the power flow between the battery and the supercapacitor. Finally, a corrected battery fade model, which can accurately match the studied battery, is used to analyze the battery fade behavior. The results reveal that the battery capacity fade cost of the hybrid energy storage system can be reduced by 44.42%, 30.44%, and 57.16% compared with the sole battery storage under new European drive cycle, highway driving cycle, and Indian urban driving cycle, three driving cycles, respectively.
