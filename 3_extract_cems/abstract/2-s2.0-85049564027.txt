In this work, a two-step protocol was proposed to prepare NiS/Ni3S4 composite nanosheets as an electrode material for supercapacitors. The composite nanosheets were prepared by hydrothermal sulfuration on the α-Ni(OH)2 monolayer nanosheets that were produced by grinding the mixture of nickel salt and morpholine at room temperature. The results of morphology observation indicated that the composite prepared at 140 °C had sheet-like morphology and large lateral size. It presented high-specific capacitance (2070.0 F g−1 at current density of 2.5 A g−1) and excellent electrochemical stability (86% retention of initial capacitance after 10,000 charge–discharge cycles). It was considered that the high electrochemical performance of this composite could be attributed to its sheet-like morphology and the introduction of Ni3S4 phase.
