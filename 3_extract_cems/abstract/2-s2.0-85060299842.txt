This paper demonstrates the feasibility of predicting the discharge time of a supercapacitor loaded by a constant current using Peukert's law. Originally developed for lead-acid batteries, this law states that the delivered charge increases when the discharge current decreases. A previous study reveals that Peukert's law also applies to supercapacitors because of the porous electrode structure and the charge redistribution process of supercapacitors. This paper extends this study and shows that Peukert's law can be used to predict the supercapacitor discharge time. A set of seven constant current discharge experiments is designed and performed for four supercapacitor samples. The Peukert constant is fitted using four of the seven experiments and the discharge time of the other three experiments is predicted. Results show that the prediction error associated with the optimal Peukert constant is approximately 10-15% of that when Peukert's law is not utilized.
