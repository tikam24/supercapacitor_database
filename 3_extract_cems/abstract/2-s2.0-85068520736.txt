In this paper, a tramway's system model is established to evaluate its longitudinal dynamics performance, where the model includes multiple masses point connecting together powered by the catenary and a hybrid energy-storage system which consists of a battery pack and ultracapacitor pack. To explore an optimal or appropriate real-time power distribution among these energy sources, a dual fuzzy logic control-based energy management strategy combined with wavelet transform and multi-objective optimization is proposed. The control parameters of the dual fuzzy logic controller are adjusted using a multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm while considering the daily operating cost of the tramway. To verify the effectiveness and validity of the proposed model and energy management strategy, its simulation results are further compared and verified with the field experimental results of a real tramway and a real driving cycle in China.
