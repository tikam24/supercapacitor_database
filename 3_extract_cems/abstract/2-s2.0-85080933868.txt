Various bismuth oxyhalides materials (such as BiOX, where X = Cl, Br, F, I) are widely investigated in supercapacitors and photocatalyst fields owing to their unique morphological features and outstanding electrochemical properties. In this study, we have synthesized various bismuth-rich oxyiodides such as BiOI, Bi4O5I2, Bi5O7I, and Bi7O9I3 with two-dimensional morphologies in large scale by facile hydrothermal route. The chemical composition, surface properties, morphological features, and electrochemical properties have been systematically investigated using various advanced characterization techniques. The XRD results confirmed that the BiOI, Bi4O5I2, Bi5O7I, and Bi7O9I3 could be prepared by adjusting simply the pH values and OH− concentrations. Furthermore, the enrichment in the Bi content, the surface area, specific capacitance, and photocatalytic activity of the materials has been increased appreciably. A high specific capacitance value of 347 F g−1 is achieved for the Bi7O9I3 material, which is higher than the other bismuth-enriched oxyiodide such as BiOI, Bi4O5I2, and Bi5O7I, respectively. Moreover, compared with other bismuth oxyiodides, the Bi7O9I3 exhibited admirable photocatalytic activity toward the rhodamine B dye and 4-chlorophenol degradation under the visible light. In addition, this comprehensive study provides a new strategy in the development of highly efficient bismuth oxyhalides for constructing high-performance photocatalyst material and supercapacitor electrode for energy and environmental applications.
