In this study, bimetallic selenide NiCoSe 2 has been successfully synthesized by using metal-organic framework (MOF) precursors. First, Ni-Co-ZIF (nickel and cobalt in the ZIF-67) with the same shape of ZIF-67 was synthesized as a precursor. Next, the NiCoSe 2 with polyhedral morphology was produced by annealing the precursor with selenium (Se) powder at high temperature. The NiCoSe 2 with a high surface area of 232.8 m 2 g −1 exhibited a high specific capacitance of 300.2 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 in 2.0 M KOH electrolyte, and possessed an excellent cycling stability with almost no decrease in capacitance after 2000 cycles at 5 A g −1 . These data suggested that this bimetallic selenide NiCoSe 2 with polyhedral morphology could be a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.
