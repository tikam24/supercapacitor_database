In this work, we reported a controllable preparation of nanoporous Ni 3 S 2 films by a simple solvothermal-assisted sulfuration of nickel foam. The pore size can be easily adjusted by controlling the sulfuration time. Electrochemical tests show that the specific capacitance and the cycling performance of the Ni 3 S 2 films were sensitive to their pore size. The Ni 3 S 2 films with optimal pore size demonstrate a high specific capacitance (3.42 F/cm 2 at 1 mA/cm 2 ) and excellent cycling stability (about 102% after 4250 cycles at 7.5 mA/cm 2 ). By contrast, the Ni 3 S 2 films with either too large or too small pore size show much lower capacitance and relatively worse cycling stability. An asymmetric supercapacitor by using the optimal Ni 3 S 2 film as the positive electrode and activated carbon coated on Ni foam as the negative electrode was also successfully assembled, which exhibited a superior energy density of 41.8 Wh/kg at power density of 155 W/kg and a high capacitance retention of 76.6% after 2000 cycles.
