The idea of this study is to validate a list of keywords derived from a scientific article by a domain expert from years of knowledge with prominent document similarity algorithms. For this study, a list of handcrafted keywords generated by Electric Double Layer Capacitor (EDLC) experts are chosen, and relevant documents to EDLC are considered for the comparison. Then, different similarity calculation algorithms were employed in different settings on the documents such as using the whole texts of the documents, selecting the positive sentences of the documents, and generating similarity score with automatically extracted keywords from the documents. The experiment's outcome provides us with findings that the machine-generated keywords are mostly similar to the curated list by the domain experts. This study also suggests the preferable algorithms for similarity calculation and automated key-phrase extraction for the EDLC domain.
