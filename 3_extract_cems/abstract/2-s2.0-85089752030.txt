Electrode materials with high energy and power density are mostly essential to overcome traditional fossil fuel use. Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of Au decorated self-assembled SnO2 nanoflowers consisting of nanorods by a cost-effective and eco-friendly solvothermal process. The as-synthesized SnO2 based materials were employed as electrode material in the energy storage system, which delivered considerably high specific capacitance of 634.3 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g. The electrode material also exhibits excellent cycle stability of 83.52% after 4000 galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) cycles. The high specific capacitive value is attributed to the hybrid performance of battery and supercapacitor, more active sites, and higher surface area. A solid state asymmetry device was fabricated using Au–SnO2 and activated carbon (AC) as positive and negative electrodes. The asymmetry device shows an excellent energy density of 168.9 Wh/kg at a power density of 1 kW/kg with an applied current density of 1 A/g.
