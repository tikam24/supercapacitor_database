Great efforts have been carried out to fabricate wearable energy store devices to satisfy the booming demands for power consumption. Despite the emerging candidate selections and device designs, it still remains the great challenge to develop a flexible supercapacitor device with high stretchable ability and long-term stability. Herein, wearable pseudocapacitor device based on P(VDF-AM)/Ni–Co Oxide@MnO2/PDMS was exploited and evaluated as a solid state supercapacitor. The mesoporous Ni–Co oxide@MnO2 with enriched electrochemical sites was firstly prepared and then was placed on periodic PDMS surface via plasma and stretching-releasing treatments in order to gain highly stretchable supercapacitor. The fabricated wearable pseudocapacitor device displays high areal capacitance, long term stability and thermostability under repeated cycles and can endure 10000 stretching and releasing tests. The assembled wearable pseudocapacitors deliver a large areal capacity of 0.77 F cm−2 (50 mA cm−2), a high energy density of 52 μWh cm−2 at a power density of (17.3 mW cm−2). The prominent electrochemical performance and excellent stretchability are ascribed to the good alloyed metal oxides, the promoted electrochemical kinetics, improved mass transfer and embedded periodical flexible PDMS substrate. Moreover, high operating voltage and output current are obtained by the serial and parallel connection of the flexible device for powering high-energy-consuming devices. This study supplies a promising strategy to construct for stretchable and wearable electronics based on artificial interface linked technique and metal oxide alloying pattern.
