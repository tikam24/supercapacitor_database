We synthesized 1D/2D homo-orientation Co3O4/NiCo2O4 composites vertically on nickel foam. This vertical structure can greatly improve the electron transmission rate and material conductivity. So, the Co3O4/NiCo2O4 composites display good rate capability and long-term cycling stability. The composites retain 82% of the initial retention rate at 20 mA cm-2 after 20,000 cycles. In addition, the supercapacitor device using Co3O4/NiCo2O4 as positive materials not only can exhibit excellent 89% of the capacity retention after 20,000 cycles at 1 A g-1 but also deliver a maximum energy density of 22 W h kg-1 and a maximum power density of 2.25 kW kg-1. These results indicate that Co3O4/NiCo2O4 is a hopeful electrode material for high-performance supercapacitor applications.
