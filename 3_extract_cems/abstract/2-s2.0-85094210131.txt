Over the past numerous decades, unrelenting attention has been dedicated for sustainable design and synthesis of electrochemical metal oxide with controlled morphology and nano scale structural complexity to enhance their electrochemical properties. Here in, we reported the solâ€“gel synthesis of molybdenum trioxide NPs using bioactive compounds of Euphorbia cgnata Boiss as fuel. The current study demonstrated the stabilization of molybdenum trioxide nanoparticles by Benzeneethanamine and Benzenemethanol. The chemical and structural intrinsic features with low band gap energy of 2.02 eV rendered the MoO3 NPs suitable for electrochemical applications. On this account, we fabricated MoO3 nickel foam electrode to investigate its supercapacitor properties. MoO3 electrode revealed the moderate capacitance of 63.5 F/g at 2 mV/s with energy density of 1.8 Wh/kg and high power density of 4551.3 W/kg. Therefore, the overall results are proposing the potential of fabricated electrode toward energy storage device like supercapacitor. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
