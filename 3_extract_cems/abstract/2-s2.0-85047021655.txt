We report on the fabrication and testing of a semitransparent foldable supercapacitor for applications in 3D structured energy storage devices for the first time. With a facile papermaking method, we fabricate a 50 μm-thick veil of randomly dispersed 7 μm-in diameter carbon fibers for usage as semi-transparent foldable electrodes. We experimentally show that supercapacitors with such electrodes can be cut and folded into 3D structures with 95% capacitive retention rate over 10,000 charge cycles. By lighting up a light-emitting diode (LED) with a supercapacitor folded into a 3D structured freestanding origami crane, we demonstrate a new class of energy storage devices to broaden the range of geometries and application possibilities in various wearable electronics.
