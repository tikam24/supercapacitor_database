The purpose of this study is to propose an energy management strategy (EMS) based on a load following approach for a hybrid power system. The adopted hybrid power system is made up of a lithium-ion battery and supercapacitor, along with two bidirectional DC-DC converters. The proposed EMS algorithm aims not only to provide the necessary power references to the power system but also to extend the power elements lives. The effectiveness of the suggested energy management strategy under load profile process conditions is proven by processor in the loop (PIL) co-simulation results.
