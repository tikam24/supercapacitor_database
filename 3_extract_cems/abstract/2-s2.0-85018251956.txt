A simple template-free solvothermal method has been developed to synthesize perovskite LaNiO3 with hollow spherical structure. Appropriate annealing of the LaNiO3 precursor is crucial to form uniform hollow structure. The obtained hollow structure significantly improves the ionic and electronic transportation leading to enhanced electrochemical performance. A high specific capacitance of 422 F g−1 has been achieved at a current density of 1 A g−1 with good cyclic stability. This facile method sets up a new synthesis route for novel perovskite oxides with hollow structure.
