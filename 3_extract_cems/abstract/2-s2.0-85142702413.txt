Transition metal oxides are promising materials in photocatalysts, sensors, photovoltaics, and especially as supercapacitor electrodes for their rapid, reversible faradaic redox reactions. Nanosized ternary transition metal ferrite (NiMnFe2O4) has been synthesized using an easy and inexpensive microwave-assisted combustion method. The powder XRD confirms the nanoparticles as in spinal cubic structure with space group Fd-3m. FTIR has analyzed to understand the vibration of metal ions in the prepared NiMnFe2O4. The elemental composition and surface morphology of the nanoparticles have been studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. The UVâ€“Visible diffuse reflectance spectra are used to examine the optical properties and to calculate the band gap energy of NiMnFe2O4, which is found to be 1.08 eV. The electrochemical properties of the prepared metal ferrite have been studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), Galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The specific capacitance of the modified electrode is found to exhibit the highest value of 476 F/g at 5 mV/s.
