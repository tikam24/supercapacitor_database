Ideal performance of an energy storage module should reflect the overall ability of its individual components. However, module performance would be limited by its worst cell and module ageing might be accelerated by supercapacitor's nonuniformity. This phenomenon severely impedes the development of large-scale energy storage. Therefore the research aiming at nonuniformity is of great importance to the effectiveness, safety and reliability of the large-scale energy storage system. The paper first reviews five possible causes of supercapacitor's nonuniformity and analyzes its internal relationship with ageing. The paper then states the nonuniformity influence on module employment. Next, the paper discusses the criteria used for supercapacitor's nonuniformity evaluation. After that, the results of experiments in paper show the characteristic difference between cells and also prove the growth of nonuniformity. Finally, by analyzing state-of-the-art, the paper predicts the research trends.
