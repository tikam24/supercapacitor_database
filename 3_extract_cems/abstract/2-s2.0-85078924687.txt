A binder-free electrode has been fabricated by directly growing MoSe2 nanosheets on the macroporous Ti mesh skeleton (MoSe2 NS-Ti) via a facile hydrothermal deposition method. The as-prepared MoSe2 NS-Ti electrode is characteristic of robust porous hierarchical nanostructures with large surface area, enriched exposed active edges and improved electroconductivity. As a result, in comparison to the bare MoSe2 electrode, the MoSe2 NS-Ti electrode shows dramatically enhanced electrocatalytic activity and pseudocapacitive performance due to its desirable structural features.
