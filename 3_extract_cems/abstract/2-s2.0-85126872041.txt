Present article reports morphology controlled synthesis of lead sulfide (PbS) thin films using cost-effective chemical method. The structural, morphological, and electrochemical studies of the samples were carried out. Rock-salt phase cubic structure formation is affirmed by XRD analysis. SEM micrograph describes the evolution of an exotic, anisotropic, 3D hierarchical dendritic architecture into microflowers as a function of reaction time. The optimized sample shows specific capacitance of 360 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The all-solid-state asymmetric PbS//MnO2 supercapacitor device shows cycling stability of 71% over 1000 cycles highlights the significance of hierarchical PbS nanostructures in supercapacitors.
