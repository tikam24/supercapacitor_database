Pliable supercapacitor, yielding specific capacitance (Cs) and energy density as high as 348 F g−1 and 48.3 Wh Kg−1 respectively was fabricated using modified activated carbon electrodes. The nanospheres of activated carbon (AC) were anchored on the nanoplates of boron nitride (BN) by employing the facile technique of pulsed laser ablation in liquid (PLAL) using 532 nm focused laser beam. Four different variants of electrode materials were synthesized by varying the weight percentage (1%, 3%, 5% and 10%) of BN in AC in the PLAL precursor solution. The morphological characteristics, the elemental composition and the structural analysis of the synthesized electrode materials were studied respectively by FESEM, XPS and XRD. The morphological studies indicated that the PLAL synthesis of the electrode materials resulted in proper intercalation of carbon nanospheres into BN nanoplates, which resulted in the observed enhanced performance of the fabricated supercapacitor. Four supercapacitors in this work were fabricated using the four variants of synthesized electrode materials in conjunction with gel polymer electrolyte (GPE). GPE are well known for their non-corrosive nature and best sealing ability to avoid any leakage that results in increasing the cycle life of the device. The performance of the fabricated supercapacitors was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) measurement and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results indicate that the supercapacitor fabricated using 3% BN in AC as electrode material manifested the best specific capacitance and energy density. Also it was found that the supercapacitor maintained 85% of its initial capacitance even after 5000 charge/discharge cycles.
