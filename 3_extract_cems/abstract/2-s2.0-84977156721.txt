R(fMWCNT-GO)/TiO2NTs/Ti electrodes with three-dimensional nanostructures were prepared by co-electrochemical reduction of functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (fMWCNTs) and graphene oxide (GO) onto TiO2 nanotubes/Ti. SEM studies revealed that the reduced fMWCNT-GO hybrid with highly network structures has been uniformly deposited onto the TiO2NTs arrays. The storage energy performance was investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques in 1.0 M H2SO4 aqueous solution. The R(fMWCNT-GO)/TiO2NTs/Ti electrodes exhibit a high specific capacitance up to 600 F g−1 at 12 A g−1 in 1 M H2SO4 and a long cyclic durability with 90 % capacitance retention over 500 cycling, indicating a potential application in electrode material of supercapacitors. The high capacitance of R(GO-fMWCNT)/TiO2NTs electrode could be attributed to the functional groups of GO-fMWCNT, the 3D structures of the electrode and the highly electrical conductivity fMWCNT.
