The abundantly available low-grade coals were efficiently used to produce supercapacitor electrode materials by using wet-chemical methods. The low-grade coals were first chemically converted to graphene-like carbon nanosheets (GCNSs), and then their electrochemical parameters were extensively investigated to know their basic supercapacitor properties. The formation of the GCNSs was established by using scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) techniques. The carbon flakes of the size range of 2–50 μm were found to present in the coal-derived carbon nanomaterials. HRTEM analysis revealed the formation of layered GCNSs along with micropores/mesopores during the oxidative processes. The thermally stabled coal-derived GCNSs were found as promising electrode materials for supercapacitor demonstrating novel charge storage characteristics. The specific capacitance value of ∼125, 84 and 95 F g−1 with high rate capability over 1000 cycles were observed in an acidic electrolyte (H2SO4 1M) with considerably high power density and energy density.
