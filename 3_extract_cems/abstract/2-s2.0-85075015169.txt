In recent years, in order to alleviate the problems of energy shortage and environmental pollution, the development of high-performance energy storage devices has become a research hotspot. Nowadays, new energy storage devices (including lithium-sulfur batteries, sodium-ion batteries and supercapacitors) have attracted much attention of researchers due to their broad development prospects. One of the effective ways to improve the performance of new energy storage devices is finding the key materials with high performance and low cost. The high-performance polymer has become an important cornerstone of the modern industry and high-tech industry due to the advantages of light weight, low price, and good stability. Especially, in recent years, the application of high-performance polymer has gradually attracted widespread attention in the field of new energy. Starting from the application of lithium-sulfur batteries, sodium-ion batteries, supercapacitors and so on, the development history and application prospects of high-performance polymers would be briefly described, meanwhile, their promoting effects on the improvement of national economic level would be pointed out.
