Carbon derived from natural precursors is attracting tremendous attention from the scientific community for high-performance supercapacitor applications. This is for the first time; one-step synthesis was carried out for Mn incorporated carbon derived from coconut water as the starting precursor via the spray pyrolysis method. An energy-efficient, low-cost, and eco-friendly method of synthesis is a need of time. Three different concentrations (0.08 M, 0.05 M, and 0.02 M) of "Mn"incorporated carbon were prepared and tested for supercapacitor application. Among these, 0.05 M Mn incorporated coconut water carbon (Mn/CWC) manifests the highest areal capacitance of 438.33 mF cm-2 at the current density of 2 mA cm-2 with the energy density of 21.91 10-3 Wh cm-2 and 299.9.18 10-3 W cm-2 power density and shown 94.8% of capacitance retention rate at the current density of 4 mA cm-2 after the 2000 cycles. The results indicated that 0.05 M Mn incorporated CWC can be a potential candidate for electrode material in energy storage applications.
