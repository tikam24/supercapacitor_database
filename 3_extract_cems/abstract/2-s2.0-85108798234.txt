ZnO/NiO:rGO nanocomposite coated Ni foam binder-free electrode (ZNR/NF) and powder sample (ZNR) were synthesized through hydrothermal technique for supercapacitor applications. The synthesized powder sample have been characterized by XRD and FT-IR analysis to identify its crystalline nature and functional groups, respectively. Raman spectra of the prepared GO and rGO samples, elucidate that the rGO possess lower structural defects than GO. The uniform distribution of ZNR sample on Ni foam substrate was illustrated by SEM analysis. Besides, the nanostructures of ZnO and NiO and its fringe patterns were confirmed by HR-TEM analysis. The high purity of the ZNR and binder-free electrodes were revealed by EDS analysis. The electrochemical properties were tested under 1 M KOH electrolyte, ZNR/NF binder-free electrode exhibited a maximum of 622.3 F g−1 specific capacitance at 1 A g−1. Also, it delivers a maximum power and energy density of 2460 W kg−1 and 16.7 W h kg−1 respectively. The fabricated binder free electrode possesses 85.7% electrochemical retention after 10,000 GCD cycles and it was the one of the key advantages for long term applications.
