The amino-functionalized graphene/polyaniline nanocomposites (AGNS/PANI) were fabricated through in-situ chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline in the presence of amino-functionalized graphene sheets (AGNS). FTIR, UV-vis spectroscopy analyses revealed that aminophenyl groups covalently bound to the basal plane of graphene via a diazonium addition, and the polyaniline chains grafted to graphene sheets. The FE-SEM images show that PANI nanorods aligned vertically on the surface of graphene. The AGNS/PANI nanocomposite exhibits excellent electrochemical performance for supercapacitor electrode materials. Â© (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
