The implementation of nanostructure designs that optimize the benefits of all constituent elements and facilitate interfacial interactions between them represents a promising approach for enhancing electrochemical efficiency. This study uses a simple single source precursor technique to produce distinctly shaped Nd2S3:Ni9S8:Co9S8. The material's crystal, optical, morphological and elemental investigation was performed. The optical band gap of 3.5 eV was identified through UV–visible analysis. Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis confirmed the presence of Nd, Ni, Co, as well as S in the composite. Significant functional groups were investigated through FTIR. Electrical investigations involving multiple techniques were performed in a photoelectrochemical cell. Ascribing to the transparent photoactive electrode In:SnO2/Nd2S3:Ni9S8:Co9S8 the results presented an unsurpassed specific capacity of 946 Fg−1 in the presence of light. In each experiment, it was demonstrated that the electrode's photocurrent density was greater when it was exposed to light. This study has successfully introduced a highly valuable photoelectrode that exhibits great potential for practical application in the realm of renewable energy systems.
