Flexible supercapacitors have received increasing attention due to its portable, flexibility, lightweight and stability. Herein, the flexible supercapacitor electrode with core-shell structure is prepared by in-situ growth of 3D TiO2 nanoflowers on activated Ti foil and uniform coating of Au film and MnO2 nanowires. The porous Ti conductive substrate is achieved by adjusting HCl-KOH corrosion time, thereby providing more channels for charge transport. Free-standing 3D structure of TiO2 NFs provides more surface area to facilitate ions intercalation/deintercalation. Au thin film plays a pivotal role in enhancing conductivity of Ti/TiO2 substrate and adhesion of MnO2 nanowires. The TiO2 NFs@Au@MnO2 composite electrode performs an excellent specific capacitance (1322.5 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and satisfying cycling stability (86.3% capacity retention after 2000 cycles). Additionally, the assembled solid-state symmetric supercapacitor also displays superior electrochemical performance (223.75 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1), favourable rate capability (85.8% capacity retention after 2000 cycles) and remarkable flexibility. The combination of 3D architecture nanocomposite electrode with other carbon-based materials will open up a prospect for developing flexible asymmetric supercapacitors.
