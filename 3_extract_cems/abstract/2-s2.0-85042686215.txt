Three dimensional (3D) graphene and its composite have recently attracted great interests in the field of materials science because of its superior properties such as good flexibility, large specific surface area, high power density, stable mechanical properties, fast electron transport and so on. In this paper, the basic properties of the three dimensional graphene materials are summarized. The preparation methods of the composite materials and their applications in supercapacitor are reviewed. The widely used preparation methods include self-assembly method, template method and 3D printing technique and so on. The performances of porous structure, pore size, flexibility and electron transport rate can be optimized by improving the preparation methods. The composite composed of three dimensional (3D) graphene, transition metal compounds and conductive polymer showed a remarkable application potential as supercapacitor electrode materials.
