Supercapacitors (SCs) are considered to be one of the most promising energy storage device options for sustainable development of human beings due to their advantages of fast charge-discharge capacitance, high specific capacitance, reversibility, long life and so on. As a key component of SCs, electrode materials determine the electrochemical performance of SCs. Transition Metal Nitrides (TMN) with low electrical resistance, excellent thermal and chemical stability are promising as electrode materials for SCs. Moreover, the integration of TMN with carbonaceous nanocomposite materials attracts great research interests because of the unique inherent properties of carbonaceous material (high specific surface area and low resistivity), which can enlarge the specific surface area of the nanocomposite for faradiac redox reaction. This review summarizes the main preparation method of TMN, the latest research progress of TMN including binary nitrides, ternary nitrides, carbon and TMN composites (TMN/C). Finally, we give a brief overview of some of the challenges by the electrode materials and point out the research directions in the future.
