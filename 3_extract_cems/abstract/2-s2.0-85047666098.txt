Recently, great efforts have been devoted to designing and fabricating flexible, lightweight, wearable, and miniaturized supercapacitors. At the same time, the exploration of green, renewable, and biocompatible energy-storage materials has been attracting intensive attention. By taking fabrication and configuration design into consideration, the naturally derivable juglone molecule was exploited as an active charge-storage material, and integrated into flexible and micro-supercapacitor devices. The polypyrrole/juglone-composite-based supercapacitors exhibit significant energy-storage capabilities with high specific capacitance and long cyclability, which are comparable to that of conventional electrode materials. This study presents a new way for developing flexible, lightweight, portable, and/or wearable electronic devices with biocompatible and environmentally friendly attributes.
