Leather tanning operations create a large amount of solid and liquid waste from tanning, wherein Cr(III) compounds are used to produce wet blue leather. In this study, activated carbon (AC) generated from leather waste (LW) was evaluated for supercapacitor (SC) applications. AC was produced through carbonization at a temperature range of 700°C–900 °C, followed by chemical activation. The morphological characteristics of the AC samples revealed a certain degree of porosity and a maximum surface area of 381 m2 g−1. X-ray diffraction and EDX examination showed the existence of graphitic planes in the LW-derived AC. Raman, FT-IR, and XPS confirmed the defect nature and surface functional groups of the AC samples. A three-electrode approach was employed to assess the electrochemical characteristics of the AC samples. The supreme capacitance of a sample (LW700) at 1 A/g was 550 F g−1 (237 C g−1) in a 6 M KOH electrolyte. All the electrochemical results (CV, GCD, and Nyquist curves) demonstrated that the LW carbon possessed a high specific capacitance and electrochemical cycle constancy, and hence is appropriate for SC fabrication. These desirable capacitive performances enable solid leather waste-derived carbons as a source of new materials for low-cost energy storage supercapacitors. This work put forwards a new concept of ‘waste to value-added products’ that can be a helping hand for leather industries and its solid waste management disposal problems.
