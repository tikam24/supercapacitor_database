Ultrathin MoO3 nanocrystals were assembled on 3D graphene oxide frameworks via a hydrothermal reaction forming a layered structure by oxygen-bonding interactions at the interface. The structure and morphology of the resulting MoO3-GAs hybrids were characterized by a range of experimental tools including atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared and Raman spectroscopy. Because of abundant exposed active sites of the ultrathin MoO3 and rapid ion diffusion and electron transport of 3D graphene frameworks, the resulting MoO3-GAs hybrids possess the highest specific capacitances and excellent cycling stability in both aqueous (527Fg-1 at the current density of 1.0Ag-1, 100% retention after 10,000 cycles) and solid electrolytes (373Fg-1 at 1.0Ag-1, 100% retention after 5,000 cycles) among leading literature results of similar systems.
