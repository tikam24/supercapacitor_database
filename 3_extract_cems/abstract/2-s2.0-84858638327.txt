Here, we report the fabrication of self-organized titania (TiO 2) nanotube array supercapacitor electrodes through controlled phase transformation of TiO 2, with aerial capacitances as high as 2.6 mF cm -2, which far exceeds the values so far reported in the literature. The role of phase transformation in the electrochemical charge-discharge behaviour of nanocrystalline TiO 2 nanotubes is investigated and discussed in detail. The ease of synthesis and the exceptional electrochemical properties make these nanotube arrays an alternative candidate for use in energy storage devices. Â© 2012 the Owner Societies.
