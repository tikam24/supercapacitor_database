The research in this article describes a novel and cheap 3D printed platform for testing supercapacitor materials. The platform is tested and analyzed through Cyclic voltammetry (CV), Chronoamperometry and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). Pyrolyzed commercial paper is used as a dummy material to validate the platform as both current collector and active material. SEM pictures of the electrodes are taken. Additionally, the relationship between pyrolysis heating rate and capacitance is studied.
