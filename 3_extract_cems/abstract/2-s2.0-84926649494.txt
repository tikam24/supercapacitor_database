Little is known regarding the effect of the graphene lateral size on the electrochemical performance of hybrid graphene electrode. This work examines the electrochemical performance of a flexible hybrid supercapacitor electrode composed of ultralarge graphene oxide (UGO; mean lateral size of 47 ± 22 μm) and vanadium dioxide (VO2) nanobelts, referring to a reference electrode composed of small scale graphene oxide (SGO; mean lateral size of 0.8 ± 0.5 μm) and VO2.Thermal treatment converts UGO/VO2 and SGO/VO2 to URGO/VO2 (denoted VURGO) and SRGO/VO2 (denoted VSRGO) electrodes, respectively. The sheet resistance of the VURGO film (0.57 ± 0.03 kΩ sq.-1) was two orders of magnitude lower than that of the VSRGO (55.74 ± 9.35 kΩ sq.-1). The VURGO hybrid electrode showed a specific capacitance of 769 F g-1, which was significantly better than the corresponding values for the VSRGO electrode (385 F/g). These results support the notion that the use of ultralarge graphene sheets (≈22 500 μm2) lowers the intersheet resistance due to the presence of fewer intersheet tunneling barriers. This article highlights the potential utility of URGO (as a conductive support) in hybrid electrode containing VO2 nanobelts for high performance flexible hybrid supercapacitor. The utilization of ultralarge graphene oxide sheets (UGO) (mean lateral size of 47 μm ± 22 μm) in a flexible hybrid supercapacitor electrode composed of UGO and vanadium dioxide (VO2) nanobelts is reported. A significant improvement in the specific capacitance (769 F g-1) for this electrode can be achieved due to the presence of fewer intersheet tunneling barriers.
