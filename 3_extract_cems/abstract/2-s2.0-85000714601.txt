An integrated (Cu,Ni)O mesoporous nanowire array was fabricated by a simple hydrothermal method with subsequent annealing, which with optimized Cu:Ni ratio = 1:1 delivers a high specific capacitance of 1710 F g-1. The further assembled aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor (Cu,Ni)O(+)//activated carbon(-) demonstrates high energy/power densities and long cycle life.
