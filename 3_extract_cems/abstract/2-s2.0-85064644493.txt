In this paper, we present the design of a battery-less adaptative supercapacitor-based energy storage system for a self- powered multi-harvesting solution. We have designed a module that provides a dynamic capacitive impedance that adapts itself to ensure a proper short-long term operation in terms of energy availability. The module reduces its capacitive impedance during start-up to shorten 94% the time required to reach a minimum operative voltage of 2.6 V compared with the same system without adaptation functionality. Once start-up is accomplished, the module maximizes its capacitive impedance to maximize the energy stored, thus, providing an autonomy time 2,000% longer that the autonomy time of the same system without adaptation functionality. This battery-less module is accomplished with low- power cost-effective off-the-shelf components requiring a maximum current consumption of 9.5 Î¼A and being a suitable candidate for self-powered/low-power applications.
