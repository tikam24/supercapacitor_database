Magnetic linear actuators have a wide range of applications. Their main advantage is the ease with which they can be controlled by regulating the current. However, high electrical power is required for obtaining a large continuous force, acceleration, and stroke from a device with small dimensions. In this study, we developed a comprehensive open-source system consisting of simple movable iron magnetic actuators, a four-channel controller, and dedicated software. The graphical user interface facilitates the designing of the sequence of piston strokes, including the start time, duration of movement, and force for each stroke separately. The controller generates a high current of pulses, which allows achieving a high force, acceleration, and stroke from small-sized coils while maintaining a relatively safe voltage. The system was originally designed as a reagent syringe driver to control the rapid mixing process used for studying the kinetics of enzymatic reactions. However, this driver may also be applied in various other scientific as well as nonscientific applications.
