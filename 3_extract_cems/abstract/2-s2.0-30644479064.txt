For supercapacitor electrode material, hydrous Ru O2 /carbon black nanocomposites were prepared by the novel incipient wetness method using a fumed silica nanoparticle. First, hydrous Ru O2 /fumed silica/Ketjen black (KB) was synthesized by the sol-gel-based method. After dissolving the fumed silica, the hydrous Ru O2 KB nanocomposite, which is composed of Ru O2 nanoparticles (20-60 nm) dispersed on the high-surface-area KB (1180 m2 g-1), was formed with 3D porous structure at high loading of 60 wt % Ru O2 (Ru content is 46 wt %). The hydrous Ru O2 KB nanocomposite electrode exhibited a specific capacitance of 647 F g-1 with high charge utilization of Ru O2 (72%), which is significantly higher than reported values by other workers at similar loading of Ru O2. The high capacitance and the high charge utilization were probably due to enhanced proton paths within the 3D porous structure of the nanocomposite materials. Â© 2005 The Electrochemical Society.
