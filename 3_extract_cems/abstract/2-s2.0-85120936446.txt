In this endeavor, the Cu0.92Co2.08O4 materials were prepared by CTAB assisted hydrothermal technique with calcination process. The cyclic voltammetric analysis exhibit the specific capacitance of 543 Fg−1 at a scan rate of 5 mVs−1 whereas the galvanostatic charge/discharge studies provide the specific capacitance of 489 Fg−1 at a current density of 1 Ag−1. The Cu0.92Co2.08O4 nanoplate possesses low internal and charge discharge resistance which exhibit 93% of initial capacitance after 2000 continuous cyclic voltammetric cycles at a scan rate of 100 mVs−1. These results indicate that the prepared Cu0.92Co2.08O4 nanoplate is the significant electrode material for supercapacitor application.
