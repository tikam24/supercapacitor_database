In this paper, an electrical energy management strategy to control the power flow in a battery/supercapacitor hybrid system is presented. The implemented approach relies on the dynamics response of the sources to share the required power. The concept of the system relies on isolated resonant converters. A primary phase-shifted LLC resonant converter is used to connect the batteries bank to the DC-link, while the supercapacitors bank is coupled to the DC-link through a bidirectional CLLC resonant converter controlled by variable frequency control. Performances of the proposed architecture and control method are validated through some simulations. It is shown that the proposed converters can achieve soft switching for all load conditions. That the efficacy and the power density of the system are enhanced. The simulation results validates also the proposed energy management strategy.
