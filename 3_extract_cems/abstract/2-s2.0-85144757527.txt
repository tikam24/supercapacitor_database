The demerits of the carbonized eggshell membrane (EM), such as high cost, high brittleness, immutable shape and size, greatly limit its application in demanding supercapacitors as free-standing electrode. Herein, the reconstituted EM (REM) with good flexibility and excellent size-customizability is developed, which is due to their fibrous structure and abundant surface polar groups. Ti3C2 nanosheet (a typical MXene) with ultra-high electrical conductivity and good electrochemical activity is then coated on REM surface, and undergoes a low-temperature carbonization (350 °C) to prepare CREM/T. Multi-functions of Ti3C2 are exhibited: (1) constructing a conductive network on REM surface by randomly stacking to yield a high electrical conductivity of 78.1 S cm−1, (2) being as a protective mold to remain the inherent flexibility and porosity of REM during carbonization, (3) creating nanopores by inducing self-activation, and (4) yielding a large capacitance of 1729 mF cm−2 at 0.5 mA cm−2 and a high rate capability of 82 % after increasing the current density by 50 folds. Furthermore, an all-EM-based supercapacitor is fabricated with REM as the separator and CREM/T as the electrode. It delivers a high energy density of 16.1 μW h cm−2 at 1301 μW cm−2, and shows stable capacitive behaviors during bending.
