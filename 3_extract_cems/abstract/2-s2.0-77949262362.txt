Titania nanocomplexes, comprising the disordered nanoribbons or nanowires on the top surface and highly ordered nanotube array on the underlaying layer, has been fabricated by longitudinally splitting off nanotubes in a controlled anodization process. Anatase titania nanocomplexes show higher photovoltage and photocurrent responses and photocatalysis activity than titania nanotube array due to the enhanced light harvesting caused by nanoribbons and nanowires. Furthermore, titania nanowire-nanotube demonstrates a higher photoelectrical performance than nanoribbon-nanotube due to its thicker space charge layer caused by long nanotubes and more effective surface area contributed by nanowires. Cyclic charge-discharge measurements show that titania nanotube array exhibits a much higher electric double layer capacitance than titania nanocomplexes because the surface nanoribbons or nanowires inhibit the free diffusion and transportation of electrolyte ions into the underlaying nanotubes. Therefore, titania nanocomplexes can act as a photoactive material for photocatalysis applications and titania nanotube array can act as an electrode substrate for electrochemical supercapacitor applications.
