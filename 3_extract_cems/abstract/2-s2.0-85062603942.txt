It is very important to design hybrid core-shell structured electrode materials to obtain superior electrochemical and electrocatalytic performance. In this work, we reported hybrid NiCo2O4@NiWS nanostructures through a facile solution approach. The as-synthesized product can be used directly as the electrode materials for the hybrid battery and the electrocatalysts. The as-synthesized hybrid NiCo2O4@NiWS structure exhibits a high specific capacitance 580 C g-1 at current density of 1 A g-1. The as-assembled supercapacitor device shows high energy density of 41.1 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 1032.2 W kg-1. Moreover, NiCo2O4@NiWS structure possesses excellent oxygen evolution reaction with small overplant of 290 mV and excellent cycle stability.
