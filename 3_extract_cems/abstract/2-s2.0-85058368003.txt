Solid-state energy storage devices, such as solid-state batteries and solid-state supercapacitors, have drawn extensive attention to address the safety issues of power sources related to liquid-based electrolytes. However, the development of solid-state batteries and supercapacitors is substantially limited by the poor compatibility between solid-state particles to decrease electrochemically active sites, slowing reaction kinetics down. Emerging two-dimensional materials possess high specific surface area and abundantly electrochemical active sites. In addition, extraordinarily electrical and mechanical properties make two-dimensional materials ideal active or inactive components of solid-state batteries and especially, supercapacitors. Here, recent advances in the attempts for solid-state batteries and solid-state supercapacitors based on various two dimensional materials are reviewed according to the different roles played by two-dimensional materials, such as electrode active materials, conductive agents, electrolytes, and electrolyte fillers. In addition, charge storage mechanism in 2D materials, current challenges, and future perspectives are also discussed toward solid-state energy storage. This review aims to provide guiding significance for engineers and researchers to rationally design high performance two-dimensional nano-materials based solid-state energy storage devices.
