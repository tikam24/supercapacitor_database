Nickel posphite (Ni11 (HPO3)8(OH) 6) hexagonal polyhedrons are successfully synthesized under hydrothermal conditions. The effect of surfactants on the growth mechanism of Ni11 (HPO3)8(OH)6are also explored. More importantly, Ni11 (HPO3)8(OH) 6hexagonal polyhedrons are successfully applied as electrochemical supercapacitor electrode materials, which have a good specific capacitance (295 F g-1 at 0.625 A g-1), good rate capability, and cycling properties (maintained about 99.3% at 0.625 A g-1 after 1000 cycles).
