Manganese Dioxide was prepared by chemical reduction method with various anion reducing agent. The acidity-alkalinity of reagents had effect on the color of the samples from the experiments. TEM results indicated that MnO2 prepared were all of rod-like structures. The sample 1 reduced by NaHSO3 distributed equality, electrochemical measurement revealed that the sample 1 had the highest capacity, it showed good Capacitance Property in the voltage window (0-1.0 V) measured by CV. The specific capacitance of MnO2 is 237.39 F · g-1 at 5 mA · cm-2 at first cycle and 242.57 F · g-1 after 700 cycle, the loss of the capacitance was only 5.12%.
