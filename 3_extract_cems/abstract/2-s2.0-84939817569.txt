Boron-doped diamond has been utilized as an electrode material to construct an electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) as well as an electrode support to form a pseudocapacitor. In 1.0 M NaSO<inf>4</inf> solution, the capacitance of diamond EDLC is in the range of 3.6-7.0 μF cm<sup>-2</sup>, comparable with those of EDLCs based on other carbon materials. During a charge/discharge process for 1000 cycles at a scan rate of 100 mV s<sup>-1</sup>, the capacitance only decreases 5%, indicating high stability and a long lifetime of such an EDLC. To improve the capacitance of diamond EDLCs, diamond was coated with a MnO<inf>2</inf> film to construct a pseudosupercapacitor. The MnO<inf>2</inf> films were electrodeposited at a constant potential of 0.9 V vs Ag/AgCl in 0.2 M MnSO<inf>4</inf> solution. The mass of MnO<inf>2</inf> deposited per unit area, called the area density, calculated from the deposition charge, was controlled via the deposition time. The MnO<inf>2</inf> films were characterized using various techniques like SEM, XPS, Raman spectroscopy, etc. In 1.0 M NaSO<inf>4</inf> solution, the capacitance of the MnO<inf>2</inf>/diamond-based pseudosupercapacitor rises with an increase of the mass of MnO<inf>2</inf> on diamond. Its maximum capacitance was found to be reached at a MnO<inf>2</inf> area density of 24 μg cm<sup>-2</sup>. The capacitance obtained from voltammetry is 384 μF, or 326 F g<sup>-1</sup> at a scan rate of 10 mV s<sup>-1</sup>, which is comparable with the value of 406 μF, or 349 F g<sup>-1</sup>, obtained from charge/discharge process at a current density of 3 A g<sup>-1</sup> in the potential range 0 to 0.8 V. The capacitance was reduced by 34% after 1000 subsequent charge/discharge cycles carried out at a scan range of 100 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. The comparison of the performance of the MnO<inf>2</inf>/diamond pseudosupercapacitor with that of those pseudosupercapacitors based on MnO<inf>2</inf> and other carbon materials indicates that diamond could be suitable for electrochemical supercapacitor applications.
