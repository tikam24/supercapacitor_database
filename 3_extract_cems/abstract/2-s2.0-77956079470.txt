Telecommunications power systems must be an uninterruptible supplying source. This paper focus on an alternative back-up power system comprising fuel cells and supercapacitors. The fuel cell system by itself has some dynamic limitations, which are overcome by adding a supercapacitor. Therefore, the fuel cell supplies the load during the long term steady state, while the supercapacitors bank feeds sudden peak power requirements in short intervals. The presented results show how the fuel cell-supercapacitor back-up system is effective on fulfilling the strict telecommunications equipment requirements, even during load power demand variations.
