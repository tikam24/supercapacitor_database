Boron and nitrogen co-doped carbon (BCN) seems to exhibit excellent electrochemical properties very suitable as electrode material for supercapacitor applications. On the other hand, MoS2 possessing sheet-like structure proves to be favorable for electrolytic ion intercalation. Here in composites resulting from hydrothermally integrated MoS2 flakes with the BCN have been studied to determine its potency as electrode material for supercapacitor application. Owed to the high packing density of layered MoS2 flakes the as-prepared BCN/MoS2 composite exhibits high volumetric capacitance corresponding to a value of 798 F cm−3 together with the enhanced gravimetric capacitance of 283 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1. Electrochemical studies reveal improved coulombic efficiency, energy, and power densities for the as-prepared BCN/MoS2 composite owed to the established synergy and the presence of interfaces involving two different materials. These results clearly show the usefulness of integration BCN and MoS2 flakes resulting in BCN/MoS2 hybrid as an apt electrode material for supercapacitor application.
