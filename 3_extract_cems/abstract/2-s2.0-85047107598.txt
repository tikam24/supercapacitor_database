In the present article we report synthesis and electrochemical supercapacitor applications of sprayed bismuth oxide (Bi 2 O 3 ) interconnected upright standing nano-plate-based electrode material via a simple spray pyrolysis aqueous route onto a flexible 3D Ni-foam at 623 ± 2 K. The Bi 2 O 3 Ni-foam was initially characterized for its structure, morphology and phase-purity analyses and then envisaged as electrode materials in supercapacitor applications. Polycrystalline, cubic crystal structure of Bi 2 O 3 nanoplate films were hydrophobic in character. The cyclic voltammetry curves of Bi 2 O 3 electrode, scanned at scan rates from 5 to 1000 mV/s in 1 M Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte in the potential window of −0.8 – 1.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl confirm a mixed-type capacitive behavior. Using charge-discharge study, the calculated maximum values of specific energy, specific power and columbic efficiency were 702.97 Wh/kg, 334.7 kW/kg and 99.9%, respectively. Electrochemical impedance measurement scanned in the frequency range of 1 mHz–1 MHz confirms ∼6 Ω solution resistance and ∼13 Ω charge transfer resistance. An excellent electrochemical stability of 92% at 100 mV/s scan rate even after 5000 redox cycles demonstrates an industrial potential of Bi 2 O 3 electrode materials.
