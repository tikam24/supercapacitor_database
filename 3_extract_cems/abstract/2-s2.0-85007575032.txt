A new nanostructured 3-D honeycomb NiCo 2 S 4 (NC-1) has been successfully prepared by a simple hydrothermal method assisted sulfuration procedure. The morphology of the 3-D honeycomb was investigated by FESEM and TEM, and the results suggest the NC-1 has a highly porous structure. Its chemical composition was characterized by XRD and XPS and the results indicate that the NC-1 is the pure phase of NiCo 2 S 4 . In order to study the effect of morphology on the electrochemical performance, we have also prepared needle-, flake- and petal-like nanostructured NiCo 2 S 4 on Ni foam. When they were used as supercapacitor electrodes, the NC-1 exhibited the highest electrochemical performance among these four kinds of electrodes. Its maximum specific capacity was over 14 mAh cm −2 at 1 mA m −2 and it still yielded 7.96 mAh cm −2 even at 50 mA cm −2 . The NC-1 remained 99.64% of the initial capacity after the long-term test of 1000 cycles. Consequently, the NC-1 has the promising potential as an energy storage system in the future and it can also be used as an ideal substrate for other active materials involving a faradaic process.
