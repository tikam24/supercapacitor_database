A naturally fibrous carbon foam is fabricated by employing fish bones as raw materials. Differing to carbon foams in previous reports, numerous unwoven and cross-linked carbon nanofibers were found to construct the whole foam, exhibiting a hierarchical porosity with interconnected channels and multisize pores. In the meantime, on the basis of the rich organic-inorganic components of fish bones, an N-S-P-O codoping was achieved in carbon foams. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of hierarchically porous fibrous foam and multiple heteroatom doping, the as-obtained samples were employed both as anode and cathode materials in lithium ion hybrid supercapacitors (LIHC), which delivered a superior energy density of 131 Wh kg-1 in 0-4.0 V. Significantly, at an impressive power density of 62000 W kg-1, the energy density of this device can still reach an ultrahigh energy density of 72 Wh kg-1, which presents a state of the art supercapacitors. More importantly, continuously being charged/discharged at a high current density of 5 A g-1 for 20000 cycles, the LIHC device can still retain a high energy density of 79 Wh kg-1 with 82% retention, demonstrating the promising prospect of heteroatom doped fibrous carbon foam in high-performance hybrid supercapacitors.
