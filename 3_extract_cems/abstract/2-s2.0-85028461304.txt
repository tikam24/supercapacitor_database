A polyvinylpyrrolidone (1-ethenylpyrrolidin-2-one or PVP)-assisted solvothermal method has been developed to synthesize porous LaCoO3 nanospheres. Appropriate PVP addition may effectively prohibit the growth of nanospheres and plays an important role in reducing the size of LaCoO3. The porous morphology of LaCoO3 nanospheres can be obtained by an annealing process to achieve a specific capacitance of 203 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 with good cyclic stability for LaCoO3 which has been prepared with 0.5 g PVP. This attributes to the synergistic effect of both size reduction and porous morphology.
