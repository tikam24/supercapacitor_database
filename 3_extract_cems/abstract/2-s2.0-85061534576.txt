This work deals with the design of a smart balancing system for e-mobility applications. Low-cost bi-directional DC/DC converters, based on cell-to-cell shared energy transfer configuration, are used to connect battery cells to the balancing bus, which also includes a supercapacitor bank. This system can be seen as a hybrid battery management system (HBMS), since, in addition to traditional BMS features, it also enables hybridization of batteries and supercapacitors. A convex optimization problem is formulated to control the HBMS, focusing on the minimization of energy losses, while considering safety and balancing constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that, in comparison with state-of-the-art BMS solutions, the proposed HBMS reduces energy losses in up to 15%.
