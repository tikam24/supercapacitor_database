The development of new energy technology and renewable energy is a global problem today. Various ways such as artificial intelligence, algorithms forecasting, and control optimization are done for get stable and applicable results in the future. Wind velocity also has the contribution to fill the power needed for the little scale load. The standalone wind turbine has been equipped with a storage system in a DC bus. The common problem is by using a wind turbine-battery scheme, the performance had major oscillation when wind velocity had gotten into an intermittency. The purpose of this research is to provide the simulated storage performance comparison of the wind turbine standalone system using perturb and observe algorithm as the power tracker. From the performance results, it is obtained that for hybrid supercapacitor and battery system provides the better performance in terms of stability to the grid compared to the battery only system, and also the system efficiency is 94,35%, the supercapacitors keep a fixed value of 12.569 W for self-consumption. The supercapacitor in the hybrid storage system contributes to absorb the oscillatory effect, but contribute less to power flow, except during the battery time delay of response time, supercapacitors adjust to provide the lack of power..
