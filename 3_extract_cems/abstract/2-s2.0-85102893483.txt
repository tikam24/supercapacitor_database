In this work, we fabricated the three-dimensional hierarchical structure ZnO@MnO2 hybrid material on highly conductive flexible carbon cloth (CC) via hydrothermal method and thermal decomposition method for high-performance supercapacitors. During the electrochemical analysis, the hybrid CC@ZnO@MnO2 nanostructures exhibited a high area specific capacitance of 351.5 mF cm− 2 and a specific capacitance of 585.8 F g− 1 at a current density of 1.0 mA cm− 2, which was more than three times higher than that of initial CC@MnO2 electrode material. In addition, the area specific capacitance of the assembled symmetric button-type supercapacitor was 48.57mF cm− 2 and the capacitance retention rate of 100 % was obtained after 10,000 charge-discharge cycles with a current density of 1 A g− 1. Therefore, these results indicate that CC@ZnO@MnO2 is a highly attractive candidate material for future developments of supercapacitors.
