Metal oxide nanoparticles-based supercapacitor devices have received considerable attention for application as energy storage devices due to their environmental friendly and earth-abundant nature. However, many bulk metal oxide-based supercapacitors still remain a big challenging task because of their poor electrical conductivity and need for high-capacitance supercapacitors. To solve this problem, metal oxide nanoparticles have been subjected to change in their morphology and induce their electrical conductivity. Bimetallic oxides exhibit good electrochemical performance due to their electrical conductivity higher than single metal oxide. Herein we discuss the single and bimetallic oxide-based supercapacitor devices and metal oxide hybrid with carbon-based materials like nano-structured carbon, graphene, and graphene oxide and also metal-ion hybrid supercapacitor to further understand energy storage mechanism.
