This investigation reports the fabrication of three different morphologies such as mud-like, cauliflower and interconnected nanoparticles of polypyrrole (ppy) thin films through oxidant assisted successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. The influence of oxidants like ammonium per sulfate (APS), ferric chloride (FC) and potassium dichromate (PDC) on structural, morphological, surface areas and electrochemical properties of ppy thin films is examined. Among three different morphologies, interconnected nanoparticles shaped ppy thin films provide a unique three-dimensional (3D) network, high surface area and meso-porous structure which satisfy the requirements for better supercapacitive electrode materials. The electrochemical tests manifest the high specific capacitance of 510 F g-1 at a current density of 0.25 mA cm-2 with 85% capacitive retention after 1000 cycles. These studies propose that the formation of distinct nanostructures through oxidant dependent chemical polymerization route is a straightforward way for improving the electrochemical properties of ppy based supercapacitors.
