A micron-thick flexible layered RuO2·1.18H2O/PEDOT-PSS film with high electric conductivity of about 306 S cm−1 (sheet resistance of film of 7.1 Ω sq−1) was prepared using commercial PEDOT-PSS dispersion and RuO2·1.18H2O nanoparticles through a simple, low-cost vacuum filtration technology. The layered flexible film could be used as a rope to hang up 300 gram weight and as a conducting wire in a circuit to light a blue LED lamp. The symmetrical supercapacitor based on the layered flexible films showed high specific capacitance of 591 F g−1 (volumetric specific capacitance of 530 F cm−3) at 10 mV s−1, excellent long-term cycling stability (capacitance retention of 91.5%) after 5000 cycles, and high energy density of 18 Wh kg−1 at high power density of 5000 W kg−1. The flexible film as function as current collector and active material simultaneously will have practical application in miniaturized flexible supercapacitors.
