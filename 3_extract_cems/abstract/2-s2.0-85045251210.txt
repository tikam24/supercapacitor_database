Low carbon, green and energy-efficient are the important development directions of railway transit. Based on the operational requirements of rail transit and the characteristics of various energy storage components, this paper introduces a new type of E-E hybrid drive technology with super capacitors and batteries, and proposes a new configuration structure of super capacitors and batteries. The power allocation method and the key technical requirements of the technology are described, and the DC/DC voltage control optimization method is proposed for the regenerative braking energy feedback. The energy package scheme can effectively improve the performance of rail transit operation, which can provide reference for other green power drive system design.
