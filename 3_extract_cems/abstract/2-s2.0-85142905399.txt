The hybridization of multiple energy sources is the need of the present scenario which can resolve various issues such as the driving range of the electric vehicles, peak demand requirement, and uninterrupted power supply. In this work, a four-port converter in which a fuel cell, a supercapacitor, a battery, and an inverter for the electric motor of an electric vehicle (EV) are connected at each port. The power flow analysis among all four ports is demonstrated in detail. The behavior of the current in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), continuous conduction mode (CCM), mixed DCM (MDCM), and full DCM (FDCM) are analyzed using the control angle between the ports. Further, the charging and discharging behavior of the batteries are presented together with the power flow between different ports.
