Electrode active materials play a key role in electrochemical performance of supercapacitors, thus researches on the electrode active materials with better characteristics is significative to develop the actual application of supercapacitors. Here, a new hierarchical architecture composed of hexagonal phase WO3 have been successfully prepared on carbon cloth (h-WO3/CC) through a facile and effective two-step method: hydrothermal approach and a post-annealing process. For three electrode system tests, the composite electrode exhibits a large capacitance of up to 2918 mF cm−2 at a current density of 8 mA cm−2, 417 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 and well reliability with almost no decrease after 5000 cycles in the presence of H2SO4 electrolyte. Furthermore, it can be constructed into a symmetric button capacitor for two electrode systems, which demonstrates outstanding rate capability and long cycling life. The excellent performance of h-WO3/CC electrode principally attributes to the high surface area originating from the hierarchical architecture, the low internal resistance form WO3 which grows on the carbon cloth directly and multichannel structure of hexagonal crystal.
