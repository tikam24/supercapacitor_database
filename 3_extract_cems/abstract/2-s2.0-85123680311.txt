Supercapacitors are one of the energy storages designed to serve the increasing demand for electricity nowadays. They are durable and can charge electricity faster and keep electric charge longer. In this study, electrodes for supercapacitors were made from aluminum foils coated with carbon nanotube film and separated by electrolyte solution and a separator. A separator could prevent short circuit but allow ions to pass through, and consequently increased storage layers of electric charge. The separators used in this study were made from polysulfone containing CaTiO3 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 wt% with perovskite properties, high dielectric constant, electrical resistivity and energy density. After that, they were built in coin-cell form. It was found from the study that the addition of 2.0 wt% CaTiO3, the largest proportion of all samples, provided a maximum specific energy at 4.03 mWh/g and a maximum specific capacitance at 4.64 F/g. accounting for 2.17-time higher than that of polysulfone without CaTiO3. The functional group analysis of PSF and CaTiO3 separators showed that the increasing of CaTiO3 in the PSF separators, the 2958 cm-1 in C-H stretch peaks reduced, and consequently specific energy and specific capacitance were higher. Thus, supercapacitors with CaTiO3-filled polysulfone separators are suitable for improving efficiency of supercapacitors in energy storage from electrical supply.
