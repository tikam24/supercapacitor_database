Green Monoliths (GMs) of self-adhesive carbon grain from fibers of oil palm empty fruit bunches were prepared by compression pressure at 1.43 × 10 7, 1.91 × 10 7 and 2.39 × 10 7 kg/m 2, respectively. Activated carbon monoliths ACM-A, ACM-B and ACM-C prepared by CO 2 activation from these GMs, respectively, were used as electrodes in supercapacitor cells which employed stainless steel 316L current collector and H 2SO 4 electrolyte. Evaluation of the electrochemical properties showed that ACM-A, ACM-B and ACM-C cells had specific capacitance of 30, 9 and 5 F/g, total ESR of 3.21, 4.95 and 7.33 Ω, specific power (maximum) of 173.41, 107.58 and 33.82 W/kg, and specific energy (maximum) of 0.67, 0.15 and 0.09 Wh/kg. These properties are directly associated with the surface area of the ACMs, i.e. 419, 336 and 302 m 2/g for the ACM-A, ACM-B and ACM-C, respectively, indicating a direct effect of compression pressure on the physical and electrochemical properties of ACMs electrodes. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.
