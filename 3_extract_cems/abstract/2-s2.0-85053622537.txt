The aim of the paper is the study of an optimal integration of a supercapacitor-based storage system and inductive power transfer system for the free-catenary operation of a tramway. Starting from the definition of the topology of inductive power transfer system, we propose and analyze a design procedure for the pads of the inductive power system. In the second part of the paper, an optimal integration strategy for the correct size of on-board supercapacitors and the power of the inductive energy transfer are proposed. The results obtained by means of numerical simulations are discussed.
