This paper studies the hybrid energy storage system to provide frequency support for the interconnected AC grid through MTDC systems interfacing renewable resources. A hybrid energy storage structure was created using a supercapacitor (SC) and battery storage systems (BESs). To coordinate the sharing of power between SC and BESS, an improved droop controller based on virtual inductance, capacitance, and resistance gain (VICRC) is suggested. Meanwhile, the droop controller's steady-state deviation of the DC link voltage is immediately suppressed. The SC will be in charge of compensating the high-frequency demand, whereas the BESS will be in charge of compensating the low-frequency power demand, thanks to a decentralized energy management process. In addition, the suggested method aids in the rehabilitation of the SC's SOC. Finally, the simulation results with detailed models of the wind farms and ACâ€“DC grid converters are performed on IEEE tests systems in Simulink/SPS and the results extensively discussed to evaluate the proposed structure.
