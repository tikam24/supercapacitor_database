Flexible electricity storage devices with high areal capacitance were urgently demanded due to recent development of advanced portable electronics. In this work, a facile cathodic electrodeposition method was employed to anchor RuOx•nH2O on three-dimensional graphene frameworks to realize improved utilization efficiency of RuOx•nH2O and shortened diffusion/transport path for electrons and protons, without adhesives. A high areal capacitance of 3.78 F∙cm-2 was achieved at 2 mV∙s-1, which was attributed to the feasible electrolyte transport into the nano layered-structure of RuOx•nH2O. Furthermore, all-solid-state flexible supercapacitors were prepared for practical application, achieving an energy density of 0.1 mWh∙cm-2 and a power density of 2.4 mW∙cm-2 at a current density of 10 mA∙cm-2, which surpassed most state-of-the-art works.
