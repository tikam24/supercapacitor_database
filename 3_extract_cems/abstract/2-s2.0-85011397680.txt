A flexible and freestanding supercapacitor electrode with a N,P-co-doped carbon nanofiber network (N,P-CNFs)/graphene (GN) composite loaded on bacterial cellulose (BC) is first designed and fabricated in a simple, low-cost, and effective approach. The porous structure and excellent mechanical properties make the BC paper an ideal substrate that shows a large areal mass of 8 mg cm−2. As a result, the flexible N,P-CNFs/GN/BC paper electrode shows appreciable areal capacitance (1990 mF cm−2in KOH and 2588 mF cm−2in H2SO4electrolytes) without sacrificing gravimetric capacitance (248.8 F g−1and 323.5 F g−1), exhibits excellent cycling ability (without capacity loss after 20 000 cycles), and remarkable tensile strength (42.8 MPa). By direct coupling of two membrane electrodes, the symmetric supercapacitor delivers a prominent areal capacitance of 690 mF cm−2in KOH and 898 mF cm−2in H2SO4, and remarkable power/energy density (19.98 mW cm−2/0.096 mW h cm−2in KOH and 35.01 mW cm−2/0.244 mW h cm−2in H2SO4). Additionally, it shows stable behavior in both bent and flat states. These results promote new opportunities for N,P-CNFs/GN/BC paper electrodes as high areal performance, freestanding electrodes for flexible supercapacitors.
