3D flower-like Co3O4/Polypyrrole (PPy) nanosheet networks are directly grown onto Ni foam involving the solution-based method and in-situ oxidative polymerization of pyrrole for supercapacitor electrode materials. The as-prepared electrode takes advantage of the exceptional architecture of Co3O4 and high electronic conductivity of PPy. Electrochemical measurements show that the areal capacitance of 3D Co3O4/PPy electrode is 6.81 F cm−2 at 5 mA cm−2 in 6 mol L−1 KOH aqueous solution. The capacitance is 95% of original capacitance after 1000 cycles at 20 mA cm−2. With superior electrochemical characteristics and the ease of large scale fabrication, the 3D flower-like Co3O4/Polypyrrole nanosheet networks provide promising electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
