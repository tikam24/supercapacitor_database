The necessity of vehicle pollution reduction raised the discussion about electrification in automotive industry. There could be a partial electrification, case of hybrid electric vehicles with a hybrid propulsion system, and there could be full electrification, case of electric vehicles (EV) with exclusive electric propulsion. The actual main issue for EV is the energy supply system (ESS) which has to ensure performances comparable with a conventional vehicle. At the same time, ESS can also be hybrid (HESS), thus can be composed of different elements: lithium battery, supercapacitors (SC) or fuel cells (FC). This paper proposes an intelligent algorithm which arbitrates the power split between elements of HESS in order to minimize the energy consumption of the EV. This algorithm is based on Bellman's principle of optimality and dynamic programming, which finds the best solution to use the supply system having three different components: battery pack, SC and hydrogen FC.
