Herein, an integrated system combining solar cells with a hybrid supercapacitor for operating a homemade windmill device was assembled, achieving energy conversion, storage and utilization. As a candidate for positive electrode of hybrid supercapacitor devices, battery-like Ni(OH)2@CuO@Cu binder-free electrode was fabricated by a two-step process at ambient temperature. CuO@Cu was prepared by chemical oxidation method to act as the supporting electrode for electrochemical deposition of Ni(OH)2. Various deposition times (30, 50, 90, 150 and 200 s) were investigated to optimize the energy storage characteristics of the resulting Ni(OH)2@CuO@Cu electrode materials. Among all the samples, Ni(OH)2@CuO@Cu-150 exhibited the largest areal capacity of 7063 mC cm−2 at 20 mA cm−2, and was therefore chosen as the positive electrode in a hybrid supercapacitor device. Using N-doped reduced graphene oxide on nickel foam (N-rGO/NF) as the negative electrode, a hybrid supercapacitor was assembled. It displayed good flexibility, cycling stability and high areal energy density of 130.4 μWh cm−2 at a power density of 1.6 mW cm−2. Two hybrid supercapacitor devices were connected in series to successfully lighten up a red LED for 12 min 39 s, while three devices assembled in series were able to successfully power a three-digit digital display for 1 min 28 s. Interestingly, the hybrid supercapacitor device, charged by solar cells, further operated a homemade windmill device for 59 s, achieving sunlight-powered integration system. All of the findings suggested the practical application potential of the hybrid supercapacitor based on Ni(OH)2@CuO@Cu composite as energy storage device.
