The emergence of flexible and wearable electronics has raised the demand for flexible supercapacitors with accurate sizes and aesthetic shapes. Here, a strategy is developed to prepare flexible all-in-one integrated supercapacitors by combining all-freeze-casting with typography technique. The continuous seamless connection of all-in-one supercapacitor devices enhances the load and/or electron transfer capacity and avoids displacing and detaching between their neighboring components at bending status. Therefore, such a unique structure of all-in-one integrated devices is beneficial for retaining stable electrochemical performance at different bending levels. More importantly, the sizes and aesthetic shapes of integrated supercapacitors could be controlled by the designed molds, like type matrices of typography. The molds could be assembled together and typeset randomly, achieving the controllable construction and series and/or parallel connection of several supercapacitor devices. The preparation of flexible integrated supercapacitors will pave the way for assembling programmable all-in-one energy storage devices into highly flexible electronics.
