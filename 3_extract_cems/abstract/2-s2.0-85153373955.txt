ZnO nanoparticles will be combined with an activated carbon nanocomposite electrode to create a supercapacitor cell. The component measurement and rudimentary composition of NPs were resolute using TEM-SAED, and their optical transparency was investigated and TEM representation confirmed that the unit dimension was between 10 and 80 nm. Finally, the EI spectroscopy of ZnO and activated carbon is better considering its supercapacitor property. UV spectroscopy exposed an amalgamation signal at 372 nm, and the sample is transparent in the visible region at 5 mV/sec the conductance of the prepared sample is predictable to 185.2 F/cm2. The electrochemical impedance of ZnO nanocomposites and activate carbon with dissimilar accumulation ratios (1:1 to 1:3) was measured, and the estimated capacitance value (was 185.2 F/cm2).
