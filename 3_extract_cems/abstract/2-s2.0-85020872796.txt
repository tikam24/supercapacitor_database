We have designed and synthesized CoS2 and MoS2/CoS2 nanotube arrays by one-step hydrothermal method using Co(OH)2 nanorod arrays as the template. The products were characterized by X-ray diffraction pattern, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The MoS2/CoS2 electrode is demonstrated to have a relatively high area capacitance of 142.5 mF cm-2 at 1 mA cm-2, which is higher than that of CoS2 or MoS2 electrode. Besides, the electrode also shows excellent cycle stability of 1000 cycles with 92.7% retention, which is also superior to that of CoS2 and MoS2 electrodes. These results indicate that MoS2/CoS2 nanotube arrays have potential as electrode materials of supercapacitors because of the synergistic reaction of MoS2 (which supplies the specific surface area and effective electrolyte accessibility) and CoS2 (which serves as a conductive channel and reduces the phenomenon of aggregation). The design of MoS2/CoS2 architecture may open up a new strategy for synthesizing promising electrode materials for supercapacitors. (Graph Presented).
