The Ni(OH)2 particles were synthesized by infinite dilute method. The as-prepared particles are a-Ni(OH)2, which are well dispersed and have a fish scale morphology. The electrochemical tests show that the particles have relatively high capacitance and excellent capacitive retention. The good structure and excellent performance suggest its promising application in supercapacitor. Â© The Electrochemical Society of Japan, All rights reserved.
