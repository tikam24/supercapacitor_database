In today's modern world, Electric vehicles play a critical role. For a brushless DC (BLDC) motor-driven electric vehicle, regenerative electric braking system is suggested (EV) to enhance the efficiency of energy storage system. A battery, inverter, motor and charging port is the major components included in an electric vehicle. However the vehicle's power train is a key component. The motor's electric vehicle should be designed based on its efficiency and cost. The power-weight ratio, speed, torque and cost of motors are compared and analyzed in this research. Because of its greater power-to-weight ratio in spite of higher maintenance and controller expenses, the BLDC motor is demonstrated to be the most suitable for an electric vehicle. Next, the regenerative braking for electric vehicles is proposed and its performance is investigated. Regenerative braking involves using the generator function of an electric car's motor to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. Regenerative braking converts its kinetic energy and saves it in storage devices. This technique upsurges the range or decreases the fuel usage of a vehicle. The system under study is composed of a brushless DC motor, a Buck-Boost DC converter, and super capacitors. The suitable control system is optimized to store the energy in the super capacitors. With the help of this research, electric car energy flow regulation will be improved and the maximum range per charge cycle will be realized.
