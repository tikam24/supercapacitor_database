A novel nickel foam (NF)@carbon microspheres (CMSs)@Ni3S2 composite electrode is prepared through a two-step hydrothermal process. The as-obtained NF@CMSs@Ni3S2 is directly used as a binder-free working electrode in supercapacitors and its electrochemical performance is evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge and discharge test (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). It is found that the NF@CMSs@Ni3S2 composite exhibits superior area capacitance performance with high capability of 7.10 F cm−2 at 8 mA cm−2 and preferable cycling stability with 80.6% retention of specific capacitance after 2500 cycles at 16 mA cm−2. The excellent performance can be attributed to the large specific area provided by the CMSs for embedding Ni3S2.
