Multiwalled nanotubes/cotton composite was prepared firstly as conductive fabric, and then, polyaniline (PANI) doped with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were fabricated on the conductive fabric to make flexible cotton-based supercapacitor electrodes. The doping of MWCNTs cannot only provide good conductivity and large specific surface area of the electrode, but also help to increase the loading of aniline monomer in the polyaniline polymerization. Field emission scanning electron microscopy was applied to observe the surface morphology of the composite, and Fourier transform infrared and Energy dispersion spectrum were used to analysis the existence of PANI. Electrochemical tests were adopted to measure the electrochemical performance. The results demonstrated the multivariate mixture composite flexible electrode exhibited a specific capacitance of 590.93 F g−1 at a scan rate of 0.001 V s−1 and an excellent capacitance retention of 89% at 0.1 V s−1 after 3000 cycles. Based on our method, the cycle stability of the composite was great and so was the capacitance retention.
