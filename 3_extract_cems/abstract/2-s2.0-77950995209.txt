To solve the power pollution in load side, a novel device named power quality control device (PQCD) is presented. This device combined the unified power quality conditioner (UPQC) with the fuel cell to enhance the compensation scope of the UPQC and this topology was beneficial to the miniaturization of the device, the diversification of power supply and power grid greening. The three port bidirectional converter combining the fuel cell with a supercapacitor was utilized to maintain the DC-link capacitor voltage. To deal with the distorted system voltage with multiple zero crossings, a simple and practical harmonic detection method was designed. Based on the detected reference signals, the double integration control and one cycle current control were applied to rapidly and precisely track the voltage and current references, respectively. The one cycle current control mainly contained a comparator and a RS flip-flop and the frequency of the output signal was constant, therefore it is beneficial to the design of the passive filter and practical application. The simulation results illustrate the reasonableness, effectiveness and reliability of the power quality control device's design.
