Controllable fabrication of lightweight, highly conductive, and flexible films is important to simultaneously achieve excellent electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and high-rate energy storage. Herein, ultrathin, flexible, and conductive (up to 365,000 ± 5000 S m−1) TOCNFs/CNT/Ti3C2Tx hybrid films were fabricated by a facile vacuum-filtration. The obtained films with 60 wt% Ti3C2Tx content exhibited a high specific EMI SE of 9316.4 ± 205.32 dB cm2 g−1, which was comparable to most of the other carbon- and MXene- based materials synthesized by complex steps. Additionally, the porous structure contributed to exposing more active sites and providing efficient transport of electrolyte ions. Consequently, the hybrid films showed a high areal capacitance and high specific capacitance of 537 mF cm−2 and 279.7 F g−1 at 0.3 mA cm−2, respectively, together with impressive stability of 93.1% after 8000 cycles. This work provides an effective strategy to synthesize high-performance conductive films for applications in wearable or portable electronic devices.
