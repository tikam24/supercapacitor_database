Corn cob is one of the agricultural waste materials subjected to improper burning, which creates pollution. It can be used for the production of green technologies for further applications. Carbonisation or slow pyrolysis could be promising alternative to burning. It has many applications, such as soil ameliorant, waste water treatment, carbon sequestration, composting, supercapacitor, fuel cell and biocomposites material. It motivated to investigate the suitability of corn cob as a potential material for biochar production and its application. The advanced form of analysis, such as thermogravimetric, scanning electron microscopy, surface area, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy, is elaborated for in-depth knowledge of characteristics. The hypothesis is that if the available corn cob is used for biochar production, it will reduce the carbon dioxide (CO2) emission. On a global level, conversion of available corn cob into biochar is expected to reduce CO2 emission by 0.13 Gt per year. The reduction in CO2 emission also favours economy. If 1 tonne of biomass per year is converted into biochar, 0.82 tonnes of CO2 can be reduced per year and by considering the emission cost of Rs 1800 per tonne, the cost saving would be Rs 1476 per year. The presented mini-review article provides an outline of the state-of-art information on corn cob biochar and its novel application. It will be helpful to scientific domain to find new opportunities in biochar research and also the humanity will be benefitted due to reduction in greenhouse gases.
