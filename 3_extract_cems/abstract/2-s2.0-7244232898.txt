Carbon aerogel was synthesized from resorcinol and formaldehyde by sol-gel process. The structure and pore size distribution of carbon aerogel were studied. Constant current cycle was used to measure the electrochemical property of supercapacitor made of carbon aerogel electrode in NaOH electrolyte. The results showed that carbon aerogel electrode exhibited excellent high efficiency and stable electrochemical behavior. The specific capacitance was as high as 121 F/g at 0.5 mA current and the efficiency of charge-discharge achieved 95%.
