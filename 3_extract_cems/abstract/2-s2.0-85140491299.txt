The Current review is a comprehensive document in which we outline recent advances in the fabrication of metal organic framework based on nickel (Ni-MOF) and their high energy supercapacitor applications as electrode materials. Ni-MOFs have ignited a lot of interest in energy storage systems due to their extraordinary properties among various transition metal-based metal organic frameworks such as superior electrochemical performance, outstanding rate capability, highly porous structure, abundant active sites, high specific capacitance, strong redox activity, and eco-friendly have sparked intense interest in the development of growing supercapacitors to satisfy the soaring requirement for efficient electrochemical energy storage devices. However, reviews on Ni-MOFs and its nanocomposites as electrode material for high energy supercapacitor applications are very rare. The current review also presents the synthetic methods such as hydro/solvothermal approach, microwave-assisted, slow evaporation, sonochemical, electrochemical, and mechanochemical in electrochemical energy storage systems. Several nanocomposites of Ni-MOFs with carbon nanotubes, graphene, and polymers along with characterization techniques have been briefly reviewed here. Furthermore, this study outlines the current issues as well as some potential solutions that may embolden remarkable strategic design of agile Ni-MOFs nanomaterials for high performance supercapacitors in the upcoming period.
