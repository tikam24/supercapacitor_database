By using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) asstabilizer, polyaniline (PANI) nano-spheres with diameters of about 200 nm were prepared via chemical oxidative polymerization method.The composition, structure, and morphology of as-prepared electrode material were characterized by XRD, FT-IR, FESEM and TEM techniques. The capacitive properties of PANI nano-sphere electrode material for supercapacitor was investigated in three electrode system.The specific capacitance of the PANI nano-sphere electrode material was 494 F/g at the current density of 0.5 A/g.And the capacitance retention was 71% when the current density increases from 0.5 to 20 A/g.
