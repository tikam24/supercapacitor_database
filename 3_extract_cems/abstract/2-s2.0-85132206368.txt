In this study, nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4) nanoparticles synthesized by a solution based approach have been investigated for supercapacitor application. To prepare the electrode of supercapacitor, NiFe2O4 nanoparticles were deposited on a stainless steel substrate by drop casting method. The structural and morphological properties of the synthesized NiFe2O4 nanoparticles were investigated by XRD and SEM techniques. The electrochemical performance was investigated in an aqueous electrolyte and in two electrodes configuration. A specific capacitance of âˆ¼ 120F/g has been obtained from NiFe2O4 nanoparticles. Electrochemical properties suggest that NiFe2O4 can be utilized as effective electrode for supercapacitor.
