Development of efficient energy storage devices is a very important challenge for renewable energy advancement. One of the promising energy storage systems is the supercapacitor. In this research work, a composite material based on porous carbon and manganese oxide was synthesized by potentiostatic (PS) electroplating by applying a potential of 1 V vs Ag / AgCl for different periods. The physico-chemical and electrochemical characterizations were carried out in order to evaluate their performances and to elucidate the relation between their structures and their electrochemical performances. We have shown a significant influence of the electrodeposition time on the morphology and performance of manganese oxides. In addition, it was found that the sample synthesized for 20 seconds showed good capacitive behavior with a high specific capacity (320 F / g). Electrodeposition time of 20 seconds allows the formation of an excellent electrode for the supercapacitor.
