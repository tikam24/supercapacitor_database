Supercapacitors (SCs) have garnered increasing attention as an alternative energy storage device but the relatively low potential window and energy density impede their application prospect. Herein, we propose a novel three-dimensional (3D) packaging method for the first time, utilizing high flexible phosphor-copper sheets (PCSs) sprayed with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and covered with polyimide (PI) films on their both sides as the serial medium followed by CO2 laser irradiation to fabricate all-solid-state flexible high voltage supercapacitors (HVSCs). This method achieves double voltage output in the limited PI membrane compared with common 2D encapsulation. As a result, as-obtained HVSCs deliver not only an enhanced mechanical tensile strength up to 18.23 MPa but also the outstanding electrochemical performances, including ultrahigh working voltage window (10 V), high energy density (37.68 Î¼Wh/cm2) and power density (3.38 mW/cm2). Owing to the excellent flexibility, the HVSCs can be arbitrarily bent or twisted without obvious attenuation on capacitive property. After 10000 cycles, the capacitance retention of HVSCs still maintains to be 90.2%. This novel 3D packaging strategy may pave the way for developing high-performing SCs with wide operating voltage and high energy density for flexible displays, wearable equipment and integrated electrical devices.
