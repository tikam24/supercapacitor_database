Tin oxide coated molybdenum oxide nanowires (SnO 2/MoO 3) are synthesized by a combination of hydrothermal and wet chemical routes. The electrochemical capacitance properties of the SnO 2/MoO 3 core shell composite nanowires are measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge method in 1 M Na 2SO 4 aqueous solutions. The results showed that specific capacitance of SnO 2/MoO 3 core shell composite nanowires is 295 F g -1, which is much higher than the specific capacitance of pure individual MoO 3 (69 F g -1) and SnO 2 (96.6 F g -1). Moreover the synthesized core shell composite nanowires has also exhibited excellent long-term cycling stability (only 3% loss of its initial specific capacitance after 1000 cycles) which may lead to its multifarious usage in high-performance energy storage devices for future potential applications.
