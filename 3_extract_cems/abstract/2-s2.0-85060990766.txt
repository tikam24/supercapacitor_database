Pure, Copper and Zinc doped Cadmium oxide was incorporated by the co-precipitation method. In this preparation method cadmium chloride, copper chloride, zinc chloride has been utilized as a precursor material. X-Ray Diffraction pattern, Fourier Transform Infrared spectrum and, Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Spectrum have affirmed the presence of the copper and zinc doped cadmium oxide nanoparticles. Scanning Electron Microscope uncovered the surface morphology, Ultra Violet-Vis Near Infra analysis and the optical band gap of the materials were observed to be 2.48 eV for Pure CdO, 2.35 eV for Cu–CdO and 2.28 eV for Zn–CdO which were assessed from Tauc's plot. The predominant electrochemical capacitive execution using Cyclic Voltammetry which indicates that the material has the ability to form a capable electrode material for stable and high-performance electrochemical supercapacitors.
