This paper introduces the function of regenerative braking energy utilization device in rail transit during vehicle regenerative braking, analyzes in detail the problems faced when using PI controller for closed-loop control of DC voltage, and puts forward a method of closed-loop control of DC voltage with series pi-pi controller. It is concluded that the zero steady-state error control of DC voltage can be realized by using the series pi-pi controller when the braking current increases in the given slope mode. The simulation results show that the method is correct and practical.
