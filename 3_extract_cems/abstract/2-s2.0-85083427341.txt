The lifetime prediction of supercapacitors is of great significance to the management of energy storage systems, but the phenomenon of capacitance regeneration may occur in the aging cycle experiment of supercapacitors, which will bring about interference to its lifetime prediction. In this paper, the critical factors affecting the capacitance regeneration of supercapacitors are investigated, so as to analyze the influence of the regeneration phenomenon on the lifetime prediction of supercapacitors. The results show that the regeneration performance of supercapacitors is closely related to the working voltage, temperature, aging depth and recovery time. When the charging voltage is increased, the amplitude of the capacitance regeneration decreases, and with the deepening of aging degree, the amplitude of the capacitance regeneration decreases gradually. The temperature has little effect on the amplitude of the capacitance regeneration, but the higher the temperature, the longer the recovery time of capacitance regeneration. In addition, the regeneration capacitance of supercapacitors decays faster than its inherent capacitance under the same aging test conditions. Considering the capacitance regeneration characteristics, the aging trend of supercapacitors is predicted by using support vectors machines method. The prediction results are basically identical with the experimental results.
