Managing the energy is one of the most important issues for the efficiency of vehicular applications using hybrid electric power systems. This paper deals with an analysis of an energy management for hybrid power system, which consists of fuel cell, ultra-capacitor and battery and dedicated to electrical vehicles. Thus, an energy management method is applied in order to split the energy flow between the three used sources. This strategy is based on a combination of three control methods; a fuzzy logic control, a flatness control and rule-based algorithm. For the fuzzy logic, the main idea is inspired from rule-based algorithms except that it is more flexible and less aggressive. The second technic is an innovative control using the flatness property for a Fuel cell/ supercapacitor/ Battery hybrid power system. For the rules based algorithm, it uses a supercapacitor state-of-charge control principle. Then, an experimental validation is done for the energy management method to show the efficiency of the proposed control strategy in term of the well share of the energy between sources to satisfy the load demand. A dSpace real-time card is used for management algorithm implementation and data acquisition. The obtained experimental results prove the efficiency and the validity of the proposed supervisor.
