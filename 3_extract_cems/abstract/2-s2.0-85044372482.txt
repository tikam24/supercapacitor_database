Vertically-aligned Ni3S2 nanorod bundles were grown on nickel foam through a novel hydrothermal method for application as supercapacitor electrode. In this method, Fe3+ ions were utilized as the etching agent for the nickel foam substrate; the nickel foam itself is both the nickel source for Ni3S2 and the scaffold substrate. Furthermore, it was revealed that Mg2+ ions can act as growth modifiers and afford vertically-aligned nanorod bundles of Ni3S2. A crystal growth mechanism was proposed and the vital roles of Fe3+ and Mg2+ were explained. Electrochemical studies of the Ni3S2 electrodes were conducted in 3 M KOH solution, and the cyclic voltammetric tests revealed that the charge storage of the Ni3S2 nanorod bundles involves both capacitive and charge-transfer mechanisms identified by high base currents and broad redox peaks, respectively. A specific capacitance of 230 mF cm−2 at a high potential scan rate of 100 mV s−1 with a stable performance up to 1000 cycles attests the superiority of the supercapacitor electrode.
