This paper proposes the hybrid energy system for a smart green building. The hybrid energy system has the variety of power sources, such as photovoltaic generation systems, wind power generation systems, and diesel generator with energy storage systems. The energy storage system can be combined the battery and super-capacitor, and it can be optimized for the fuel consumption efficiency of the diesel generator to supply the stable power to loads. In this paper, it shows the modeling and control of each hybrid energy system and the simulation results to verify the optimized operation of diesel generator.
