Supercapacitors, also called ultracapacitors or electrochemical capacitors, are an ideal electrochemical energy-storage system, suitable for rapid storage and release of energy. They are in between high-power-output conventional capacitors and high-energydensity batteries. In comparison with that of batteries, the energy density of supercapacitors is much lower. The aim of supercapacitor development is improving the energy density without sacrificing the high power density. Supercapacitors can be classified into two major types based on the active electrode material used: an electrochemical double-layer capacitor consists of carbon electrode and pseudocapacitor or redox capacitor with the use of metal oxide or conducting polymers. Among these electroactive materials, conducting polymers are promising materials for supercapacitors due to the advantages of high specific capacitance, reasonable conductivity, redox properties, environmental stability and eco-friendly quality. Among the conducting polymers, polyaniline is mostly being studied for supercapacitor application because of its easy processability, light weight, safe, low cost and eco-friendly nature. This article presents an overview of literature data on the historical background of capacitor, classification of supercapacitors and status of polyaniline based materials (polyaniline and its composites with carbon and/or metal oxide) for supercapacitor work. These issues are summarized and discussed. Â© 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.
