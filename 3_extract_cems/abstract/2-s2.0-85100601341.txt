The heteroatom doped carbon with hierarchically porous structure and high specific surface area (SSA) can provide promising electrochemical performance for supercapacitor, however, the synthetic procedure is fairly complicated. Hererin, a N,P,S-codoped carbon (NPSC) is facilely manufactured by thermal annealing of polyaniline/phytic acid (PANI/PA) hydrogel, and the electrochemical characteristics can be effectively modified by altering the amount of PA applied. The products possess hierarchically micropore-dominant porous structure with high SSA and abundant heteroatoms. The electrochemical investigation reveals that the capacitive performance of product is mainly contributed by the fast-kinetic processes, and the sample prepared with medium amount of PA delivers a superior capacitance (402 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1) owing to the well-balanced electron/ion transport behavior. Furthermore, the symmetric supercapacitor composing two NPSC electrodes exhibits outstanding energy densities of 21.7 and 10.9 Wh kg−1 at the power densities of 350 and 7000 W kg−1, respectively. Meanwhile, an excellent capacitance retention (93.7%) is achieved after 10000 charge/discharge cycles at 3 A g−1. This NPSC with facile synthesis and optimised nanostructure and heteroatoms codoping shows superior capacitive performance, highlighting great feasibility of the strategy to manufacture advanced carbons based on conducting polymer hydrogels.
