The most promising way to increase the properties of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to use in supercapacitor electrodes is rational design, and defects and high porosity are introduced via the use of bimetallic MOFs. In this work, we synthesized Cu-MOF and accommodated different ions in the structure to evaluate the effect of mixed metal and mixed linker in MOF structures. Pillar-layered metal-organic frameworks, M2(L)2(DABCO), M = Cu, Co, Ni, L = BDC (1,4-benzene dicarboxylic acid), NH2BDC (2-Aminoterephthalic acid), and DABCO = 1,4-diazabicyclo [2.2.2] octane, have been designed by accommodating ions and ligands in the structures and synthesizing in a facile manner. Various characteristic and electrochemical measurements were done to investigate our samples application's performance. According to the results, the best capacitance is for the mixed metal/ligand MOF, Cuâ€“Co (NH2/50). Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitor was set up using our MOF and activated carbon as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. Our synthesized electrode performed maximum specific energy of 3.39 Wh/kg, maximum specific power of 750.0 W/kg, and capacity stabilization of 86% after 10000 cycles.
