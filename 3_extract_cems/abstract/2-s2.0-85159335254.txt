Pitch is a complex mixture of a series of hydrocarbons rich in thick rings aromatic hydrocarbons and their non-metallic derivatives with high carbon content. The development of pitch as a carbon material precursor for the preparation of supercapacitor carbon electrode material not only expands the application market of pitch and enhances its added value, but also responds to the national demand for new energy utilization. In this paper, the energy storage mechanism of supercapacitors was firstly described, and the structural factors and laws affecting the electrochemical properties of carbon materials for supercapacitors were discussed. The composition, structural model, sources and applications of pitch were outlined. Then, the research progress of pitch-based porous carbon for supercapacitor electrode materials was reviewed, and the characteristics and progress of pitch-based porous carbon preparation by activation method, template method and molten salt method were analyzed. A summary of the research on the modification of pitch-based porous carbon materials was highlighted. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of pitch-based porous carbon materials as electrode materials for supercapacitors were pointed out. It is suggested that the asphalt raw materials should be pretreated and carbonized to remove metal heteroatoms from the obtained carbon materials to obtain capacitor carbon with stable and long cycle life. The research on the carbonization law of four components in asphalt should be strengthened, so as to improve the carbonization rate of pitch-based supercapacitive carbon materials. The KOH activation method should be combined with other activation methods in order to reduce the loss of equipment and the impact on the environment on the basis of obtaining high-performance activated carbon.
