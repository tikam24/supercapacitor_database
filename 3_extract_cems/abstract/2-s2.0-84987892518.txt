The use of carbide-derived carbon (CDC) as the positive electrode material for lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) is investigated. CDC based LIC cells are studied utilizing two different negative electrode materials: graphite and lithium titanate Li4Ti5O12 (LTO). The graphite electrodes are prelithiated before assembling the LICs, and LTO containing cells are studied with and without prelithiation. The rate capability and cycle life stability during 1000 cycles are evaluated by galvanostatic cycling at current densities of 0.4–4 mA cm−2. The CDC shows a specific capacitance of 120 F g−1 in the organic lithium-containing electrolyte, and the LICs demonstrate a good stability over 1000 charge-discharge cycles. The choice of the negative electrode is found to have an effect on the utilization of the CDC positive electrode during cycling and on the specific energy of the device. The graphite/CDC cell delivers a maximum specific discharge energy of 90 Wh kg−1 based on the total mass of active material in the cell. Both the prelithiated and non-prelithiated LTO/CDC cells show a specific energy of around 30 Wh kg−1.
