Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) systems are one of the important technologies which are gaining major importance presently. This technologies help to meet peak electrical load demands by providing time varying energy management. Therefore, it can be suitably utilized to solve reactive power dispatch (RPD) problems. The RPD's are frequently associated with real power loss minimizations with dynamic voltage stability issues. The proposed RPD problems are commonly tackled by capacitor placements. Due to its static behavior, the capacitors are unable to provide desired results every time. In this context, SMES can generate the desired solutions. However, the SMES have also limited applications due to their higher installation and operating costs. Now, if the hybridized compensators involving capacitor and SMES are optimally chosen, the cost of operation reduces. In this work, hybrid capacitor-SMES based var compensation is utilized to solve the RPD problem. The sitting and sizing of the compensators are assigned by the Cuckoo Search Algorithm. The CSA based results showed the hybrid capacitor-SMES provided minimum 6.85 % power loss reduction w.r.t other meta-heuristics techniques. Moreover, the hybrid capacitor-ESS achieved 3.93 % more power loss reduction and 1.53 times improved economics compared to single capacitor based solution.
