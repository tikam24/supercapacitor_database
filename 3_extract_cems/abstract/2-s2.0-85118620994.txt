Transition metal tellurides have been developed as electrodes for supercapacitors owing to their high pseudocapacitance and excellent electrical conductivity. However, the limited surface-active sites limit the improvement of capacity performance. Herein, the 3D hierarchical nanoarrays consisting of NiCo-Te nanoneedles modified with Co1.29Ni1.71O4were designed and synthesized on nickel foam (NF@NiCo-Te/Co1.29Ni1.71O4). In particular, due to the design of bimetallic telluride structure with multiple oxidation states and the surface modification of bimetallic oxides with adequate active sites, the prepared NF@NiCo-Te/Co1.29Ni1.71O4shows rapid and invertible redox reaction during the process of energy storage. At the current density of 1.0 A g−1, the as-prepared electrode material can express a high specific capacitance of 186.5 mA h g−1(1332 F g−1). Significantly, electrolyte ions can easily complete intercalation and deintercalation due to the multilayer structure of nanoneedles, and the hybrid supercapacitors assembled by activated carbon (negative electrode) and NF@NiCo-Te/Co1.29Ni1.71O4(positive electrode) deliver a maximum energy density of 63.4 W h kg−1at 800 W kg−1. In addition, the capacity retention ratio of NF@NiCo-Te/Co1.29Ni1.71O4//AC remains 83.85% after 5000 high-current charge-discharge cycles. Therefore, the 3D architecture electrodes based on bimetallic tellurides with unique structures possess a great application value in energy storage.
