To come across the ever-increasing energy demands, metal chalcogenide nanomaterials are intensely demanded the exploration of the different supercapacitor applications including electronics, automobiles, space, military, etc. Metal chalcogenide (i.e., sulfides, selenides, and tellurides) are strongly considered as an emerging contender, in consequence of their unique physical and chemical properties. In this chapter, the recent research progress of the last 5 years on metal chalcogenides nanomaterials in the field of supercapacitors is summarized in terms of their unexpected performance as high energy density, power density, specific capacitance, current density, and capacitive retention values proving them efficient candidates as supercapacitors.
