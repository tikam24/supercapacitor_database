We have utilized the SILAR technique to prepare the manganese oxide nanosheets on SS substrates for binder free supercapacitor electrode. The manganese oxide nanosheets thin films were prepared and well structural characterized with Raman, XRD, XPS, FE-SEM, FE-TEM and EDAX mapping. The electrochemical properties of manganese oxide thin films were systematically studied with cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The manganese oxide nanosheets show the utmost capacitance of 398 F g–1, at the current density of 1 A g–1. The capacity retention was 91.3% after completion of 2000 cycles at 20 A g–1. The manganese oxide nanosheets display the maximum energy density of 35.4 Wh kg–1 and power density of 8000 W kg–1. These impressive results conclude the manganese oxide nanosheets was a promising electrode material for supercapacitor.
