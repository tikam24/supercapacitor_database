Metal oxides and sulfides nanocomposites with mesoporous structure are gaining attention in the field of supercapacitors owing to their high surface area and appropriate pore size distribution. Such nanocomposites deliver high values of specific capacitance due to effective contacts between the electrode and the electrolytes. Moreover, the high value of the specific capacitance is attributed to fast transport of ions and electrons in the bulk and at the interface of the electrode and the electrolyte. The present study reports synthesis and the fabrication of a high-performance electrode consisting of Y2Zr2O7/MnS nanocomposite as a dynamic material for supercapacitor application. Because of distinctive morphology, the unique electrode consisting of Y2Zr2O7/MnS nanocomposite can store and tolerate a specific capacitance of 262 F/g at a potential window of 0.75 V. The nanocomposite electrode demonstrates a high cyclic stability over 4500 successive cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV). The specific capacitance increases from 145 to 905 F/g after successive 4000 CV cycles. The ability to tolerate high specific capacitance, withstanding over successive CV cycles and its outperformance suggests that Y2Zr2O7/MnS nanocomposite can be an alternative high performance electrode for next generation supercapacitors.
