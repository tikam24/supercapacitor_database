Conventional wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in smart home-building (SHB) are typically driven by batteries, limiting their lifespan and the maximum number of deployable units. To satisfy the energy demand for the next generation of SHB which can interconnect WSNs to make the internet of smart home-building (IoSHB), this study introduces the design and implementation of a 250 mW to 2.3 W energy harvesting device. The proposed device is dynamically autonomous owing to the integration of embedded solar photovoltaic (PV) modules and power storage through a supercapacitor (SC; 5 V, 0.47 F) capable of powering WSNs for 95 s (up to 4.11 V). The deployed device can harvest indoor and outdoor ambient light at a minimum illumination of 50 lux and a maximum illumination of 200 lux. Moreover, the proposed system supports wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to do data transfer to a webserver as a complete internet of things (IoT) device. A customized android dashboard is further developed for data monitoring on a smartphone. All in all, this self-powered WSN node can interface with the users of the SHBs for displaying ambient data, which demonstrates its promising applicability and stability.
