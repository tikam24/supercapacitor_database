A novel in situ N and low-valence-state Mo dual doping strategy was employed to significantly improve the conductivity, active-site accessibility, and electrochemical stability of MoO3, drastically boosting its electrochemical properties. Consequently, our optimized N-MoO3-xnanowires exhibited exceptional performances as a bifunctional anode material for both fiber-shaped asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) and microbial fuel cells (MFCs). The flexible fiber-shaped ASC and MFC device based on the N-MoO3-xanode could deliver an unprecedentedly high energy density of 2.29 mWh cm-3and a remarkable power density of 0.76 Î¼W cm-1, respectively. Such a bifunctional fiber-shaped N-MoO3-xelectrode opens the way to integrate the electricity generation and storage for self-powered sources.
