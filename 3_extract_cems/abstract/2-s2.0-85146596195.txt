Polypyrrole-carbon nanotube (PPy-CNTs) nanocomposites as an active material for supercapacitor electrode was prepared and their electrochemical properties were measured as a function of PPy particle size. In order to make nanocomposites, a solution of pyrrole monomer was prepared and CNTs functionalized at different times with of 2, 5 and 10 wt.% were added to the solution. It was found that, by increasing the CNTs wt.%, the size of PPy particles decreased, and with increasing the reflux time of CNTs from 15 to 60 min, the size of PPy particles increased. Electrochemical measurements showed that the specific capacity of the supercapacitors decreases by increasing reflux time of CNTs (CNTs length reduction) in the nanocomposite. In samples with reflux time of 15 and 30 min, by increasing the wt.% of CNTs, the specific capacity decreased and the maximum specific capacity of 123 F/g was obtained at 5 mV/s voltage scan speed and 15 min reflux time of CNTs with 2 wt.%.
