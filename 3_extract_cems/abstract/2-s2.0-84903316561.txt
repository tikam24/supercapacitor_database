The concept of interfacial polymerization is utilized for the synthesis of polyaniline-phosphomolybdate (PAni-PMo12) molecular hybrids and it is well characterized. The electrical conductivity of the synthesized hybrid materials increases with increase in PMo12 wt%. The synthesized hybrid materials are evaluated as the active electrode materials for supercapacitor application. Cyclic voltammetric studies of the hybrid-modified electrode shows broad parallelogram-shaped peak as an evidence for pseudo-capacitive behaviour. The galvanostatic charge-discharge studies enlighten that interfacially synthesized hybrid materials loaded with PMo12 show relatively enhanced specific capacitance values than PMo12 free samples.
