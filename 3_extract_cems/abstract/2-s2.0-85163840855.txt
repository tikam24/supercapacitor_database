This study provided an overview of how pore structures and functional groups influence the electrochemical behaviors of activated carbons derived from a new type of biomass waste - Japanese cedar bark (JCB) with four different activators, i.e., KOH, K2CO3, H3PO4, and ZnCl2. Based on the chemical composition, microstructure, gas adsorption isotherms, and electrochemical analytical techniques, relationships between the pore structures, functional groups, and electrochemical behavior of the activated samples were assessed. The K2CO3 and KOH activated materials, designated KC-6 and KO-6, respectively, with an activation ratio of 6 (6 g an activator/1 g of JCB), were well rated for their electrochemical capabilities. At 10 mA g−1, these two samples had a specific capacitance of roughly 210 F g−1. The high electrochemical potential of KC-6 was attributed to a particular hierarchical structure comprised of micro-meso-macropores and rich oxygen functional groups on its surface, allowing faster ion diffusion and more effective ion adsorptions. Furthermore, in the case of the 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte, KO-6 had the largest specific surface area of 3000 cm2 g−1 and appropriate micropores (diameters (d) < 1.2 nm) for the electrolyte ion adsorptions, thus allowing this model to maintain an 80% specific capacitance for approximately 6500 Cyclic Voltammetry cycles at 1 mV s−1. The pore properties, functional groups, and electrochemical properties of the activated material derived from JCB can be controlled to some extent by the activator selections and experimental conditions.
