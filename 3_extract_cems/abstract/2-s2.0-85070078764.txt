The growth direction, morphology and microstructure of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) play key roles for their potential applications in electronic and energy storage devices. However, effective synthesis of CNTs in high crystallinity and desired microstructure still remains a tremendous challenge. Here we introduce an electric field for controlling the microstructure formation of CNTs. It reveals that the electric field not only make CNTs aligned parallel but also improve the density of CNTs. Especially, the microstructures of CNTs gradually change under electrical field. That is, graphite sheets are transformed from the “herringbone” structure to a highly crystalline structure, facilitating the transportation of electrons. Due to the improved aligned growth direction, high density and highly crystalline microstructure, the electrochemical performance of CNTs is greatly improved. When the CNTs are applied in supercapacitors, they present a high specific capacitance of 237 F/g, three times higher than that of the CNTs prepared without electrical field. Such microstructure modulation of CNTs by electric field would help to construct high performance electronic and energy storage devices.
