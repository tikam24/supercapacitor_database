It is possible to fabricate all solid-state thin film supercapacitor (TFSC) with an amorphous LixPOyNz (LiPON), Ta 2O5 thin film electrolytes and ruthenium oxide film electrodes, which has the full cell structure of RuO2/LiPON/RuO 2/Pt, RuO2/Ta2O5/RuO2/Pt. The TFSC will be very useful to drive a microelectronic device if it can be hybrid with thin film battery (TFB). The ruthenium oxide thin films were grown on Pt/TiO2/SiO2/Si substrates by using direct current (d.c.) reactive magnetron sputtering at room temperature. Both LiPON and Ta 2O5 electrolyte films were grown on the RuO2 films by using radio frequency (r.f.) magnetron sputtering at room temperature. After the deposition of amorphous LiPON and Ta2O5 electrolyte films, RuO2 top electrode films were grown on the as-deposited electrolyte films by using d.c. reactive sputtering system. Room temperature charge-discharge measurements of the RuO2/LiPON/RuO 2/Pt TFSC at a constant current clearly revealed a typical supercapacitor behavior, even though the capacity of as-fabricated TFSC showed much lower than the bulk one and relatively fast decreased. However, room temperature charge-discharge curves of RuO2/Ta2O 5/RuO2 supercapacitor did not show the same pattern as above one. Electric double layer capacitance was prominent due to high dielectric constant of Ta2O5 material.
