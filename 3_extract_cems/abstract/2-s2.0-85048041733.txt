A wireless sensor network (WSN) is used in many applications such as Inventory control, Mobile technologies and Radar system tracking. The sensors are connected in a network manner which communicates with one another. A microcontroller is an important component of a wireless sensor node, also called Mote. It has to perform the measurements using the integrated peripherals, to post process the measured data as well as to coordinate the data transport of the wireless sensor network (WSN). The lowest possible power consumption is also a key requirement. This work demonstrates the flexibility of the microcontroller that is needed to adapt a Mote to a specific application area. In this case, the application area is RIVER MONITORING. One requirement is a perpetual operation using energy harvesting. This work presents the first water level monitoring platform only using ultra-capacitors as energy storage elements to compensate the irregularity of environmental energy sources.
