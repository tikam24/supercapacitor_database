Flexible supercapacitors are considered as a promising candidate for power supplementation in wearable electronics due to their high power density. However, effectively fabricate flexible and low-cost supercapacitor electrodes in a big scale is still a key challenge. Herein we demonstrate a scalable fabrication method for hierarchical electrodes via metalizing air-laid paper and loading with MnO2 as cathode active materials. To be specific, we coat a thin layer of Ni on air-laid paper by magnetron sputtering, then deposit Ni nanocone arrays (NNAs) on the Ni sputtered paper and finally deposit MnO2 on the NNAs to obtain the NNAs@MnO2 paper electrode. The as-prepared paper-based electrode possesses high conductivity and fine wettability, which facilitates the electrons and ions transporting through the conductive network. Additionally, this electrode provides large specific surface area with a hierarchical architecture. Thus the electrode shows high capacitance (451 F/g) and favorable cycle performance (92.9% capacity retention after cycling for 5000 times). By coupling with activated carbon (AC) coated on the NNAs conductive paper as anode, an NNAs paper-based asymmetric supercapacitor is constructed. Benefiting from the high mechanical durability and the 3D hierarchical architecture of the electrodes, the asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits excellent mechanical flexibility and high energy density (26.9 Î¼Wh/cm2 at 1.08 mW/cm2). This method can be easily scaled up to produce lightweight and low-cost conductive paper electrodes, making it promising for the application of flexible supercapacitors in wearable electronics.
