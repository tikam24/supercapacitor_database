There is still a great challenge to develop new-style battery-type electrode materials with low resistance, large surface area, and stable microstructures on carbon fabric, which limited the development of flexible devices. In this work, NiCo2O4 nanoneedle@NiMn2O4 nanosheet core-shell arrays are constructed on the carbon fabric as a high-capacitance and long-life supercapacitor electrode for the first time. Benefiting from this kind of binder-free core-shell microstructure, the CF@NiCo2O4@NiMn2O4 electrode displays extraordinary specific-capacitance of 539.2 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1, and nearly 93.0% retention of total capacitance even after discharging 5000 cycles. The outstanding properties of the hybrid electrode demonstrate that it is of great potential for flexible supercapacitors and batteries the application.
