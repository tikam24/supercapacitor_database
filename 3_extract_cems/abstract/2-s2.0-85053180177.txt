Binary transition metal oxides (BTMO) (Co-Zn, Co-Cu) on Ni foam are fabricated through a facile and cost efficient hydrothermal method. In the three-electrode system testing, CoO@ZnO shows the highest specific capacitance of 2.394 F/cm2 at a current density of 5 mA/cm2 as well as excellent cycling stability which remains 76.5% of initial capacitance after 1000 cycles. This study provides an important method for the synthesis of high performance BTMO for supercapacitors.
