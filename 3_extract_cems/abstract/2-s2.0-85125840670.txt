Mixed transition metal compounds with abundant more active sites are attractive to supercapacitors and electrochemical water splitting. In this work, the Co3O4/Zn Co Mo/NF composite is prepared by a hydrothermal method and thermal annealing. The Zn Co Mo nanosheet arrays are synthesized on nickel foam (NF) to form a three-dimensional (3D) network to take advantage of the electrical conductivity and viscosity of NF. Co3O4 is produced directly in the 3D microchannels to achieve a large energy density and robust stability. In the test of the supercapacitor performance, the specific capacitance of Co3O4/Zn Co Mo/NF is 2169 F g?1 at a current density of 1 A g?1. In addition, excellent long-Term cycling stability is observed as manifested by specific capacitance retention of 85% after 4,000 cycles at a current density of 25 A g?1. As a catalyst in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), Co3O4/Zn Co Mo/NF shows an overpotential of 128 mV at 10 mA cm?2. Our results confirm the dual functionality of the materials which have promising potential in energy storage and generation applications.
