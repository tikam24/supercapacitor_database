In DC microgrid (MG), the hybrid energy storage system (HESS) of battery and supercapacitor (SC) has the important function of buffering power impact, which comes from renewable energy sources (RES) and loads. This paper proposes a HESS control strategy with DC bus voltage self-recovery function. High and low frequency power decomposition based on virtual droop control, and DC bus drop voltage is compensated by added proportional integral regulation. The relationship between DC bus voltage recovery and super-capacitor (SC) state of charge (SoC) recovery is analyzed. The system can realize stable energy storage, supply under frequent load power impact. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is verified by simulation in MATLAB/Simulink.
