The Hybrid AC/DC microgrid is the new idea of the researchers to complete the power demand in developing countries like India. Hybrid AC-DC microgrid consists of AC microgrid and DC microgrid which are connected using an interlinking converter. In this paper Management of Electrical Power between AC microgrid and DC microgrid is possible with an Interlinking converter which is used here is a bidirectional AC/DC converter. The proposed system consists of many number of renewable energy sources or DGs. This paper presently deals with the power management and operation of an islanded mode Hybrid AC/DC microgrid. In the proposed system, the AC microgrid and DC microgrid are interlinked with an Interlinking converter (ILC), whereas PV array, Battery and wind turbine generator are connected to the DC microgrid and DC load is also connected along with the wind turbine generator, Fuel cell and Supercapacitor to the AC microgrid including the AC load. Management of power in hybrid AC/DC microgrid is possible with ILC with normalization technique.
