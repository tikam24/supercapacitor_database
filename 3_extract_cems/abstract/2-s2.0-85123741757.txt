The energy density of aqueous asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) is confined by the narrow voltage and the mismatching between cathode and anode. Vanadium dioxide (VO2) can contemporaneously operate in both negative and positive potential windows for efficient aqueous ASCs. Nonetheless, their intrinsically inferior cycling stability and capacity seriously restrain the overall capacitive properties. Herein, a novel manganese dioxide (MnO2) coated VO2 (VO2@MnO2) with hierarchical structure is firstly fabricated as cathode with enlarged potential (0 to 1.2 V) and superb specific capacitance (608.9 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1). Subsequently, VO2 coated by a thin layer of carbon (VO2@C) owning high electric conductivity and superb structure stability is designed to match with VO2@MnO2 cathode. Eventually, the VO2@C//VO2@MnO2 aqueous ASCs exhibit stable voltage (2.2 V), maximal energy density (77.1 Wh kg−1) and favourable cycling stability. This research inspires the design and preparation of matchable electrode materials, providing a feasible method for the development of aqueous ASCs with broad voltage.
