Smart textiles are attracting increasing attention due to their tremendous applications in wearable devices. Herein, we report a flexible and conductive textile prepared via simple “dipping and drying” method with Ag nanowires (Ag NWs) ink. The obtained Ag NWs/cellulose textiles have very high conductivity(sheet resistance 0.2 Ω/sq) and excellent chemical and mechanical stabilities, showing great potential in wearable energy storage and photothermal conversion. The supercapacitor made from the Ag NWs/cellulose textile showed a higher capacitance (159 F g−1) than the textiles functionalized with single-walled carbon nanotube (SCNT) and graphene. Besides, they presented excellent photothermal conversion property with about 50% improvement in temperature compared with pure textile. These multifunctional textiles would provide new opportunities for flexible and wearable electronics and sensors.
