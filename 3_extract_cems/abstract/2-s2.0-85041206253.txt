In this study, cost-effective hierarchically porous carbon (HPC) derived from starch was successfully prepared through a simple mixing and subsequent one-step carbonization method. Based on the three-dimensional interconnected hierarchically porous structure, HPC exhibits a high specific surface area of 2259.54 m2 g−1 and a specific capacitance of 385.7 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in a three-electrode system. When the as-prepared carbon was employed to fabricate an aqueous symmetrical supercapacitor, the device displayed a high specific capacitance of 81.3 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, and even at 20 A g−1 the specific capacitance remained 64 F g−1 (capacity retention rate of 78.72 % compares with that at 1 A g−1), demonstrating an outstanding rate performance. This supercapacitor maintained a capacity retention of 100 % after 60 000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g−1, indicating superior long-term cycling stability. Furthermore, when the as-prepared carbon was employed to fabricate a symmetrical supercapacitor in ionic liquid (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, EMIMBF4) electrolyte, it ultimately achieved an ultrahigh energy density of 133.94 Wh kg−1 (power density of 1997.51 W kg−1) and a capacity retention rate of 83.3 % was maintained after 5000 cycles throughout a wide operating potential window of 0–4 V at 10 A g−1.
