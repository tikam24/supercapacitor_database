In this paper we synthesize well aligned Ni-Co sulfide nanowire arrays (NWAs) with a Ni-Co molar ratio of 1:1 on 3D nickel foam by a facile two-step hydrothermal method. Owing to the low electronegativity of sulfur, Ni-Co sulfide NWAs exhibit a more flexible structure and much higher conductivity compared with Ni-Co oxide NWAs when used as active materials in supercapacitors. The electrochemistry tests show that these self-supported electrodes are able to deliver ultrahigh specific capacitance (2415 F g-1 and 1176 F g -1 at a current density of 2.5 mA cm-2 and 30 mA cm -2, respectively), together with a considerable areal capacitance (6.0 F cm-2 and 2.94 F cm-2 at a current density of 2.5 mA cm-2 and 30 mA cm-2, respectively), and good rate capability. More importantly, the asymmetric supercapacitor, composed of Ni-Co sulfide NWAs as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode, reaches up to an energy density of 25 W h kg-1 and a power density of 3.57 kW kg-1 under a cell voltage of 1.8 V. Furthermore, the two assembled supercapacitors in series can power a 3 mm diameter red (2.0 V, 20 mA) round light-emitting diode (LED) indicator for more than 30 minutes after charging separately for a total time of 6 min. The superior electrochemistry capacity demonstrates that the self-standing Ni-Co sulfide nanowire arrays are promising for high-performance supercapacitor applications.
