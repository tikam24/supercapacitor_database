For the purpose of studying the state of health of AOWEI 1.5V/80000F hybrid supercapacitor with aqueous electrolyte for the driving power system of supercapacitor city bus, an equivalent circuit model describing the electrical characteristic of hybrid supercapacitor is proposed according to its working principle. Then, the statistical method of correlation and regression analysis is presented to model the relationship of temperature and equivalent circuit model parameters based on experimental data. The goodness of fit and the test of statistical significance are fulfilled to verify the regression model and coefficients, and results show that the parameters of equivalent circuit model can describe temperature behavior of hybrid supercapacitor.
