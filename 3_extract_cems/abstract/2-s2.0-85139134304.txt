Flexible hybrid micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) have emerged as promising micro-storage devices for flexible integrated electronics because of their small size and high power density. However, most of them need inefficient and high-cost process which limits their wide range of applications. This paper demonstrates a high-efficient technique which utilizing infrared CO2 laser to convert the microstructured polyimide (PI) substrate into LIG and deposit Fe3O4 nanoparticles on LIG under ambient air (LIG/Fe3O4). Benefiting from the in-situ preparation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and the grooves-like structure of porous LIG, the LIG/Fe3O4-based MSCs exhibit high areal specific capacitance exceeding 43.6 mF/cm2. This facile process provides great prospects for the production of hybrid supercapacitors with excellent performance and offers a promising avenue for the mass fabrication flexible energy storage devices.
