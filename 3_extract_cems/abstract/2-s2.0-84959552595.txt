Porous Co3O4 microflowers were successfully synthesized by calcinations of novel flower-like metal-organic framework microcrystals. A supercapacitor was conducted based on this porous Co3O4 microflowers as the electrode material, which shows that the porous Co3O4 electrode exhibit a specific capacitance of 240.2 F g-1 at the current density of 0.625 A g-1 and remains more than 96.3% after 2000 cycles. The results demonstrate that porous Co3O4 microflowers can be acted as a promising electrode candidate in supercapacitors.
