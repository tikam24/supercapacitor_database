This paper presents the design of charging Super-capacitors based on the wireless power transmission technology, a magnetic coupling wireless charging system. The hardware components of the charging system is composed of transmitter control circuit, transmitter control MCU, transmitter coil, receiver coil, charging control MCU, charging control circuit and super capacitor bank. When charging the super capacitor, PID algorithm is used to control the charging circuit. In PID regulation, it is particularly important to match the proportional, integral and differential coefficients. Experiments show that the system can quickly track the expected power value and maintain a stable state through PID algorithm. Results of the experiment also show that the system can better meet the requirements of rapid response of the load to the system in the charging process through PID control, and has better dynamic performance than the traditional wireless charging system.
