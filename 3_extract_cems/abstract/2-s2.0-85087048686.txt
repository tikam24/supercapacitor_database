The composites of Fe2O3 nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can be applied in many fields including energy storage. The synthesis of Fe2O3/CNTs composite is usually carried out under high temperatures with complicated processes. To solve these problems, we report a novel one-step chemical bath deposition method to synthesize it at a very low temperature in this work. With DMF as a complex agent, ferrous cations can be well combined with the external surface of CNTs to form small Fe2O3 nanoparticles just at 70 °C for 2-h reaction. XRD, SEM, and TEM analyses confirm that as-prepared Fe2O3 nanoparticles are ultra-small, well crystallized, and highly dispersed onto the surface of CNTs. When being used as an electrode material for supercapacitor, the composite has a specific capacitance of 942 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 and 645 F g−1 at 15 A g−1, exhibiting a higher specific capacitance than previously reported Fe2O3/CNTs composites due to its smaller size.
