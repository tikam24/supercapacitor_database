In this study, halloysite nanotubes polyaniline (HNT-PANI) nanocomposite was synthesized by using an ultrasound-assisted method. Because of high conductivity, ease of synthesis, low cost, nanosize tubular structure and improved structural/electrochemical properties, HNT-PANI had been used for the electrode fabrication of a supercapacitor. The dispersion of halloysite nanotubes in polyaniline was prepared by following an ultrasound approach. The structural and morphological studies of the HNT-PANI nanocomposite were investigated by X-ray diffraction, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, Raman and transmission electron microscopy. The length of the halloysite nanotubes varied from 200 to 1000 nm and the composite nanoparticles possessed tubular hallow shaped structure. The electrochemical performance of the HNT-PANI nanocomposite electrode was analyzed after performing potentiodynamic and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic studies. The crystallite size of HNT-PANI composite was calculated and the average size ranged from 30 to 100 nm. HNT-PANI composite electrode exhibited the highest specific capacitance of 282.5 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g.
