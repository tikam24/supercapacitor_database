Attapulgite@carbon/polyaniline (APT@C/PAn) hybrid nanocomposites were fabricated by in situ chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline after hydrothermal carbonization of glucose on the surface of the attapulgite. The introduction of attapulgite can effectively guide the heterogeneous deposition of carbonaceous species on the surface of attapulgite and further prevent polyaniline from self-aggregation. The obtained hybrid nanocomposites were characterized by transmission electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectrum, X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analysis. The maximum specific capacitance of the APT@C/PAn electrode materials was 324.5 F g -1 after correcting for the weight percent of the electroactive materials at a current density of 2.5 mA cm-2 in a 1.0 M H 2SO4 electrolyte. The excellent performance might be ascribed to the orientation of APT and the combination of the good electrical conductivity of carbon and the pesudocapacitance of polyaniline. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.
