In this paper, a two-step hydrothermal method was used to prepare NiCo2S4/N-CNT nanocomposites with excellent cycling performance. N-doped carbon nanotubes occur coordination effect; it is conducive to enhancing the overall electrochemical effects of NiCo2S4. Besides, the introduction of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) greatly improved the cycling stability of the materials. Electrochemical tests show that the NiCo2S4/N-CNT composite materials have an ultra-high specific capacitance of 1428 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, while the capacitance of pure NiCo2S4 is 733.5 F g−1. After 4000 charge and discharge cycles, the capacitance of NiCo2S4/N-CNT electrode materials still maintains 80.2%, while the retention rate of NiCo2S4 materials is only 60.2%. Compared with the electrochemical performance of NiCo2S4 materials reported by most people, it has greatly improved. Therefore, the NiCo2S4/N-CNT composite material is a promising electrode material.
