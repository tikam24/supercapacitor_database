Biomorphic Co 3 O 4 nanocrystal/mesoporous carbon microtube composites have been hydrothermally prepared and subsequent calcinated using cotton as biotemplate and precursor. The as-prepared composites are fabricated by octahedral Co 3 O 4 nanocrystals with high exposed {1 1 1} facets supported on the porous carbon microtubes and exhibit a unique tubular morphology and porous features. The specific capacitance of the present biomorphic materials is 284.2F⋅g −1 at 1 A⋅g −1 , which is 4.8-fold larger than that of pristine Co 3 O 4 prepared without cotton template. The excellent pseudocapacitive performance is attributed to the introduction of porous carbon, the high exposed active facets, the high specific surface area and the optimized hierarchical microstructure inherited from the biotemplate.
