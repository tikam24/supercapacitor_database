A series of bismuth oxide materials with controllable morphology are successfully prepared under different pH via a facile chemical precipitation method. Furthermore, we investigate the electrochemical performances of as-prepared bismuth oxide based electrodes. The results indicate that as-prepared bismuth oxide based electrodes possess favorable electrochemical performance with high specific capacitance, excellent rate capability and outstanding cyclic stability. In particular, bismuth oxide based electrode prepared at pH 12 exhibits the optimal specific capacitance (1241.6 F g −1 at current density of 1.0 A g −1 ), which approximates to the theoretical value.
