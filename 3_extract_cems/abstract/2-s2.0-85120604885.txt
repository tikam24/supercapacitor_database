The production of energy-storage devices is primarily concerned with cost-effective solutions that increase efficiency and stability. Due to the presence of several oxidation states of copper ions, porous nanostructure, and high surface area that require rapid ion diffusion, graphene oxide (GO)-assisted copper oxide (CuO)-based electrodes have enhanced electrochemical properties in supercapacitor applications such as long cyclic stability and high specific capacitance. In this paper, we describe a green synthesis of copper oxide nanoparticles from Clerodendrum phlomidis aqueous extract and subsequent infusion with graphene oxide (GO) for electrode preparation. The specific capacitance of the GO–CuO nanocomposite electrochemical measurements showed that the samples have incredible cycling stability and have a specific capacitance of approximately 82.1 F g−1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Furthermore, GO–CuO demonstrated effective photocatalytic degradation of crystal violet (CV) under xenon lamp irradiation, with a degradation efficiency of 56.93%. Thus, the green synthetic pathway of GO–CuO nanocomposites proved to be a potential electrode for supercapacitor applications.
