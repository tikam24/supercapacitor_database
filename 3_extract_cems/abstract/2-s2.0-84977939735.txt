We report the fabrication of a carbon-based high energy density Li-ion hybrid electrochemical capacitor (Li-HEC) from low cost and eco-friendly materials. High surface area (2448±20 m2 g-1) activated carbon (AC) is derived from the environmentally threatening plant, Prosopis juliflora, and used as the positive electrode in a Li-HEC assembly. Natural graphite is employed as negative electrode and electrochemically pre-lithiated prior to the Li-HEC fabrication. The Li-HEC delivers a specific energy of 162.3 Wh kg-1 and exhibits excellent cyclability (i.e., ∼79 % of initial capacity is retained after 7000 cycles). The superior electrochemical performance of Li-HEC benefits from the tube-like unique structural features of the AC. Also, the presence of a graphitic nanocarbon network improves the ion transport, and the formed micro- and meso-porous network acts as reservoir for the accommodation of charge carriers.
