This paper presents different works which are actually developed in the field of fuel-cell hybrid systems in different public laboratories in France. These works are presented in three sections corresponding to: 1. Hybrid fuel cell/battery or supercapacitor power sources; 2. Fuel-cell multi-stack power sources; 3. Fuel cell in hybrid power systems for distributed generation. The presented works combine simulation and experimental results. Â© 2009 IEEE.
