Poly(1′,4′-phenylene-1″,4″- (2″-(2″″-ethyl-hexyloxy))phenylene- 1″,4″-phenylene-2,5-oxadiazolyl) (PPEPPO) was synthesized and its electrochemical characteristics was investigated as electrode material in redox supercapacitor. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) shows there was scarcely a redox reaction and further suggests n-doping is difficult to occur in this system. However, the discharge curve between 3.0 to 0.01 V is continuously decreased like a straight line, similar to the discharge pattern of EDLC. The initial specific discharge capacitance is ∼6.4 F/g, while the specific capacitance of 1000th cycle is ∼0.1 F/g. The PPEPPO can be used as the electrode of supercapacitor, emissive material, as well as charge-transporting material in polymer LED.
