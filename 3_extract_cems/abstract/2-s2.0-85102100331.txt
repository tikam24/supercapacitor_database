Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are widely used as precursors to prepare porous carbon materials due to their highly ordered porous structure and large specific surface area. In this paper, a metal-organic framework {[Zn(1,4-BDC)0.5(3-NH2-trz)]·(solvent)]}n was prepared using a solvent method as a precursor to prepare nitrogen self-doped porous carbon ZAPC-T by a direct carbonization, and the effect of different carbonization temperatures on the microstructures, compositions, and electrochemical properties of the nitrogen self-doped porous carbon ZAPC-T samples was investigated. Results showed that the specific surface area of ZAPC-800 reached 728.57 m2 g-1 with nitrogen and oxygen contents of 19.09% and 5.93%, respectively. When the carbonization temperature was 800 °C, the specific capacitance of ZAPC-800 was 225.4 F g-1 at a current density of 1.0 A g-1, and after 5000 cycles, the capacitance retention was as high as 83.01% with constant current charging and discharging. The specific capacitance decay rate was only 21.2% when the current density was increased from 1.0 A g-1 to 10.0 A g-1. Thus, nitrogen self-doped porous carbon ZAPC-800 showed excellent electrochemical properties and good cycling stability. This study provides useful experimental data for the preparation of MOF-based nitrogen self-doped porous carbons and their applications.
