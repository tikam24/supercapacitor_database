Electrochemical oxidation of the carbon nanotube (CNT) polarizable electrodes of electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) was studied. It indicated that electrochemical oxidation elevated the available surface area of the electrodes and introduced some kinds of functional group on the CNT surfaces. The specific capacitances of the polarizable electrodes with organic electrolyte could be enhanced from 22.4 F g-1 to 78.2 F g-1 after electrolysis oxidization. The enhancement of the specific capacitance depends on the extent of electrochemical oxidation. Using acidic electrolyte for electrochemical oxidation has different effects on modifying the performances of the CNT polarizable electrodes compared to using basic electrolyte.
