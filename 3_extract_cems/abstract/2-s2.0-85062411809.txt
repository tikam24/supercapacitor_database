Aiming at distributed wind and PV micro-sources with intermittence and fluctuation, in order to ensure the high reliability and stability of micro-grid power quality, an AC/DC micro-grid structure with gas turbine and hybrid energy storage system is established and a new power allocation strategy is proposed to enhance the flexibility of micro-grid island operation. The control strategy will be used to filter the total power difference of the system, uses the battery to bear the low frequency component of the instantaneous fluctuation power of the load, and optimally control the power throughput rate and maintain the stability of the bus voltage. The super-capacitor provides its differential power. At the same time, the battery bears the profit and loss of the energy generated by super-capacitor after the energy of the system is stable, maintains the initial state of the voltage at all times to realize the power interaction between the energy storage and effectively reduce the capacity of the configured device. The coordinated control of the gas turbine with the mixed storage system which cannot run for a long time is analyzed. Finally, through the simulation of AC/DC microgrid with Matlab/Simulink hybrid energy storage, the feasibility of the proposed energy management scheme and the effectiveness of the control strategy are verified.
