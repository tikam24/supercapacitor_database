In current research a hybrid autonomous supplying system for electric vehicles applications is presented. The hybrid system is consisted of fuel cell, micro gas turbine and supercapacitor. There are realized with averaged models in MATLAB/Simulink environment. The supplying elements are connected to a DC bus for charging a different type of EV s. In this case as a load is use two EV s: BMW -i3 and Nissan Leaf. This system can operate autonomously in hard-to-reach places where there is no supplying from the distributed grid and other sources. With the help of the developed model, the optimal value of the supercapacitor has been determined in order to minimize the costs for the construction of the charging station.
