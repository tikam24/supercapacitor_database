In the last decade, the issue of air pollution or the reduction of CO2 emissions has become of extreme interest both for civil society and then for the industrial and scientific research world. For this reason, the scientific research on automotive is called to answer with increasingly innovative solutions. One of the principal subjects are the storage and the utilization of the electric energy for electrical and hybrid vehicles. Nowadays, supercapacitors are getting more and more attention because of their characteristics that allow them to be a bridge between electrolytic capacitors and batteries in several application such as bust-mode energy delivery, regenerative breaks and so on. The aim of this work is the modelling, simulation and characterization of a supercapacitor for the seen automotive applications.
