Carbon fabrics from viscose fibers activated with KOH have been investigated as possible electrode materials for electrochemical capacitors. The fibers were first pyrolysed at 400 or 600 °C, then saturated with KOH at C/KOH ratios from 1:3.5 to 1:5 and treated in the temperature range from 700 to 800 °C. The carbon fibers saturated with KOH were analysed by thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis in order to get information on the temperature dependence of the KOH reaction with carbon. The electrochemical properties of the activated carbons were determined using three-electrode Swagelok® type capacitors both in 4 M H2SO 4 and 7 M KOH aqueous electrolytes. Specific capacities of ca. 340 and 270 F/g were determined in acidic and alkaline medium, respectively. We demonstrate that the electrical capacity for both negative and positive electrodes depends on the treatment method. The capacitance values are discussed taking into account the porous texture, the elemental composition and the surface functionality of the activated carbon fibers. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.
