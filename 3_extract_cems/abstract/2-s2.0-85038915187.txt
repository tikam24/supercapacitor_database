The hybrids of pristine graphene with polyaniline were synthesized by in situ polymerizations for making a high-performance supercapacitor. The formed high-ordered PANI nanocones were vertically aligned on the graphene sheets. The length of the PANI nanocones increased with the concentration of aniline monomer. The specific capacitance of the hybrids electrode in the three-electrode system was measured as high as 481 F/g at a current density of 0.1 A/g, and its stability remained 87% after constant charge-discharge 10000 cycles at a current density of 1 A/g. This outstanding performance is attributed to the coupling effects of the pristine graphene and the hierarchical structure of the PANI possessing high specific surface area. The unique structure of the PANI provided more charge transmission pathways and fast charge-transfer speed of electrons to the pristine graphene because of its large specific area exposed to the electrolyte. The hybrid is expected to have potential applications in supercapacitor electrodes.
