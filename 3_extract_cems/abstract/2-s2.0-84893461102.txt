Transparent and/or stretchable energy storage devices have attracted intense attention due to their unique optical and/or mechanical properties as well as their intrinsic energy storage function. However, it remains a great challenge to integrate transparent and stretchable properties into an energy storage device because the currently developed electrodes are either transparent or stretchable, but not both. Herein, we report a simple method to fabricate wrinkled graphene with high stretchability and transparency. The resultant wrinkled graphene sheets were used as both current collector and electrode materials to develop transparent and stretchable supercapacitors, which showed a high transparency (57% at 550 nm) and can be stretched up to 40% strain without obvious performance change over hundreds of stretching cycles.
