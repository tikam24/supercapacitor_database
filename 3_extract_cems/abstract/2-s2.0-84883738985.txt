MnO2 nanorods/graphene composite materials have been fabricated using a facile hydrothermal method for super capacitor applications. The prepared composite materials are characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM)and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Electrochemical performances are evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectrometry (EIS).It indicates that ratio of MnO2 nanorods to graphene in composite materials has significant influenceon the electrochemical performance of composite electrodes. We have achieved the maximum specific capacitance of 218 F g-1at the scan rate of 5 mV s-1in 1 M Na2SO4aqueous solution. Additionally, MnO2nanorods/graphene composite materials exhibit highest energy density of 16 Wh kg-1at power density of 95 W kg-1and excellent capacitance retention with no more than 6% capacitance loss after 1000 cyclesat the most favorable composites ratio.
