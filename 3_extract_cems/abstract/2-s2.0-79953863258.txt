Graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets are readily reduced by aniline above room temperature in an aqueous acid medium, with the aniline simultaneously undergoing oxidative polymerization to produce the reduced graphene oxide-polyaniline nanofiber (RGO-PANi) composites. The resulting RGO-PANi composites and RGO (after dissolution of PANi) were characterized by XPS, XRD analysis, TGA, UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, and TEM. It was also found that the RGO-PANi composites exhibit good specific capacitance during galvanostatic charging-discharging when used as capacitor electrodes. Â© 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
