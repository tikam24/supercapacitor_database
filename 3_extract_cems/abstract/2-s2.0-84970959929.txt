Highly ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNAs) with enhanced electronic conductivity treated by introducing oxygen vacancies have been considered to be a promising electrode material for supercapacitors. In this work, we fabricated electrochemically doped TiO2 nanotube arrays (ED-TNAs) through a facile cyclic voltammetry method, and then deposited the uniformly dispersed Cu2O nanoparticles onto ED-TNAs to synthesise a high performance electrode for a supercapacitor. The ED-TNAs electrode exhibited a high specific capacitance of 5.42 mF cm-2 at a scan rate of 10 mV s-1, which was about 59 times higher than for the pristine TNAs electrode. Moreover, the ED-TNAs were demonstrated to be an appropriate support for Cu2O nanoparticles. The highest specific capacitance of the Cu2O/ED-TNAs electrode could reach 198.7 F g-1 at the current density of 0.2 A g-1, and approximately 88.7% of the initial capacitance was retained after 5000 cycles of galvanostatic charge-discharge.
