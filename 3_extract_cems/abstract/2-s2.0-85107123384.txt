The rising energy consumption in today's world need electrochemical devices with excellent energy storing efficiency. Supercapacitors are considered as incredible energy-storing devices due to high power density, longevity, exceptional charge/discharge cycling stability, and low cost. The electrochemical performance of the supercapacitors absolutely relies upon the choice of its establishing parts like electrodes, binder, separator, electrolyte, and current collector; and its manufacture strategy. The part of polymers in this field is inescapable and has a background marked by many years. This review deliberately extends the part of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF); its copolymer and nanocomposites as a binder, separator, electrolyte, and piezoelectric generator in the development of supercapacitors. Polyvinylidene fluoride is a semi-crystalline polymer and the second-biggest fluoropolymer underway. It displays great mechanical properties, high dielectric consistent, wettability, and excellent thermal and chemical strength. Today, PVDF is quite possibly the most requesting polymers because of its self-polarizing capacity under the electric field. The piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and ferroelectric properties of PVDF pulls into the consideration of researchers and specialists who are working in the development of self-charging supercapacitors and other energy reaping and storing gadgets. This review succinctly uncovers the future viewpoint for the advancement of PVDF-based self-powering electronic gadgets.
