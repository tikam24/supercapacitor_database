The existence of inevitable hole defects in the hydrothermal process of graphene hydrogels makes the strength of the prepared aerogel to be further improved. We design a simple self-assembly method of standing at room tempreture for preparing MXene/RGO composite aerogel. The strong forces from different directions make this three-dimensional (3D) porous aerogel unique fusiform shape and stiffer wall of the pores to exhibit favorable strength of 16.18 MPa and excellent cyclic compression performance at a load capacity up to 10 kg (2 MPa). And as a freestanding supercapacitior electrode, it shows excellent electrochemical energy storage performance of 233 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with an outstanding cycling performance of 91.01% after 10,000 cycles. Besides, this research lays a certain theoretical reference for free-standing supercapacitor electrode materials.
