It is a challenging task to store and process regenerative braking energy in a Medium-low Speed Maglev Train system. In the Shanghai Medium-low Speed Maglev Train Test line, due to the dense distance between stations of Medium-low Speed Maglev Train and the high density of experimental scheduling, the recovery of braking energy poses a certain challenge to the design of the power supply system. Because of the low utilization rate of the existing regenerative braking energy recovery mode that depends on many uncertain factors, such as vehicle scheduling and platform power consumption, this paper proposes a scheme of installing supercapacitor energy storage device to collect and store regenerative braking energy in roadside substation and establishes the model of Medium-low Speed Maglev Train to verify the feasibility of the scheme. The scheme of installing a supercapacitor energy storage device does not demand transmitting power back to the power grid so that the power fluctuation of the power grid is significantly reduced. Meanwhile, there is no need to transmit power along the track, and the risk of overheating the brake resistance is not present.
