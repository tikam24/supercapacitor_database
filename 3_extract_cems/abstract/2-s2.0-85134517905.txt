Cobalt oxide synthesis with difference stirring time is rarely highlighted because it is considered to have little effect when, in fact, the stirring time influences the final product. Cobalt oxide has multiple applications since almost all modern technologies that use nanotechnology use cobalt oxide with an easy example is the manufacture of the electrodes in supercapacitors. Cobalt oxide in this study was synthesised using the sol-gel auto combustion method with stirring time variations of 15 minutes, 75 minutes, and 135 minutes. The analysis of phase identification and crystal size used XRD. The morphological analysis used SEM, analysis of functional group bonds used FTIR, and three secondary data were used as amplifiers to determine the specific capacitance value. The smallest crystal size of cobalt oxide in this study was 21.2872?nm at a stirring time of 15 minutes with the final sample having a single phase. The synthesised samples' morphology using the sol-gel auto combustion method appeared to have low agglomeration and porosity levels. Based on the FTIR testing, there was a double absorption peak in the fingerprint region, namely 569-671?cm-1. Based on the three secondary data observed, cobalt oxide's specific capacitance values ranged between 235 F/g, 391.4 F/g, and 430.6 F/g. From this statement, comparing each factor, and the obtained results from other studies, it showed that the synthesised cobalt oxide in this study had the feasibility and potential to be applied in the manufacture of the electrodes of a supercapacitor.
