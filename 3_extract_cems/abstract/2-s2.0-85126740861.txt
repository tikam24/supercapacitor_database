In this paper, we evaluated the leakage current of super capacitor during self-discharge. A three branch electrical equivalent circuit model (ECM) is constructed to estimate voltage response and leakage current of commercially available 2.7 V 350F (BCAP350) double-layer capacitor (DLC). Experimental work carried out with two constant current charging segments 0.25 ampere, and 0.5 amperes. Simulated data shows good agreement with experimental results obtained at electro-chemical workstation CH760e with RMSE and MAE error up to 0.0633, 0.05715, and 0.0759, 0.04173 for 0.25 ampere and 0.5 amperes charging current, respectively. The results confirm that the ECM model is capable to simulate the complex terminal behavior of the super capacitor and provides the means to study its application as an energy storage device.
