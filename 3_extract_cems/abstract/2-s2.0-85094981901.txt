The self-supported monolithic carbon materials are attractive supercapacitor electrode materials owing to their three-dimensional interconnected hierarchical porous network, suitable surface area and relatively high conductivity. Here, zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) crystals were in situ synthesized on the skeletons of melamine foam (MF). After the pyrolysis at high temperature, ZIF-8/MF precursors were carbonized into three-dimensional (3D) hierarchically porous N doped carbon/carbon foam (PNC/CF) with large surface area, good electrical conductivity and mechanical property. Thus, PNC/CF achieves high specific capacitance of 250.6 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and excellent rate performance. Furthermore, the constructed symmetrical supercapacitor based on PNC/CF delivers a maximum energy density of 14.2 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 375 W kg−1 and superior cycling stability of 98.4%. The superior capacitive performance can be assigned to 3D hierarchically porous structure with a suitable surface area, good wettability of between electrodes and aqueous electrolyte, and relatively high electronic conductivity of PNC/CF.
