In this study, three-dimensional graphene monolithic materials (3DG) were prepared from graphene oxide by hydrothermal reaction and high temperature annealing process. The compressible properties and electrochemical performance of 3DG using as electrode material for supercapacitor were evaluated. The 3DG material with 3D porous cross-linked networks exhibited excellent compressibility and mechanical properties. The symmetrical supercapacitor based on 3DG electrode materials with sheet thickness of 2 mm and aluminum plastic package size of 5Ã—6 cm2 showed a specific capacitance of 175 F/g in 6 mol/L KOH electrolyte at the current density of 0.1 A/g, along with the specific capacitance retention rate of 81.9% after 10000 cycles at current density of 1 A/g. After loading different force, the excellent capacitive performance kept well.
