We demonstrate a novel approach for the preparation of layered Polyaniline-polypyrrole (PANI-PPy) nanocomposite via simplest oxidative chemical polymerization. The approach is conceptualized on the basis of the electrostatic interactions between cationic source (aniline/pyrrole with H 2SO4) and anionic source (ammonium persulfate) in double distilled water. The investigation describes advantages of facile successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) for depositing nanograined PANI-PPy thin film onto cost-effective large area stainless steel substrates. The physico-chemical characteristics of deposited films are studied via analysis of structural, morphological, surface wettability and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. A PANI-PPy nanocomposite prepared from this approach exhibited an excellent electro-capacitive performance with a high specific capacitance over 737 F/g at 5 mV s1 scan rate. Impedance measurements suggest that the nanograined PANI-PPy electrodes are promising for the next generation high performance electrochemical supercapacitors. The simple method described here opens up a generalized route to make a wide range of PANI-PPy based nanocomposite materials for applications beyond electrochemical energy storage.
