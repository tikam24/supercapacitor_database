Partially graphitic hierarchical porous carbon nanofiber is prepared via electrospinning, pyrolysis, activation and acid treatment of the nascent fiber. The ameliorating structural features of the as-obtained carbon nanofiber, such as a relatively high graphitic degree, a high specific surface area and a large pore volume with hierarchical porous structure, acted synergistically, resulting in excellent electrochemical properties. When applied in supercapacitors, the obtained sample delivers a high specific capacitance of 287 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, a high rate capacitance of 196 F g−1 at 100 A g−1 and a high capacity retention of 95.4% at 5 A g−1 after 10,000 cycles. When used as an anode for lithium ion batteries, the prepared electrodes display an exceptionally high reversible capacity of 1495 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, superior cycle stability and an outstanding high-rate capacity of 391 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1 for 1100 cycles. These values demonstrate the superiority of partially graphitic hierarchical porous carbon nanofiber as bi-functional electrodes in supercapacitors and Li-ion batteries with outstanding performance.
