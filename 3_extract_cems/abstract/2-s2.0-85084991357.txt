Abstract: Zinc vanadate (Zn3V2O8) rods have been prepared using easy and economical hydrothermal technique and are explored for supercapacitor electrode application. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) were analysed for the structure and morphology of the sample. The electrochemical performance of the Zn3V2O8 electrode was investigated using cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic charge–discharge test. The performance of Zn3V2O8 in water soluble electrolytes, such as K2SO4, Na2SO4 and KOH were analysed, and the results demonstrated unique double layer properties of the material. The electrode material tested in 0.5 M K2SO4 showed good supercapacitive performance in terms of specific capacitance and efficiency when compared to other electrolytes. We have obtained a specific capacitance of 213 F g−1 at current density of 1 A g−1. This electrode exhibits very less charge transfer resistance (3.3 Ω) in potassium sulphate electrolyte and is lower than other electrolytes. Moreover, Zn3V2O8 provided enhanced rate capacity, with (77%) of retention capacity for charge–discharge up to 1000 cycles. Graphic Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
