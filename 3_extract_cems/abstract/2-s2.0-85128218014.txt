As one of the typical MXenes materials, 2D Ti3C2Tx has attracted extensive attention in the field of energy storage. However, due to the restacking problem of Ti3C2Tx nanosheets, the electrochemical performance of Ti3C2Tx is unsatisfactory. In this paper, a scheme is proposed to obtain 3D aerogel with 1D channels by directional freeze drying of Ti3C2Tx. With the help of the unidirectional channels, the 3D Ti3C2Tx/Sodium alginate (SA) aerogel can effectively solve the stacking problem of Ti3C2Tx nanosheets, and it also accelerates the diffusion of ions. The Ti3C2Tx/SA-5 electrode can still reach the mass capacitance of 284.5 F g−1 and the areal capacitance of 4030.4 mF cm−2 at 2 mV s−1 when the loading is 14.2 mg cm−2 in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. In addition, the electrode showed good cycling performance without capacitor degradation after 20,000 cycles at 50 mV s−1. These results suggest that by using the strategy of building special 3D structure of 2D MXene with 1D unidirectional channels, high performance supercapacitor electrodes with high mass loading can be realized.
