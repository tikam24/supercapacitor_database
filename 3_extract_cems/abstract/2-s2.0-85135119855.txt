This work aims to use the electro-active materials for energy storage application from the waste raw material source, readily and indigenously available materials. Nowadays, the use of waste sources to prepare electro-active materials for energy storage applications is trending due to their low-cost, high availability, reduced environmental problems, and so forth. In this direction, Polyaniline (PANI) is prepared using a MnO2 oxidant collected from waste Zn-C cells. PANI displayed a compact and interconnected granular morphology with a surface area (39 m2 g−1), pore volume (0.19 cm3 g−1), and pore diameter (2.2 nm). Activated carbon (AC) has a surface area (860 m2 g−1), pore volume (199 cm3 g−1), and pore diameter (1.2 nm) is purchased locally. FT-IR, XRD, and EDAX spectra support the formation of polyaniline salt with a small amount of Mn and Zn. The asymmetric cell is constructed using a PANI as a positive electrode and carbon as negative electrode material. The cell (PANI//AC) shows a high specific capacitance of 157 F g−1 at a current density of 5 mA cm−2. The cell offers a cycle life stability of 5000 cycles with a coulombic efficiency of 93% at a current density of 10 mA cm−2.
