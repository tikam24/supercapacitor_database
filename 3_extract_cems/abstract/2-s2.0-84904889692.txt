The vulnerability of electricity consumers must be decreased by integrating specific energy storage systems, which can be used in any situation. As energy distribution and consumption are not constant, the storage units (for backup) must be as high capacity and total availability to streamline the complete system. This paper proposes an objective function of charging an UPS integrated hybrid source (battery and supercapacitor) and a method for optimizing the supply of loads in a critical place of consumption through the UPS with hybrid structure, increasing the autonomy of backup source and its time of re-entry into service.
