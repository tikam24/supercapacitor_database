The main research about the preparation of the conducting polymer/graphene composite hydrogel has been focused on the hydrothermal synthesis or the external gel accelerator. Herein, the composite hydrogel based on graphene oxide (GO) and polypyrrole (PPy) and polyaniline (PANI) is fabricated via vapor-liquid interfacial synthesis. FeCl3 and GO are dispersed in an aqueous solution. Then, the polymerization of pyrrole and aniline occurs on the interface between their vapor and the above aqueous solution. The effect of FeCl3 and GO on formation, morphology and performance of composite hydrogel of GO/PPy/PANI is investigated. Furthermore, the specific capacitance of hydrogel is larger than that of composite film obtained without the addition of GO. After 2000 electrochemical cycles at a scan rate of 1 A gâˆ’1, about 91% of the specific capacitance of GO/PPy/PANI composite hydrogel is kept, indicating the enhanced cyclic stability of composite hydrogel. Moreover, graphite paper can be coated by GO/PPy/PANI composite hydrogels and used as binder-free electrodes to construct a flexible solid-state symmetric supercapacitor with excellent cyclic stability and rate capability. This work reveals an easy, efficient, and scalable route for the preparation of the conducting composite hydrogel with improved electrochemical performance.
