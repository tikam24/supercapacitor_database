Exploring new electrolyte materials is important to comprehend high performance secondary charge storage devices for effective utilization of renewable energy. Ionic liquids with broad electrochemical voltage window and wide range of thermal stability are prospective materials for the same. As an improved version of this class of materials, we report herein, on the synthesis of novel pyrrolidinium based ionic liquid tethered nanoparticle hybrid electrolytes and compared their conductivity and electrochemical cycling behaviors. Hybrid electrolytes are prepared by covalently grafting N-Methyl-N-propylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide to the surfaces of pre-synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles at three different core volume fractions, ranging from 0.11 to 0.46. Uniform dispersion of the core nanoparticle within the matrix of the electrolytes improves their mechanical properties. With increasing core volume fractions, the electrical conductivity slightly decreases due to increasing viscosity. Nevertheless, nanoparticle grafting significantly improves the electrochemical performance of the electrolytes. The electrolytes show very good capacitance retentivity (>90%) and long-term cycling stability above room temperature even at the lowest grafting density within symmetric stainless steel electrodes. Impressive room temperature electrochemical performance of these materials within symmetric supercapacitor cell containing CMS graphite as electrodes further demonstrates the applicability of these hybrid materials as promising electrolytes for secondary charge storage devices.
