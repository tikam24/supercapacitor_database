Mesoporous cobalt oxide (Co3O4) nanosheet electrode arrays are directly grown over flexible carbon paper substrates using an economical and scalable two-step process for supercapacitor applications. The interconnected nanosheet arrays form a three-dimensional network with exceptional supercapacitor performance in standard two electrode configuration. Dramatic improvement in the rate capacity of the Co3O4 nanosheets is achieved by electrodeposition of nanocrystalline, hydrous RuO 2 nanoparticles dispersed on the Co3O4 nanosheets. An optimum RuO2 electrodeposition time is found to result in the best supercapacitor performance, where the controlled morphology of the electrode provides a balance between good conductivity and efficient electrolyte access to the RuO2 nanoparticles. An excellent specific capacitance of 905 F/g at 1 A/g is obtained, and a nearly constant rate performance of 78% is achieved at current density ranging from 1 to 40 A/g. The sample could retain more than 96% of its maximum capacitance even after 5000 continuous charge-discharge cycles at a constant high current density of 10 A/g. Thicker RuO2 coating, while maintaining good conductivity, results in agglomeration, decreasing electrolyte access to active material and hence the capacitive performance.
