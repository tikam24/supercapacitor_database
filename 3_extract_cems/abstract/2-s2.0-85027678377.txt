Due to highly conducting and extraordinary stable nature, carbon based materials expand the arms of energy storage devices in terms of supercapacitor. Hence, emphasis has been made to use flexible and free-standing multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) bucky paper synthesized by chemical vapor deposition for electrochemical supercapacitive electrode. The high specific capacitance of 270 F/g (2 mV/s) with superb stable behavior (88% at 10000 cycles) of bucky paper has promised as decent electrode in energy storage application. Aqueous symmetric supercapacitor (ASSC) device developed through bucky paper exhibits voltage frame of 1.6 V yielding specific capacitance of 91 F/g along with specific energy of 32 Wh/kg at a current density of 1 mA/cm2 with trustworthy stability of 107% at 6000 cycles. The hands-on practicability to light up a red LED offers its promising approach in energy storage domain.
