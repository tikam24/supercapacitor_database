Due to lack of conventional sources and increased pollution in environment, researchers are forced to evolve the alternate methods for fuel based transport. In 21st sanctuary the electrical vehicles (EVs) emerged as an alternative of the engine based vehicles. Electrical vehicles need reliable and efficient energy storage scheme, power electronic devices, and motor. In this paper we introduce a bidirectional DC-DC converter with non-isolated multi-input topology. In this paper hybrid energy storage scheme (HESS), comprising of an ultra-capacitor clubbed with a suitable battery is used. The benefits of this proposed converter involve batter acceleration, high energy density, enhance battery life and controlled regenerative breaking. A bidirectional converter for multi-inputs is simulated for 1kW power capacity in MATLAB/Simulation software. The fuzzy logic is used to generate the duty ratio and increases the gain of converter to enhance the system performance. The implemented control scheme is proved to be novel and superior to the PI control method.
