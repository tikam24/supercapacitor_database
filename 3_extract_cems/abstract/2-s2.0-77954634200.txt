Graphene is an emerging carbon material that may soon find practical applications. With its unusual properties, graphene is a potential electrode material for electrochemical energy storage. This article highlights recent research progress in graphene-based materials as supercapacitor electrodes. With a brief description of the working principle of supercapacitors, research progress towards the synthesis and modification of graphene-based materials, including graphene oxide, fullerenes, and carbon nanotubes, is presented. Applications of such materials with desirable properties to meet the specific requirements for the design and configuration of advanced supercapacitor devices are summarized and discussed. Future research trends towards new approaches to the design and synthesis of graphene-based nanostructures and architectures for electrochemical energy storage are proposed.
