Energy storage devices play an integral role in next-generation flexible electronics. Immense efforts have been made to satisfy the desire for lighter, miniature, and higher performance power resources in recent decades. However, conventional laminated energy storage devices suffer from considerable interfacial contact resistance and unavoidable displacement among adjacent components. Accordingly, the recent explosion of all-in-one electrochemical energy storage devices with integrated configuration, which is conducive to the transport of ions and electrons and enhances the structural stability during consecutive mechanical deformation, has received significant attention. This review provides a new paradigm for thinking of all-in-one batteries and supercapacitors in the general operating principles and the methods to make these devices integrated. Namely, the fabrication strategies of deposition, in situ polymerization, laser patterning, and printing are highlighted, and the performances of these different strategies are discussed. We also describe the subsequent applications of all-in-one energy storage devices, with an energy harvester or sensor systems enabling real-time noninvasive monitoring with prolonged power supply. The final section provides a perspective for future developments and challenges for all-in-one batteries and supercapacitors.
