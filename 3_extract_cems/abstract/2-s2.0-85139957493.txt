A NiCo-metal organic framework (MOF) electrode, prepared using urea as a surfactant, was synthesized using a one-pot hydrothermal method. The addition of urea to the NiCo-MOF creates interstitial voids and an ultra-thin nanostructure in the NiCo-MOF, which improves its charge transfer performance. We obtained the optimal metal to surfactant ratio to achieve the best specific capacitance. The NiCo-MOF was employed as the working electrode material in a three-electrode system. Field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy were employed to characterize the microstructures and morphologies of the composites. Cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy curves were employed to quantify the electrochemical properties of the electrodes in a 6 M KOH electrolyte.
