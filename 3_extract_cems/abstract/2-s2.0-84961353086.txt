Three-dimensional (3D) MnO2 structures are deposited on microwave-expanded graphite oxide (MEGO) via a self-limited redox reaction between MEGO and KMnO4. The 3D architecture consists of MnO2 sheets lying uniformly on MEGO and walls protruding from MEGO, both with thickness in the range of 1-5 nm. The loading of MnO2 and the height and density of walls in the 3D architecture can be controlled by tuning the reaction duration, leading to a balanced specific capacitance and power performance. Symmetric supercapacitors assembled using a MEGO-MnO2 composite with 24.5 wt% MnO2 can work at a voltage of up to 2 V in a 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, yielding an energy density of 14 W h kg-1 (13.6 W h L-1) at a power density of 250 W kg-1 (243 W L-1) or a power density of 7.67 kW kg-1 (7.44 kW L-1) at an energy density of 5.46 W h kg-1 (5.3 W h L-1). Asymmetric supercapacitors, consisting of the MEGO-MnO2 (containing 24.5 wt% MnO2) composite as the positive electrode and activated MEGO as the negative electrode in a 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, exhibit an energy density of 25.1 W h kg-1 at a power density of 93 W kg-1 with a working voltage of up to 1.8 V.
