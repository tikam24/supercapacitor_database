Asymmetric supercapacitors have emerged as one of the most appropriate energy storage systems. Enhancing the specific capacity of electrode materials at high current densities is a critical issue in asymmetric capacitors. Herein, we optimized a simple strategy to develop partial reduced hierarchical nanosheets shaped nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxide with Ag nanoparticles for efficient charge storage. The composite cathodes are prepared using a mild hydrothermal method followed by a liquid phase reduction process. Benefiting from the electric conductivity tuning, the hybrids reveal better capacitive performances. Among all, the nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxide with 5 wt.% Ag decoration presents a high specific capacitance of 1338 F g − 1 at a current density of 10 A g − 1 with a good capacity retention of 660 F g − 1 at 60 A g − 1, implying its fascinating rate capability. Besides, the established capacitor device achieves an energy density of 43.07 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 400 W kg−1. Interestingly, the device exhibits excellent long-term durability for 10,000 consecutive cycles of repeated charge-discharge processes at 12.5 A g − 1 with a capacity retention of 89.6%. Such a high performance suggests a practical and feasible approach as three-dimensional (3D) electrode tailoring for sustainable energy storage devices.
