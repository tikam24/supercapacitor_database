As an important part of supercapacitors, electrolyte plays a key role in determining the performance of device. This review briefly discusses about the characteristics and the latest research results of the electrolytes including aqueous, organic liquid, ionic liquid, solid/quasi-solid polymer electrolyte and redox system for supercapacitors. The classification and property of solid/quasi-solid polymer electrolytes are focused, and put forward the development of wide potential window, high ionic conductivity, and stable electrochemical properties of ionic liquids and excellent mechanical strengths and comprehensive properties of gel polymer electrolytes are trends in the field of electrolytes for supercapacitors in the future. Finally, the development prospect of electrolytes for supercapacitors is proposed.
