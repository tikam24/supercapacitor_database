The electrode graphene/MnO2 nano-composites were obtained by depositing a layer of reduced graphene on the porous MnO2 nanoscale which was deposited firstly on the foamed nickel substrate by cyclic voltammetry. The morphology, phase and valence state of the material were analyzed by SEM, XRD and XPS. The specific capacitance, cyclic stability and resistance were characterized by the means of cyclic voltammogram, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectrum. The results show that the MnO2 nanosheets are mostly coated by graphene. The equivalent series resistance and charge transfer resistance decrease form 0.83 立, 9.34 立 to 0.4 立, 6.76 立, respeactivly. The specific capacitance of graphene/MnO2 composites at current density of 2 A/g is 501 F/g which has improved 25% compared to bare MnO2, and exhibit an 84% specific capacitance retention after 3 000 cycles.
