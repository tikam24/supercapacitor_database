The rich porous structure, high surface area and surface doping make nitrogen doping mesoporous carbon materials (N-MPC) attractive in various areas, including adsorption separation, electrochemical energy storage, catalysis and other fields. Herein, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is introduced into the polymerization process of assembly of phenol/formaldehyde (PF) resin by means of hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interaction, which not only leads to the formation of uniform mesopores, but also leads to the increase of specific surface area and nitrogen doping. The amount of PVP and annealing temperature has no obvious effect on morphology, but subsequently has effect on the specific surface area and pore volume. When appropriate PVP dosage and annealing temperature are adopted, the obtained N-MPC shows abundant mesoporous, high surface area and suitable nitrogen doping. As electrode materials in supercapacitor, the N-MPC shows good performance with high capacitance good stability and rate performance, presenting its excellent promising in energy storage.
