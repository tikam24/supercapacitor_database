Multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)/MnO 2 supercapacitor electrodes containing MnO 2 nanoflakes in the MWCNT network are fabricated through the oxidation of manganese acetate with poly(4- styrenesulfonic acid) (PSS) dispersed MWCNTs. The structural evolution of the electrodes under charge/discharge (reduction/oxidation) cycles and its impact on the electrodes' electrochemical properties are evaluated. Structural evolution involves the dissolution of MnO 2 upon reduction, the diffusion of the reduced Mn species from the MWCNT network toward the electrolyte solution, and the deposition of MnO 2 on the electrode surface upon oxidation. Electrode structural changes, including the electrode dissolution and the growth of the MnO 2 crystals, are scan rate dependent and have deteriorating effect on the electrode's electrochemical properties including the specific capacitance and cyclic stability.
