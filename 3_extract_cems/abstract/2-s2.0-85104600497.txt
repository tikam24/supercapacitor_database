Rational design and precise regulation over the morphology, structure, and pore size of functional conducting mesoporous polymers with enriched active sites and shorten electron–ion transport pathway are extremely important for developing high-performance micro-supercapacitors (MSCs), but still remain a great challenge. Herein, a general dual-colloid interface co-assembly strategy is proposed to fabricate hollow mesoporous polypyrrole nano-bowls (mPPy-nbs) for high-energy-density solid-state planar MSCs. By simply adjusting the size of block copolymer micelles, the diameter of polystyrene nanospheres and the amount of pyrrole monomer, mesopore size of the shell, void and shell thickness of mPPy-nbs can be simultaneously controlled. Importantly, this strategy can be further utilized to synthesize other hollow mesoporous polymers, including poly(tris(4-aminophenyl)amine), poly(1,3,5-triaminobenzene) and their copolymers, demonstrative of excellent universality. The structurally optimized mPPy-nb exhibits high specific surface area of 122 m2 g−1and large capacitance of 225 F g−1 at 1 mV s−1. Furthermore, the MSCs assembled by mPPy-nbs deliver impressive volumetric capacitance of 90 F cm−3 and energy density of 2.0 mWh cm−3, superior to the most reported polymers-based MSCs. Also, the fabricated MSCs present excellent flexibility with almost no capacitance decay under varying bending states, and robust serial/parallel self-integration for boosting voltage and capacitance output. Therefore, this work will inspire the new design of mesoporous conducting polymer materials toward high-performance microscale supercapacitive devices.
