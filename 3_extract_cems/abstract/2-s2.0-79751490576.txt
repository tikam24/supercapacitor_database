In this study a carbon and NiO/carbon electrodes were prepared and investigated. The surface roughness increases with the increase of the torch power. The addition of the NiO changes the surface structure from a snowflake-like to a mesh-like. It was demonstrated that the addition of the nickel oxide to amorphous carbon increases the specific capacitance of composite electrode. However, the NiO/carbon electrodes have a lower breakdown voltage values and longer charge-discharge cycles.
