Herein we illustrate a rational scheme to construct nanorod structured Co3O4@Fe2O3-2DC working electrode for electrochemical capacitor applications. When analyzed as a supercapacitor electrode material, Co3O4@Fe2O3-2DC at 5 A/g delivered an optimum capacity retention of 96.7%, and a high specific capacitance of 2657.1 F/g at a marginal current density of 1 A/g. Co3O4@Fe2O3-2DC unparalleled electrochemical performance can be accredited to its unique morphology consigned with a high specific surface area of 532.8 m2/g, and the effect of synergy between single-layer practically defect free graphene, and the anchored cobalt and iron metal oxides. The electrode operated within a wide potential window, almost at the limit for aqueous electrolyte system (1.23 V), which makes it merit a high over-potential caption. These results validate Co3O4@Fe2O3-2DC to be considered as a favorable electrode material, for application in next-generation excellent performance supercapacitors.
