Although TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTAs) have shown great promise as supercapacitor materials, their specific capacitances are still not comparable with some typical materials. Here, TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs)/TNTAs hybrid structure has been derived from the anodized TNTAs by a facile hydrothermal solid-gas method (HSGM), which can avoid cracking or curling of the TNTAs from Ti substrate. The obtained NPs/TNTAs hybrid structure can exhibit a ∼4.90 times increase in surface area and a ∼5.49 times increase in areal specific capacitance compared to the TNTAs without HSGM treatment. Besides, the argon-atmosphere annealing can offer improved areal capacitance and cycling stability relative to the air-atmosphere annealing. The hydrothermal vapor pressure is a key factor for controlling microscopic morphologies of TNTAs, the morphology transformations of TNTAs during the HSGM treatment can be accelerated under enhanced vapor pressures. The highest areal capacitance of HSGM-treated TNTAs is up to 76.12 mF cm−2 at 0.5 mA cm−2, well above that of any TiO2 materials reported to date.
