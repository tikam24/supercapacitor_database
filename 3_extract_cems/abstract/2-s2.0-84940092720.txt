An overview of the recent development in the production of activated carbon electrodes from agricultural waste biomass for application in supercapacitors is presented. The use of agricultural waste biomass as precursor for the production of activated carbons has been on the increase lately because it is cheap, readily available and also viewed as a veritable way of combating waste disposal problem in the agricultural industries. The effects of activating methods (physical, chemical and microwave-induced) and conditions on the properties of activated carbons are reviewed. The survey of articles published in the last decade indicates the viability of biomass active carbons being used as electrodes in supercapacitors. Under optimum process conditions, active carbons with specific capacitance as high as 374 F g-1 and high-rate long-cycle stability at 4 A g-1 have been produced. In this review, the influence of surface modification on activated carbon properties is also discussed. From the survey literature, it can be seen that the changes in surface chemistry and the introduction of specific surface functionalities on the surface of activated carbons impacted more on the electrochemical properties than the physiochemical properties of the activated carbons.
