Lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) combining of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and supercapacitors (SCs) with improved performance bridge the gap between these two devices, and have attracted huge attention in the field of high-efficiency electrochemical energy storage. The behavior of electrode materials is essential for the realization of high energy and high output LICs devices. As the most widely utilized electrodes, carbon materials demonstrated their ability in LICs with fast charge storage and long life-span. Here, an overview of carbon materials for advanced LICs applications is given. The advantages and shortcomings of carbon materials as electrodes are systematically analyzed with the purpose of disclosing their influence on LICs devices. In light of this analysis, the critical aspects are discussed, which should be dealt with in the future for the realization of desires high-performance LICs devices.
