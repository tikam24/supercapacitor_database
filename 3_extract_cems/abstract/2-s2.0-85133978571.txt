Constructing solid-state humidity-independent proton conductors having low activation barriers is crucial in the field of renewable energy application since they provide consistent performance over a wide range of temperatures with minimal aid of water molecules. In this work, we report the synthesis of nitrogen- and oxygen-functionalized few-layer graphene (NOFG) materials, which are modified from two graphene precursors using the Bucherer reaction and are abbreviated as NOFG-D and NOFG. These materials revealed an exceptional performance at room temperature, sub-zero temperature, high temperatures, and under low-humidity conditions as well. Under fully hydrated conditions (95% relative humidity), NOFG-D exhibited a proton conductivity of 4.1 × 10-3S cm-1at room temperature (27 °C), which gradually increased to 8.7 × 10-3S cm-1at 95 °C with a small activation barrier of 0.10 eV. NOFG demonstrated proton conductivities of 1.7 × 10-3and 3.6 × 10-3S cm-1at room temperature (27 °C) and 95 °C, respectively, at 95% RH, possessing only 0.09 eV activation energy. Both the materials also showed a nearly humidity-independent solid-state proton conduction behavior. The proton conductivities recorded at -20 °C were 2.1 × 10-3and 8.4 × 10-4S cm-1for NOFG-D and NOFG, respectively. We proposed that the basic nitrogen functional groups in cooperation with acidic carboxylic acid moieties produced a low energy barrier employing acid-base interactions, which presumably made proton transport channels self-sufficient. A supercapacitor device was also fabricated employing NOFG, which demonstrated excellent performance in a two-electrode configuration (77 F g-1at 0.5 A g-1current density for the full cell) with ∼107% cyclic stability after 10 000 cycles.
