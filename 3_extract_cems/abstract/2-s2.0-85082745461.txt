In the past few years, the increasing energy consumption of traditional fossil fuels has posed a huge threat to human health. It is very imperious to develop the sustainable and renewable energy storage and conversion devices with low cost and environment friendly features. Hybrid supercapacitors are emerging as one of the promising energy devices with high power density, fast charge-discharge process and excellent cycle stability. However, morphology and structure of the electrode materials exert serious effect on their electrochemical performances. In this review, we summarized recent progresses in transition metal oxide based electrode materials for supercapacitors. Different synthesis routes and electrochemical performances of electrode materials and storage mechanisms of supercapacitor devices have been presented in details. The future developing trends of supercapacitor based on metal oxide electrode materials are also proposed.
