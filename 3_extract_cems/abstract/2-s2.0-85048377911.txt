In order to enhance the capacity and stability of a supercapacitor electrode at high current density, a carbon-molybdenum sulfide (C-MoS2) nanosphere is prepared in a one-pot synthesis using a co-growth mechanism. With the help of the co-growth mechanism, part of the MoS2 is embedded in a carbon supporter, which makes two components well blended. Besides an increase in the stability, the carbon supporter also helps to decrease the impedance of the composite electrode. As the result, the composite materials show high specific capacitance (1000 F g-1 at 1 A g-1) and excellent stability (capacity retention rate of 93%) at a large current density (20 A g-1) for a long cycle life (20 000 cycles). When the C-MoS2//AC-ASC is fabricated, it demonstrates a high energy density of 32 W h kg-1 when the power density reaches 224.58 W kg-1, revealing its viability and potential for practical applications.
