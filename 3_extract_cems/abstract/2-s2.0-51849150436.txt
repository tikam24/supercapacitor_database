This paper describes a bidirectional DC-DC converter for a small electric vehicle. The DC-DC converter designed and tested is capable of raising the voltage from the battery pack (96V nominal) to 600V necessary to feed the Variable Frequency Drive that controls the induction motor,. This converter is also capable of working in the opposite direction (600V to 96V) in order to capture energy from regenerative braking and downhill driving. Since our EV is designed to have multiple energy sources - batteries, supercapacitor and solar panels - this same converter will be used in parallel, one for each source, having thus a multiple power converter.
