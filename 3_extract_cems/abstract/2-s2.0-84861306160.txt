For the first time, polyaniline/activity mesophase carbon microbeads composite was synthesized by in-situ chemical polymerization which used ammonium persulfate(APS) as oxidant, the middle-phase activated carbon microspheres and aniline (ANI) as the main raw material. The microstructure and component of the obtained materials were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction(XRD). With the aim to investigate the electrochemical performances of the composite, Hybrid capacitor was fabricated, and cyclic voltammetry, ac impedance spectroscopy, galvanostatic charge-discharge tests were done. The results show that in 1M H2SO4aqueous solution as electrolyte, specific capacitance of composite materials increases to 288.46F/g.
