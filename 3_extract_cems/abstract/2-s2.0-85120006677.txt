Lithium-ion capacitors (LICs), which combine the characteristics of lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors, have been well studied recently. Extensive efforts are devoted to developing fast Li+ insertion/deintercalation anode materials to overcome the discrepancy in kinetics between battery-type anodes and capacitive cathodes. Herein, we design a FeNb2O6/reduced graphene oxide (FNO/rGO) hybrid material as a fast-charge anode that provides a solution to the aforementioned issue. The synergetic combination of FeNb2O6, whose unique structure promotes fast electron transport, and highly conductive graphene shortens the Li+ diffusion pathways and enhances structural stability, leading to excellent electrochemical performance of the FNO/rGO anode, including a high capacity (770 mA h g-1 at 0.05 A g-1) and long cycle stability (95.3% capacitance retention after 500 cycles). Furthermore, the FNO/rGO//ACs LIC achieves an ultrahigh energy density of 135.6 W h kg-1 (at 2000 W kg-1) with a wide working potential window from 0.01 to 4 V and remarkable cycling performance (88.5% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 2 A g-1).
