An advanced integrated electrode for high-performance supercapacitors has been designed by growing hierarchical NiCo2O4@MnO2 core-shell heterostructured nanowire arrays on nickel foam. Such unique array nanoarchitectures exhibit remarkable electrochemical performance with high capacitance and desirable cycle life at high rates. Â© 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
