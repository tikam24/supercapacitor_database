This work developed novel surface-modified carbon foams (SMCFs) with high heteroatom contents and a certain amount of iron oxide particles via the carbothermal reduction reaction between iron oxide and the cyanate resin-based carbon foam. The effects of carbothermal reduction of iron oxide on microstructures and electrochemical properties of the carbon foams have been studied systematically using TG, XRD, FESEM, BET, and XPS. Results show that the carbothermal reduction greatly influences the microstructures of carbon foams when the temperature is higher than 600 °C. The generated iron oxide particles were embedded into the surface of carbon foams. With the increase of temperature, the surface became porous and rough with a certain graphitic structure. When the temperature arrives at 1000 °C, the as-prepared SMCF-1000 has a highest specific capacitance of 212.42 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, and the specific capacitance maintains 107% of the initial value after 10,000 charge-discharge cycles. In addition, the SMCF-1000 exhibits a maximum compressive strength of 2.52 MPa, which is expected to be a novel three-dimensional self-supporting electrode material.
