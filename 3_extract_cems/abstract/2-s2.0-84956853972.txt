This paper presents the control and charge management strategy of a photovoltaic system (PV) with plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) as energy storage. The hybrid energy storage system (HESS) of PHEV consists of battery and supercapacitor. A simulation model for the PV system with PHEV energy storage has been developed using Matlab/SimpowerSystems. The system consists of PV arrays, SEPIC dc-dc converter with maximum power point tracking (MPPT), hybrid battery-supercapacitor energy storage with bidirectional dc-dc converter and inverter for grid connection. A charge management algorithm for the hybrid energy storage system is proposed to control the power flows among the PV system, energy storage and the grid. Results show that the proposed power management algorithm can control the power flows in an efficient manner.
