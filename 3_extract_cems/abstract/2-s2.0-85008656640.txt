Polyaniline (PANI) nanowire electrode was successfully prepared using electrodeposition method. The morphology, thickness, and electrochemical performance of PANI electrode can be controlled by varying the deposition scan rates. Lower deposition scan rate results in compact and aggregates of PANI nanowire morphology. The uniform nanowire of PANI was obtained at the applied scan rate of 100 mV s−1, and it was used as symmetric electrode coupled with H2SO4/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) gel electrolyte. The different concentrations of H2SO4 acid in polymer electrolyte have influenced the electrochemical performance as well. The optimum specific capacitance and energy density of P100 PANI electrode in 3 M H2SO4/PVA gel polymer electrolyte was 377 F g−1 and 95.4 Wh kg−1 at the scan rate of 1 mV s−1. The good stability of the electrode in this system is applicable to many wearable electronics applications.
