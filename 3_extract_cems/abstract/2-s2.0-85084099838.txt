The increasing electrification places great demands on the supply and storage of electrical energy. Beside batteries, supercapacitors are a second storage technology with clear advantages compared to batteries in terms of charging time, energy density and cycle stability. This publication deals with the structurally compliant integration of pouch supercapacitor cells which are developed for integration into fiber-reinforced composites. The energy storage components are designed to transmit mechanical stresses. The aim is to qualify a space structure with integrated supercapacitors for use under space conditions. For a special peak power application, 14 supercapacitors are integrated into the lay-up of a glass fiber-reinforced structure. This structure connects electronic components and is therefore designed loadbearingly. Thermal cycling under high vacuum between -22°C and +67°C shows temperature effects, as result of the temperature dependence of the ion mobility. During the other mechanical tests (sinus vibration, random vibration, pyroshock) and irradiation with a Co60 source the electrical performance keeps at the same level. The structure featuring 14 integrated supercapacitors exhibits a specific capacitance of 1.12 F/g compared to a specific capacitance of 0.35 F/g of a structure using 16 commercial supercapacitors (FastCap EE350). These results demonstrate the great weight- and volume-saving potential of this approach.
