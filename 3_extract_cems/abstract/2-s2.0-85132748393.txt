Flexible textile-based supercapacitors have exhibited great potential for use in e-textile systems due to their high flexibility, light weight and ease of integration into the textile materials. The capacitance and energy density of current textile-based supercapacitors, however, are insufficient to meet the high demands of wearable electronics and smart textiles. This review summarizes the recent progress of enhancement methods regarding textile-based supercapacitors, including the multidimensional nanostructure of active materials, the structural designs of textile substrates and the wearable softness. Furthermore, the remaining challenges and future prospects of constructing high-performance flexible textile-based supercapacitors for smart textiles and wearable electronics are also proposed.
