In the recent years it has been increased the need to develop alternative energy conditioners to harvest renewable energy instead of using the conventional energy supplies. This kind of energies can be used at small energy scale with the objective to supply power to low-power systems. In this paper is presented a different alternative to power-conditioning of environmental sources of energy through an advanced dc-dc converter, with the purpose to explore another efficient way to improve energy harvesting. In particular, it was used a 1-W high-efficiency solar monocrystalline cell and, as a base of the power conditioning structure, an enhanced self-lift positive output Luo converter (ESLPOLC) is proposed. A 1 F supercapacitor array is used to store the collected energy, which can be employed in low-power devices as wireless sensors and other low-power applications.
