A unique MoS2/RGO/MoS2 (MRMS) nanostructured composite is prepared on Mo net surface through an in-situ hydrothermal synthesis. During the synthesis process, Mo net serves as not only a support but also Mo source for the lower MoS2 layer and reductant of GO. MRMS samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As-synthesized MoS2/RGO/MoS2@Modirectlyactedassupercapacitorelectrodewhichexhibitedexcellentelectrochemicalperformance(*): A high capacity of 1138.5 mF cm−2 at 20 mA cm−2 (455.3 F g−1), and a capacity retention of 98.8% after 4000 running times. A symmetric supercapacitor device consisting of two MRMS electrodes was assembled, which exhibited an energy density of 6.22 Wh kg−1 and power density of 1.87 kW kg−1.
