Rational design of composite with other electroactive materials can effectively improve the supercapacitive performances through the modulation of electronic structure and conductivity of the hybrid material. In this work, core-shell structured Ni3S2@VO2 nanorods on the nickel foam are prepared through a one-pot hydrothermal method. The addition of VO2 effectively reduces the charge transfer resistance and thus enhances the electrochemical conductivity. The nickel foam provides a platform for the in situ dispersive growth of Ni3S2@VO2 as well as a “superhighway” for the transformation of electrons. The Ni3S2@VO2 shows a high areal specific capacity of 1.09 C cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2. After a slight decrease in the initial 200 cycles, the discharge capacity remains almost constant at about 1.00 C cm−2 during the following cycles. At a high current of 50 mA cm−2, the areal specific capacitance is 0.09 C cm−2. A symmetric supercapacitor is assembled using Ni3S2@VO2 as both the anode and cathode. The specific capacity of it is 0.864 C cm−2 at a current of 1 mA cm−2. Good cycling stability and rate capability are also obtained. All these features promise it a high performance supercapacitor electrode.
