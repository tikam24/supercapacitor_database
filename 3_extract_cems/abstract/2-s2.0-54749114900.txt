The first observation of a simultaneous electrochemical supercapacitor and linear actuator composed of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) with DNA wrapping was reported. DNA was dissolved for 6 h in deionized water to prepare the spinning solution. SWNTs were then added to this solution, which was then sonicated for 20 mm to obtain a black ink- like solution. The coupling agent, EDC, was added to the black ink solution and mixed for 24 h at room temperature to prepare the crosslinked fibers. The structure of the DNA-SWNT hybrid fibers was examined using a SEM, an HRTEM, and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and Raman spectroscopy. The excellent first results for DNA-SWNT hybrid fibers relative to SWNT mat actuators indicates a high double-layer capacitance due to the presence of debundled SWNTs from DNA wrapping. The DNA was effective in debundling the SWNTs and acting as a mechanical binder even when immersed in liquid electrolytes.
