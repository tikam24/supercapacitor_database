Graphene oxide was used to prepare three types of dye modified graphene oxide by adsorbing dyes of acid blue 74, methylene blue, and congo red. The as-prepared dye modified graphene oxide was used to fabricate dye modified graphene oxide/polyaniline composites via an in-situ chemical polymerization. The nanocomposites were labelled as acid blue 74 modified graphene oxide/polyaniline (GAP), methylene blue modified graphene oxide/polyaniline (GMP), and congo red modified graphene oxide/polyaniline (GCP) composites, respectively. Furthermore, their electrochemical properties as electrode materials for supercapacitor were studied. The results demonstrate that polyaniline (PANI) nanorods in the GAP composite are 20~30 nm in diameter and 100~150 nm in length, and the PANI arrays are uniformly and orderly constructed in the composite; whereas the PANI nanorods in GMP and GCP composites possess larger size in diameter and length, which are partly aggregated together. The specific capacitances of GAP, GMP, and GCP are up to 419 F/g, 401 F/g, and 399 F/g, respectively, at a current density of 0.5 A/g. Comparing with the specific capacitance of PANI (399 F/g), these composites display enhanced specific capacitances.
