This study's objective is to prepare and characterize a ZnO-rGO composite for use in supercapacitors. The hydrothermal method was used to successfully prepare ZnO and ZnO-rGO. Characterization of the prepared materials was carried out using X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrometers. The electrochemical properties of the ZnO and ZnO-rGO electrodes were examined using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and impedance spectroscopy. The specific capacitance of the ZnO-rGO composite electrode in 1M NaOH as an electrolyte was 293.37F/g at the scan rate of 5mV/s. As a result of the low equivalent series resistance and improved ion diffusion produced by ZnO and rGO working together, the ZnO-rGO nanoparticles electrode has a higher super capacitance. The result achieved a higher energy density of 39.93Wh/kg and a power density of 54.45kW/kg. These findings demonstrated the significance of rGO-based composites in the development of high-performance energy storage systems as well as their enormous potential for improvement.
