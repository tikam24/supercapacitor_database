The emergence and development of thick electrodes provide an efficient way for the high-energy-density supercapacitor design. Wood is a kind of biomass material with porous hierarchical structure, which has the characteristics of a straight channel, uniform pore structure, good mechanical strength, and easy processing. The wood-inspired low-tortuosity and vertically aligned channel architecture are highly suitable for the construction of thick electrochemical supcapacitor electrodes with high energy densities. This review summarizes the design concepts and processing parameters of thick electrode supercapacitors inspired by natural woods, including wood-based pore structural design regulation, electric double layer capacitances (EDLCs)/pseudocapacitance construction, and electrical conductivity optimization. In addition, the optimization strategies for preparing thick electrodes with wood-like structures (e.g., 3D printing, freeze-drying, and aligned-low tortuosity channels) are also discussed in detail. Further, this review presents current challenges and future trends in the design of thick electrodes for supercapacitors with wood-inspired pore structures. As a guideline, the brilliant blueprint optimization will promote sustainable development of wood-inspired structure design for thick electrodes and broaden the application scopes.
