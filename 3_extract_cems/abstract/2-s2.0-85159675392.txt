In the present era, unique and novel energy storage devices are required that combine the essential characteristics of supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries to fulfil energy demands. In this research, the cobalt niobium sulfide@polyaniline (CoNbS@PANI) composite is synthesized using the hydrothermal method and measured the structural and electrochemical characteristics. The cobalt niobium sulfide (CoNbS) shows a low specific capacity of 701.35 C g−1 at 1.5 A g−1, improving up to 1207.5 C g−1 with PANI because of the large conductivity and redox-active sites. The performance of the activated carbon (AC) is enhanced with the doping of PANI and used as an electrode in a hybrid device. We also designed a supercapattery device (CoNbS@PANI//PANI@AC), which showed an excellent specific capacity of 185 C g−1 at 3 A g−1. Besides, a remarkable energy density of 35 Wh K−1g−1 and a power density of 2400 W Kg−1 are conceived. Supercapattery device retains a capacity retention of 80% after 1000 galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) cycles. The results provide insight to cultivate the stability and working of energy storage devices.
