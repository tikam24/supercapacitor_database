An in situ hard template strategy coupled with NaOH activation is proposed to prepare hierarchical porous carbons with high surface area from biomass for high-performance supercapacitors. The preparation of the carbon includes the sol-gel process of lotus seed shell and sodium phytate, followed by carbonization and NaOH activation. The soluble sodium phytate is pyrolyzed to nano-Na5P3O10 during carbonization and then reacts with NaOH to convert to nano-Na2CO3 and nano-Na3PO4 particles, which are encapsulated in the carbon matrix as the in situ hard templates and leave large mesopores/macropores after being removed in the subsequent washing treatment. Combined with the micropores created by NaOH activation, the as-prepared carbons possess developed hierarchical pores with a large surface area of 3188 m2 g-1 and a pore volume of 3.2 cm3 g-1. Furthermore, the carbons are rich in the heteroatoms of O, N, and P originated from the biomass precursors and sodium phytate. As a result, the biomass-derived hierarchical porous carbon exhibits high capacitance (286 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1), great rate performance (241 F g-1 at 200 A g-1), and excellent cycle stability in 6 M KOH electrolyte. Outstanding electrochemical performances are also achieved in 3 M H2SO4 electrolyte. Thus, the biomass-derived carbon with hierarchical porous structure and outstanding performance is considered as a promising electrode material for high-rate and high-energy density supercapacitors, and the strategy based on the in situ template method opens a new door for the preparation of hierarchical porous carbons with high surface area from biomass precursors.
