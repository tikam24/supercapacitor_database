Stretchable supercapacitors are critical for a variety of portable and wearable electronic devices, and they have been typically realized by the use of non-active elastic substrates that do not contribute to the energy storage capability. Here a new family of stretchable supercapacitors is fabricated from cellular carbon nanotube film-based electrodes with high electrochemical performances. They display high specific capacitances that can be maintained by 98.3% after stretching by 140% for 3000 cycles. In addition, their voltage and current windows are tuned by varying the configuration of the film electrode.
