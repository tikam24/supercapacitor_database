Negative electrode materials with high capacitance performance are highly desired for asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs). In this work, a novel kind of sulphur-doped Co3O4 (S-Co3O4) negative electrode material with enhanced electrochemical properties was developed by doping sulphur into Co3O4. The S-Co3O4 nanowires grown on carbon cloth by a hydrothermal method achieved an areal capacitance of 0.55 F cm-2 at 10 mV s-1 in a 5 M LiCl solution, which is more than 11 times that of the untreated Co3O4 electrode. Moreover, the S-Co3O4 electrode has an excellent long-term cycling stability with more than 92% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles. In addition, a high-performance flexible supercapacitor (ASC) was also prepared with S-Co3O4 nanowires as a negative electrode and MnO2 as a positive electrode. A maximum energy density of 0.86 mW h cm-3 and a maximum power density of 0.79 W cm-3 were achieved for the as-fabricated ASC device.
