A block-like metal-organic framework UiO-66 was prepared by in-situ growth one-pot hydrothermal process. The as-synthesized material was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The electrochemical properties used as a supercapacitor electrode material were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge measurement (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 2 M KOH solution, exhibiting a high specific capacitance (311 F·g-1 at 1 A·g-1), suggesting its promising potential as a supercapacitor electrode material.
