The current study presents a facile pathway for the fabrication of high-performance supercapacitor electrodes. Cu30Mn70 binary alloy was fabricated using an elemental powder mixture followed by homogenization and surface activation through a severe surface deformation processing technique. The processed and activated specimen was subjected to DC etching in 0.025 M HCl solution for 3 min, resulting in a uniform nanoporous surface. The developed nanoporous CuO/MnO@CuMn specimen with 100-Î¼m thickness was directly used for electrochemical energy storage, wherein it showed a wide potential window of 1.65 V in an aqueous solution. The electrode demonstrated a high specific capacitance of ~ 773 F/cm3 and superior cyclic stability for 5000 cycles. With a wide potential window Of 1.7 V, a symmetric device demonstrated a large energy density of ~ 17.15 Wh/L. The excellent electrochemical performance obtained in the current study results from the synergistic effect of hybrid oxides.
