Supercapacitors, also called ultracapacitors, can be combined with lithium-ion batteries in a hybrid system as primary energy devices for power assist during acceleration and hill climbing, as well as for recovery of braking energy. The hybrid system can extend the life, downsize the volume, and reduce the cost of batteries, and, therefore, has been attracting much attention these years. In this chapter, the main focus will be on graphene-based electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors, including conductive polymers and metal oxides. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) as a unique synthesis technique will be introduced. In the end, we will address the issues and challenges of graphene-based nanocomposites for supercapacitors for future studies.
