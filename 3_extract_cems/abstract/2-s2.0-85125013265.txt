The N-doped carbon nanofiber coated graphene nanosheets (NFGNs) were designed and constructed using EGNs as the skeleton and PPy as the carbon source. The samples were characterized by SEM, XRD, Raman, FTIR, XPS and BET. The results show that the interconnected N-doped carbon nanofibers are uniformly coated on the surface of EGNs. The NFGNs-800 presents high-level nitrogen atom doping of 11.53% and large specific surface area of 477.65 m2•g-1. The capacitance performance test results show that the NFGNs-800 electrode material exhibits high specific capacitance of 323.3 F•g-1 (1.0 A•g-1) and good rate characteristic. NFGNs-800 supercapacitor shows high energy density of 87.1 Wh•kg-1 at power density of 10500 W•kg-1. The specific capacitance of the supercapacitor is 95.9% of the initial specific capacitance and the columbic efficiency still remains above 99% after 10000 constant current charge discharge cycles.
