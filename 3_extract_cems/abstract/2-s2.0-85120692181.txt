Fundamentals and Applications of Supercapacitor 2D Materials covers different aspects of supercapacitor 2D materials, including their important properties, synthesis, and recent developments in supercapacitor applications of engineered 2D materials. In addition, theoretical investigations and various types of supercapacitors based on 2D materials such as symmetric, asymmetric, flexible, and micro-supercapacitors are covered. This book is a useful resource for research scientists, engineers, and students in the fields of supercapacitors, 2D nanomaterials, and energy storage devices. Due to their sub-nanometer thickness, 2D materials have a high packing density, which is suitable for the fabrication of highly-packed energy supplier/storage devices with enhanced energy and power density. The flexibility of 2D materials, and their good mechanical properties and high packing densities, make them suitable for the development of thin, flexible, and wearable devices.
