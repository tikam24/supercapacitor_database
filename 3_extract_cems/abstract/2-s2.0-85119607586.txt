Supercapacitor is a new type of energy storage device, which has the advantages of high-power property and long cycle life. In this study, three-dimensional graphene (3D-GN) with oxygen doping and porous structure was prepared from graphene oxide (GO) by an inexpensive sodium chloride (NaCl) template, as a promising electrode material for the supercapacitor. The structure, morphology, specific surface area, pore size, of the sample were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM and BET techniques. The electrochemical performances of the sample were tested by CV and CDC techniques. The 3D-GE product is a three-dimensional nano material with hierarchical porous structures, its specific surface area is much larger than that of routine stacked graphene (GN), and it contains a large number of mesoporous and macropores, a small amount of micropores. The capacitance characteristics of the 3D-GN electrode material are excellent, showing high specific capacitance (173.5 F·g−1 at 1 A·g−1), good rate performance (109.2 F·g−1 at 8 A·g−1) and long cycle life (88% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles at 8 A·g−1)
