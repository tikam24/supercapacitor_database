Nanocrystalline and highly porous Cobalt oxide electrode was electrodeposited onto stainless steel substrates by two different electrodeposition modes, such as Chronopotentiometry and Chronoamperometry Methods. The deposited electrodes were then annealed at 5000C for 6 hours for metal oxide formation. The structural and morphological characteristics were investigated through X-ray diffraction analysis and SEM characterizations, wettability by Contact angle measurement. The electrochemical analysis was done through cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge analysis. The electrochemical properties of the deposited thin films were studied using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge. The optimum value of specific capacitance of 294.67 Fg-1 at 5mVs-1 scan rate, specific energy 3.642Wh/kg, Specific Power 3 kW/kg was obtained in 1M aqueous Na2SO4 electrolyte at a current density of 1 A g -1 in 1M aqueous Na2SO4 electrolyte by Chronoamperometry mode. Similarly, using Chronopotentiometry mode of specific capacitance of 284.4 F g-1 at a scan rate of 5mVs-1, specific energy 4.325 Wh/kg, specific power 3 kW/kg was obtained at a current density of 1 A g -1 in 1M aqueous Na2SO4 electrolyte.
