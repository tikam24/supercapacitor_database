Graphene is an allotrope of carbon consisting of a single layer atoms in a two dimensional honeycomb lattice. It has excellent electrochemical stability and possible change in physical and chemical properties. Electrodes are the primary determinants of supercapacitor electrochemical efficiency, so designing and fabricating electrodes with acceptable structural and chemical properties is critical for developing high-performance energy storage devices. The force makes graphene easy to agglomerate the reduce of the specific surface area and ratio of capacity. In this study, the graphene oxide reduced by plant leaf and then ZnO/RGO composites were synthesized by hydrothermal preparation of precursors and then calcination of precursors into composites. The phase structure and micromorphology were characterized by XRD, SEM, Raman and FT-IR. It was found that ZnO nanoparticles were embedded in the graphene sheets and form a composite structure. The electrochemical properties of the material were tested. The results show that the incorporation of graphene and Zinc oxide acted as an electrode material. The results concluded that the ZnO/RGO composite has excellent cycle stability, after 2000 cycles the average specific capacitance retention remains 80%. This is benefit from the introduction of graphene sheets and ZnO uniformly load between the sheets of graphene. The nano structure of reduced graphene oxide provides a conductive nature and more active sites for electrochemical reaction. The results prove that the incorporation of graphene and Zinc oxide are effectively reversible nature and good electrode material.
