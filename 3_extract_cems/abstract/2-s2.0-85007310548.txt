New generations of ship must meet new challenges, particularly in terms of energy efficiency, reliability and environmental impacts. One of the future goals of shipbuilding is to reduce the impact of ship emissions to respond to existent and future regulations of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) on greenhouse gas and pollutants emissions. In this context, Hybrid Propulsion Systems (HPS) - are promising solutions to meet these requirements. This work presents a state of the art of hybrid propulsion systems for small vessels. The paper includes a general description of the future challenges for shipbuilding and a description of the possible topologies of HPS which can be implemented in small ships. The key features of the HPS components are also described and several electric and hybrid propulsion small ship are presented.
