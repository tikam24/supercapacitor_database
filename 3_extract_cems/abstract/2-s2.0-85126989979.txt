NiCo metal-organic framework (MOF) electrodes were prepared by a simple hydrothermal method. The flower-like NiCo MOF electrode exhibited an exciting potential window of 1.2 V and an excellent specific capacitance of 927.1 F g-1 at 1 A g-1. The flower-like NiCo MOF//activated carbon (AC) device delivered a high energy density of 28.5 W hkg-1 at a power density of 400.5 W kg-1 and good cycle stability (95.4% after 5000 cycles at 10 A g_1). Based on the flower-like NiCo MOF electrode, the asymmetric quasi-solid-state flexible supercapacitor (AFSC) was prepared and exhibited good capacitance retention after bending (79% after 100 bends and 64.4% after 200 bends). Furthermore, two AFSCs in series successfully lit up ten parallel red LED lights, showing great application potential in flexible and wearable energy storage devices.
