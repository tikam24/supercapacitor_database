In the present work, the electrochemical performance of BiFeO3-graphene composite as electrodes material has been investigated for high power supercapacitor application. The composite material was coated on a stainless steel substrate by drop casting method. The supercapacitor device was made in two electrodes configuration and an aqueous electrolyte of 1 M Na2SO4 was filled between the electrodes. The electrochemical performance was determined using cyclic voltammetery and constant current charging/discharging process. It was observed that the supercapacitor made of BiFeO3-graphene composite electrodes can deliver a power of 18.75 kW kg-1 with maintaining the energy density of 1.9 Wh kg-1. These values are comparable to the reported values in the literature. Surface morphology of the electrode was characterized by scanning electron microscopy. X-ray diffraction was also used for the structural analysis of the electrode.
