Cobalt phosphite (Co<inf>11</inf>(HPO<inf>3</inf>)<inf>8</inf>(OH) <inf>6</inf>) microarchitectures assembled by ultralong nanoribbons are successfully synthesized by a mild hydrothermal condition without any additives. The uniform ultralong nanoribbon has a width of 100 nm and length of 20-30 μm. More importantly, Co<inf>11</inf>(HPO<inf>3</inf>)<inf>8</inf>(OH) <inf>6</inf> microarchitectures are also successfully applied as an electrochemical supercapacitor with a good specific capacitance (312 F g <sup>-1</sup> at 1.25 A g<sup>-1</sup>), good rate capability and excellent cycling property (maintaining about 89.4% at 1.25 A g<sup>-1</sup> after 3000 cycles). © The Royal Society of Chemistry.
