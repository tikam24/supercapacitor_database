To accomplish superior performance in supercapacitors, a fresh class of electrode materials with advantageous structures is essential. Owing to its rich electrochemical activity, vanadium oxides are considered to be an attractive electrode material for energy storing devices. In this work, vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) nanostructures were prepared using surfactant (CTAB)-assisted hydrothermal route. Stacked V2O5 sheets enable additional channels for electrolyte ion intercalation. These stacked V2O5 nanosheets show highest specific capacitance of 466Fg-1 at 0.5Ag-1. In addition, it exhibits good rate capacity, lower value of charge transfer resistance and good stability when used as an electrode material for supercapacitors. Further, an asymmetric supercapacitor device was assembled utilizing the stacked V2O5 sheets and activated carbon as electrodes. The electrochemical features of the device are also discussed.
