Co3O4 anchored polyaniline (PANI) binary composite with excellent electrochemical activity is successfully developed by lowering the synthesis temperature. The composite achieves a specific mesoporous structure at subzero temperature and exhibits an admirable specific capacitance as high as 1308 F g−1 at 10 mV s−1. The enhanced electrochemical performance is attributed to the low-temperature synergism of PANI and Co3O4. The specific morphology offers enough active sites for efficient electrolyte diffusion and buffers the structural deformation of PANI, thus improving the composite's stability. Also, the fabricated symmetric supercapacitor shows a stable energy storage performance − 99.6% coulombic efficiency over 5000 CD. The notable specific energy (250 Wh kg−1) at a specific power of 6.4 kW kg−1 at 1 A g−1 demonstrates the potential of Co3O4 anchored PANI binary composite electrode for future supercapacitors.
