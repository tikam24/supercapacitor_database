In this report, graphene nanosheets (GNS)/nickel sulfide (NiS) based material for high-performance supercapacitor is prepared by "dip and dry" and electrodeposition methods. Commercial flexible make-up cottons (MCs) are chose as skeletons to construct homogeneous three-dimensional (3D) interconnected graphene-wrapped macro-networks, which can support structures for high loading of active electrode materials and facilitate the access of electrolytes to active electrode materials. The hybrid GNS/NiS based MCs (denoted as MCs@GNS@NiS) electrode yields relatively high specific capacitance of 775 F g-1 at a charge/discharge specific current of 0.5 A g-1 and good capacitance retention of 88.1% after 1000 cycles at 2 A g-1. Furthermore, the MCs@GNS@NiS electrode delivers a high energy density of 11.2 Wh kg-1 at even a high power density of 1008 W kg-1. Therefore, such low-cost and high-performance energy MCs based on GNS/NiS hierarchical nanostructures offer great promise in large-scale energy storage device applications.
