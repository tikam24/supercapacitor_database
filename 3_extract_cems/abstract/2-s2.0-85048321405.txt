Herein, we described a mild method to synthesize Co2Mn(PO4)2 nanorods. The scanning electron microscopy results indicated that the Co2Mn(PO4)2 nanorods have average widths and lengths of 50 nm and 600 nm, respectively. The electrochemical performance of Co2Mn(PO4)2 was examined in a three-electrode system, which revealed a specific capacitance of 525 F gâˆ’1 at a current density of 1.0 A/g. Importantly, the capacity retention of the prepared Co2Mn(PO4)2 electrode is 95.3% after 5000 cycles in 3 M KOH aqueous electrolyte at the current density of 1.0 A/g. These extraordinary electrochemical performances of the Co2Mn(PO4)2 nanorods made it an excellent candidate for application in energy storage devices.
