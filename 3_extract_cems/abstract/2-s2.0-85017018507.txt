The effective utilization of the kinetic energy of an electric vehicle during braking depends on the capacity of the drive system to be able to process and to store such energy. To prevent the electronic processing of such energy, usually associated with high power peaks, a supercapacitor is connected directly to the inverter DC bus, which drives the PMSM. The DC voltage is variable according to the vehicle speed, ensuring the ability to absorb all the regenerated kinetic energy. Such voltage variation must be adjusted to allow the correct driving of the vehicle at nominal torque at any speed. This paper presents design criteria of the drive system and the dynamic modeling of the power electronic converters controllers. This system makes use of observers to implement the flux control. Simulation and experimental results allow the validation of the proposal.
