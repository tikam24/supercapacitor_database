Porous carbon sheets (PCSs) was synthesized via carbonization and activation from epipremnum aureum leaves for their ability to absorb harmful substances. The specific surface area (SSA) was increased to 1076 m2 g−1 with pore volume to 0.508 cm3 g−1 after KOH activation. As an electrode material for supercapacitors (SCs), PCSs had a high specific capacitance of 243 F g−1 at the current density of 0.1 A g−1. PCS-based SCs exhibited excellent electrochemical reversibility and good cycling performance (94.4% after 10,000 cycles). The outstanding capacitive behaviors indicated PCSs had fast ion transfer path, good conductivity and excellent cycling stability, which can be potentially applied in energy storage field.
