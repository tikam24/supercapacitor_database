Metal sulfides/graphene nanocomposites are of interest because of their potential applications in electrochemical and photoelectrochemical energy conversion and storage. Such materials can be prepared with in situ growth strategy, hydrothermal or solvothermal method, sol-gel method, microwave assisted irradiation method and chemical vapor deposition. This article briefly summarized recent literature and patents on the synthesis of metal sulfides/graphene nanocomposites and their promising applications in energy conversion and storage such as rechargeable lithium batteries, supercapacitors and solar cells.
