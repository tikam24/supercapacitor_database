Mo2S3@Ni3S2 nanowires on nickel foam, which were synthesized by a simple hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) assisted hydrothermal route. In the three-electrode system testing, the Mo2S3@Ni3S2 nanowires show a nice capacitance of 998.9 Fg-1 at 1 A g−1, and 43.5% of the original capacitance was retained at a current density of 10 A g−1, suggesting excellent rate capability. In addition, it possesses good stability with 90.55% of the initial capacitance retained after 650 cycles at 2 A g−1.
