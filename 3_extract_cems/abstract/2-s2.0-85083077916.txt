The use of metallo-supramolecular polymer (MSP) as a thin-film-based redox supercapacitor electrode material is reported for the first time. Fe(II)- and Ru(II)-based MSPs (polyFe and polyRu, respectively) were synthesized by complexation of appropriate metal salts with 4′,4″-(1,4-phenylene)bis-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine, and thin films of these polymers were prepared by spray coating onto an indium tin oxide glass substrate. A study of the energy storage performances of the polyFe and polyRu films in a nonaqueous electrolyte system revealed volumetric capacitances of ∼62.6 ± 3 F/cm3 for polyFe and 98.5 ± 7 F/cm3 for polyRu at a current density of 2 A/cm3. To improve the energy storage performance over a wider potential range, asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) displays were fabricated with suitable combinations of the MSPs as cathodic materials and Prussian blue as the anodic counter material in a sandwich configuration with a transparent polymeric ion gel as the electrolyte. The fabricated ASCs showed a maximum volumetric energy density (∼10-18 mW h/cm3) that was higher than that of lithium thin-film batteries and a power density (7 W/cm3) comparable to that of conventional electrolyte capacitors, with superb cyclic stability for 10 000 cycles. To demonstrate the practical use of the MSP, the illumination of a light-emitting diode bulb was powered by a laboratory-made device. This work should inspire the development of high-performance thin-film flexible supercapacitors based on MSPs as active cathodic materials.
