Through the optimized combination of aluminum electrolytic capacitors anode and electrochemical capacitors cathode, using Ta/Ta 2O 5 as the anode, activated carbon as the cathode, we developed a work unit for 100V voltage of the hybrid supercapacitor. Compared with the usual electrochemical capacitor working voltage, the capacitance had improved. The electrical performance test shows that it has high energy storage density and rapid charging and discharging ability, electrochemical spectrum impedance (EIS) analysis shows that it has good impedance characteristics and the frequency characteristics.
