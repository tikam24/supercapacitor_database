In the present work, Molybdenum disulfide/ hematite/Graphene (MoS2/Fe2O3/G) composite based heterostructure material is successfully prepared by hydrothermal method and employed as electrode material for supercapacitor device. The electrochemical properties and performance of prepared electrode overruled pure MoS2 and MoS2/Fe2O3 composite. The MoS2/Fe2O3/G composite electrode delivered significant capacitance of 98.2 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 and outstanding cycling behavior. To determine practical application, the MoS2/Fe2O3/G and Activated carbon electrodes are used as cathode and anode material for asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) design. The ASC device unveiled energy and power density of 46.8 Wh kg−1 and 750 W kg−1. Moreover, the device retained the capacity up to 77% even after 10,000 cycles. Thus, the MoS2/Fe2O3/G electrode material can be claimed to have constructive prospect for practical application of supercapacitor.
