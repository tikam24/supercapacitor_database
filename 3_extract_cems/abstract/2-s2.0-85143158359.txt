The electrochemical deposition is an additive, easy, cheap, and reproducible method to deposit different types of materials including metals, polymers, metallic oxides, chalcogenides, etc. As a general condition, this method is used to deposit one type of material onto a conductive another. Due to its remarkable properties (especially electrical conductivity, redox activity and environmental stability), polyaniline (PANI), an intrinsically conducting polymer, is a versatile material with potential applications in manufacturing of many devices such as chemical sensors, biosensors, actuators, supercapacitors, display device electrodes (electrochromic devices), photonic devices, drug delivery devices, passive or active electronic components, organic light emitting diodes, energy harvesting devices (especially solar cells), fuel cell devices, printed circuit board manufacturing, rechargeable absorbers, etc. In present paper we present the results obtained for synthesis of porous layers of polyaniline deposited by anodic electrochemical polymerization onto screen printed electrodes of gold on alumina 96% substrate. After the electrochemical synthesis, Co, Mn, Fe and Sn oxides were incorporated into the polyaniline matrix by chemical precipitation. The working conditions, electrical and physico-chemical properties of the deposited layers are presented in the paper.
