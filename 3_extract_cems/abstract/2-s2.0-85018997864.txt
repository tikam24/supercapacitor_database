Direct adoption of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as electrode materials shows impoverished electrochemical performance owing to low electrical conductivity and poor chemical stability. In this study, we demonstrate self-templated pseudomorphic transformation of MOF into surface chemistry rich hollow framework that delivers highly reactive, durable, and universal electrochemically active energy conversion and storage functionalities. In situ pseudomorphic transformation of MOF-derived hollow rhombic dodecahedron template and sulfurization of nickel cobalt layered double hydroxides (NiCo-LDHs) lead to the construction of interlayered metal sulfides (NiCo-LDH/Co9S8) system. The embedment of metal sulfide species (Co9S8) at the LDH intergalleries offers optimal interfacing of the hybrid constituent elements and materials stability. The hybrid NiCo-LDH/Co9S8 system collectively presents an ideal porous structure, rich redox chemistry, and high electrical conductivity matrix. This leads to a significant enhancement in its complementary electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution and supercapacitive energy storage properties. This work establishes the potential of MOF derived scaffold for designing of novel class hybrid inorganicâ€“organic functional materials for electrochemical applications and beyond.
