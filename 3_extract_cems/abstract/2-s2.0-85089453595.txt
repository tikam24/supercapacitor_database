Vertically Aligned Carbon Nanotubes (VACNTs)-coated flexible aluminium (Al) foil is studied as an electrode for supercapacitor applications. VACNTs are grown on Al foil inside thermal Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) reactor. 20 nm thick layer of Fe is used as a catalyst while Ar, H2 and C2H2 are used as precursor gases. The effect of growth temperature on the structure of CNTs is studied by varying the temperature of CVD reactor from 550 °C to 625 °C. Better alignment of VACNTs arrays on Al foil is recorded at 600 °C growth temperature in comparison to other processing temperatures. Cyclic voltammetry results shows that VACNTs-coated Al foil has a specific capacitance of ~ 3.01 F/g at a scan rate of 50 mV/s. The direct growth of VACNT array results in better contact with Al foil and thus low ESR values observed in impedance spectroscopy analysis. This leads to a fast charge–discharge cycle as well as a very high value of power density (187.79 kW/kg) suitable for high power applications. Moreover, wettability study shows that the fabricated VACNT electrode has a contact angle of more than 152° which signifies that it is a superhydrophobic surface and hence shows lower specific capacitance in comparison to reported values for VACNT array. Therefore, it is necessary to develop suitable post-processing strategies to make VACNTs hydrophilic to realize their full potential in supercapacitor applications.
