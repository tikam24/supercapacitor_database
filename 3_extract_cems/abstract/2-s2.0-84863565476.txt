We present the phenomenological study of process parameters, characteristics and limitations of carbon nanowalls (CNW) growth by means of microwave plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition in order to optimize the synthesis of CNW samples for targeted applications, such as supercapacitors or batteries. The growth of CNWs directly onto commercial Cu foils is simple, resulting in a higher density as compared to SiO2 or alumina supports. Complete chip coverage by CNW deposition is restricted to ∼1 cm2 squared Cu foil pieces. This is due to some electric field distortion by the use of insulating spacer and certain microwave field contribution. As a result, anisotropy and localized distribution of plasma species and conditions that enable the CNW growth is promoted. Testing the charge storage capability of our CNWs on Cu foil evidenced the suitability of present synthetic approach for the development of supercapacitor devices. © 2012 The Surface Science Society of Japan.
