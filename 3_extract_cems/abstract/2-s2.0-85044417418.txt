In the current work, cost-effective NiO nanosheets decorated with NiS nanoparticles were successfully fabricated on Ni foam by following a facile two-step hydrothermal route, and investigated as an efficient electrode material for supercapacitor applications for the first time. The obtained NiO/NiS hybrid electrode was found to deliver rapid diffusion of ions and fast electron transport, due to the high electrical conductivity, large surface area, and unique surface morphology of the NiO/NiS. As a result, this electrode exhibited a high specific capacitance of 386.7 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and good cycling stability, specifically retaining 97.6% of the initial capacitance after 3000 charge-discharge cycles at 5 A g-1. These results indicated NiO/NiS to be a promising electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
