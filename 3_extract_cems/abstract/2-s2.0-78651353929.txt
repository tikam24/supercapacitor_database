Fe2O3 thin films have been prepared by novel chemical successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. Further these films were characterized for their structural, morphological and optical properties by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), wettability test and optical absorption studies. The XRD pattern showed that the Fe2O 3 films exhibit amorphous in nature. Formation of iron oxide compound was confirmed from FTIR studies. The optical absorption showed existence of direct optical band gap of energy 2.2 eV. Fe2O3 film surface showed superhydrophilic nature with water contact angle less than 10°. The supercapacitive properties of Fe2O3 thin film investigated in 1 M NaOH electrolyte showed supercapacitance of 178 F g -1 at scan rate 5 mV/s. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
