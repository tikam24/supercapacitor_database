The series battery string or supercapacitor string automatic equalization system based on quasi-resonant switched-capacitor converter is presented in this paper. It realizes the zero-voltage gap between cells and allows maximum energy recovery in a series battery system or supercapacitor system. It not only inherits the advantage of conventional switched-capacitor battery cell balancing system, but also overcomes the drawback of conduction loss, switching loss, and finite voltage difference among battery cells. All switches are MOSFET and controlled by just a pair of complementary signals in synchronous trigger pattern and the resonant tanks operate alternatively between the two states of charging and discharging. Zero-current switching and zero-voltage gap are achieved in this paper. Different resonant tank designs can meet the needs of different balancing time to meet the needs of different energy storage devices. Experimental results indicate that the efficiency of the system is high exceeding 98. The system is very suitable for balancing used in battery management system. Â© 1986-2012 IEEE.
