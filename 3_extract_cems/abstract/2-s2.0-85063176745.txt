The paper presents the results of economic study of energy storage system (ESS) implemented in 3 kV DC power supply system. Two conceptions of ESS have been investigated: ESS with supercapacitor (SC) and hybrid ESS (HESS) with SC and LFP battery. The investigated locations of energy storage systems are considered among existing traction substations in two railway lines with different density of train operation. The considered aims of energy storage system implementation are decreasing of energy consumption by maximum regenerative energy utilization and reduction of peak 15-min power demand of traction substation. The paper presents a method of regenerative power estimation depending on the location of the considered ESS implementation point. Also the method of optimal location selection of ESS in terms of minimization of Simple Payback Time (SPBT) of investment is presented. Besides the influence of initial cost value as well as energy price on the SPBT value are investigated. The results are compared between two railway lines with different number of trains operating.
