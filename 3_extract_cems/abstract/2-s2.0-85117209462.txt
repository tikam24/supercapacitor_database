A simple and fast method for preparing MXene hydrogels is proposed by introducing protonated thionine molecules into a MXene dispersion through electrostatic interaction. Such a 3D hydrogel effectively suppressed restacking and oxidation, and enlarged the surface utilization of the MXene, producing an improved specific capacitance of 163 F g−1at 1 A g−1and excellent stability when used as an electrode material for supercapacitors.
