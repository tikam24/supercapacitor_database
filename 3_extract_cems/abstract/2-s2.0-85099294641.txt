Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are evolving as emerging materials for application in supercapacitors on account of their inherent porous characteristics, which can be suitably controlled with molecular engineering. This allows suitable attributes to MOFs such as multiple dimensionalities, high surface area and additional aspect ratio compared to traditional materials. Secondary building units (SBUs) are the milestones that allow immense structural diversity, thermodynamic stability, and mechanical/architectural stability to demonstrate materials on-demand with predetermined topologies in the synthesis of MOFs through stronger bonding between the constituent metals and organic linkers. Despite these advancements, the usage of pristine MOFs is lagging in the area of supercapacitor, majorly due to their insulating nature. As smart avenues, hybridization of MOFs or using MOFs as templates for deriving metal oxide, carbon or hydroxides etc., are being proved as hugely successful. This review is directed towards the utilization of MOFs, specifically three-dimensional MOFs as a platform for utilization in supercapacitor. Extensive discussion is developed on divergent methods related to the synthesis of MOFs, their performance in supercapacitor application and various strategies adopted to enhance their functionality. Finally, the future prospective and possible research proceedings in this field are described briefly.
