A micro-ring space-time control circuit is proposed for micro-supercapacitor application. The center micro-ring circuit consists of sandwiched titanium dioxide (TiO2) thin film. The input light fed into the circuit via the input port is of 1.55 µm wavelength. The input space source is multiplexed with time at the add port to form the space-time function. A whispering-gallery mode is formed using suitable parameters, which results from the nonlinearity effect induced by the small rings at the sides of the center micro-ring. The light that excites the gold metal surface leads to electron cloud oscillations that form the electron density, which can be transported via wireless connection by employing the whispering-gallery mode or via cable connection. Areal specific capacitance of 0.4 F cm−2 and areal power density of 0.31 MW cm−2 are obtained. In application, the micro-ring circuit can be employed in microsystems that require high specific capacitance and high power for their operations.
