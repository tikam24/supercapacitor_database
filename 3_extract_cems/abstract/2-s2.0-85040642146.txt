Aqueous electrochemical energy storages are of enormous attention due to their high safety and being environmentally friendly, but they must satisfy very challenging standards in energy and power densities over long repeated charging/discharging cycles. Herein, a strategy to realize high-performance aqueous hybrid capacitors (AHCs) using pseudocapacitive negative and positive electrodes is reported. Polymer chains, which are synthesized by in situ polymerization of polyaniline on reduced graphene sheets, show fiber-like morphologies and the redox-reactive surface area allowing high capacitance as anode materials even at a high current density of 20 A g−1 and a high loading of ≈6 mg cm−2. Additionally, subnanoscale metal oxide particles on graphene are utilized as pseudocapacitive cathode materials and they show the approximately threefold higher capacitance than nanocrystals of ≈10 nm. Assembling these polymer chain anode and subnanoscale metal oxide cathode in full-cell AHCs is shown to give the high energy density exceeding those of aqueous batteries along with the ≈100% capacity retention over 100 000 redox cycles. Additionally, AHCs exhibit the high power density allowing ultrafast charging, so that the switching wearable display kit with two AHCs in series can be charged within several seconds by the flexible photovoltaic module and USB switching charger.
