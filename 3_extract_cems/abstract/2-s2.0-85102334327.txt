This research is devoted to the possibilities of using lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries operation in engine cold start systems. Down-scale test specimen of LiC6-LiNiMnCo (NMC) and LiC6-LiFePO4 batteries coupled with supercapacitor module were tested in cold cranking mode. The charge currents between Li-ion battery and supercapacitor module are experimentally determined. The actual operating temperatures ranges of such batteries are determined in relation to local climate condition and compared with single lead-Acid (Pb-Acid) battery. The test results showed that significant limitations exist for current value both for Pb-Acid and Li-ion battery. Coupling of supercapacitor module with Li-ion battery slightly improves the situation, but does not guarantee reliable three attempts for engine cold cranking.
