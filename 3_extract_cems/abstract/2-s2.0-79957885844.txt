This work deals with a control strategy and power management of a hybrid power source used as Distributed Generator (DG) system. The system includes a proton exchange membrane fuel cell 'PEMFC' which is used as a main source and equipped by a storage system "Supercapacitor" which ensures the continuity of the energy production. The source is connected to the power electrical system (PES) through a DC/DC converter, a continuous bus and an inverter. The most important purpose of this work is the participation to ancillary services of the (PES) by controlling frequency and voltage variation. The transient response of the power hybrid unit, frequency and voltage following load fluctuations with and without regulation were presented and commented. Â© 2011 IEEE.
