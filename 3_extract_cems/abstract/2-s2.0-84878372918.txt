In this work a self-assembly technique is presented, allowing the fast formation of carbon black thin films. It consists in the controlled addition of a stable carbon material's dispersion over the water surface, disturbed by a vortex. The vortex, although not essential for the film formation, was found to drastically improve film homogeneity. A physical chemical study concerning how several parameters could be used to tune film properties was also conducted. The self-assembled films, which can be picked up in any hydrophilic substrate, showed a good electrical conductivity and a high optical transparency. As an application example, films about 200 nm thick were employed as supercapacitor electrodes. Â© 2013 American Chemical Society.
