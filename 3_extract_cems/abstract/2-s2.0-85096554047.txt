The current information era has witnessed the fast development of flexible high-performance energy storage devices for portable and wearable smart electronics. Here, tough supercapacitor with high flexibility and tear resistance based on Ag-coated Tyvek/PEDOT:PSS/carbon nanotubes (Tyvek/Ag/PCNTs) composite electrodes has been well designed and fabricated for the first time via a facile and scalable method. In the supercapacitor, Ag-coated Tyvek substrate roles as the current collector through a polymer-assisted metal deposition method while the treatment of sulfuric acid on the electrode contributes to the removal of insulating PSS part and the increase of the crystallinity of the active materials. Due to the tough and flexible substrate and the increased conductivity of the electrodes, the supercapacitor exhibits excellent stability and rate capacity as well as brilliant mechanical strength and flexibility. The prepared supercapacitor can exhibit large specific mass capacitance (138.7 F/g) and specific volume capacitance (544.2 F/cm3) at the scan rate of 50 mV/s. As far as we can concern, the Tyvek/Ag/PCNTs-based supercapacitor owns higher energy density or power density than any other CNTs-based or PEDOT-related supercapacitors. In addition, after 1000 bending cycles, the capacitance of the supercapacitor can still reach to 91.2% of the initial value. This work will help to enlarge the study in the Tyvek-based supercapacitors for the flexible and tough energy storage devices.
