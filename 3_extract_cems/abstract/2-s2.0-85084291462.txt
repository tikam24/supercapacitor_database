Mo2C is one of the few compounds that possess good electronic conductivity. Meanwhile, it possesses a natural 1D zigzag tunnel structure that is ideally suited for fast ion diffusion. Here, an effective approach is demonstrated for fabrication of structurally stable N-doped Mo2C/C nanobelts. They demonstrate high and fast energy storage ability with initial capacitances of 1139 C g-1 at 1 mV s-1, 151 C g-1 at an extremely high scan rate of 2000 mV s-1 and 208 C g-1 at a discharge current density of 200 A g-1. After electrochemical activation of cycling, the capacity is continuously enhanced and much higher capacitances of 2523 C g-1 at 1 mV s-1 and 1403 C g-1 at 50 A g-1 are achieved after 15 000 cycles at 50 mV s-1. Using the power law, it is evaluated that a surface-controlled capacitive process makes the main contribution to the capacity, which is over 90% when the scan rates are higher than 10 mV s-1 and still high as 73% at 1 mV s-1. From in situ synchrotron XRD, it is found that there is a negligible change in the crystal structure and volume during charging/discharging, reflecting an insertion-type charge storage mechanism.
