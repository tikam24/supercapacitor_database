In order to moderate the usage of battery current and reduce the damages caused by the fast variations and peak power demand on batteries, a novel energy management strategy was developed for battery/ supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system (HESS) based on an online wavelet transform strategy. With the proposed energy management algorithm, the power demand is shared between the two energy sources according to their dynamic characteristics. The simulation is conducted using MATLAB/ Simulink software. Two test driving cycles have been experienced in this study to validate the proposed energy management strategy (EMS). The results show that the wavelet analysis can decompose the demand power in real-time, and can better increase system efficiency and battery lifetime.
