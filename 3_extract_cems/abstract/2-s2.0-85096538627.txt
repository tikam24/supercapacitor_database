The development of nanotechnology in recent decades has brought new opportunities in the exploration of new materials for solving the issues of fossil fuel consumption and environment pollution. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), as a typical class of anionic clays materials, display large potential in electrochemical energy storage and conversion due to the facile tunability of their composition, structure and morphology. Furthermore, nanoarray architecture design of LDHs, combining the excellent intrinsic physico-chemical properties of LDHs and structural advantages of nanoarrays, is emerging as a key strategy to fabricate high-performance electrochemical electrodes. This review summarizes the latest developments in the preparation and evaluation of LDH materials toward electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Furthermore, current challenges and future strategies are proposed from the viewpoint of material design and practical application of LDHs nanoarray electrodes.
