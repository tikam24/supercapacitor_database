Present work portrays surface morphology alteration of CuS thin film with increase in reaction bath temperature. The porous nanoflowers like morphology of CuS offers higher electron transfer and shorten ion diffusion pathway, which facilitates transfer of electrolyte ions. Nanoflowers like morphology of CuS electrode exhibits specific capacitance (Cs) of 1818.2 F g−1 at scan rate of 5 mV s−1 with electrochemical cycling stability of 92%. The symmetric FSS-SCs-PVA-LiClO4 device demonstrates Cs of 172.5 F g−1, specific power density of 1750 W kg−1 and capacity retention of 93% after 2000 CV cycles. More importantly, this device glows the panel of 200 red LEDs.
