We demonstrate the high performance of supercapacitors fabricated with vertically aligned carbon nanotubes and nonaqueous electrolytes such as ionic liquids and conventional organic electrolytes. Specific capacitance, maximum power and energy density of the supercapacitor measured in ionic liquid were 75Fg 1, 987kWkg 1 and 27Whkg 1, respectively. The high power performance was consistently indicated by a fast relaxation time constant of 0.2s. In addition, electrochemical oxidation of the carbon nanotubes improved the specific capacitance (158Fg 1) and energy density (53Whkg 1). Both high power and energy density could be attributed to the fast ion transport realized by the alignment of carbon nanotubes and the wide operational voltage defined by the ionic liquid. The demonstrated carbon-nanotube-and nonaqueous-electrolyte-based supercapacitors show great potential for the development of high-performance energy storage devices. Â© 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.
