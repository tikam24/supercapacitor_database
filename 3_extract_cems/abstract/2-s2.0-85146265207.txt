Two kinds of CuO nanomaterials with different morphologies were grown directly on surface of nickel foam using electrochemical deposition technology, and their electrochemical properties were studied. The morphology of CuO at different deposition voltages (spherical and wheat spike) were observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that the deposition voltage is the main factor affecting the morphology of CuO. In addition, X-ray diffraction results showed that the prepared samples are CuO materials. The electrochemical properties of CuO nanostructures were studied by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. These test results showed that the specific capacitance of CuO nanomaterials was largely related to the morphology of the material. Compared with CuO nanospheres thin films, wheat spike CuO thin films had a more prominent specific capacitance. The wheat spike CuO array film has a specific capacitance of 120mF/cm2 at a current density of 1mA/cm2 in 1mol/L sodium sulfate electrolyte.
