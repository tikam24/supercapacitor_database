The chapter emphasizes flexible fiber shape electrodes for flexible supercapacitors. Supercapacitors have an incredible impact as marvelous electrochemical devices in energy storage systems. To meet the rapid consumer demand for wearable and portable devices a new class of energy devices employ flexible fibrous electrodes/supercapacitors FE/FSC. Fiber shaped flexible electrodes attained great attention for miniaturized micro scale devices and the modern textile industry. The 1D nano-hybrid structure includes wrapped, rolled, twist, coaxial and parallel fiber shape electrodes/super-capacitors. A detail discussion on pros and cons, limitations and future aspects are highlighted for future prospects.
