Supercapacitor electrodes comprising of conjugated conducting polymers (CPs) and metal oxides have become the focus of scientific research due to their high specific capacitance, low equivalent series resistance and high density with better cyclic stability. A 3D architecture is fabricated using polypyrrole and lead oxide as the building blocks by a facile, one pot chronoamperometry method to achieve a conductive additive free, binder free and scalable supercapacitor electrode. The superior electrochemical properties of the 3D PPy-PbO2 are due to its porous structure, high surface area and high electrical conductivity that endow rapid transportation of electrolyte ions and electrons throughout the electrode matrix. The synergistic effect between the components in a proper ratio improves the supercapacitor performance and material stability. The structure and electrochemical performance of the 3D composite are correlated. The high specific capacitance (330 Fg-1) and impressive cycling stability (>2000 cycles) estimated for PPy-PbO2 open up an opportunity to consider the 3D nanostructures as cutting edge materials for energy storage solutions.
