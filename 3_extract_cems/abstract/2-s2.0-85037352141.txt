In this work, graphene aerogel/carbon foam is prepared by in situ inducing graphene aerogels in the pores of carbon foam. This novel hierarchical porous structure possesses a higher specific surface area as the introduction of graphene aerogels in carbon foam increases the proportion of micropores thus making it a superior candidate as electrodes for supercapacitors. The characterization and comparison of various properties of carbon foam and graphene aerogels/carbon foam have been investigated systematically. The result shows that specific surface area is up to 682.8 m2/g compared with initial carbon foam which increased about 55%, and the pore distribution curve shows more pore volume at 0.3 nm for F-CF/GA. It is demonstrated that the introduction of graphene aerogels not only increases the specific surface area, but also improves the conductivity, thus resulting in the reduction of the internal resistance and the improvement of the electrochemical performance. Consequently, graphene aerogel/carbon foam shows an excellent specific capacitance of 193.1 F/g at 1 A/g which is 72% higher than that of carbon foam acted as electrodes for supercapacitors.
