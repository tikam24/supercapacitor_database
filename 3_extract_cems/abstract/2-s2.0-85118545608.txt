Utilizing Manganese Chloride tetra hydrate as a precursor, Pure and H2O2-assisted Mn3O4 were synthesized using a facile hydrothermal technique. The structural transformation was carried at room temperature by adding H2O2 to the precursor solution. The primary reactions of H2O2 in an alkaline medium, such as oxidative dissolution and moderate reducing activities are assists to modify the shape of the materials. The color of the mixture changes when H2O2 is added, and this is used to prove that the substance has undergone structural modification. It is directly visible through naked eyes. The crystal systems of the samples were analyzed through X-ray Diffraction. The surface morphology and an elemental composition of the samples were observed through scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive spectroscopy. Using Cyclic Voltammetry and Chronopotentiometry, the electrochemical characteristics of both samples were studied. In this chronopotentiometry analysis, H2O2 (Mn3O4) reveals an elevated specific capacitance of 1007 F/g at 0.1 A/g in 1 M aqueous Na2SO4 electrolyte. It has a potential window of 1.2 V, with a maximum energy density of 71 Wh/kg at a power density of 602 W/kg.
