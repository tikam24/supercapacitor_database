The fabrication of porous carbons plays an important role in improving electrochemical performance for supercapacitors. The fabrication of carbon microspheres with controlled porous structure and graphitization degree is still a challenge in synthetic methodology, since it is difficult to achieve both goals at the same time. Porous carbon microspheres with controlled porous structure and graphitization degree are realized here via a simple template-free method, using Ni-based salts and resorcinol-formaldehyde resin microspheres as raw materials. The amount and types of Ni-based salts as well as ethanolamine significantly affect the porous structure and graphitization degree for the carbon microspheres. The porous carbon microspheres prepared with 4.0 g of Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O and 0.25 mL of ethanolamine possess the surface area of 392.1 m2 g−1, the pore volume of 0.395 cm3 g−1 and the IG/ID ratio of 1.18. The as-synthesized porous carbon microspheres can serve as excellent candidates for electrode materials in supercapacitors to achieve excellent electrochemical behaviors. The as-prepared porous carbon microspheres exhibit a specific capacitance of 193.8F g−1 at 1 A g−1, good rate capability and long cycle life in a two-electrode system. The superior electrochemical performance can be attributed to both the unique hierarchical porous structure and high graphitization degree. The hierarchical porous structure can provide fine transportation pathways and a large number of adsorption sites for electrolyte ions, and high graphitization degree can ensure rapid electron transport.
