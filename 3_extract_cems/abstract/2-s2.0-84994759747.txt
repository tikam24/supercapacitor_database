We report a synthesis of three dimensional ZnCo2O4 nanowires (NWs)@MnO2 nanosheets (NSs) core-shell structures grown on carbon cloth (CC) by a facile and efficient two-step hydrothermal approach. This special core-shell structure contributes to a large electroactive surface area and superior electrochemical properties. The electrode made of CC@ZnCo2O4@MnO2 sample shows greatly improved electrochemical performances with an ultrahigh areal capacitance of 3.6 F cm−2 at a current density of 2 mA cm−2 and of 2.3 F cm−2 even at a current density of 100 mA cm−2. Moreover, the electrode also exhibits an excellent cycling stability by retaining 95.5% of its original state after 5000 cycles, rendering the 3D ZnCo2O4 NWs@MnO2 NSs core-shell structures a potential electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.
