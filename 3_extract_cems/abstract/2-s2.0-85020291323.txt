The mixed (manganese and vanadium) oxides (Î²-Mn3O4/V2O5) are prepared for supercapacitor electrode material by hydrothermal method. The prepared material was characterized by structural, morphological and electrochemical studies. The electrochemical behavior of the prepared electrode material was examined using a gel electrolyte in the potential window of 0 to +1.5 V. The maximum specific capacitance of 786 F g-1 was obtained from cyclic voltammetry at a scan rate of 2 mV s-1. The electrochemical results imply that it is suitable for supercapacitor applications.
