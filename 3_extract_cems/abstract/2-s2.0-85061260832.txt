A facile approach of in situ electrochemical oxidation has been utilized to modify carbons, including activated carbon, mesoporous few-layer carbon, graphite, carbon fiber, and carbon nanotube, which induces oxygen-containing functional groups on its surface and simultaneously enhances its wettability, contributing to the improvement of capacitance. By this approach, the capacitance of commercialized activated carbon is increased by 86% in an acidic electrolyte, reaching 320 F g -1 , of which more than 96% was maintained after 10 000 cyclic tests. The huge improvement stems from electrochemical redox reactions enabled by oxygen-associated groups, which do not adversely affect the porous structure and electrical conductivity. Such improvement will put carbon-based electrochemical capacitors into more practical application areas.
