This paper presents an adaptive power management and control for a self-reliant dc microgrid powered by photovoltaic (PV) array and fuel cell stack that is escorted with the supercapacitor- and electrolyzer-based hybrid energy storage device. The prime operational impediments associated with this dc microgrid are the unpredictable variations in the PV generation and load demand, fuel starvation phenomenon of the fuel cell, the time constant associated with the electrolyzer operation, and state-of-charge limitation of the supercapacitor. In this paper, the above-mentioned issues are addressed by employing an adaptive dynamic power management strategy (ADPMS) that supervises the overall power flow in the system. The ADPMS enables the co-existence of high power density and high energy density storage devices to deliver the power flow required by the loads. The expeditious support extended by the supercapacitor helps in swift regulation of the dc-link voltage during unforeseen transient load/source power variations. The electrolyzer-fuel cell combination employed in this system can supplement a battery bank and can equip high energy density and self-reliance to the system. The set-reset flip-flop based fixed frequency current controller is simple and effective in accurately tracking the reference currents established by the ADPMS. The proposed ADPMS along with the control is validated for transient unforeseen load profiles and renewable generation changes via simulation studies and its performance is also validated through an experimental analysis on a laboratory-scale dc microgrid testbed.
