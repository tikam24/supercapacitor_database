The increased needs for sustainable energy storage devices make it urgent to develop novel supercapacitor electrode materials. An ingenious zipper-like NiCo2O4/Ni(OH)2 composite has been successfully grown on nickel foam via a one-pot hydrothermal method free of any template or catalyst. Owing to its close contact with the substrate, its distinguished zipper-like structure and unique ingredients, the specific capacitance of NiCo2O4/Ni(OH)2 was as high as 2721 mF cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2; 2161 mF cm−2 was obtained even at 50 mA cm−2; and it retained 86% capacity after 10000 cycles. The facile synthesis method and remarkable capacitive performance of the zipper-like NiCo2O4/Ni(OH)2 make it attractive for supercapacitor applications.
