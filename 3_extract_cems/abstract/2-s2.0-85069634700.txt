As a kind of energy storage device, supercapacitors have attracted the attention of researchers, and the development of high-performance electrode materials is also the focus of attention. In this paper, template synthesis and pyrolysis were combined to prepare high performance porous carbon electrode materials. The carbonized electrode material effectively increased the capacitance storage capacity and charge transfer rate. The results revealed that the derivative had a relatively low charge-transfer resistance and high specific capacitance of 1059 F·g−1 at a current density of 1.0 A·g−1 in a three-electrode system. To further exploring practical application, a device based on the derivative and hemp-activated carbon asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled in 0.1 M Na2SO4 neutral electrolyte, which exhibited an energy density of 20.35 Wh·kg−1 at a power density of 400 W·kg−1. Interestingly, it showed capability retention of nearly of 91.7% and columbic efficiency of 100% even after 10000 charging/discharging cycles in the neutral electrolyte.
