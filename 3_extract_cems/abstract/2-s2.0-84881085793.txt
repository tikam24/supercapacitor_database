This work describes the first steps towards fabrication and characterization of a novel hybrid nanostructure comprised of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) grown out-of-plane and in between graphene layers for supercapacitor applications. The structure was characterized by Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. The results showed improved electrochemical performance for the graphene-CNT structure over the graphene structure. Forthcoming work includes electrochemical testing of a graphene-CNT-graphene architecture.
