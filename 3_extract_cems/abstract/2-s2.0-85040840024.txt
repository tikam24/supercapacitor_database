Ultrathin MnO2 decorated hierarchical urchin-like FeOOH hollow micro-nanospheres have been designed and synthesized through a facile hydrothermal route. The microspheres are made of FeOOH nanofibers with a diameter of 10 nm. Due to the synergetic effect between the unique FeOOH hollow micro/nanostructures and ultrathin MnO2 layer, the as-fabricated FeOOH@MnO2 hybrid electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 1192 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. It also reveals high rate capabilities and superior stability. Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) assembled from the FeOOH@MnO2 and the active carbon (AC) delivers a high energy density of 40.2 W h kg−1 at a power density of 0.78 kW kg−1, and the energy density could remain 10.4 W h kg−1 under a condition of high power density of 11.7 kW kg−1.
