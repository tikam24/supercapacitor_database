The paper investigates the efficiency of energy storage system applied for electric transport, taking into account the data about the degradation of the electrical parameters during the expected exploitation lifetime provided by the manufacturer. On the one hand, the purpose of using mobile energy storage system considered in the paper is only to accumulate the braking energy stating that it should not be remarkably voluminous; on the other hand, it is analyzed how much more capacious system to choose by considering that during its exploitation its capacity deteriorates.
