A simple two-step hydrothermal method is adopted to prepare a N/C@MnO2 hybrid electrode by anchoring manganese dioxide (MnO2) encapsulating carbon nanospheres (C) on nickel foam substrate (NF). The obtained N/C@MnO2 hybrid electrode possesses superior electrochemical performance due to the advances in outstanding electrical conductivity. The specific capacitance of the as-prepared electrode achieves 335.5 F/g at 1 A/g and retains 85.4% after 8500 cycles, endowing N/C@MnO2 with high specific capacitance and optimized cycle stability. Moreover, the preparation process of the hybrid electrode is convenient and low cost compared with other methods. Therefore, the N/C@MnO2 hybrid electrode with excellent advantages is a promising candidate for supercapacitors.
