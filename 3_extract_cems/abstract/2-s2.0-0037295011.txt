Integration into a conducting polymer matrix to form a hybrid material is an effective way to harness the electrochemical activity of nanosized oxide clusters. By anchoring them into polyaniline, the reversible redox chemistry of the otherwise soluble polyoxometalate clusters can be combined with that of the conducting polymer and be put to work in energy storage applications. We present here preliminary results that show how the resulting hybrid polymer displays the combined activity of its organic and inorganic components to store and release charge in a solid state electrochemical capacitor device.
