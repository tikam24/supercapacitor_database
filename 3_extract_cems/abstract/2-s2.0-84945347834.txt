This paper discusses the control strategy for energy management in railway transit network with wayside (substation) supercapacitor (SC) energy storage system (ESS). Firstly, the structure of the wayside energy storage system is introduced. Secondly, the model of energy storage system is built and the control strategy is described. Thirdly, in order to estimate the required energy storage system, a useful method is proposed to predict the instantaneous regenerative energy magnitude which is delivered to each substation. Finally, the ESS configuration for each substation is determined. A simplified mathematical model of the whole metro network is established and the main features of the control strategy are developed. Numerical simulations show the efficacy of suggested control strategy and the energy saving obtained for railway transit network.
