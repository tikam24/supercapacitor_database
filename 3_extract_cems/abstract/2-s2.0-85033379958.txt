Graphene/CNTs/35% PEDOT:PSS@CMC (GCP-35@CMC) ternary coaxial fibers were continuously prepared through coaxial wet-spinning technology. The GCP-35@CMC-assembled flexible fiber-shaped supercapacitors (FSCs) exhibited an advanced area specific capacitance (396.7 mF cm-2 at 0.1 mA cm-2) and energy density (13.8 Î¼W h cm-2). This performance was ascribed to the synergistic effect of the well-designed ternary system and its special microstructures.
