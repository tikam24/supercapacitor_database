Two-dimensional titanium carbide (MXene) has attracted a wide attention for its fast charging and discharging ability as an electrode for supercapacitors. Tremendous efforts have been dedicated to further optimize the electrochemical performance of MXene by adjusting the interlayer spacing and surface functional groups. Here, hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) molecules are used as an intercalation agent to enlarge the layer spacing of MXene nanosheets and regulate their electronic structure by the partial replacement of the surface functional groups (–F, –O and –OH) with N elements via the carbonization temperature at 300 °C. The as-prepared N-doped MXene film exhibits the excellent flexibility, appropriate layer spacing and high electrical conductivity, which can be used directly as supercapacitor electrode materials. It delivers the excellent rate performance with a specific capacitance of 193 F g−1 at 2000 mV s−1. In addition, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor with N-doped graphene aerogel, delivers a high energy density of 26.22 W h kg−1 at a power density of 899 W kg−1, and the capacitance retention of 92.1 % after 25,000 discharging/charging cycles, indicating the excellent application prospect.
