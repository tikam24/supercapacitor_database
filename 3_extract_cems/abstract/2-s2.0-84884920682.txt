We have investigated the properties of N-doped graphite with density functional theory. Doping enhances significantly the electronic density of states near the Fermi level, and improves the screening of an external electric field. As a consequence, the capacity of an N-doped graphite electrode in contact with an electrolyte solution is much greater than that of pure graphite. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.
