Hollow Ni–Co layered double hydroxide (LDH) was synthesized with rhombic dodecahedral zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) as self-sacrificed template and cobalt precursor. Water was found to be very important role on the formation of Ni–Co LDH hollow microstructure. As a supercapacitor electrode material, the obtained hollow Ni–Co LDH delivered a high specific capacitance of 1530 F g−1 at the current density of 1.0 A g−1 and good cycle performance, which can be ascribed to its hollow mesoporous structure composed of the Ni–Co LDH nanosheets and high specific surface area. Combined with the AC negative electrodes, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitors performed an energy density of 27.5 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 375 W kg−1.
