Ordered nanostructured cobalt-doped nickel oxide films were prepared on a conducting glass substrate via the sol-gel dip-coating method. X-ray diffraction analysis shows the films to be amorphous. Field-emission scanning electron microscope images showed well-defined, ordered grains with pores in between them. Supercapacitor behaviour was studied using cyclic voltammetry. A maximum specific capacitance of 1982F/g at a scan rate of 5mV/s with 1M KOH was obtained for 5wt% of cobalt-doped nickel oxide films. AC impedance analysis showed that the solution resistance was R s=27 and the charge transfer resistance R ct=20. Â© 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.
