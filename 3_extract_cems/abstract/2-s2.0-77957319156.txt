We introduced a facile method to construct hierarchical nanocomposites by combining one-dimensional (1D) conducting polyaniline (PANI) nanowires with 2D graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets. PANI nanowire arrays are aligned vertically on GO substrate. The morphologies of PANI nanowires can be controlled by adjusting the ratios of aniline to GO, which are attributed to different nucleation processes. The hierarchical nanocomposite structures of PANI-GO were further proved by UV-vis, FTIR, and XRD measurements. The hierarchical nanocomposite possessed higher electrochemical capacitance and better stability than each individual component as supercapacitor electrode materials, showing a synergistic effect of PANI and GO. This study will further guide the preparation of functional nanocomposites by combining different dimensional nanomaterials. Â© 2010 American Chemical Society.
