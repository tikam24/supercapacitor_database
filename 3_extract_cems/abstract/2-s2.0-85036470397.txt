NiO nanosheets were anchored at honeycomb amorphous porous carbon with ultrahigh surface area derived from activated wheat husk to obtain NiO@PC (porous carbon). The ultrahigh surface area of PC (634.4 m2 g−1) promoted the attachment of NiO nanosheets, and this hierarchical nanostructure (NiO@PC) was beneficial for facilitating electron and electrolyte ion transport and accelerating the reversible redox reaction, which successfully demonstrated its high energy storage properties as supercapacitor. The NiO@PC composite exhibited brilliant capacitance of 500 F g−1 at 10 A g−1 after 8000 cycles. Moreover, as symmetric supercapacitor, NiO@PC exhibited high specific capacitance of 76 mF cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2. The excellent electrochemistry performance of NiO@PC brings the possibility of using biomass waste as electrode materials for energy storage. This process is facile and environmental friendly.
