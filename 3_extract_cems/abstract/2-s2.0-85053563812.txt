A 400-μm-thick free-standing and flexible cellulose/RGO/AgNPs composite film was fabricated by chemical reduction of cellulose/GO/AgNPs film with hot hydrazine vapor, which was obtained via the reaction of GO with silver–ammonia complex in the presence of cellulose fibers, followed by dewatering with assistance of filtration. The 400-μm-thick cellulose/RGO/AgNPs film was systematically characterized and found to be conductive enough with sheet resistance of merely 0.17 Ω sq−1 for direct use as electrode. When measured in a three-electrode setup, such flexible electrode exhibited outstanding supercapacitive performances with the highest areal specific capacitance of 1242.7 mF cm−2 (corresponding to 31.1 F cm−3), excellent rate capability and remarkable cycling stability with the capacitance retention of 99.6% after extensive charge/discharge at a high current density of 60 mA cm−2 for more than 10,000 cycles. Furthermore, a symmetric flexible all-solid-state supercapacitor cell of cellulose/RGO/AgNPs//cellulose/RGO/AgNPs was assembled. It delivered the maximum areal specific capacitance of 683.8 mF cm−2 (corresponding to 8.6 F cm−3), possessed desirable rate capability, showed no substantial variation of supercapacitive behavior when being bent, and offered the highest areal energy density of 95.0 μWh cm−2 (corresponding to 1.19 mWh cm−3), which outperformed that of many existing graphene-based symmetric flexible supercapacitors and lots of asymmetric flexible supercapacitors. The impressive electrochemical properties and facile preparation process of cellulose/RGO/AgNPs film make it a promising candidate for constructing next-generation high-performance flexible energy storage devices.
