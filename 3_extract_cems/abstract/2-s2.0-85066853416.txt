A crosslinked membrane based on renewable, degradable and environmentally friendly soybean protein isolate was formed by solution casting method. A series of gel polymer electrolytes were prepared with the crosslinked membranes saturated with 1 mol路L-1 Li2SO4. The solid-state electric double-layer capacitors were fabricated with the prepared gel polymer electrolytes and activated carbon electrodes. The optimized solid-state supercapacitor delivered a single electrode specific capacitance of 115.17 F路g-1 at a current density of 1.0 A路g-1, which was higher than the supercapacitor assembled with the commercial separator in 1 mol路L-1 Li2SO4. The solid-state supercapacitor exhibited an outstanding cycling stability, indicating that the gel polymer electrolyte based on the crosslinked soybean protein isolate membrane could be a promising separator for a solid-state supercapacitor.
