The arrays of nanorods decorated with nanosphere blended by hydrothermal route were reported. The high surface area and open geometry sandwiched between nanorods let easier for electrolyte diffusion and hence affords more electroactive sites. The surface and structural properties were consequently defined by standard characterization analysis. To review the properties of binary composite nanorods designed for supercapacitor application, it scanned experimentally through standard electrochemical analysis. While increasing stoichiometric molar ratio of the active electrode, the specific capacitance increased obviously is depicted as 1:1 (200 Fg−1), 2:1 (281 Fg−1) and 3:1 (509 Fg−1) and the composite electrode retains 99.82% of retention over 2000 cycles. Besides, as an asymmetric device with improved energy density was build up effectively by CMS-3 nanorod as positive and activated carbon as negative electrode and achieved 113 WhKg−1 energy density at 1 Ag−1 with 98.1% stability in 2000 cycles. The practical demonstration of asymmetric device has been tested and simply energizes the red light-emitting diode (LED). As per the above discussion, the improved activity of CuSe2@MoSe2 was because of Cu and Mo inclusion with selenium further progress its conductivity, well-retained surface morphology and high reversibility. Consequently, the good contact between them ensured the smooth transportation of electrons without any obstacles. Hence, the synergetic effect affords the way for immense development of the binary composite for hopeful future.
