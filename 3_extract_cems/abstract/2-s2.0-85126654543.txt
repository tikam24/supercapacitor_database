MOF materials offer highly eye-catching performance in supercapacitor applications, but the traditional ligands are relatively crude and limited in diversity, which fails to realize the full potential of MOFs. In order to probe the electrochemical possibilities of MOFs, we synthesize MOF materials based on N-containing melamine (MA) ligand and S-containing 2,5-thiophene dicarboxylic acid (TDA) ligand, and use a bimetal strategy to optimize materials properties. It is observed that the crystallinity and morphology of the materials have greatly improved after partially replacing the DMF with MeOH in the solvothermal reaction. The obtained Zn1Ni3-M electrode delivers a specific capacitance of 466.5 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. Moreover, the assembled Zn1Ni3-M//activated carbon asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) realizes a specific energy density of 9.55 Wh kg−1 and an excellent power density of 3600.0 W kg−1. It is demonstrated that the prepared Zn1Ni3-M bimetallic MOF has considerable potential as ultrafast electrode material for supercapacitors.
