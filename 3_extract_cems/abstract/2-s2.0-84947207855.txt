In this paper authors present a method for optimal sizing of supercapacitor (SC) energy storage system (ESS) for braking energy recovery in tram network. The method is applicable for segmented tram networks with radial feeding topology and a stationary storage system installed in traction substation. The method is demonstrated for one traction substation of Riga public transport network.
