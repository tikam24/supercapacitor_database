PEDOT nanotubes were chemically synthesized using a hexane/water reverse microemulsion polymerization and deposited onto ITO substrate. FTIR polarized specular reflectance spectra are consistent with AOT molecules organized inside the PEDOT nanotubes. The electrochemical properties of PEDOT nanotubes were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in comparison with PEDOT:PSS modified electrodes. The results indicates an increase in the capacitance and a decrease in the charge transfer resistance for the PEDOT nanotubes in comparison with PEDOT:PSS films due to the higher exposure of the electroactive sites in the nanostructured material. Galvanostatic charge/discharge curves were performed and a maximum specific capacitance of 160 F·g−1 was revealed, indicating that this material has potential to be used in supercapacitors development.
