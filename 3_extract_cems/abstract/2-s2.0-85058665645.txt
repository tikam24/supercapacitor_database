CoAl-LDH nanosheet electrode material with better dispersity and uniformity in size (about 2 Î¼m) is prepared by a facile coprecipitation method. The result of electrochemical measurements in three-electrode configuration shows that the CoAl-LDH nanosheet electrode exhibits the specific capacitance of 723 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g, and the capacitance retention rate up to 72% when the current density increases to 20 A/g. The CoAl-LDH nanosheet electrode material is expected to be the optional electrode material of high performance supercapacitor.
