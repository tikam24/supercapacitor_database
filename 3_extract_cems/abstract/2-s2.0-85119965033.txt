To obtain excellent performance materials of supercapacitor, on carbon cloth substrate cobalt nitrides with carbon-nitride structure modified (CC@Co2N@CN) materials were fabricated by simple electrochemical deposition and annealing method. As-prepared carbon-nitride structure on cobalt nitrides not only improves the capacitance of whole electrode, but also relives the oxidation of cobalt nitrides, thus enhancing conductivity of the whole device. Besides, CC@Co2N@CN capacitance remains 77% of its initial value after 10 000 cycles, revealing remarkable span life. What is more, the areal capacitance of electrode can reach 429.4 mF•cm-2 at the current density of 1 mA•cm-2. With large areal capacitance and remarkable cycle stability performance, carbon cloth based cobalt nitride with carbon-nitride structure modified supercapacitors will have widespread application prospect in energy storage fields.
