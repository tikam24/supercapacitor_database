Polypyrrole is one of conductive polymers with the best conductive stability. Because of its simple preparation, environmental friendliness, high conductivity, high conductivity and unique doping, the preparation of polypyrrole composites in order to improve the stability is becoming a hot spot in the research field of conductive polymer-based supercapacitors electrode materials. Polypyrrole electrode materials and binary, ternary composite electrode materials with the carbon materials or metal oxide materials used in the research development of supercapacitors in recent years are reviewed. The charge storage mechanism, polypyrrole polymerization mechanism and preparation methods are introduced. Meanwhile, this paper prospected the current hot research fields and development prospect of the polypyrrole and its composite electrode materials.
