MnO2 particles in the size less than 200 nm were prepared via the oxidation of MnSO4 using KMnO4 as oxidizer. The printing 'ink' was prepared by mixing MnO2 particles with acetylene black, dispersion additive Lomar-D, ethanolamine, binder CMCS and distilled water in the mass ratio of 200:40:4:1:1:4000, and dispersing under ultrasonic. The ultra thin MnO2 film electrodes were prepared by means of computer jet printing technique using this 'ink'.The SEM images showed that the surface of the ultra thin MnO2 film electrode was uniform, and its thickness was about 2.5 μm. In 1 mol· L-1 Li2SO4 solution the electrodes present typical electrochemical supercapacitance behavior observed by voltammetry and charge-discharge measurements, in the potential region of 0-0.85 V(vs SCE). Its specific capacitance reached to 154 F· g-1 at the discharge current of 9.4 A· g-1, and remained almost no change after 2000 cycles. © Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.
