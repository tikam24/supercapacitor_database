A simple strategy is proposed for the development of silver (Ag) incorporated Poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly (styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) electrodes for electrochemical supercapacitors. To examine the effects of the Ag on the specific capacitance and energy density of PEDOT:PSS, its concentration was varied from 0.3 to 1.5 wt.% Ag. Surface morphology of the films is examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy, which revealed the smooth surface for PEDOT:PSS and existence of small Ag bright spots onto the smooth surface of PEDOT:PSS for the Ag-PEDOT:PSS. The electrochemical activity of PEDOT:PSS was enhanced after its interaction with Ag. An electrode with 0.9 wt.% Ag in PEDOT:PSS showed superior specific capacitance (172 Fg−1) and energy density (36.11 WhKg−1) due to the synergistic effect of both Ag and PEDOT:PSS. These results were extensively examined using different characterization tools. This study will provide a new avenue for designing low cost and excellent electrochemical performance electrode based on Ag-PEDOT:PSS for better supercapacitors.
