In this paper a state feedback control strategy for supercapacitors used in energy storage systems of railway vehicles is proposed. The control goal consists of guaranteing good performance in transient and steady state operating conditions, also in the presence of line voltage and motor current variations. Numerical results on a realistic example show the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy, also for missing line contact scenarios. Â© 2014 IEEE.
