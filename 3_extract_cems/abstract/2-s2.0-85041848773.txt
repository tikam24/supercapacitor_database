Here, we have demonstrated a straight forward and easy synthetic route for preparation of three dimensional hierarchical and porous polyaniline (PANI)/manganese dioxide (MnO2)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) ternary hybrid nanomaterials with surface decorated by ordered PANI whiskers. The nanostructured material shows different well defined morphology like tubular fiber, sphere which resembles natural tubular wiregrass sedge and spherical cactus. The simple removal of graphene surface modifier through selective dissolution from nanohybrids results further porous structure. The ternary hybrid materials show varying capacitance values depending on composition and nanostructured morphology with the best capacitance value of 762 F/g at current density 1.4 A/g with good electrochemical stability.
