The fabrication, and characterization of SnO2@Co3O4/NGO composite with a nanogranular-like morphology was synthesized by a thermal reduction process in presence of ammonia and urea as catalyst. The structure and morphology of the composite were investigated by sophisticated techniques. Cyclic voltammetry was performed to determine the electrochemical performance of the composite electrode for supercapacitor applications. The composite symmetrical electrode was displayed a specific capacitance of ∼375 F g−1 at 0.5 A/g in a 2 M KOH aqueous electrolyte with a capacity retention of ∼93% after 10,000 cycles. The SnO2@Co3O4/NGO composite asymmetric electrode exhibited a specific capacitance of∼256 F/g at 1 A/g and excellent cyclic retention. The improved electrochemical properties of the composite depends on the nanogranular-like morphology, large surface properties, and excellent conductive networks. Therefore, the ternary oxide@NGO composite electrode is promising architecture for energy storage applications.
