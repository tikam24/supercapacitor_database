Fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) has recently attracted increasing research interest. This paper investigates the performances of MPPT-FC generators supplying electric vehicle power train through an interleaved boost DC/DC converter (IBC). The accent is made on forcing the FC generator to operate at its maximum power point by using perturb and observe (P&O) algorithm integrated to the IBC control. However, the MPPT-FC control creates rapid changes in the power output from the fuel cell, which cause serious life shortening, severe cell degradation, and decrease the system efficiency. To overcome these shortcomings, the control of air generation system was designed to improve the power quality and to prevent fuel starvation phenomenon during rapid power transitions. The work involves the modeling and the simulation of the fuel cell power train in the vehicular application using the experimental data obtained in previous works. The experimental part of the proposed FCEV is based on a low-cost, low-power consumption microcontroller, which controls the IBC and performs the MPPT-FC operation. A microcontroller is used to measure the FC output power and to change the duty ratio of the IBC control signals. Â© 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
