The pore structure and electrochemical performance of mesoporous carbons prepared by the ZnCl2 chemical activation method as an electrode material for a supercapacitor were investigated in this work. It is found that the impregnation ratio exerts significant effect on the pore structure of the carbons, and mesoporous carbon can be obtained at a higher impregnation ratio. The cyclability of the supercapacitor is greatly improved after the carbon (electrode material) was treated at a higher temperature by using the "two-stage sintering" process. The "grouped linear fitting method" has been proposed to obtain the effective surface area and surface-specific capacitance of the carbons. The minimum pore size that can form an electric double layer is confirmed to be 2.0 nm for the porous carbon in 1 M Et4 NBF4 ∫propylene carbonate electrolyte. Porous carbon with an abundant mesopore is featured with good rate capability. © 2008 The Electrochemical Society.
