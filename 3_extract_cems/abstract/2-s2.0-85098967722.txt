Due to unique properties, ease of synthesis and functionalization, graphene-based nanocomposites show great potential in energy storage and conversion. These hybrid materials have excellent characteristics like high carrier mobility, faster recombination rate and long-time stability. In this review, the recent progresses in the synthesis and applications of graphene and its composites in the fields of energy storage (supercapacitors) and conversion (Solar cells) are summarized. This article highlights the challenges of the practical applications of graphene-based materials in supercapacitors and solar cells. Future research to develop new methodologies for the design and the synthesis of graphene-based nanocomposite are also proposed.
