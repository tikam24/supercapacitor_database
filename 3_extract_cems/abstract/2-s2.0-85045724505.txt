In the present study, we report synthesis of NiO nanoparticles by varying the reagent ratio of nickel nitrate and ammonium bicarbonate using solvent deficient approach. The synthesis process involves the solid state grinding reaction of nickel nitrate and different mole ratio of ammonium bicarbonate varying from 0.5 to 4, to obtain the precursor followed by rinsing and annealing at 300Â°C for 2 h. The XRD and FTIR analysis is carried to confirm the formation of NiO nanoparticles. The XRD analysis confirms the cubic structure of NiO. The peaks observed in FTIR confirms the presence of Ni - O vibration mode. The FESEM images shows the particle size is larger for lower content of ammonium bicarbonate and decreases with increase in amount of bicarbonate added. Electrochemical performance clearly indicates the specific capacitance increases from 0.5 to 2 and further decreases with increase in the ammonium bicarbonate. The maximum achieved specific capacitance is 1218 Fg-1 for the reagent ratio 2 of ammonium bicarbonate.
