Nowadays, the integration of energy storage micro-devices has attracted more and more attention. The integration of planar on-chip micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) not only supplies a higher voltage output, but also meets the requirements of different devices for output voltage by adjusting the number of integrated MSCs. Here, we show an integrated all-solid-state planar on-chip MSC, which based on reduced graphene oxide film with photolithography technology. This series of MSCs can support 2 V output voltage. In addition, it also possessed better electrochemical performance, and its area capacitance, stack capacitance, energy density, and power density had reached 9.48 μF cm−2, 7.90 F cm−3, 1.10 mWh cm−3 and 12.7 W cm−3 at an output voltage of 2 V. Meanwhile, it had a better cycle stability. After 10,000 cycles, 98.5% of the capacitor could be retained. If such a planar on-chip MSC is highly integrated, its electrochemical properties will be greatly improved, which will greatly promote the development of MSCs.
