The successful synthesis of ternary PPy/PB/RuO2 nanocomposite through oxidative polymerization assisted chemical method and its fabrication as an active electrode material for supercapacitors is reported. The FT-IR and XRD studies revealed the molecular structure and the phase composition of the as-prepared nanomaterials; wherein the average crystallite size of PPy/PB/RuO2 was found to be 10 nm. The uniformly distributed porous structure observed in the micrograph of PPy/PB/RuO2 showed the effective interconnection of well-dispersed nanoparticles. TGA revealed the high thermal stability of PPy/PB/RuO2 due to the packing arrangement of RuO2. The electrochemical activity of PPy/PB/RuO2 electrode was explored in alkaline (1 M KOH), acidic (1 M H2SO4) and neutral (1 M Na2SO4) media using three-electrode configuration mode. Due to the enhanced specific capacitance (625.13 Fg−1) of PPy/PB/RuO2 in Na2SO4 electrolyte, CV studies of PPy, PB and RuO2 electrodes were also carried out in Na2SO4 aqueous media to understand the charge storage mechanism in individual components. From GCD, the ternary electrode exhibited longest charge/discharge time with high specific capacitance value (504.90 Fg−1) at 5 Ag−1. The low charge transfer resistance and 92% of its capacitive retention after 5000 cycles indicated that PPy/PB/RuO2 could be a reliable candidate for supercapacitive electrode material.
