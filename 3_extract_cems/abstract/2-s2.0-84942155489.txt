Nanowire of nickel molybdate hydrate, being recognized as an emerging supercapacitor material, was synthesized from the intercrystal self-assembly process (commonly referred to as oriented aggregation or attachment). The detailed lattice image of a NiMoO<inf>4</inf>·0.75H<inf>2</inf>O nanowire and the intermediate nanostructure before reaching the interplanar binding were successfully captured by means of high-resolution transmission and scanning electron microscopies. NiMoO<inf>4</inf>·0.75H<inf>2</inf>O possessed highly crystalline surface and internal nanostructures.
