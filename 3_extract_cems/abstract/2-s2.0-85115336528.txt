Electrochemical supercapacitors are prominent energy storage devices owing to their superior capacitive behaviour and matchless power and energy density with excellent cyclic stability. In this report, we have prepared the rod shape WO3/V2O5 nanocomposite by the microwave-assisted method. XRD analysis confirmed the rhombohedral and orthorhombic phase structure of V2O5 and WO3. Various functional groups associated with V2O5 and WO3 compounds were studied by FTIR spectrum. Surface and morphological image analysis demonstrated rod shape morphology. Surface area (22.798 m2/g), pore volume (0.137 cc/g) and particle size (18 nm) were analyzed by BET analysis. The pure V2O5 nanostructure exhibited maximum specific capacitance of 150F/g in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte which was enhanced to 260, 265 and 386F/g respectively for various wt.% of WO3 added V2O5 nanocomposites. The long cyclic test showed 104 % of capacitance retention over 5,000 cycles with 99 % columbic efficiency.
