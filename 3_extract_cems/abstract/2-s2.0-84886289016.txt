This essay describes the findings of generating the electrode composite of polyaniline/activated carbon fiber (PANI/ACF) by repeatedly immersing eigenstate PANI into the solution of NMP and CHCl3 added with VC. A sample's surface profile and structure were represented using SEM and FT-IR. Thereafter the composite was assembled into a super capacitor, electrochemical performances of which were then tested through cyclic voltammetry (CV). The result showed that the specific capacitance of this composite is up to 531.75F/g in the solution of 6 mol L-1 KOH. Â© (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
