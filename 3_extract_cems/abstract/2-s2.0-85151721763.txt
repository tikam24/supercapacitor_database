The advancement of clean, renewable energy materials and their devices, propelled by environmental issues and energy crises, is required immediately. Due to various functionalized structure and exceptional physical properties graphene materials demonstrate enormous potential for supercapacitors to achieve high surface area and high specific efficiency. Graphene would be a promising candidate for alternative energy storage appliances with PANI-based power storage devices like supercapacitors due to their high power density, excellent cycle life and low maintenance costs. This chapter summarizes the composites derived from various functionalized form of graphene and PANI as electrodes for supercapacitors.
