Graphene is an arrangement of graphite atoms tucked in a single layer and a promising wonderful material for various applications. It has amazing capabilities in terms of conductivity, robustness, thermal conductivity, great electron mobility etc. It is a strong material yet lightweight and flexible. This 2D material is million times smaller than human hair. It is showing numerous advantages over conventional material silicon and a potential replacement. Its extraordinary properties have been explored which are consequently useful in fuel-cells, super-capacitors, transportation, defense, medicine, energy, photovoltaic devices and many more. This paper reflects the properties of this wonderful material followed by the applications in different domains of life. The primary focus is the extensive exploration of graphene applications in electronics. The focus of this review is on electronic applications of graphene and its derivatives in numerous arenas like fuel cells, supercapacitors, batteries, photovoltaic devices, photonic devices etc. and how graphene made these already in use appliances more efficient and improve research in this direction.
