The carbon nanofiber composite containing Cu and MnO was fabricated by electrospinning method. The precursor solution was prepared by mixing Cupric Acetate Monohydrate, Manganous acetate, N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and polyacrylonitrile in a certain proportion. Then the material of Cu-MnO/CNF with higher capacitance was prepared by electrostatic spinning at 15 kV and high temperature heat treatment. The Cu-MnO/CNF was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-Ray diffraction (XRD). It's clear from the results that, carbon nanofiber had overlaped by metal oxides and metals, at the same time, the Cu(OAc)2 was converted to Cu and the MnACAC was turned into MnO after thermal treatment. Through a series of electrochemical tests, it showed the Cu-MnO/CNF has excellent electrochemical performance and indicated its potential advantages for supercapacitors. The results indicated the specific capacitance of the Cu-MnO/CNF displayed a larger specific capacitance of 581 F/g than the electrical capacity of Cu-CuO/CNF and MnO-Mn(OH)2/CNF.
