MnCo2O4 is regarded as a good electrode material for supercapacitor due to its high specific capacity and good structural stability. However, its poor electrical conductivity limits its wide-range applications. To solve this issue, we integrated the MnCo2O4 with Ni3S4, which has a good electrical conductivity, and synthesized a MnCo2O4/Ni3S4 nanocomposite using a two-step hydrothermal process. Comparing with individual MnCo2O4 and Ni3S4, the MnCo2O4/Ni3S4 nanocomposite showed a higher specific capacity and a better cycling stability as the electrode for the supercapacitor. The specific capacity value of the MnCo2O4/Ni3S4 electrode was 904.7 C g−1 at 1 A g−1 with a potential window of 0–0.55 V. A hybrid supercapacitor (HSC), assembled using MnCo2O4/Ni3S4 and active carbon as the cathode and anode, respectively, showed a capacitance of 116.4 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, and a high energy density of 50.7 Wh kg−1 at 405.8 W kg−1. Long-term electrochemical stability tests showed an obvious increase of the HSC's capacitance after 5500 charge/discharge cycles, reached a maximum value of ∼162.7% of its initial value after 25,000 cycles, and then remained a stable value up to 64,000 cycles. Simultaneously, its energy density was increased to 54.2 Wh kg−1 at 380.3 W kg−1 after 64,000 cycles.
