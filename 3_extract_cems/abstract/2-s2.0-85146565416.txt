In the recent years, the whole world is looking for better energy storage devices. Supercapacitors are among the most promising high-capacity energy storage devices. Manganese-based material has gained more importance among transition metals due to its cost, easy fabrication, and wide potential applications. Here, we report the synthesis of a novel MOF using metal centers, dicarboxylate ligand, and aminoterephthalic acid as a co-ligand {Mn-Ni-NH2(h2fipbb)}MOF. The synthesized material has a unique hierarchical morphology consisting of manganese and nickel connected with NH2 through h2fipbb ligand linkage, which is highly efficient for the permeation of the electrolyte and electron transfer. The {Mn-Ni-NH2(h2fipbb)}MOF shows an excellent specific capacitance of 711.60 F g−1 using 2 M KOH at a current density of 1 A g−1. The two electrode system material exhibits a high-power and energy density of 743.99 W kg−1 and 20.49 Wh kg−1, respectively. From the above results, the synthesized {Mn-Ni-NH2(h2fipbb)}MOF can be considered a promising material for electrochemical energy storage applications.
