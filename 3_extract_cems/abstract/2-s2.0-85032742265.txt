We describe a facile one-step hydrothermal route to devise and synthesize polyhedron-shaped Co3S4 nanomaterial assisted by triethylenediamine (TEDA) as ligand and structure-directing agent. The structural characterizations indicate that the obtained products are Co3S4 polyhedral nanoparticles with irregular size, which interconnect and stack each other to construct an interlinked microstructure. When investigated for its supercapacitance property, the as-fabricated Co3S4 electrode material exhibits typical pseudocapacitance performances with a high specific capacitance of 1038 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and excellent cycling stability of only 10.2% decay in its original specific capacitance after 1000 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles, suggesting its potential application in supercapacitor. Importantly, this facile TEDA-assisted hydrothermal method can be universal to obtain other transition metal chalcogenides for supercapacitors.
