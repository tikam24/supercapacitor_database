Hybrid energy storage devices have been studied with combining the high energy of lithium ion batteries and high power and long life of supercapacitor in a single system. We successfully fabricated hybrid supercapacitors using granule Li4Ti5O12/activated carbon anode and activated carbon cathode for high electrochemical performances. The hybrid supercapacitors deliver a high capacity (63 F g−1) as well as a superior rate capability (81.9% retention from 0.5 to 5 A g−1) and a cycling stability (92.8% retention after 7000 cycles at 3 A g−1). This is related to a small internal resistance value. Therefore, hybrid supercapacitors based on LTO/AC and AC electrodes are a promising and innovative solution for high performance hybrid supercapacitor.
