The development of advanced biomaterial with mechanically robust and high energy density is critical for flexible electronics, such as batteries and supercapacitors. Plant proteins are ideal candidates for making flexible electronics due to their renewable and eco-friendly natures. However, due to the weak intermolecular interactions and abundant hydrophilic groups of protein chains, the mechanical properties of protein-based materials, especially in bulk materials, are largely constrained, which hinders their performance in practical applications. Here, a green and scalable method is shown for the fabrication of advanced film biomaterials with high mechanical strength (36.3 MPa), toughness (21.25 MJ m−3), and extraordinary fatigue-resistance (213 000 times) by incorporating tailor-made core–double-shell structured nanoparticles. Subsequently, the film biomaterials combine to construct an ordered, dense bulk material by stacking-up and hot-pressing techniques. Surprisingly, the solid-state supercapacitor based on compacted bulk material shows an ultrahigh energy density of 25.8 Wh kg−1, which is much higher than those previously reported advanced materials. Notably, the bulk material also demonstrates long-term cycling stability, which can be maintained under ambient condition or immersed in H2SO4 electrolyte for more than 120 days. Thus, this research improves the competitiveness of protein-based materials for real-world applications such as flexible electronics and solid-state supercapacitors.
