Carbon materials are the most potential electrode materials in lithium-ion capacitors, in which diverse microstructures are endowed with various functionalizations, making carbon material electrodes attract increasing attention. On the basis of the current development, this article reviews various microscopic carbon materials loaded with binary metals as electrodes for lithium-ion functionalizations on capacitors. The selection and collocation of binary metals and the microscopic morphology of the corresponding carbon material carriers are summarized, which provides guidance for further exploration of the synergistic effect between carbon material carriers and binary metals. The inseparable functional complementarity of various carbon materials and binary metals in lithium-ion capacitors is elucidated. The important effects of binary metals on the energy density and specific capacity of lithium-ion capacitors, as well as those of various microscopic carbon materials on the power density and cycle stability of lithium-ion capacitors, are demonstrated. Furthermore, with the support of the radio frequency-enhanced plasma chemical vapor deposition technology, the challenges and future prospects of vertical graphene-modified diverse biological carbon material-supported binary metal materials in lithium-ion capacitors are highlighted.
