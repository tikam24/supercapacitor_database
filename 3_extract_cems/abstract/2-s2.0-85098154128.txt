α-MnO2 has been recognized as a potential material for supercapacitor applications because of its abundance, cost-effectiveness, environmental-benign nature and high theoretical specific capacitance (Csp) of 1370 F g-1. In this study, we succeeded for the first time to achieve the theoretical Csp with 3D multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) horizontally dispersed on 2D graphene oxide (GO) nanosheet framework-supported MnO2 ternary nanocomposites synthesized by a simple precipitation method. The in situ formation of α-MnO2 and GO, and the growth of 3D MWCNT/GO framework took place simultaneously in a strong acidic suspension containing functionalized-MWCNTs, graphite, NaNO3 and KMnO4. Characterizations of the composites synthesized by varying % wt MWCNTs were performed with state-of-the-art techniques. These composites were characterized to be semi-crystalline and mesoporous in nature, and the scrupulous analyses of field emission scanning electron microscopic images showed MnO2 nano-flower distributed over 3D MWCNTs dispersed-on-GO-nanosheet frameworks. These composites deposited on a graphite electrode exhibited an ideal supercapacitive behavior in an Na2SO4 solution measured via cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry. Optimum contents of MnO2 and MWCNTs in the composites showed a maximum Csp of 1380 F g-1 with satisfactory energy and power densities compared in the Ragone plot. An ascending trend of Csp against the charge-discharge cycle number studied for 700 cycles was noticed. Well-dispersion of α-MnO2 nanoparticles throughout 3D MWCNTs covalently-anchored to the GO nanosheet framework is discussed to aid in achieving the frontier Csp of MnO2. This journal is
