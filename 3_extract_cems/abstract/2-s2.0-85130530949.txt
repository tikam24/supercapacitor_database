Burning agricultural waste has become a serious environmental concern, creating health problems and global warming. The Indian government has sought to address this issue through various policies and initiatives to promote sustainable management practices such as transforming agro-waste into electricity. Biochar is a carbon-rich substance made from biomass that has been pyrolysedin a low-oxygen environment. This article addresses the opportunities and advantages of using new technologies to convert agro-waste into biochar-based functional materials with their applications in electrochemical supercapacitors. We have established an electrode on a graphite sheet using biochar as an active material and investigated its electrochemical behavior using cyclic voltammetry andgalvanostatic charge-discharge.This strategy will help overcome the challenges of safe trash recycling and the usage of fossil fuels.
