This paper presents the design and implementation of a microcontroller system for the measurement of various environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, luminosity, air quality, pressure, etc. We target application scenarios that need the deployment of such systems in the open without the availability of an electrical power grid. For this purpose, we put a strong emphasis on the energy efficiency and the development of an autonomous environment-friendly power supply consisting of solar panels and an ultracapacitor. The sensor data transmission is done over the license-free radio frequencies around 433 MHz or 868 MHz. On the software side, a lot of attention is paid to the reliability and the security of the data transmissions by the development of a custom data transmission protocol. Overall, we aim at keeping the production and deployment costs of our system economically feasible for small and medium-sized businesses. The experimental results prove that our approach has much potential and that our systems can be successfully used to build autonomous sensor data gathering networks.
