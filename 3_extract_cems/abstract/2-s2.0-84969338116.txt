A simple and green approach for the preparation of cobalt molybdate/polyaniline (CoMoO4/PANI) composite via in-situ polymerization method has been reported. The growth of PANI conductive layer on the surface of plate-like CoMoO4 nanostructures has been confirmed by XRD, FT-IR, Raman and FE-SEM techniques. The prepared CoMoO4/PANI composite delivered a maximum specific capacitance of 246 F/g at scan rate of 5 mV/s, whereas pristine PANI exhibits only 160 F/g which attributed to the synergic effect on the conducting network between CoMoO4 and PANI. The cyclic stability measurement revealed that above 80% of its initial capacitance is retained even after long cycles.
