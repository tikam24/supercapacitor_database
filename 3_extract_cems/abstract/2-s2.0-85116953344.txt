The materials and technologies of electrochemical energy storage are essential for the utilization of new energy and the achievements of carbon peaking and carbon neutralization. Based on the research work of Shanghai Key Laboratory of Materials Protection and Advanced Materials in Shanghai University of Electric Power, various electrochemical energy storage technologies are comprehensively reviewed in this paper, including lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, lithium-sulphur batteries, and supercapacitors. The current problems of electrochemical energy storage technologies are also analyzed. From the perspective of electrochemical energy storage mechanism, the modification methods of cathode, anode, separator, and current collector materials are introduced. These methods provide new ideas for the development of electrochemical energy storage devices with large capacity, long life, high safety and low cost. At last, future development trends of electrochemical energy storage technologies are proposed, including exploring new generation energy storage devices such as all-solid-state batteries and metal-air batteries and expanding the application of electrochemical energy storage devices under wide temperature and flexible conditions.
