δ-MnO2 nanoparticles synthesized in a polyol medium have been characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy(FT-IR). The electrochemical properties of the prepared material have been investigated by means of an electrode modified with an δ-MnO2 composite film based on an ionic polymer, namely, polyethersulfone amine (PES-NH2). The capacitive properties of such an electrode have been determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The specific capacitance value has been shown to depend on the composition of the film, particularly the amount of MnO2particles in the composite. Such additives as PolyVinyliDene fluoride (PVDF) significantly increased the capacitive properties of the electrode, leading to specific capacitance values in the range of 729 F∙g−1∙cm−2.
