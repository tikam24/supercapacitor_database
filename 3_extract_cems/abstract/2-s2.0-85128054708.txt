Carbonaceous materials such as expanded graphite, graphene, and amorphous carbon have been used as supercapacitor electrode materials because they have high ion storage capacity, chemical stability, conductivities, and large interlayer distance. Biomass is considered a renewable source that requires a shorter time to be reproduced compared to fossil fuels for use in food, construction, and the textile industry. The conversion of biomass into carbon nanomaterials using different techniques was extensively reviewed for its advantages and limitations.
