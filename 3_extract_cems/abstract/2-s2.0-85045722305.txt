Copper doped titanium dioxide-polypyrrole (Cu-TiO2/PPY) composite was successfully synthesized via chemical oxidative in-situ polymerization process. The structural and morphological properties of Cu-TiO2/PPY composite were investigated using X-ray diffractometer (XRD), field emission electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy(TEM) techniques. The electrochemical properties of as-synthesized composite were studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) techniques. The novel Cu-TiO2/PPY composite showed enhanced volumetric capacitance ∼714 F cm-1 and gravimetric capacitance ∼674 F g-1 at 1 A g-1. In addition an excellent coulombic efficiency and comparabley low charge transfer resistance than pure PPY suggests improved supercapacitive performance of Cu-TiO2/PPY composite as an electrode material.
