Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) film has been successfully deposited within a three-dimensional (3D) graphene aerogel (GA) by a magnetron sputtering method to facilely construct MoS2/GA composite as a high-performance electrode material of supercapacitor. Through cyclic voltammetry, constant current charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests of three-electrode supercapacitor, the electrochemical performance of the MoS2/GA composite was evaluated, demonstrating specific capacitances of 187.3 and 175.0 F g−1 at 0.5 and 1 A g−1, respectively. When cycles 1000 times under the condition of 2 A g−1, the capacitance retention remains 93.5%. The excellent electrochemical properties of MoS2/GA were attributed to the effective structural integration of MoS2 film and graphene sheets achieved with the magnetron sputtering process, which can further develop other GA-based composites as a feasible technique. The as-prepared MoS2/GA with outstanding performance in this work has a promising prospect in supercapacitor application.
