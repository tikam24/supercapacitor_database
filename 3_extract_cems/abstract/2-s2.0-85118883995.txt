Fifteen microporous carbons with variable nanotextural characteristics were prepared by KOH activation through tuning the KOH/carbon ratio and activation temperature. The prepared porous carbons have a high ratio of micropores and specific surface area up to 95% and 1410 m2 g−1, respectively. Combining the pore-structure analyzes and electrochemical measurements in aqueous KOH and H2SO4 electrolytes, it is shown that the complexity of the pore structure has a significant effect on the electrochemical performance. The solvated/naked K+ can penetrate across the narrow pore entrance of the microporous carbons with an average pore size smaller than 0.6 nm and form electric double-layer (EDL) capacitance, while solvated/naked SO42− cannot due to its larger ionic size. However, the penetration of SO42− followed by hydrated H+ become available when the average pore size is larger than 0.6 nm. With the combination of pseudocapacitance and EDL capacitance, microporous carbon shows a much higher supercapacitive performance in H2SO4 than that in KOH electrolyte. This work on pore-structure dependence of supercapacitive performance paves a guide for tailoring pore-structure suitable for aqueous KOH and H2SO4 electrolytes.
