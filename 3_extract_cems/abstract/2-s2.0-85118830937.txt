Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) hollow materials, such as hydroxide, phosphide and sulfide, have attracted great attention in the applications of energy storage and conversion owing to their advantageous features of large specific area, low density, high loading capacity and excellent ion permeability. This review summarizes various synthetic strategies and formation mechanism for different structural MOFs-derived hollow materials. The promising electrochemical applications in the supercapacitors, lithium ion battery, and electrocatalysis are prominently elucidated. An outlook of development prospects and challenges for MOFs hollow structured derivatives is also discussed.
