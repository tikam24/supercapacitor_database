Supercapacitors have received considerable attention as energy storage devices owing to their high power density, fast charge/discharge rate, and long cyclic life. Especially with an increasing demand for flexible and wearable devices, research on flexible supercapacitors has surged in recent years. The silver nanowire (Ag NW) network has been used as a flexible electrode owing to its excel-lent mechanical and electrical properties; however, its use as an electrode for flexible supercapacitors has been limited due to insufficient electrochemical stability. In this study, we proposed a method to resolve this issue. We employed a solution process that enabled the coating of the surface of Ag NW by a thin Au shell of ≈ 5 nm thickness, which significantly improved the electrochemical stability of the Ag NW network electrodes. Furthermore, we confirmed for the first time that MnO2, which is one of the most widely used capacitive materials, can be directly electroplated on the AACS NW network electrode. Finally, we fabricated a high-performance and flexible solid-state supercapacitor using the suggested Ag/Au/MnO2 core–shell NW network electrodes.
