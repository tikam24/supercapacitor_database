Corn starch and citric acid, two low-cost and abundant materials, were used for establishing a novel screen printable hydrogel for printed electronics applications. Corn starch was modified with citric acid by melt-blending; the so obtained thermoplastic starch was ground to powder and added to a water–starch suspension. Ultrasonication was used to prepare hydrogels of different citric acid concentrations. The most promising hydrogel contained 10% citric acid by weight, provided an ionic conductivity of (2.30 ± 0.07) mS cm−1 and appropriate rheological properties for screen and stencil printing. The hydrogel shows superb printability and prolonged stability against degradation. The corn starch hydrogel was used as printable gel polymer electrolyte in fully printed supercapacitors. The specific capacitance of the printed supercapacitor reached 54 F g−1. The printable hydrogel-polymer electrolyte is easy to produce without in-depth chemical knowledge, is based on widely used and non-toxic materials, and may be used as a functional layer in other printed electronics applications such as printed batteries.
