In this paper the authors present a simple solution for recovery of braking energy in tram systems. The proposed solution is stationary supercapacitor (SC) energy storage system (ESS) where ESS consists only of series connected SC cells without DC/DC power interface converter. For the evaluation of the proposed solution a detailed simulation model is developed and experimentally measured tram power diagrams are used as input data. Simulations for twenty-four hours long tram system operation are performed to assess the energy consumption with and without supercapacitors.
