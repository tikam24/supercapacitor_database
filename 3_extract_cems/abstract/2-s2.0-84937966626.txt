Highly dispersed polypyrrole particles were decorated on reduced graphene oxide sheets using a facile in situ synthesis route. The prepared composite, which obtained a folded surface, shows remarkable performance as the electrode material of supercapacitors. The specific capacitance reaches 564.1 F g<sup>−1</sup> at a current density of 1 A g<sup>−1</sup> and maintains 86.4 % after 1000 charging–discharging cycles at a current density of 20 A g<sup>−1</sup>, which indicates a good cycling stability. Furthermore, the prepared supercapacitor demonstrates an ultrahigh energy density of 50.13 Wh kg<sup>−1</sup> at power density of 0.40 kW kg<sup>−1</sup>, and remains of 45.33 Wh kg<sup>−1</sup> even at high power density of 8.00 kW kg<sup>−1</sup>, which demonstrate that the hybrid supercapacitor can be a promising energy storage system for fast and efficient energy storage in the future.
