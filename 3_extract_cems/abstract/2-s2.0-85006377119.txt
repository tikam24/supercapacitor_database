A facile route for the synthesis of spinel type NiFe2−xMnxO4-RGO as supercapacitor electrodes is reported and the microstructure, elemental composition/content, morphology and thermal stability of NiFe1.7Mn0.3O4-RGO10 were characterized by XRD, FTIR, ICP, XPS, TEM, and TGA. Uniform NiFe1.7Mn0.3O4 nanospheres were deposited densely on the reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets. The as prepared NiFe1.7Mn0.3O4-RGO10 composite showed better electrochemical performance than the corresponding binary metal systems. The spinel structure and the doping of Mn as the third component provided the composite with high specific capacitance of 1214.7 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in a three-electrode system along with good cycling stability.
