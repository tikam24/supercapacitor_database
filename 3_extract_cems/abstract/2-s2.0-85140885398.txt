In this study, a strategy to fabricate nitrogen-doped porous core-sheath graphene fibers with the incorporation of polypyrrole-induced nitrogen doping and graphene oxide for porous architecture in sheath is reported. Polypyrrole/graphene oxide were introduced onto wet-spun graphene oxide fibers by dip-coating. Nitrogen-doped core-sheath graphene-based fibers (NSG@GFs) were obtained with subsequently thermally carbonized polypyrrole/small-sized graphene oxide and graphene oxide fiber slurry (PPY/SGO@GOF). Both nitrogen doping and small-sized graphene sheets can improve the utilization of graphene layers in graphene-based fiber electrode by preventing stacking of the graphene sheets. Enhanced electrochemical performance is achieved due to the introduced pseudo-capacitance and enhanced electrical double-layered capacitance. The specific capacitance (38.3 mF cm−2) of NSG@GF is 2.6 times of that of pure graphene fiber. The energy density of NSG@GF reaches 3.40 μWh cm−2 after nitrogen doping, which is 2.59 times of that of as-prepared one. Moreover, Nitrogen-doped graphene fiber-based supercapacitor (NSG@GF FSSC) exhibits good conductivity (155 S cm−1) and cycle stability (98.2% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 0.1 mA cm−2).
