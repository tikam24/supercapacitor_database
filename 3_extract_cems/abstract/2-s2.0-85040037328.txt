The Sn-doped σ-MnO2 (Sn-MnO2) hollow structures was successfully prepared via a chemical process at room temperature (25°C). Compared to pure MnO2, Sn-MnO2 shows an obviously enhanced capacitance and outstanding cycling performance at high operating temperature of 85°C. For Sn-MnO2, the specific capacitance (Cs) of 169.9Fg-1 at current density of 1Ag-1 was measured at 85°C and retains over 90% of its initial capacitance after 1000 cycles. Meanwhile, the electrochemical properties of Sn-MnO2 were investigated on different temperatures (25°C, 45°C, 65°C and 85°C), and an improved capacitive performance was obtained with the temperature increasing.
