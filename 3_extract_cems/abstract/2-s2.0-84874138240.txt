Cyclic voltammetry is a common characterization technique for electrochemical reactions of electroactive species. Cyclic voltammetry is an important characteristic to determine the performances of energy storage devices such as battery and supercapacitor. In this paper we focus on the interdigital electrode with the various physical parameters such as gap, width and length of electrodes to increase the current response based on cyclic voltammetry performances. 2-D cyclic voltammetry time dependent model was developed. The interdigital electrode array consists of working electrode and counter electrode and the reaction at the working electrode is described by concentration dependent Butler-Volmer kinetics. The counter electrode is modeled so that it acts like an ideal reference electrode. In the design, the counter electrode with respect to ground is set to zero. The applied cell potential range from -0.5V to 0.5V. To explore the performances on cyclic voltammetry with different physical parameters of interdigital electrode, Comsol Multiphysics ver.4.2a is used to design the interdigital electrode, and the cyclic voltammetry was plotted. The maximum current response achieved is 1.6 A/m corresponding to gap of electrodes of 250 um. For the width and length of the electrodes, the maximum current response is 0.85 A/m and 1.6 A/m respectively corresponding the width of electrodes of 50 um and the length of electrodes of 700 um.
