Porous, aligned and high aspect ratio nanofibers of Ca2Fe2O5 (CFO) have been fabricated by varying various system and process parameter of electrospinning technique for the first time. CFO nanofibers are further characterized by XRD, FESEM and BET surface area. The diameter of as-spun nanofibers of CFO was found to be polymer concentration dependent. Heating profile is found to be responsible for alignment of CFO nanofibers. For the first time, novel CFO nanofibers were subjected to cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) cycling to investigate its energy storage performance as electrode material for aqueous supercapacitor, and accordingly preliminary results are discussed.
