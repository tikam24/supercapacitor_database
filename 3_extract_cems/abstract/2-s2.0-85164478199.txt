Hybrid supercapacitor or supercapattery devices have gained significant attention for their impressive power (Pd) and energy densities (Ed), as well as their exceptional cyclic stability compared to traditional storage devices. In this study, manganese niobium sulfide (MnNbS) is synthesized using a hydrothermal method. To enhance the electrochemical performance of MnNbS, polyaniline (PANI) is blended at varying mass ratios. Initially, the electrochemical properties of MnNbS/PANI are evaluated using a three-electrode configuration, consisting of working, counter, and reference electrodes. At a current density of 2 A g−1, MnNbS/PANI exhibits an improved specific capacity ((Formula presented.)) of 1366 C g−1. Subsequently, to develop a supercapattery energy storage device, a two-electrode system is constructed. This setup offers enhanced performance and flexibility, making it an ideal choice for high-performance supercapacitors. Activated carbon (AC) and MnNbS/PANI are employed as the negative and positive electrodes, respectively, in the two-electrode system. Notably, the device demonstrates outstanding energy density (Ed) of 26.2 Wh kg−1, power density (Pd) of 2072 W kg−1, and specific capacity of 118 C g−1. Furthermore, durability tests involving 1000 charge–discharge cycles reveal a capacity retention of 79%. This study suggests that MnNbS/PANI (at a weight ratio of 80/20%) holds promise as an electrode material for supercapattery applications.
