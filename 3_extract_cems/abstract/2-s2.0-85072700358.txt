Three-dimensional graphitic carbon materials with controllable composition and hierarchically porous structure are promising electrode materials for supercapacitors. In this work, a modified phase inversion method combined with a calcination process was developed to prepare three-dimensional graphene networks embedded with nitrogen-doped carbon nanoparticles. When used as electrode for supercapacitors, the as-prepared material delivered a high capacitance of 431.9 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and 156.8 F g−1 at 20 A g−1, as well as a stable cyclic behavior with no capacitance decay after 5000 cycles. Such a remakable capacitive performance was attributed to its hierarchically porous structure and proper nitrogen doping content (9.68 ± 0.24 at%), which facilitated the migration of electrolyte ions and provided abundant redox active sites for the faradic reactions. The synthetic strategy may be exploited for the rational design and synthesis of new carbon materials with controlled doping level and three-dimensional porous structure.
