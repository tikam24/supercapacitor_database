Very few research has focused on Mn3O4@carbon nanorod-structured materials for supercapacitor electrode. A facile process has been developed to prepare Mn3O4@carbon core-shell hybrid nanorods for supercapacitor electrode materials. The core Mn3O4 polycrystals, which are 50 nm in diameter and 500 nm in length, offer faradaic pseudo-capacitance, while at the same time they serve as supporting template for 4.5 nm shell carbon surface, which functions as electrically conductive material and is also beneficial for improving the capacitive performance. It is highly desirable that the hybrid nanorods exhibit an excellent cycle ability with 95% retention after 5000 cycles at 4 A g-1. The hybrid nanorods present a capacitance of 168 F g-1 and good rate capability (125 F g-1 at 5 A g-1). The results indicate that the Mn3O4@carbon core-shell nanorods may have a promising future in applications which need durable, stable, long-lasting power supply.
