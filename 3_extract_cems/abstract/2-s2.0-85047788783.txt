This paper discusses the effectiveness of frequency control and peak shift by Electric Energy Storage System (EESS) that consists of Lithium ion Capacitor (LiC) and Valve-Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA) battery in Izu-oshima. We demonstrate that EESS suppresses frequency fluctuation while maintaining the suitable State of Charge of LiC that has small capacity. We also demonstrate to reduce the peak load by scheduled discharge from VRLA, so it is shown that the possibility of reducing operating time of diesel generators that contributes to extend examination period.
