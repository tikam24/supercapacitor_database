This paper proposes polymorphic storage unit based on a grid of supercapacitors, enabling the interchanging and the switching of the supercapacitors (SCs) to meet the available voltage in the load or source side, to be consumed or provided. This paper shows the polymorphic storage unit interest that is more much relevant in the small voltage recovery. A script Matlab returns the code of the switches associated to the SCs that their combination gives the required voltage, while Simulink communicates the available voltage to be provided or consumed and the voltage of each supercapacitor.
