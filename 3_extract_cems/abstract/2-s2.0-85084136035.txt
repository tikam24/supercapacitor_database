Electric vehicles (EVs) are economically and environmentally friendly compared to gasoline engine vehicles. In EV technology, bi-directionality of dc-dc converters have significantly enlarged the scope of EV applications with the use of regenerative braking and reverse charging technique in present days. Driving a synchronous machine (SM) connected to a three-port dc link is the aim of this work. A battery and a supercapacitor are connected via two bi-directional dc-dc converters (BDC), which are triggered by Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) technique. The converters are controlled in bi-directional in order to facilitate a high figure in efficiency with accurate levels of outputs. The proposed two converter systems are well explained using PSCAD™/EMTDC™ and MATLAB/Simulink™ simulation results.
