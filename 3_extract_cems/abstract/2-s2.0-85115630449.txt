Polymer nanocomposites exhibit idiosyncratic physicochemical features that cannot be achieved by the respective individual constituting materials. Owing to their unique properties, they have witnessed widespread application in numerous areas of electrochemistry such as supercapacitors, batteries, solar cells, energy storage, and electrochemical sensors. By combining polymeric materials such as polyaniline (PANI), polyacetylene (PAc), polypyrrole (PPy), polythiophene (PTn), or poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) with different fillers, for example, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene (Gpn), metal nanoparticles (MNPs), and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), several composites materials have been fabricated. Electrochemical sensors are very selective, sensitive, and low-cost materials for the effective detection of target molecules. This review summarizes some conventional conducting polymer-based nanocomposites and their utility as electrochemical sensors. Lastly, a discussion on the future perspectives of conducting polymer nanocomposites is also included.
