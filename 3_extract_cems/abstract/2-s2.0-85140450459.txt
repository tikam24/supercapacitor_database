This paper investigates a nonlinear disturbance observer (NDOB) based integral terminal sliding mode control (ITSMC) approach for hybrid energy storage system (HESS) subject to load disturbance and input voltage variation. The pro-posed control strategy can reasonably distribute the output power of the battery and supercapacitor (SC), provide the required power to the load and stabilize the direct current (DC) bus voltage. A strict stability analysis is also given. By comparing with the PI control and ITSMC methods, the proposed method obtains a better disturbance rejection ability when the load and input voltage are varying. Simulation results show that the proposed control strategy can stabilize the entire system and achieve better control goals.
