Ternary Cu-Co sulfides, CuCo2S4, with an average size of about 20â€“60 nm were synthesized via a novel and low-cost method. Characterization results show that the as-obtained CuCo2S4 nanoparticles belong to cubic phase with high crystallinity. Meanwhile, CuCo2S4 nanoparticles exhibit excellent electrochemical performances, i.e.: the specific capacitances as high as 443.7 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g, and good cyclic stability (83.8% capacitance retention after 10000 charge-discharge cycles). More importantly, full-cell asymmetric supercapacitors based on CuCo2S4 nanoparticles and activated carbon were successfully assembled, which achieving higher specific capacitance of 274.5 mF/cm2 at the current density of 3 mA/cm2. After 5000 charge/discharge cycles, these full-cell asymmetric supercapacitors can still remain 94.7% of the initial specificcapacitance. Besides, they can be charged and discharged to drive some electric elements. All these outstanding results demonstrate the promising potential application of CuCo2S4 nanoparticles in the field of energy storage.
