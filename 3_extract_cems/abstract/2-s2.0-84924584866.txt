We report a facile and low-cost approach for the preparation of all-in-one supercapacitor electrodes using copper foam (CuF) integrated three-dimensional (3D) reduced graphene oxide (rGO) networks. The binder-free 3DrGO@CuF electrodes are capable of delivering high specific capacitance approaching the theoretical capacitance of graphene and exhibiting high charge-discharge cycling stability.
