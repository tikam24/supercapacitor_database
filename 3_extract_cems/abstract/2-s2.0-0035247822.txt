In this work, dynamic properties of electrochemically polymerized polypyrrole in 0.1 M NaNO3 and 0.1 M NaClO4 electrolyte solution was investigated for the application of supercapacitor using piezoelectric quartz crystal. The cyclic voltammetry was performed to interpret capacitor characteristics of Ppy thin film in various electrolyte solutions and the results were compared with AFM images. The results show that the perchlorate anion doped films present better electrochemical capacitor characteristics than the case that other electrolytes are used as counter anions.
