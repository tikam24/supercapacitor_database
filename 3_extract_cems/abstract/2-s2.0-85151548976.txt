The ever-increasing global energy demand, combined with the scarcity of fossil fuels, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions, has pushed the globe towards the adoption of electric vehicles. The scarcity of public charging stations is a key impediment to broad adoption of electric vehicle infrastructure for charging. Hydrogen is a form of energy that can be stored and it has the power to deliver massive volumes of energy. Fuel Cells use hydrogen as their main fuel. This research paper focuses on Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicle (FCHEV), that is the combination of any energy storing element like an ultra-capacitor or battery with fuel cell to fulfill the power demand which is essential for the electric motor and the device attached to it. Here, Ultracapacitor is used along with FCEV to store energy. A Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) is used here for transmission purpose. This article deals with designing and analysing the performance of the FCHEV model developed in MATLAB Simulink.
