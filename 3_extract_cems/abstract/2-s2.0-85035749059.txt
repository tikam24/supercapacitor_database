In order to incorporate the advantage of the V2 control scheme and the benefits of digital implementation, this paper proposes a digital V2 control with hybrid capacitor current ramp compensation, which includes the estimated output capacitor current ramp and the external ramp. Since capacitor current responds to the load change immediately, the proposed method has faster transient response than either digital inductor current compensation or external ramp compensation. The proposed estimator does not require high sampling rate and avoids the current ramp distortion due to the parasitic resistance and inductance. The small-signal model is derived by describing function to understand the dynamic characteristics of the proposed control scheme. The model provides design criteria of the current feedback gain and the external ramp slope. The effectiveness of the proposed control architecture and the current ramp estimator is verified by simulation and experimental results. Compared with the benchmark, the proposed control has 70% reduction on settling time and 20% reduction on undershoot deviation.
