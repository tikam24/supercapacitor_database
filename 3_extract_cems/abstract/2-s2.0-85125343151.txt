Iron oxide is a mineral compound that shows different polymorphic forms, including hematite (α-Fe2O3), magnetite (Fe3O4) and maghemite (γ-Fe2O3). Iron oxides are economical, nontoxic and possess good chemical stability and high theoretical capacity. However their major disadvantages in energy application are they aggregate after reaction, poor capacity retention and low electronic conductivity. Their application for electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices like lithium ion batteries, supercapacitors and fuel cells can be enhanced by loading them on to some conducting matrices like graphene. This can not only remove the disadvantages of Iron oxide but also minimize the aggregation or restacking of graphene and thus enhancing its properties for such energy applications. This chapter deals with the recent advances in various synthetic procedures of Iron oxide based nanocomposites, their characterization methods and their potential applications in energy storage devices, supercapacitors, fuel cells etc. Future challenges and perspective of these materials in energy applications are also discussed.
