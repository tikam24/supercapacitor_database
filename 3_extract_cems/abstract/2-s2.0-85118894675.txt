This work mainly focuses on the development of a novel type of chemically activated electrodes from the cotton yarn by carbonization and chemical activation. Chemical activation is employed in order to obtain high specific capacitance, energy and power density. The zinc oxide was prepared by the sol - gel method and the pH should be in the range of 9 and 11. ZnO/CCY electrode is prepared and it was stirred with a magnetic stirrer. The performance of the electrode is evaluated using aqueous electrolyte at various current densities and scan rate. The sample which was prepared electrochemically characterized using CV, GCD and EIS. This paper reports the development of highly flexible, less weight, and electrically conductive ZnO/CCY electrode with an electrochemical specific capacitance of 10.06 F g-1 at 150 mV s-1. The ZnO powders were evenly developed over the carbonized cotton yarn. The porous nanostructure presented in ZnO powder presented enough potential electro-active sites. Additionally, it offered the good electrolyte adsorption. The well-developed ZnO/CCY fiber electrode showed enhanced electrochemical performance and stability from the analysis of CV, GCD and EIS. From the results, the fabricated flexible ZnO/CCY electrode can provide impending applications in the development of cable-type devices and next generation electrochemical supercapacitors.
