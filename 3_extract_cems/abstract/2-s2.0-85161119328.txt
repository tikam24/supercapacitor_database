Hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs) are playing an increasingly important role in smart mobility platforms including electric vehicles. The design of the energy management strategy is the core of making the system rationalize the power distribution and stable operation. The power state and temperature state directly affect the determination of safe operating boundaries in the energy management strategy. In this paper, based on the equivalent circuit model of HESS, a thermoelectric coupling model of battery pack considering air-cooled system is established. In addition, a power capability prediction method considering the constraints of temperature, current, voltage and SOC is proposed and the power capability prediction method is embedded in the energy management strategy based on model predictive control. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can further improve the system performance and reduce the system energy consumption. The energy management strategy can provide the optimal power distribution at different air-cooled wind speeds and guarantee the maximum temperature of both the battery pack and the supercapacitor pack are in the normal operating range.
