For the construction of high-performance energy storage and conversion devices, the development of advanced electrode materials with specific nanostructural characteristics is a requirement of the moment. Several types of ZnCo2O4@Ni(OH)2 nanoarchitectures are prepared in this study using a simple two-step hydrothermal strategy. At 1 A g-1, the observed capacitance of the ZnCo2O4@Ni(OH)2-2.0 sample-based hybrid capacitor was 848.6 C g-1. The fabricated capacitor device exhibited not only high energy density but also an excellent cycling stability. As an electrocatalyst, the same sample, that is, ZnCo2O4@Ni(OH)2-2.0, demonstrates 280.2 mV over potential at 50 mA cm-2. This research shows that the provided electrode material is well suited for future capacitor and electrocatalyst applications.
