The solar-thermal conversion of sunlight into heat has received considerable attention due to its low cost and high conversion efficiency. Microsupercapacitors (MSCs) are a promising class of microscale power sources for microelectronic devices, but low-temperature operation is a huge challenge for their potential applications due to sluggish diffusion kinetics. Here, a simple strategy of adhering a graphene photothermal film on the backside of a model MSC to realize the device self-heating at low temperatures is demonstrated. At an extremely low ambient temperature of −50 °C, graphene film can increase the actual operating temperature of MSC to −16.5 °C under irradiation of 1 sun. Solar-driven self-heating resulted in a 4.5-fold increase in the specific capacitance, a 2.7-fold increase in the rate capability, and a 2.8-fold increase in the energy density without compromising the cyclic stability. This work presents a new application for solar energy and a new approach to improve the overall performance of MSCs at low temperatures.
