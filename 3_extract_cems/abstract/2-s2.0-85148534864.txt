The hybrid nitrogen doped N-rGO/MgCo2O4 nanocomposite was studied for supercapacitor electrodes. Hydrothermal and reflux process was adopted for N-rGO and for nanocomposite respectively. GO/MgCo2O4, MgCo2O4 physical and chemical properties were used to compare to understand the enhancements made by nitrogen doping. Phase purity of N-rGO/MgCo2O4, GO/MgCo2O4 nanocomposites and MgCo2O4 were studied. Raman and FTIR spectra were used to confirm the reduction of graphene oxide, nitrogen doping in. N-rGO and its nanocomposites. SEM and EDX analysis revealed the morphology and the elements in the synthesized nanomaterials. The electrochemical performance of all the nanocomposites were studied in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge, impedance spectra, cyclic stability of N-rGO/MgCo2O4, GO/MgCo2O4, MgCo2O4 results have been discussed. The energy and power density have been compared. N-rGO//N-rGO/MgCo2O4 asymmetric supercapacitor device was fabricated and studied. It exhibits an energy, power density of 3750 Wh Kg−1, 28.3 W Kg−1 and the results have been presented.
