Layered LiNi0.94Co0.06O2 (LNCO) was prepared and explored as an energy-storage material for Li-ion (LIBs), Na-ion (SIBs) batteries as well as supercapacitor application for the first time. All the physical and morphological characterizations were studied for the sample LNCO. The result displays good thermal stability, phase purity in the crystal structure, appreciable Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area (5.53 m2 g−1) and possesses cubic morphology. The cobalt was identified in lithium nickel oxide with binding energies at 794.02, 779.04 and 784.30 eV, respectively. In the case of LIBs, LNCO exists with a minimal difference of 5 mAh g−1, even when cycled from 2C to 0.1C. After 200 cycles, the specific capacity, 247 mAh g−1, is obtained for the cell with retention of 97.8% (efficiency 99.8%) at 0.1C. In SIBs, at 0.1C, the discharge capacity of 182 mAh g−1 was restored even when cycled after 2C. After 200 cycles, a discharge capacity of 204 mAh g−1 is ensured with retention of 96.6% (efficiency of 99.4% at 0.1C). In supercapacitor, the electrode, LNCO, delivered a specific capacity of 300 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. Therefore, LNCO is highly recommended as a suitable electrode material for fulfilling the requirement of energy-storage applications.
