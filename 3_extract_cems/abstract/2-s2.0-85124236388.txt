Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful electrochemical characterization technology, which has been widely used in the field of electrochemical energy, such as lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors, fuel cells, etc. Distribution of relaxation time (DRT) is an EIS deconvolution technique which does not depend on the prior knowledge of the targeted research object. Furthermore, DRT can serve to separate and analyze physical and chemical processes which are highly overlapped in their EIS data. In order to encourage the application and popularization of DRT deconvolution technology, several core questions are addressed in this paper: (1) DRT deconvolution principle, implementation steps and important extensions; (2) DRT deconvolution method for typical circuit elements; (3) DRT implementation software and typical electrochemical energy application examples; (4) achievements, challenges and development trends for DRT deconvolution technique.
