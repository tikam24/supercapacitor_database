Biochars encompass an excellent prospect in the field of energy storage. Biochars possess a large specific surface area, rich pore structure and good electrical conductivity. These features make them have the potential to provide high power and high reversible capacity. At the same time, they have advantages of rich source of raw materials, environment friendly and easy processing and structural devising, which characteristics fossil energy storage materials are not available. When the original biochars are used as energy storage materials and components, their irreversible capacity are large and their high-current charge and discharge capacity are weak. For these problems, this paper expounds the principal preparation methods of biochars and some methods ofenhancing their reversible capacity and high-current charge and discharge capacity when they are used as the lithium-ion battery anode and supercapacitor electrode material.
