A cost-effective and simple method has been developed for the preparation of flower-like hierarchical spheres of semiconductor oxide materials. Efficient self-assembly of BiVO4 flower-like hierarchical spheres was performed via a simple hydrothermal method, followed by calcination at 500 Â°C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies distinguished diffraction planes of the monoclinic BiVO4 phase, which was further confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) analysis. The electronic and optical properties of BiVO4 were studied via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV-visible spectroscopy. XPS analysis confirmed the binding energy relations and the formation of BiVO4, and also an increase in the Bi-O, V-O bond strengths in BiVO4. The remarkable efficiency of pseudocapacitor electrode materials depends on the consistent fabrication of nano architectures. The carbon-free BiVO4 electrodes showed a higher specific capacitance of 1203 F g-1 at 2 A g-1, without detectable degradation after 2000 cycles and a beneficial cycling stability was achieved because of the electrochemical activity of the distinctive porous hierarchical architecture. Our synthetic method suggests a simple procedure for the design and fabrication of bismuth vanadate hierarchical nano architectures, encouraging electrochemical energy storage. These nanocomposites could be utilized as anode materials in lithium-ion batteries.
