ZnO/MnO2 hybrid nanostructure for electrode and asymmetric supercapacitor is fabricated and electrochemical performance of the as-prepared active material is investigated in this paper. The as-synthesized electrode material possesses a wheel-like shape composed of the nanosheets and nanoparticles. This ZnO/MnO2 electrode with 3-electrode measurement and the assembled supercapacitor show maximum area capacitance of 271.1 mF cm−2 and 376.7 mF cm−2 at current densities of 2 mA cm−2, respectively, as well as energy density of 109.8 mWh cm−2 and 610.2 mWh cm−2, power density of 3240 mW cm−2 and 6480 mW cm−2, respectively. Moreover, the as-prepared electrode material has a long-term cyclic life and stability (95% after 50,000 cycles) and the assembled supercapacitor possesses 97% retention after 10,000 cycles, respectively. Excellent electrochemical performance of the as-fabricated hybrid nanostructure could be contributed to the unique hybrid nanostructure and good pseudocapacitance of MnO2.
