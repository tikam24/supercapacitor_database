We report an original setup using carbon nanotube matrices as supercapacitors where redox enzymes serve for continuous charging of the capacitors. High currents can be delivered under short pulse discharges. This supercapacitor/biofuel cell hybrid system remains stable for at least 40 000 pulses of 2 mW.
