A new ternary composite containing graphene, tin oxide (SnO2) and poly (p-phenylenediamine) (PpPD) is prepared successfully via one-pot method, which includes the reduction of GO and the formation of SnO2 simultaneously followed by polymerization of p-phenylenediamine (pPD). The graphene/SnO2/PpPD (GSP) composite achieves an enhanced specific capacitance (777.5 F g-1) at 5 mV s-1 in 1 M H2SO4 and retains 97.8% of the initial capacitance after 2000 cycles. Therefore, the GSP ternary composite can be a promising electrode material for supercapacitors and other energy storage devices.
