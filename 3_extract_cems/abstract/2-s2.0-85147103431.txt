It is of great scientific and economic value to recycle waste poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) into high-value PET-based metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and further convert it into porous carbon for green energy storage applications. In the present study, a facile and cost-effective hydrothermal process was developed to direct recycle waste PET bottles into MIL-53(Al) with a 100% conversation, then the MOF-derived porous carbon was assembled into electrodes for high-performance supercapacitors. The results indicated that the as-synthesized carbon exhibited high SSA of 1712 m2 g−1 and unique accordion-like structure with hierarchical porosity. Benefit to these advantageous characters, the assembled three-electrode supercapacitor displayed high specific capacitances of 391 F g−1 at the current density of 0.5 A g−1 and good rate capability of 73.6% capacitance retention at 20 A g−1 in 6M KOH electrolyte. Furthermore, the assembled zinc ion capacitor still revealed outstanding capacitance of 335 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, excellent cycling stability of 92.2% capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles and ultra-high energy density of 150.3 Wh kg−1 at power density of 90 W kg−1 in 3M ZnSO4 electrolyte. It is believed that the current work provides a facile and effective strategy to recycle PET waste into high-valuable MOF, and further expands the applications of MOF-derived carbons for high-performance energy storage devices, so it is conducive to both pollution alleviation and sustainable economic development.
