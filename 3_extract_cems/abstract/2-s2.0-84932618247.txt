Mesoscopic WO<inf>3</inf> microspheres composed of self-assembly nanofibers were prepared by hydrothermal reaction of tungsten acid potassium and H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>. The mesoscopic WO<inf>3</inf> microspheres offer desired porous properties and large effective active areas provided by intertwining nanofibers, thereby resulting in excellent supercapacitive properties due to facile electrolyte flow and fast reaction kinetics. In three electrode configuration, mesoscopic WO<inf>3</inf> microspheres exhibit specific capacitance value of 797.05 F g<sup>-1</sup> at the current density of 0.5 A g<sup>-1</sup> and excellent cycling stability without decay after 2000 cycles in 2 M H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> aqueous solution. These values are superior to other reported WO<inf>3</inf> composites. An asymmetric supercapacitor is constructed using the as-prepared WO<inf>3</inf> mesoscopic microspheres as the positive electrode and the activated carbon as the negative electrode, which displays excellent electrochemical performance with a maximum energy density of 97.61 Wh kg<sup>-1</sup> and power density of 28.01 kW kg<sup>-1</sup>. These impressive performances suggest that the mesoscopic WO<inf>3</inf> microspheres are promising electrode materials for supercapacitor.
