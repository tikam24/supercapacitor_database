Electrochemical performance of a supercapacitor is basically contributed from the electrode material or the active material. The specific issue that is being exhibited by graphene alone is that even it has high surface areas for charge storage, the charges physically stored on the carbon particles in porous electrode layers are unfortunately limited. This shows that graphene has a great conductivity but lacks in capacitive behavior and the restacking of other carbon atom to form graphitic structures. As for the molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), the problem that it faced is the resistivity of it in conducting electrons and the very low specific surface area. In this work, graphene was mixed together with MoS2 through liquid phase exfoliation in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) solvent. The use of NMP as solvent during the liquid phase exfoliation is suitable for both graphene and MoS2. This is supported with the data collected from Raman spectroscopy shows that the bulk powders are exfoliated to few layers of flakes. The experiment confirmed that the composite of 75G-25MoS2 exhibited a fair performing electrode which the specific capacitance is 24.71 F/g under 1 mA/mg of current density for 10,000 cycles. It also gives a fair value in specific capacitance from cyclic voltammetry analysis at lowest scan rate at 1 mV s- 1 which is 38.64 F/g in an aqueous electrolyte of 0.5 M of sodium sulfate. The capacitance retention of the composite electrode also turned out to be better than pure graphene electrode after 10,000 cycles.
