Transition-metal (Fe, Co, Ni) based metal-organic framework materials with controllable structures, large surface areas and adjustable pore sizes have attracted wide research interest for use in next-generation electrochemical energy-storage devices. This review introduces the synthesis of transition-metal (Fe, Co, Ni) based metal-organic frameworks and their derivatives with the focus on their application in supercapacitors and batteries.
