The frequency of the power system must lie within a predefined range to maintain the operational security of the power system. Synchronous generators with their rotating masses help to resist changes in system frequency. However as renewable generation is replacing conventional generation, the ability of the system to resist changes in frequency decreases. The decreasing system inertia in the future grids is prompting the TSOs to look for better frequency response services like Enhanced Frequency Response (EFR). This paper presents an approach of power intensive energy storage in the form of supercapacitors to damp the frequency within 10 seconds of the frequency deviation. The solution is evaluated for the transmission grid models of UK, Ireland and Hawaii with a focus on the UK grid. The lowest frequency point, fnadir and the excursions outside operational and statutory frequency limits are evaluated for all grids with and without the solution.
