In this paper, a three-dimensional graphene (3DG) network grown on nickel foam was employed as a template for synthesizing graphene-based composite materials of supercapacitor electrode. The composites (crystal Ni3S2nanorods on the surface of 3DG (abbreviated as Ni3S2/3DG)) were obtained through a one-step hydrothermal reaction. The morphological and structural evolution of the Ni3S2/3DG composites were investigated by SEM, TEM, XRD and Raman spectroscopy. Detailed electrochemical characterization showed that the Ni3S2/3DG-coated electrodes exhibited both a specific capacitance as high as 1825 F·g-1at 5 mV·s-1and a discharge capacitance as high as 517 F·g-1at 10 mA. Remarkably, a high cycling performance (∼ 100% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles) is achieved at a current density of 20 mA.
