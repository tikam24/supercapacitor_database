Due to the rising concern of environmental problems in ship industries, fuel cell hybrid power systems have been proposed to be an ideal substitution to diesel engines in shipboard power systems. However, the hybrid power system has brought many challenges, one of which is the power splitting among different power sources. In this paper, a wavelet transform and fuzzy logic-based energy management strategy is proposed for a fuel cell/battery/ultra-capacitor hybrid power cruiser, considering the dynamic characteristics of each power source. Specifically, the energy demand of the cruiser is decoupled into different frequencies by wavelet transform and distributed to different energy sources according to their dynamic characteristics. To ensure long-Term reliable operation of the hybrid power system, fuzzy logic is proposed to keep the state of charge of the energy storage system within safe range. The proposed energy management strategy is applied to a hybrid power cruiser in MATLAB/Simulink and two cases are studied considering different initial states of charge of the energy storage system. The results show that, the proposed energy management strategy enables the fuel cell to supply about 50% of the high frequency power, and reduce the peak power supplied by the fuel cell by 80% when the initial state of charge of the ultra-capacitor is low; and the fuel cell supplies around 400% higher than the low peak power and 50% of the high peak power when the initial state of charge of the battery is low.
