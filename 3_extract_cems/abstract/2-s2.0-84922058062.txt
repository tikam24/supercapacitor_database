MnMoO4/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) hybrids were prepared through a cost effective hydrothermal procedure. The hybrids were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The electrochemical performance of the MnMoO4/RGO hybrid as the electrode material in a supercapacitor was determined by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies. The MnMoO4/RGO hybrid had a higher specific capacitance, better cycle-life stability and lower resistance than pure MnMoO4, indicating that the high surface area and electrical conductivity of the RGO contribute to the excellent electrochemical performance of the MnMoO4/RGO electrode. So MnMoO4/RGO hybrids are very promising electrode materials for supercapacitors.
