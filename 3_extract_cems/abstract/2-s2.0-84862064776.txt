Polyaniline was prepared by chemical in-situ polymerization at ambient temperature. The morphology and structure of polyaniline were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Symmetric redox supercapacitor was assembled with the PANI as active electrode material and 1 mol/L Na 2SO 4 aqueous solution as electrolyte. The capacitive performances of the supercapacitor were tested with cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge. The results show that the PANI product has high capacity, good power characteristics and good cycle performance. The specific capacitance of the PANI electrode is about 451 F/g at the charge-discharge current density of 5 mA/cm 2. After 1000 charge-discharge cycles the specific capacitance of the PANI electrode is about 208 F/g. The specific capacitance of the PANI electrode is about 230 F/g at the charge-discharge current density of 20 mA/cm 2. Energy density up to 7.35 Wh/kg.
