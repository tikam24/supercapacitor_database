The graphitic carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 )/iron oxide (α-Fe 2 O 3 ) composites have been prepared by a one-step pyrolysis of Prussian blue (PB) and melamine. The Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles derived from PB effectively protect the thin layers of g-C 3 N 4 from restacking and expanding. The as-prepared g-C 3 N 4 /α-Fe 2 O 3 composites exhibit a large specific surface area, and demonstrate their excellent electrochemical performance in the supercapacitor and non-enzymatic detection of glucose. The g-C 3 N 4 /α-Fe 2 O 3 composites facilitate the faster faradic reaction in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, and deliver the highest specific capacitance (580 F g −1 ) at the current density of 1.0 A g −1 . The resultant composites also show an excellent long cycle life (up to 1000 cycles) at the current density of 2 A g −1 . In addition, the modified electrode based on the g-C 3 N 4 /α-Fe 2 O 3 hybrids are also used for the non-enzymatic detection of glucose. The as-fabricated modified electrode exhibits good electrochemical performance towards the oxidation of glucose with a response time <3 s and a linear range of 2.0 × 10 −6 − 2.4 × 10 −3 mol L −1 . The electrode modified by the g-C 3 N 4 /α-Fe 2 O 3 composites exhibits good anti-interference performance and stability. The g-C 3 N 4 /α-Fe 2 O 3 hybrids have great potential in the application of electrochemical storage devices and sensors.
