The demand for renewable energy resources has become of prime interest in the modern age due to the depletion of fossil fuel, environmental pollution, and its unaffordable cost. Solar and wind energies are fascinating alternatives, but the limitations of these renewable resources are weather and day-night dependent efficiency of the system. In order to overcome these issues, backup energy storage systems need to be integrated to avoid intermittent power supply. Among the electrochemical energy storage systems, supercapattery/supercapacitors have drawn much attention. The supercapattery/supercapacitors offer high power density but suffer from low energy density. Different strategies are being utilized to improve their energy density, one of them is to design advance novel electrode materials which play key roles in enhancing the overall performance. This chapter discusses the noble metal-based ternary nanocomposites which have been exploited as active materials for supercapattery/supercapacitors, because they are useful to enhance the specific capacitance, electrochemical conductivity, and also improve the thermal and chemical strengths of the electrode constituted materials. The advances of ternary electrode materials based on noble metals with transition metals and conducting platforms such as carbonaceous materials and conducting polymers are assessed. This chapter summarizes and outlines the current progress and investigation into noble metal-based ternary composite electrode materials for supercapattery, with the inclusion of synthesis approaches, electrochemical functioning, and associated energy storage devices.
