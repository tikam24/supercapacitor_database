In this academic research, we report a facile carbonization approach to fabricate Ni3S2 nanoparticles immobilized on interconnected carbon nanosheets (denoted as Ni/Ni3S2@CNS) derived from sodium alginate. The prepared hybrids provide more redox sites and shorten ion diffusion path. On the one hand, the interconnected carbon nanosheets restrain the agglomeration and dissolution of nanoparticles under the high carbonization temperature. On the other hand, it effectively improves the electrical conductivity, thus maintaining its excellent electrochemical properties. Consequently, the Ni/Ni3S2@CNS-2-800 electrode fulfills perfect specific capacity, satisfactory charge-discharge rate, and splendid lifespan. Furthermore, an advanced asymmetrical device is assembled by employing Ni/Ni3S2@CNS-2-800 and activated carbon as the electrode materials, which delivers a high specific capacitance (229.30 F g−1) and exceptional energy density (81.42 W h kg−1).
