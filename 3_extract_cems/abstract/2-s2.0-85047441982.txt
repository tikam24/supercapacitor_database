In situ contrast-matched neutron scattering was used to probe the electrolyte infiltration behavior of activated supercapacitor carbon electrodes using an aquoeus 1 M NaCl solution. It was found that only about 20% of the pore volume was infiltrated at chemical equilibrium. The partial infiltration can be attributed to the co-existence of hydrophilic and hydrophilic pores. The study suggests that for the achievement of optimal capacitance, supercapacitor electrodes should be evacuated before electrolyte infiltration.
