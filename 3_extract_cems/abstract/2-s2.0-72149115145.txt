Ru oxide/carbon fabric composites (Ru oxide/CF) were prepared by impregnating carbon fabric (CF) with a hydrous RuO 2 suspension. Their properties were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and constant current discharging. Specific capacitance increased with increasing loading of Ru oxide. The apparent average specific capacitance of the Ru oxide component reached 1,085 F g -1 for a 9.15% loading, with a peak of 1,984 F g -1 at approximately 0.3 V vs Ag/AgCl. The presence of Ru oxide decreases the ionic resistance of the CF and appears to increase its specific capacitance by generating additional electroactive surface functionality.
