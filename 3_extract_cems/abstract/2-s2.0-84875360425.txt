Polyaniline (PANI) was synthesized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) with aniline as monomer in sulfuric acid (H2SO4) electrolyte. The structure and morphology of PANI were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. The electrochemical properties of electrode which was consisted of PANI powder were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge (CP) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 2 mol/L KOH electrolyte. The results suggest that PANI doped with H2SO4 by electrochemical deposition exhibits good crystallinity and shows a nanorods morphology. The specific capacitance is up to 421.11 F/g at a current density of 20 mA/cm2. PANI turns out to be a prospect materials for supercapacitor.
