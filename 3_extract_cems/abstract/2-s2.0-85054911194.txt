In this article, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was modified with conducting polymer polyaniline (PANI) to produce composite supporters (PANI-CNTs), and then the MnO 2 /PANI-CNTs composite material was prepared by hydrothermal route through the oxidation of manganese sulfate using ammonium persulphate (APS) as oxidizing agent. XRD, FT-IR, SEM and laser Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize the composition and structure of materials, meanwhile the electrochemical properties of the material were also investigated. In addition, a series of materials such as MnO 2 , MnO 2 -CNTs, MnO 2 -PANI with different supporters were also prepared to investigated the support effects on the structure and electrochemical properties of composite materials. The characterization results show that the dispersion of MnO 2 in composites was greatly affected by the constitution of supports. In comparison with poor MnO 2 dispersion on MnO 2 /CNTs, as for the composite materials including PANI, the anchoring of Mn 2+ through covalent bond between PANI and Mn 2+ , which would help to disperse the MnO 2 , and then uniform ‘starfish-type’ MnO 2 was achieved on MnO 2 /PANI-CNTs composite. Moreover, the addition of PANI would improve the conductivity of composite materials. In conclusion, high electrical conductivity and MnO 2 dispersion on MnO 2 /PANI-CNTs composite results in higher specific capacitance (391F/g), which was triple value of specific capacitance for pure MnO 2 (132 F/g). Moreover, high specific capacitance retention (90%) for MnO 2 /PANI-CNTs composite displays good electrochemical stability in comparison with other composites.
