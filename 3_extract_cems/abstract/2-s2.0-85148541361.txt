Plant ash and eggshells are explored to serve as natural activation agent and template to prepare N, O, and S co-doped carbon (KDPC) with porous structure from biomass - Descurainia sophia seeds. The obtained KDPC-20-600 shows a high yield of 75 % and a relatively high specific capacitance of 250.5 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in 2 M KOH, which maintains 232.8 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1, superior or comparable with commercial active carbon. Also, the KDPC-20-600 demonstrates a long-term cycling life with a capacitance retention of 99.0 % after 10,000 cycles. Furthermore, the KDPC-20-600-based symmetric supercapacitor displays a high energy density of 24.8 Wh kg−1 at 1050 W kg−1 in 1 M Na2SO4. The findings indicate that environmentally friendly agents (e.g., plant ash, eggshells) can substitute harsh chemicals (e.g., KOH, H3PO4) to synthesize porous carbon from biomass materials in-situ doped with heteroatoms. Therefore, this cost-effective, environmentally friendly and sustainable process to obtain porous carbon will shed light on the development of electroactive materials for energy storage and conversion devices.
