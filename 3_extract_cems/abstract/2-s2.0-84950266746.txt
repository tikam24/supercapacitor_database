Facile synthesis of porous and high conductive materials is highly desirable for supercapacitor electrode application. In this work, hierarchical porous CoMn(CoMn)2O4 spinel coated on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was synthesized successfully through mixed solvothermal process followed by calcination. By adjusting the solvent ratio of dimethyl formamide (DMF): deionized (DI) water used in the mixed solvothermal process, the surface morphology of CoMn(CoMn)2O4/rGO can be tuned from nanofiber to nanoplate. The nanoplates display the highest surface area of 133.1 m2 g-1 with the pore size of âˆ¼3 nm, whereas the corresponding electrode exhibits the highest capacitance of 571 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1, with the working potential as high as 1 V. In addition, the electrode based on nanoplates can retain about 84% of the initial capacitance after 1500 cycles at a charge current density of 5 A g-1. These results confirm that the mesoporous CoMn(CoMn)2O4 nanoplates supported on rGO, synthesized the facile method described here, is a promising candidate for supercapacitor applications.
