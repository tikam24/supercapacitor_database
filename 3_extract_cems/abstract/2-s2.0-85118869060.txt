The current investigation addresses the alternating current electrical properties, electrochemical characteristics on biopolymer as Withania somnifera leaf extract incorporated sodium alginate [WLISA] polymer film prepared by solution casting method. Some crystallinity along with the amorphous nature of sodium alginate emerged due to the incorporation of Withania somnifera leaf extract [WSLE]. Two absorption maximum (λmax) were obtained for both WLISA and WSLE samples in the UV–Vis spectrum. The blue, green, and red emission of WSLE and weak blue emission of WLISA are studied by PL analysis. The more amount of strain that occurred in crystallization provides broaden peak in X-ray diffraction pattern. With aid of guluronic and mannuronic acids in sodium alginate making hydroxyl bond formation with leaf extract due to the cross-linking process can be analyzed from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The EDAX analysis showed the chemical composition of WSLE. At room temperature, the prepared 5 ml leaf extract WLISA film has demonstrated the highest ionic conductivity in the typical value of 2.80 × 10–6 S/Cm. The electrochemical window of the prepared polymer film is in the range of − 0.4 to 0.4 V suggesting that used as an electrolyte for supercapacitor applications.
