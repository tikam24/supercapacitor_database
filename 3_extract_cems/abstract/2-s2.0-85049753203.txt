Nanostructured carbon materials are the first preference for fabricating electrodes as they have intrinsic conductivity, excellent chemical stability and high surface area. In this report, a novel two dimensional (2D) holey carbon nanosheet was prepared by pyrolysis of a composite of resorcinol–formaldehyde resin (RF) and calcium acetate (CA), followed by acid etching and base activation. The results reveal that CA plays a crucial role in the formation of the 2D holey carbon nanosheet. The CaO originated from the decomposition of CA was found not only to act a template for the holes, but a catalyst for the graphitic carbon. The obtained carbon nanosheet exhibited uniformly distributed holes with an average diameter of 60 nm. The hierarchical micro/mesoporous structure has a high surface area of 1258.2 m2 g−1, which is great for the fabrication of electrode materials in supercapacitor. It delivered a specific capacitance of 360.1 F g−1 at the current density of 1.0 A g−1 in 6.0 M KOH solution. Furthermore, a two-electrode symmetric supercapacitor based on the carbon material displayed an energy density of 13.3 Wh kg−1 at a high power density of 7125 Wkg–1. The supercapacitor also showed superior rate capability, cycle stability and great potential for use in practical applications.
