The three-dimensional (3D), nitrogen doped reduced graphene oxide (N-RGO) monoliths have been synthesized using graphene oxide and melamine through an ice-templated assembly. The self-assembled monoliths are accompanied with the considerable reduction of graphene oxide after annealing and specific surface area of 190 m2 g-1. The blue shift of approximately 22 cm-1 and 4 cm-1 in D and G bands for N-RGO is notified in Raman analysis, confirming the incorporation of nitrogen onto the graphene sheet. In addition, an extra peak at 1251 cm-1 appears possibly due to the stretching vibration of C-N bonds. The detailed doping configurations analyzed by x-ray photoemission spectroscopy indicate the nitrogen content of around 6.2 at% in the N-RGO with predominant pyridinic N-type configuration. The specific capacitance is enhanced up to 217 F g-1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1, which is approximately three times higher than that of the pristine 3D RGO owing to the pseudocapacitive behavior of N-RGO. The high electronic conductivity of the N-RGO electrode with low charge transfer resistance as confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is associated with good rate capability. Furthermore, the N-RGO sample exhibits an excellent cyclic stability with no decay in capacitance even after 5000 cycles at scan rate of 100 mV s-1.
