Two-dimensional (2D) composites with characteristics of high conductivity, good redox activity and large microporosity are constructed via sandwiching reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets with conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) containing built-in redox-active ferrocene moieties. The integration of redox-active CMPs and conductive rGO within a 2D porous framework gives rise to remarkable faradaic energy storage as well as fast charge/energy transfer between the electrode and the electrolyte. As a result, the supercapacitors fabricated with these 2D hybrids possess remarkable capacitance at varied current density and excellent cycling stability. Thanks to the structural flexibility of CMPs, this strategy opens an avenue towards the design of new-generation supercapacitors and other electrochemical devices with molecular accuracy.
