Co/Ni-based hydroxide phosphate (CNHP) hollow polyhedrons with multiple-shell are synthesized by a cobalt-nickle layered double hydroxide (Co/Ni-LDH) coating and step-by-step phosphate etching strategy with ZIF-67 dodecahedron as templates. Through rational controlling the LDH coating and Na3PO4 etching time, double shells Co/Ni-(PO4)x(OH)y hollow polyhedron (DS-CNHP) and triple shells Co/Ni-(PO4)x(OH)y hollow polyhedron (TS-CNHP) are successfully constructed. The as-obtained TS-CNHP presents a high specific capacitance of 1506 ​F ​g−1 at the current density of 1 ​A ​g−1, and excellent ratio performance of maintaining 68% initial capacitance from 1 to 10 ​A ​g−1. Furthermore, a hybrid TS-CNHP//AC supercapacitor device is fabricated, and a high energy density of 34.4 ​Wh·kg−1 is achieved at the power density of 0.375 ​kW ​kg−1. Therefore, the step-by-step strategy in this work can provide valuable guidance to construct MOFs derived multiple-shell hollow structures with wide applications.
