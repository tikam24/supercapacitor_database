We report the preparation of a nickel-foam-supported graphene sheet/porous NiO hybrid film by the combination of electrophoretic deposition and chemical-bath deposition. The obtained graphene-sheet film of about 19 layers was used as the nanoscale substrate for the formation of a highly porous NiO film made up of interconnected NiO flakes with a thickness of 10-20 nm. The graphene sheet/porous NiO hybrid film exhibits excellent pseudocapacitive behavior with pseudocapacitances of 400 and 324 F g-1 at 2 and 40 A g-1, respectively, which is higher than those of the porous NiO film (279 and 188 F g-1 at 2 and 40 A g-1). The enhancement of the pseudocapacitive properties is due to reinforcement of the electrochemical activity of the graphene-sheet film. Â© 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
