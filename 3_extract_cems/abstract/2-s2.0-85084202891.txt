The exploration of high-performance supercapacitors (SCs) has attracted wide attention worldwide. Herein, iron cobalt oxide (FeCo2O4) nanocomposites were prepared by using soft-template and hydrothermal method. The prepared FeCo2O4 electrode material presented good dispersivity and had different flower-like structures and flocculent structures, which exhibited high capacitance and cyclic stability. Specially, the FeCo2O4 electrode with the usage of 0.5 g polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), and none template agents showed high capacitance of 1231.1, 956.2, 1027.8, and 677.3 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. Furthermore, we used an optimized FeCo2O4 electrode material as the positive electrode, activated carbon (AC) as the negative electrode, and 6 M KOH solution as the electrolyte to assemble an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC). The resulting ASC device exhibits a favorable energy density of 51.2 Wh kg−1 and a high power density of 775.4 W kg−1.
