Graphene/polyaniline/Co3O4 ternary composites were synthesized by a facile route using graphene oxide/polyaniline (GO/PANI) and cobalt salts as raw materials through hydrothermal treatment. The composites prepared by the novel two-step method presented an interconnected lamella structure in which the Co3O4 nanoparticles uniformly dispersed on the ultrathin graphene nanosheets, and exhibited an outstanding performance with large specific capacitance of 789.7 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1. Furthermore, their capacitance retained 81.8% at 10 A g-1 for 1000 cycles, which indicated it could be a promising supercapacitor with a superior capacitance and cycling stability.
