Lignin, as one of the most abundant natural polymers, has been proved to be a promising material for the construction of high-performance electrochemical energy systems, including electrodes, electrolytes, and separators, because of their low-cost and sustainable natures and unique structure with abundant functional group. In this review article, we outline some key contributions in this field such as fundamental principles and various electrochemical energy systems including rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors, solar cells, and fuel cells. At the same time, we also point out the significant scientific discussion and critical barriers for lignin-based materials for electrochemical energy systems and also provides feasible strategies for preparing new sustainable energy materials.
