The present paper aims to propose a real-time energy management strategy (EMS) based on two-phase interleaved buck-boost and boost converters for Fuel Cell/supercapacitor hybrid system. The interleaved converter (IC) is chosen to be applied in this work thanks to advantages, which presents compared to conventional DC/DC converter, as low input current ripples, a higher efficiency, a faster transient response, a reduced electromagnetic emission and an improved reliability. The proposed converters control strategies continuously support the EMS, based on frequency distribution to coordinate the hybrid power supply system, under variable load power conditions. In order to implement the proposed controllers, a laboratory test bench is applied to conduct experimental validation of the adopted structure. Experiments FC/SC hybrid system with the developed EMS was performed for variable load and the experiment waveforms of each power source are included. The obtained results suggest that the proposed energy management algorithm and the converters controllers present good performances.
