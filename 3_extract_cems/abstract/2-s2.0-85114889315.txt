Present work successfully demonstrates the synthesis of ion diffused ant colony-like porous carbon structure (PSWC) with high surface roughness from seaweed using a facile pre-carbonization NaCl treatment, followed by carbonization at 800°C. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy studies confirm the retention of natural redox groups such as pyrrolic N, pyridinic N, oxidized sulfur, carboxyl, Fe3+, and Zn2+ and the diffusion of Na+ and Cl− ions in the PSWC. The electrochemical analysis of PSWC reveals that NaCl treatment further enhances the performance, and the redox groups and transition metal ions facilitate the faradic battery-type energy storage with an excellent specific capacitance of 904.44 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 of current density in a classic three-electrode system. The fabricated polyvinyl alcohol-potassium hydroxide gel electrolyte-based quasi-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor device exhibits good energy density and power density of 52.15 Wh kg−1 and 362.14 W Kg−1, respectively with a superior cyclic life (98.94% capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles). The overall eco-friendliness, low cost, availability, facile synthesis process, sustainability, facile upscale synthesis, and excellent electrochemical properties provide a potential application of PSWC in advanced energy storage systems.
