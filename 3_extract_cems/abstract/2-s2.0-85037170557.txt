A hierarchical nanocomposites of NiMoO4@Ni(OH)2 is fabricated via hydrothermal and electrodeposition method. The electrochemical tests performed using cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy display that the hierarchical NiMoO4@Ni(OH)2 nanocomposites exhibits superior supercapacitive performance to those of NiMoO4 and Ni(OH)2, respectively. The initial specific capacitance for NiMoO4@Ni(OH)2 is 1278 F g− 1 at a current density of 1 mA cm− 2. The Nyquist plot of the NiMoO4@Ni(OH)2 reveals low Rct and its EIS data fitted by Zsimpwin software matched well with the primary data.
