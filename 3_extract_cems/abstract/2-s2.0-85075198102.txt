In this research paper, we present a DC hybrid power system HPS consists of PV, wind and hybrid storage system HESS includes batteries and supercapacitor devices. Such a system is destined to supply an island remote village in a Saharian zone in Algeria. The main objective of this work is to ensure an uninterruptible power supply UPS for the systemâ€™s appliances during normal and critical cases caused by the intermittent nature of the renewable sources REs. Therefore, a comparative analysis is carried out between four MPPT technics, which are Perturb and Observe P & O, Incremental Conductance IC, P & O with a PI regulator, and power limitation technics. Thus, two energy management policies are implemented to control the charge-discharge, injected and absorbed currents, and operating voltages of the storage devices. Besides, seven test scenarios have created by selecting an MPPT method with a storage management policy in each scenario to manage the shared energy between distributed energy resources DERs, storage system ESS and the load. Thus, these tests are achieved under variable solar resources and a specified load schedule. The main criteria for performance comparison are voltage, state of energy of the HESS, converters efficiencies, global efficiency of the system, spikes of current, and peaks of power. Moreover, the management strategies EMS aim to specify the battery reference currents based on load demand and the available renewable energy. In general, all scenarios have proved reliable results, whereas the optimized solution was with scenario 5, which has proved the highest efficiency of the system, stable voltage, extracted powers from PV and wind sources, and the stress on the HESS. The HPS is evaluated in Matlab Simulink, where results are compared and discussed.
