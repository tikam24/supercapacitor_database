A DC microgrid hybrid energy storage system (HESS) based on converter cascade structure and its control strategy are proposed in this paper. The HESS is composed of a dual active bridge bidirectional DC/DC converter (DAB-BDC) and a bidirectional buck/boost converter in cascade. The DAB-BDC is used to connect the ultracapacitor and DC bus in the front-end. The ultracapacitor is used to compensate the high frequency power fluctuations of the DC microgrid. The Buck/Boost bidirectional converter is used to connect the lithium battery and the ultracapacitor in the back-end. The lithium battery is used to indirectly compensate the low frequency power fluctuations of the DC microgrid through supplement power of the ultracapacitor. In this way, the HESS can not only compensate the power fluctuations of DC microgrid, but also realize the electrical isolation. And it effectively reduces the demand of energy storage equipment voltage. Meanwhile it can effectively reduce operation times and prolong the service life of lithium battery by partitioning of droop characteristic. At last, simulation results verify the proposed control strategy. According to the DC bus voltage information, the HESS can adjust the output power of HESS to maintain the DC bus voltage stable quickly.
