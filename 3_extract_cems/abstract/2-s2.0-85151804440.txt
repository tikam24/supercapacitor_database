In this report, Iron (Fe) doped nickel sulfide (NiS) nanoparticles integrated with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) have been prepared by hydrothermal and ultrasonication approach. X-rays studies of synthesized samples showed the existence of single-phase hexagonal Fe–NiS along MWCNTs with crystallite size of 13.19 nm. SEM images indicated spherical Fe–NiS particles encapsulated by long and thin thread like MWCNTs. Fe–NiS@MWCNTs was drop casted on nickel foam (NF) for the supercapacitor application. Fe–NiS@MWCNTs/NF offered a specific capacity of 662C g−1 at 5 mV s−1 with excellent cyclic stability. Fe–NiS@MWCNTs/NF maintained 70.2% of initial specific capacity at a high scan rate of 100 mV s−1. For impedance studies, a small equivalent series resistance (ESR = 2.30 Ω) and charge transfer resistance (RCT = 3.12 Ω) were observed for Fe–NiS@MWCNTs/NF. The superior electrochemical performance of Fe–NiS@MWCNTs/NF can be accredited to the large surface area and intervened network of Fe–NiS@MWCNTs. Pseudocapacitive Fe–NiS and highly conductive MWCNTs generate synergistic effects that ultimately boost up the specific capacity of Fe–NiS@MWCNTs/NF electrode. The excellent electrochemical performance of proposes Fe–NiS@MWCNTs/NF as effective electroactive material for supercapacitor applications.
