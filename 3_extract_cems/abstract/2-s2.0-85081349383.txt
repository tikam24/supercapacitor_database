A growing number of electric industry leaders agree that it is only a matter of time before renewable energy resources dominate their grid systems. In the context of increasing interest for smart grids, grid-connected renewable energy systems play a major role. However, the increasing renewable energy penetration poses typical challenges for the existing power system like stability, protection, and power quality issues. This indicates the necessity of a proper channel for the efficient and stable inclusion of such sporadic generation. DC microgrid acts as an effective platform for such purposes due to its renowned characteristics like increased efficiency, reduced complexity in control, negligible power quality issues, etc. In this perspective, this chapter presents the control and energy management in a grid-connected DC microgrid comprising of solar PV array, battery, and supercapacitor banks in order to maximize the synchronized grid integration of the renewable energy along with the objective of stabilizing the DC microgrid. Modeling and analysis of the system are carried out in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment and vital operating scenarios associated with the system are tested to evaluate its performance. The results presented in this chapter convey the effectiveness of the control and energy management employed to the system in stably integrating the renewable energy against the operating constraints associated with the system components.
