A hydrogen ion supercapacitor cell was constructed with an electrochemical double-layer carbon material as positive electrode and an electrochemical hydrogen storage composite material as negative electrode. The electrochemical performances of both electrodes and hybrid device were investigated by varying of the mass ratio of positive and negative electrode. It was found to be that both electrodes went through the different hydrogen ion storage processes and the capacity of this hybrid supercapacitor was highly correlated with the negative to the positive electrode ratio. The highest capacity was achieved at ratio of 1:7; further increasing of this ratio may downgrade the performance of the hybrid system. With this optimized ratio, the hybrid device demonstrated good electrochemical performance.
