In this work, porous NiMn2O4 nanosheets with large surface areas are successfully grown by a hydrothermal method and examined as electrodes for supercapacitors. Results have shown that the supercapacitor based on NiMn2O4 electrodes exhibits the highest specific capacitance of 1321.6 F g−1 at a scan rate of 2 A g−1, much higher than those of other supercapacitors made of metal oxides and composites. The NiMn2O4 supercapacitor also shows a good cycling behavior, only 6.5 % capacitance decay after 1500 cycles. The NiMn2O4 nanosheets possess a robust mechanical adhesion to Ni foam, which has been demonstrated by an ultrasonication test.
