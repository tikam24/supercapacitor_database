A hybrid Fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative (Fuzzy-PID)-based control algorithm is introduced for a non-dissipative (active) charge equalization scheme consisting of a supercapacitor and two-stage bidirectional DC-DC converter. The proposed control algorithm intelligently modulates the balancing parameters while realizing the cell-to-pack-to-cell (C2P2C) balancing of a lithium-ion battery pack. The charge imbalance and charging/discharging profile are considered by the Fuzzy-logic algorithm to determine the balancing current that not only enhances the balancing speed but also ensures the operation under a safe operating region and a longer battery life. Accurate determination of cell state of charge (SOC) is highly challenging, here the proposed Fuzzy-based control algorithm eliminates the necessity of accurate SOC determination that eventually reduces the computational cost and necessity of highly precise sensors. The proposed topology requires fewer active components due to the utilization of C2P2C balancing, resulting in a simple control algorithm and lower implementation cost. The supercapacitor is used as an energy buffer to enhance the robustness and life of the balancing circuitry. Simulation studies are conducted in MATLAB-Simscape to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Further, a comparative study with the state-of-the-art is performed to demonstrate the superiority of the scheme.
