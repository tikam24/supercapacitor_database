For the first time, a composite CuO/Co3O4 electrode material is explored for supercapacitor applications. In this report, we synthesized a Co3O4 and CuO-decorated Co3O4 (CuO/Co3O4) composite material using a facile hydrothermal method. Compared to the Co3O4 electrode, the CuO/Co3O4 electrode delivered a high specific capacitance of 806.25 F g-1 at 2 A g-1 and superior cycling stability with a retention of 99.75% after 2000 cycles. Excitingly, the CuO/Co3O4 electrode showed excellent electrochemical performance under various bending angles, demonstrating superior flexibility.
