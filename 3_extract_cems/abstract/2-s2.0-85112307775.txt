Advanced carbon materials with high specific surface area (SSA), porous structure, and good conductivity are the key factors to obtaining efficient energy storage and conversion devices. Here, a simple gas-phase cycle reaction was used to prepare a carbon material with 3D honeycomb structure derived from seaweed powder. The as-obtained carbon material (CS-2) exhibited excellent SSA (1206.97 m2 g-1) and good surface wetting properties. In particular, the CS-2 material exhibits very high specific capacitance (448.3 F g-1) and stable cycle life (âˆ¼91.39% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles) due to the special porous structure on its surface. To test the applicability of the material in practice, CS-2 was assembled into a simple symmetrical supercapacitor (SC), which achieved a maximum energy density of 3.125 W h kg-1. The above performance analysis indicates that the carbon material based on seaweed powder can be efficiently used as an electrode material for SCs.
