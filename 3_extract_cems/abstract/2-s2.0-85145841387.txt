Designing multifunctional nanomaterials for high performing electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices has been very challenging. A number of strategies have been reported to introduce multifunctionality in electrode/catalyst materials including alloying, doping, nanostructuring, compositing, etc. Here, we report the fabrication of a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-based ternary composite NiO/MnO2/rGO (NMGO) having a range of active sites for enhanced electrochemical activity. The resultant sandwich structure consisted of a mesoporous backbone with NiO and MnO2 nanoparticles encapsulated between successive rGO layers, having different active sites in the form of Ni-, Mn-, and C-based species. The modified structure exhibited high conductivity owing to the presence of rGO, excellent charge storage capacity of 402 F·g−1 at a current density of 1 A·g−1, and stability with a capacitance retention of ~93% after 14,000 cycles. Moreover, the NMGO//MWCNT asymmetric device, assembled with NMGO and multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as positive and negative electrodes, respectively, exhibited good energy density (28 Wh·kg−1), excellent power density (750 W·kg−1), and capacitance retention (88%) after 6000 cycles. To evaluate the multifunctionality of the modified nanostructure, the NMGO was also tested for its oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The NMGO delivered a current density of 10 mA·cm−2 at the potential of 1.59 V versus RHE. These results clearly demonstrate high activity of the modified electrode with strong future potential.
