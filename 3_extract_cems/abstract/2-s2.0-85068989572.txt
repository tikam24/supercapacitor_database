In this paper, a novel three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical structure of CuCo2S4@Co(OH)2 core-shell hybrid electrode was reported. It uses self-supporting nanoneedles CuCo2S4 without organic binders synthesized by hydrothermal method as ideal conductive supports for Co(OH)2 nanosheets. The prepared CuCo2S4@Co(OH)2 composite electrode has good electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 2066 F⋅g−1 at 1 A⋅g−1 (highest specific capacity of 258 mAh⋅g−1) and a high capacitance retention rate (over 82.76% at 10 A⋅g−1 after 1000 cycles). The asymmetric supercapacitor device (CuCo2S4@Co(OH)2//AC) has an energy density of 37.58 Wh⋅kg−1 at 795.8 W⋅kg−1, and a high capacitance retention rate over 84.10% after 5000 cycles at 10 A⋅g−1, which exhibits the enormous potential of this hybrid nanostructure as high performance supercapacitor electrode material.
