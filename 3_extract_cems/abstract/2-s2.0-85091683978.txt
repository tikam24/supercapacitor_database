A highly ionic-conductive and high-performance neutral pH polymer electrolyte comprises of Na2SO4 and polyacrylamide (PAM) was developed for solid electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs). Na2SO4 was compared with Li2SO4 baseline in liquid electrolyte and exhibited higher ionic conductivity and identical stability window. Na2SO4−PAM electrolytes were optimized by varying their salt-to-polymer ratio. While all compositions show excellent stability for over 30-day tracking period, an ionic conductivity of ca. 30 mS cm−1 was attained at 10,000 : 1 molar ratio of Na2SO4:PAM, among the highest reported for neutral pH polymer electrolytes. Raman spectroscopy verified that the electrolyte maintained well-hydrated ions throughout the 30 days monitoring period. Solid EDLCs were constructed using activated carbon electrodes and Na2SO4−PAM electrolyte. They exhibited a wide 1.9 V operating window at 50 mV s−1 CV scan rate, with comparable capacitance to its liquid baseline. The solid EDLCs outperformed many symmetric devices in terms of energy and power densities. They also displayed good rate capability (up to 500 mV s−1) and excellent cycle life (>8,000 cycles).
