The spinel NiMn2O4 has been directly grown on 3D nickel foam by combining a simple microwave-assisted hydrothermal with annealing process at different temperatures (350 °C to 650 °C), which can be used as a binder-free electrode for high-performance supercapacitors. The results indicate that the pure NiMn2O4 can be obtained below 550 °C. The as-prepared NiMn2O4 at 450 °C has the largest specific capacitance of 802 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and excellent cycle stability (61 % capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 10 A g−1) among all the obtained samples. This outstanding electrochemical performance may be attributed to its relatively large grain size, high specific surface area, and appropriate pore structure. This indicates that NiMn2O4 grown on nickel foam shows great potential as an electrode material for supercapacitors.
