Bacterial cellulose (BC) is an appealing biomass for developing functional electrodes with multiple components along their cross-linked nanofibers. Herein, we demonstrate a BC-directed ternary composite through the successive layer-assembly of polypyrrole (PPy) and bimetallic hydroxide (NiMn-LDH). In our strategy, both in-situ layer-by-layer depositions have been realized at mild conditions (≤25 °C). By tailoring the feeding weights of PPy/BC in NiMn-LDH precursor solutions, the ternary composites the maximum loading of NiMn-LDH has achieved with the highest specific surface. The optimized BC-based electrode material delivers a specific capacity of 653.1 C g−1 at a current density of 1.0 A g−1. Hybrid supercapacitor by assembling NiMn-LDH/PPy/BC as cathode and Fe3O4@C/MWCNTs as anode shows stable performance with a high energy density of 29.8 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 299.0 W kg−1. Our strategy to prepare BC-based electrode materials may provide new opportunities for developing low-cost and efficient energy-storage devices.
