Three-dimensional (3D) MoS2/chemically modified graphene (CMG) aerogel composites are prepared by a hydrothermal reduction reaction. Such 3D architecture enables effective electron and ion transfer and stable distribution of 2D nanosheets. 3D MoS2/CMG composites are investigated as supercapacitor electrode materials, showing a high specific capacitance of 268 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1, a high rate capability with 87.7% retention up to 15 A g-1, and a good cycle life with 93% retention for 1000 cycles. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis reveals that the 3D interconnected structure of MoS2/CMG enhances the charge transfer and facilitates diffusion of electrolyte ions.
