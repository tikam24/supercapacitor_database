Fuel cell (FC) technology has been a major focus of attention for most automobile manufacturers across the world, especially for their ability to address the pollution problems associated with internal combustion engine vehicles. Hybridization has shown its effectiveness in overcoming these problems. Highly efficient online energy management strategies are then required in real-world applications. This paper proposes an online energy management strategy (EMS), based on a fuzzy logic approach, which seeks to increase the lifespan of the energy sources while satisfying two major restrictions: the short response of the fuel cell and the limits of the state of charge of the supercapacitor (SoC). The fuzzy logic system has two inputs: the power required for the traction power of the vehicle and the SoC and an output which is the power to be requested from fuel cell. This proposed strategy offers some advantages, such as less pressure on fuel cell therefore higher lifetime for it.
