Ni(OH)2·0.75H2O nanosheets embedded with NiMoO4 nanoparticles (NiMo-LDH) supported by nickel cobalt sulfur (NiCoS) nanorods were prepared by a multi-step hydrothermal method, which provides an effective channel for ion transport and abundant active sites for charge storage. The NiCoS@NiMo-LDH electrode exhibited a very high capacitance of 1302.5 μAh cm−2 at 10 mA cm−2, with 54 % capacitance retention observed at 50 mA cm−2. The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) assembled with the NiCoS@NiMo-LDH as the positive electrode and active carbon (AC) as the negative electrodes which exhibits an energy density of 1096.6 μWh cm−2 at a power density of 2.8 mW cm−2 along with good stability of 86.67 % after 5000 cycles.
