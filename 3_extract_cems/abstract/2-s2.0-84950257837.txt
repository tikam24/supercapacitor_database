We report the fabrication of high energy asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) using pseudocapacitive 3D microstructured composite NiCo2O4@Co3O4 and double layer forming activated carbon (AC). The pseudo capacitive electrode is synthesized via a facile two step hydrothermal process and AC is obtained from the bio-waste, Jackfruit (JF) peel by chemical activation. Extensive powder characterization and optimization has been conducted for both electrodes, especially in electrochemical aspect. The ASC is fabricated using JF derived AC as anode and NiCo2O4@Co3O4 cathode in aqueous media. Prior to the ASC assembly, the mass loading between the electrodes are adjusted based on the single electrode performance of both components vs. Ag/AgCl. The ASC is capable of delivering a maximum energy density of 42.5 Wh kg-1 at power density of 80 W kg-1. In addition, the ASC rendered excellent cycleability, for example, the cell retains âˆ¼97% of initial capacitance after 7000 cycles. The outstanding performance of the ASC is originated from the well-developed building blocks of porous electrodes. An impedance study is also conducted to corroborate the excellent performance of NiCo2O4@Co3O4 vs. JF derived AC based ASC.
