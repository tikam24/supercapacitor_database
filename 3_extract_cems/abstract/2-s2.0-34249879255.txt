As wind energy reaches higher penetration levels, there is a greater need to manage intermittency associated with the individual wind turbine generators. This paper considers the integration of a short-term energy storage device in a doubly fed induction generator design in order to smooth the fast wind-induced power variations. This storage device can also be used to reinforce the dc bus during transients, thereby enhancing its low-voltage ride through (LVRT) capability. The topology is evaluated in terms of its ability to improve the performance both during normal operation and during transients. Results show that when storage is sized based upon the LVRT requirement, it can effectively damp short-term power oscillations, and it provides superior transient performance when compared with conventional topologies.
