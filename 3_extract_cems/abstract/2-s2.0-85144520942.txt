Regenerative braking method can extend the driving range and can improve energy usage efficiency of an electric vehicle. Regenerative braking system of EV driven by BLDC motor is recommended because of its rugged construction, efficiency, reliability and life span. It can be done efficiently by making use of hybrid energy storage system (HESS) comprising both battery and supercapacitor. During regenerative braking, the voltage across the dc link is boosted by controlling the switching of lower switches of the inverter. So in this method, an inverter is used alone to drive the motor. This regenerated energy can be stored into batteryâ€“supercapacitor system. The simulation is done by using MATLAB Simulink. Drive cycle analysis of electric vehicle system also done through this work. Drive cycle analysis helps to determine the optimum parameters of the electric vehicle.
