Macro/meso/microporous carbon monoliths doped with sulfur have been prepared from sulfonated poly(divinylbenzene) networks followed by the activation with CO2 resulted in the activated carbon monoliths with high surface area of 2400 m2 g-1. The monolithic electrode of the activated carbon shows remarkably high specific capacitance (175 F g-1 at 5 mV s-1 and 206 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1). Â© The Royal Society of Chemistry.
