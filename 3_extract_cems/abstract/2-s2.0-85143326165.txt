The advantage of composites comes from the synergy between different material, that is, the engineering of interface effects between them. Well-developed surface effects between the materials help to maximize the properties and improve the stability of the composite. Herein, CoNiB@ca-CNTs composites were successfully prepared through a simple wet chemical reduction method by reducing the metal ions pre-anchored on the surface of carboxylated modified CNTs. Co0.25Ni0.75B@ca-CNTs composite were used as electrode materials for supercapacitor. It provides high specific capacitance (2078 F g−1 under 1 A g−1), outstanding rate performance (1802 F g−1 under 10 A g−1), and good cycling stability (87.8% retention rate at 5000 cycles). The constructed Co0.25Ni0.75B@ca-CNTs//AC (activated carbon) asymmetric supercapacitor obtained 180.3 F g−1 under 1 A g−1. It has an energy density of 67.4 Wh kg−1 at 400.4 W kg−1 and good stability (84.1% retention at 5000 cycles). In addition, Co0.75Ni0.25B@CNTs was used as catalyst with excellent catalytic activity for the hydrolysis of NaBH4, with hydrogen production rates of 6245.75 mL min−1 gcatalyst−1 and 18135.16 mL min−1 gCo,Ni−1 at 25 °C and low activation of 28.67 kJ mol−1. It has good catalytic stability remaining 72.6% after 10 catalytic hydrolysis cycles. The results demonstrate that CoNiB@ca-CNTs exhibit excellent performance and stability in the field of supercapacitors and hydrogen production from NaBH4 hydrolysis. This work has a good inspiration for the development of bifunctional composite materials in the future.
