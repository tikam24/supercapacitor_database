Polyaniline/Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (PANI/MWCNTs) nanocomposite was prepared via liquid-liquid interfacial polymerization method. The morphology studies of the nanocomposite using SEM and TEM techniques confirmed the presence of PANI as aggregates along with MWCNTs and X-ray diffraction studies indicated the presence of graphitic planes of MWCNTs along with PANI in semi-crystalline emeraldine salt form. The PANI/MWCNTs nanocomposite electrode exhibited specific capacitance (Cs) of 1551 F/g at a scan rate of 2 mV/s in aqueous 1 M H2SO4 in a potential window of 0–1.2 V. The material exhibited good cycle life with 95% capacitance retention in a life cycle test conducted at 5 A/g for 1000 cycles. Further, an asymmetric supercapacitor device (ASD) was fabricated using PANI/MWCNTs as positive and activated carbon as negative electrodes in aqueous 1 M H2SO4. The ASD exhibited a Cs of 142 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV/s in a wide potential range of 0–1.6 V. The device offered high energy and power densities of 29 Wh/Kg and 7.3 kW/Kg respectively and also demonstrated an excellent cyclic stability by retaining 97% of its initial capacitance after 5000 cycles at high current density of 20 A/g.
