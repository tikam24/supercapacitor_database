A two-step synthetic method is developed for the preparation of ternary CoMoO4/CuO heterostructure on Cu foam as binder-free and high-performance supercapacitor electrode. The synthesis approach involves a simple chemical bath deposition and hydrothermal reaction. CuO nanorods are obtained on Cu foam with chemical bath deposition, and CoMoO4 nanosheets are subsequently grown on as-prepared CuO nanorods to form multi-dimensional CoMoO4/CuO heterostructure by the hydrothermal procedure. The in situ grown CoMoO4/CuO heterostructure could be used as a binder-free supercapacitor electrode. The CoMoO4/CuO heterostructure delivers a significant specific capacitance of 1176 F g−1 under the scan rate of 1 mV s−1, which is distinctly higher than that of the bare CoMoO4 electrode. The galvanostatic charge and discharge tests reveal the CoMoO4/CuO heterostructure electrode has excellent cycle stability, maintaining 95.1% capacitance retention under 2.5 A g−1 after 5000 cycles. These superior performances could be original from the unique multi-dimensional CoMoO4/CuO heterostructure which provides more active sites and additional electron transport channels. These results have promoted the potential implementation of multi-dimensional heterostructure for advanced electrochemical capacitors.
