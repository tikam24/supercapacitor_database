In the paper a frequency-controlled electric drive with an energy storage system, based on supercapacitors, is considered. The description of the research object is given. The structure of the mathematical model of an asynchronous electric drive with an energy storage device is presented. The main task of investigation of electric drive under operation with a cyclic variable load, which combines reactive and active static torque components, is formulated. a method for determining the maximum acceptable heating load of an induction motor is presented. The simulation results of the motor operating modes under control both with a constant rotor flux and optimal control with minimum stator current are presented. Based on the typical tachogram and load diagram for hoisting mechanisms, the resource of a squirrel-cage induction motor, according to the criterion of the acceptable from the heating point of view motor torque, was detected. a comparative analysis of the motor power losses with a cyclic variable load of an electric drive at controls with a constant flux linkage and with minimum stator current was carried out. Main conclusions about the energy efficiency of using the control law with minimum stator current and its influence on the dynamics of energy storage system as part of an electric drive, operating in modes with a cyclic variable load, is given.
