Activated carbons prepared by chemical activation from three different types of waste woods were treated with four agents: melamine, ammonium carbamate, nitric acid, and ammonium persulfate, for the introduction of nitrogen and oxygen groups on the surface of materials. The results indicate that the presence of the heteroatoms enhances the capacitance, energy density, and power density of all samples. The samples treated with ammonium persulfate show the maximum of capacitance of 290 F g-1 while for the melamine, ammonium carbamate, and nitric acid treatments, the samples reached the maximum capacitances values of 283, 280, and 455 F g-1 respectively. This remarkable electro-chemical performance, as the high specific capacitances can be due to several reasons: i) The excellent and adequate textural characteristics makes possible a large adsorption interface for electrolyte to form the electrical double layer, leading to a great electrochemical double layer capacitance. ii) The doping with hetero-atoms enhances the surface interaction of these materials with the aqueous electrolyte, increasing the accessibility of electrolyte ions. iii) The hetero-atoms groups can also provide considerable pseudo-capacitance improving the overall capacitance.
