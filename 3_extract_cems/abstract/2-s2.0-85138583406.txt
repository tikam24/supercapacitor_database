In this study, photolysis and immobilization of bis(aminopyridine)-Cu on the surface of SiO2-coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles were used to create core-shell composites of magnetite (Fe3O4) and Fe3O4@SiO2-bis(aminopyridine)-Cu. FTIR, ICP-AES, XRD, XPS, FESEM-EDS-mapping, and TEM were used to identify the structural characteristics of the catalyst. TGA was used to test the prepared materials' thermal stability, and CV, GCD, and EIS were used to assess their electrochemical characteristics. The successful shelling of SiO2 around Fe3O4 with a size of 20 nm was confirmed by the TEM images. The results of the electrochemical tests demonstrate that the performance of the synthetic materials is typical for supercapacitors. The shell of SiO2-bis(aminopyridine)-Cu can boost Fe3O4's reversibility and storage energy. After 1000 cycles at 5 A/g, the Fe3O4. The Fe3O4@SiO2-bis(aminopyridine)-Cu electrode exhibits good specific capacitance of 265 F/g and excellent cyclic stability with a retention ratio of 85% compared to pure magnetite's 67 percent
