Helical hierarchical porous Na x MnO 2 /CC and MoO 2 /CC, which are assembled from nanosheets and nanoparticles, respectively, are fabricated using a simple electrodeposition method. These unique helical porous structures enable electrodes to have a high capacitance and an outstanding cycling performance. Based on the helical Na x MnO 2 /CC as the positive electrodes and helical MoO 2 /CC as the negative electrodes, high performance Na x MnO 2 /CC//MoO 2 /CC asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) are successfully assembled, and they achieve a maximum volume C sp of 2.04 F cm -3 and a maximum energy density of 0.92 mW h cm -3 for the whole device and an excellent cycling stability with 97.22% C sp retention after 6000 cycles.
