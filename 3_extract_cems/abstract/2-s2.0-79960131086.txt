The ultimate physical limit approach is applied to the case of electrode nanostructures of double electric layer (DEL) supercapacitors (SCs) on the basis of advanced superionic conductors (AdSIC) required for the development of many high-tech directions. New nanoionic fundamentals (notion, criteria and estimations) are introduced and the ways for the creation of advanced carbon-based nanostructures suited for different types of SCs are proposed.
