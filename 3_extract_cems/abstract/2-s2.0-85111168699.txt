Aiming at the characteristics of unstable wind power during the ship's sailing process, this paper uses a multi-lithium battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system to store electrical energy, and stabilizes the severe fluctuations in wind power. The utilization of electrical energy in the ship's power grid has been improved. Utilizing the fast charging and discharging characteristics of supercapacitors, a control strategy for supercapacitor switching charging and discharging was designed to improve the energy utilization rate.
