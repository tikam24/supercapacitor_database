WO3 nano-fibers with super large aspect ratio are synthesized on a Cu conductive current collector by using a simple hydrothermal method. The as-prepared WO3 nano-fibers can accommodate a large number of electrolyte ions and provide a rapid route for the migration of electrons and electrolyte ions due to its direct growth, high specific surface area, and one dimensional (1D) pipeline structure. The WO3 nano-fibers exhibit excellent cyclic reversibility (98% at 1.0 A g−1), good cycling stability (93% after 5000 cycles), high specific capacitance (436 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1) and low charge transfer resistance (29 Ω). After the WO3 nano-fibers are assembled into a symmetric supercapacitor, the symmetric supercapacitor device has a wide effective operating range of 0–1.8 V and high energy density of 99.0 W h kg−1 at the power density of 450 W kg−1. The good electrochemical performances of as-prepared WO3 nano-fibers make it an attractive candidate for high energy storage systems and promising supercapacitor electrode material.
