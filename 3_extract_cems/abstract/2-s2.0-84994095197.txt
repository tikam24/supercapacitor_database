The alga as solid carbon source, which has adsorption characteristics for metal ions, can adsorb metal ion catalyst uniformly without the conditions of biomass material modification. Three dimensional porous graphene was synthesized by combination of high temperature metallic catalysis and chemical activation using alga as the precursor. The morphology and structure of the three dimensional porous graphene was characterized with scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman and N2 adsorption/desorption, while its capacitive properties were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. The results showed that the porous graphene had three-dimensional network structure, with a relatively high graphitization degree and a high specific surface area of 1 700 m2/g. The internal pore size of porous graphene ranged from 2 to 10 nm. The supercapacitor based on the porous graphene showed good electrochemical capacitance (up to 90 F/g at 1 mV/s). In the two-electrode symmetric supercapacitor, relatively high energy densities and power densities could be achieved.
