In this work, the binary and ternary composites composed respectively by carbon fiber/polyaniline(CF/PAni) and carbon fiber/multiwall carbon nanotubes/polyaniline (CF/PAni/MWCNT) were synthesized by oxidative polymerization. The composite materials were physically characterized by Scanning electron microscopy, by Raman spectroscopy and electrochemically by cyclic voltammetry. These hybrid composites were designed to be used as supercapacitors. By Raman spectroscopy, a higher conductivity for the CF/PAni/MWCNT composite was observed composite was observed.The highest specific capacitance was achieved to CF/PAni/MWCNT (400Fg-1) which is a good candidate to the supercapacitor electrode.
