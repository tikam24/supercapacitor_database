In order to enhance specific capacitance and energy density of carbon-based supercapacitor, some nanometer-scale amorphous particles of nickel oxide were loaded into activated-carbon by suspending the activated-carbon in a Ni(NO 3)2 solution followed by neutralization. A hybrid type electrochemical capacitor was made and tested, in which the activated-carbon loaded with nickel oxide was used as cathode material and activated-carbon was used as anode material. Although the BET surface area of the activated-carbon decreased upon nickel oxide loading compared to that of the starting material, its specific capacitance increased 10.84%, from 175.40 to 194.01 F g -1 and the potential of oxygen evolution on the composite material electrode was 0.076 V higher than that of the pure activated-carbon electrode, in the electrolyte of 6 mol/L KOH solution, so the hybrid capacitor had larger energy density. Similar to the pure activated-carbon electrode, no obvious change appears on the specific capacitances of the composite material electrode at various discharge currents and the composite material electrode exhibiting good power characteristics.
