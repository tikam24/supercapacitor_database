The following paper presents an adjustable speed stand alone generating system. The system - also called variable speed generating system is a modern technique that has a great number of advantages over a conventional synchronous generator driven with constant speed. In the adjustable speed generating system the prime mover drives a permanent magnet generator producing variable frequency and amplitude AC voltage. The variable voltage is conditioned by an AC/AC power electronic converter providing high quality multiphase AC constant frequency sinusoidal voltage. Decoupling the speed of the generator and output voltage frequency provides a new way for optimizing prime mover like reducing its rated power, weight, emission and size. In such generating systems the prime mover speed control strategy is essential subject of investigation. The paper discusses the design and performance of a laboratory rig which is used to test and to evaluate different adjustable speed generating system topologies and control strategies. The built test rig is designed in such a way that is easy to implement these topologies and control strategies. Therefore the test rig is called "simulator". The paper shows the methods of speed control and performance of the stand alone adjustable speed generating system according to the implemented methods. The generating system has also been equipped with an additional controlled energy storage system made of supercapacitor bank. The energy provided by the supercapcitors can help achieve good transient performance. Preliminary tests validated methods of speed control. Presented laboratory tests results with/without supercapacitor controlled energy storage system validate the quality of the output voltage during transient states caused by steps of load of the adjustable speed generating systems.
