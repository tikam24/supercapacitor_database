Supercapacitors with improved storage capacity and longer operational times are in high demand. Herein we report the charge storage nanocomposite cobalt(II, III) oxide/cobalt(II) phosphate, Co3O4–Co3(PO4)2, formed in the calcination temperature range 600–800 °C showing varying degrees of crystallinity. The isolated Co3O4–Co3(PO4)2 nanocomposite was characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction and high-resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Cyclic voltammetry studies based on a three-electrode system showed that Co3O4–Co3(PO4)2 formed at 700 °C exhibited the highest specific capacitance behaviour of 538.3 Fg-1 at 0.5 mVs−1 in 3 M KOH electrolyte. Galvanostatic charging and discharging studies showed a specific capacitance of 526.9 Fg-1 at 1 Ag-1 current density. The unrestricted Becke-3-Lee-Yang-Parr (UB3LYP) functional in conjunction with the 6–311g(d,p) basis set was used for quantum calculations of the thermo-chemical properties of the Co3(PO4)2 moiety in the nanocomposite. The entropy and heat capacity showed optimum temperature values for the nanocomposites in the order 600 °C > 800 °C > 700 °C, the most suited electrode material for charge storage was found at 700 °C. The electronic measurement for the cobalt(II) phosphate moiety in the nanocomposites indicated that the system was very polar with a low bandgap and good electronic and ionic conductivity.
