Electric double layer capacitors are energy storage devices with advantages of fast charge-discharge and long life span. Surface modification of activated carbon electrodes is an effective way to improve their performance. For this purpose, deoxofluorination of activated carbon with sulfur tetrafluoride was attempted in this study. Successful introduction of fluorine atom on the surface of activated carbon resulted in the increased capacitance and improved coulombic efficiencies in electrochemical tests for electric double layer capacitors.
