In this work, specific morphology of Mn3O4 supercapacitor electrode material was synthesized in a fast, efficient, and mass-produced two-step hydrothermal method. 20–30 nm Mn3O4 particles were successfully anchored on 500–600 nm Mn3O4 nanorods. The products were tested by XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM, CV, EDS, EIS, and galvanostatic charge/discharge to prove that the material exhibits good electrochemical performance. At a current density of 0.5 A/g, its specific capacitance could reach 233.41 F/g. This could maintain 10,000 cycles galvanostatic charge/discharge with 108.4% retention. When the current density was 0.5 A/g, the power density of the electrode material was 250 W kg−1 and the energy density was 32.42 W h kg−1. The synergistic effect of nanoparticles and nanorods enhance the electroactive sites of material and increase the energy storage and specific capacitive.
