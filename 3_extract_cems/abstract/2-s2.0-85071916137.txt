A facile strategy for the synthesis of three-dimensional nitrogen-doped microporous carbon (MC-IPNx) is reported here. We adopt the advantages of cross-linking individually of interpenetrating polymer networks to synthesize porous carbon with well-controlled micropores (âˆ¼0.6 nm) and interconnected pores by one-step carbonization of aniline formaldehyde resin/sodium polyacrylate interpenetrating polymer networks (AF/PAAS IPNs), a radically different approach that allows AF/PAAS IPNs to be directly converted to nitrogen-doped microporous carbon (MC-IPNx) without any pretreatment. Due to the interpenetrating pores and abundant porosity, MC-IPNx acquired a high specific surface area (1275 m2 g-1), which reveals remarkable specific capacity (223 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1) and superb capacity retention (80% retention in a current density within the range 0.5-10 A g-1). The unique pore structure of MC-IPNx provides an innovative idea for the control of pore size, and advanced electrochemical performance indicates its application prospects.
