This paper deals with the modeling control and simulation of a series hybrid propulsion system for driving a Wheel Loader by relying upon the Power-Oriented Graphs (POG) modeling technique. The considered propulsion system is composed of the following elements: an ICE (Internal Combustion Engine), two controlled PMSMs (Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors), a supercapacitor as energy storage device and the transmission system of the vehicle itself from the gearbox all the way down to the vehicle wheels. A strategy for the control of the considered hybrid architecture is studied, with the objective of minimizing the ICE specific fuel consumption. Simulation results showing the operation of the presented strategy are finally reported and commented in detail.
