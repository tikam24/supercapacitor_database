Ultrathin Ni(OH)2 nanoflakes grown on nickel foam have been prepared via a facile hydrothermal route without adding any additional nickel sources and further investigated as a binder-free electrode for high-performance supercapacitors. Benefiting from high conductivity and enough spaces between the nanoflakes in combination with high surface area, the Ni(OH)2 nanoflakes show high-capacitance performance with a specific capacitance of 2342 F g-1 at a charge and discharge current density of 2 mA cm-2 and 1100 F g-1 at 8 mA cm-2 with a good cycling ability (80.4% of the initial specific capacitance remains after 2000 cycles). These results show that Ni(OH)2 nanoflakes with this cost-effective synthesis route and distinguished electrochemical performance combined with the flexible nickel foam substrate are very promising for the next generation of high-performance supercapacitors.
