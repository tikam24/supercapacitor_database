Due to the surge in requirement for reliable energy storage, search for materials capable of rendering perfect electrochemical performances is going on at a great rate. Even though supercapacitors have higher power density than batteries, they are still restricted by low energy density and low-capacity retention. Essential fuel sources like internal combustion engines, power devices and batteries function admirably as a consistent source of low power, yet can't productively deal with top power demands or recover energy since they release and re-energize slowly. Recently, the quick development in graphene-based supercapacitors has arrived at where there is a requirement for devices with definite adaptability, which will be a fundamental benefit in innovative electronic devices. Different materials are being tested to ensure the suitable properties. Graphene having unique properties like wide surface area, high conductivity, is considered as a potential candidate for the usage as building material of superconductors. In this paper we studied various aspects of graphene-based superconductors, their types, metal/ non-metal/ polymer doping as well as oxides & reduced oxides of graphene incorporated superconductors. By summarizing we tried to compare the processes followed by the researchers and find out which would be the most suitable way to get the best electrochemical performance.
