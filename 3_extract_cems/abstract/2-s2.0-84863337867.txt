Flexible carbon nanotube/polyaniline/graphene (CNT/PANI/GR) composite papers were prepared by electrochemical polymerization of PANI on cyclic voltammetry electrochemical oxidized CNT (CV-CNT) papers and the successive adsorption of GR. CNT, PANI, and GR provided a flexible conducting network skeleton, faradaic pseudocapacitive material, and surface conductivity modification properties, respectively. The composite papers exhibited a sandwich structure with an outer layer of GR and an inner layer composite network of CV-CNT/PANI, taking full advantage of the superior properties of the three components. The structure and morphology were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Raman spectroscopy. The chemical capacitance characteristics were studied thoroughly. It was shown that PANI nanowhiskers wrapped around the CV-CNT surface evenly. The composite paper exhibited enhanced capacitance and high current charge/discharge characteristics as a supercapacitor electrode. The specific capacitance level could reach 415 F·g -1 at a current density of 0.5 A·g -1 and maintain a level of 106 F·g -1 at the higher current density of 20 A·g -1. In the protection of GR, the composite maintained a higher capacitance than CV-CNT/PANI after 1000 cycles, suggesting that the CV-CNT/PANI/GR composite would be an ideal flexible electrode material for a supercapacitor. © Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.
