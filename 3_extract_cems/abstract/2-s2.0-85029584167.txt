This paper exhibits a rapid one-step hydrothermal method to prepare three different morphologies (spininess, columnar, lamelliform) of MnO2 covered on the surface of carbon spheres (CS@MnO2) by the control of KMnO4 concentration and hydrothermal temperature. All these CS@MnO2 composites were applied in supercapacitor electrode material, and the superior electrochemical performance of CS@MnO2 indicates that the combination of CS and MnO2 has a synergy effect on the enhancement of electrochemical performance. Among these samples, it is worth noting that the columnar morphology of CS@MnO2 exhibited the best performance achieving the max capacitance 178 F gâˆ’1 as the supercapacitor electrode material.
