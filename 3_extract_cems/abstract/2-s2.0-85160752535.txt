The multidimensional microstructure of bimetallic oxides shows a synergistic effect and enhanced energy storage performance compared to their monometallic oxides with a single microstructure. One-dimensional (1D) NiMoO4/ZnMoO4 nanorods self-assembled from two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin NiMoO4 nanosheets loaded with zero-dimensional (0D) ZnMoO4 nanoparticles were evenly grown on the surface of Ni foam (NZMO/NF) by combining hydrothermal method and heat treatment. The NZMO/NF electrode for supercapacitors shows a high specific capacity of 2064.07 F g-1 at 2 mA cm-2 and an excellent capacity maintenance of 99% after 10 000 cycles. Such exceptional performances can be boiled down to its distinctive structural design of multidimensional hierarchy. In addition, the asymmetric pseudocapacitor assembled with NZMO/NF and AC exhibits not only a maximum energy density of 47.4 Wh kg-1 but also a relatively good cyclability (91.74% capacitance retention after 12 000 cycles), demonstrating a promising application as supercapacitor electrode materials.
