Nano-structured composite materials of Ni3S2/MnS2 at carbon are synthesized by a one-step carbonization and vulcanization. The morphology of the composites is controlled by adjusting the ratio of aniline and ammonium persulfate (both as an initiator and a sulfur source). The nanocomposite material has a porous structure stacked by sheets, which can expose more active sites; in the meantime, the porous structure is conducive to the rapid transfer of electrolyte ions. Furthermore, the synthesized nanocomposite material can be used as anode materials for supercapacitor, which has a wide potential window from -1.1 to 0.2 V and shows high specific capacitance of 291 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in 6 M KOH. The asymmetric supercapacitors further assembled with Ni(OH)2 as cathode materials has a specific capacitance of 67 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and good cyclic stability (capacitance retention of 74.5% over 2000 cycles). The electrochemical properties of asymmetric supercapacitors deliver a maximum energy density of 18.8 Wh kg−1 at power density of 360.8 W kg−1. It indicates that this kind of nanocomposite material is a very promising negative material for supercapacitors with excellent electrochemical performance.
