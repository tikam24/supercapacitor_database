Herein, intelligent construction of an NiCoSe2/Ti3C2Txhybrid heterostructure with unique morphologies was performed using a hydrothermal protocol. The coexistence of the dual metal core in Ni-Co selenides and Ti3C2TxMXene helps in realizing outclassing physicochemical properties. The two-dimensional (2D) heterostructure provides an admirably smaller Tafel slope of 86 mV/dec, indicating the faster H2evolution rate (Pt/C: 82 mV/dec) and overpotential of 62 mV at 10 mA/cm2(Pt/C: 52 mV/dec). Our heterostructure devices demonstrate a specific energy density of 32.05 Wh kg-1coupled with a power density of 0.2 kW kg-1and maintain 15.39 Wh kg-1coupled with a power density of 0.92 kW kg-1. The experimental results underpin new profitable opportunities and scale up deployment of the bifunctional electrodes. Further, the experimental findings were supported through density functional theory (DFT) simulations in terms of a lower overpotential and higher quantum capacitance for the heterostructure NiCoSe2/MXene compared to pristine NiCoSe2. There is charge transfer from MXene Ti3C2Txto NiCoSe2leading to enhanced electronic states near the Fermi level responsible for enhanced catalytic activities and charge storage performance.
