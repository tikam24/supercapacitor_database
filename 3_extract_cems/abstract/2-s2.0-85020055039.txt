Iron cobaltite (FeCo2O4) has been successfully prepared via a conventional facile solvothermal reaction, followed by a calcination step. The as-prepared material exhibits a 2D-nanosheets morphology, which expected to provide better electronic transportation as compared to zero-dimensional nanomaterials. FeCo2O4 nanosheets were tested as an electrode material for supercapacitor applications. The as-prepared material showed an excellent electrochemical performance on Ni foam substrate. It exhibited high charge storage property with a specific capacitance value of 853.8 F g−1 at 5 A g−1 and also a remarkable cycling stability with 87.5% capacitance retention being stable after 3000 cycles. It also showed a superior rate capability with (73%) from 5 to 25 A g−1. The excellent electrochemical performance of FeCo2O4 nanosheets is related to its high conductivity, high porosity, and the fast electrons/ions transportation.
