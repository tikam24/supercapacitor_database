The preparation and electrochemical properties of 3D ordered nickel oxide/silicon microchannel plate (NiO/Si-MCP) array electrode materials for supercapacitors are studied. The Si-MCP fabricated by electrochemical etching is used as a 3D supporting structure for electrodes. The active NiO is synthesized by electroless plating of nickel on the surface of the Si-MCP followed by annealing under oxygen. The electrochemical properties of the NiO/Si-MCP nanocomposite electrode materials are studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronopotentiometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in a 2 M KOH solution. The results reveal typical electrochemical capacitive behavior in the potential range from -0.6 to 1.0 V. The specific capacitance of approximately 586.4 F g-1 decreases slightly with 4.8% loss after 500 cycles. The linear and symmetrical charge/discharge curves are measured by chronopotentiometry. The NiO/Si-MCP composite is a promising electrode material for integrated supercapacitors. Â© 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
