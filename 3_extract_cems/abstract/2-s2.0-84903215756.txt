Ruthenium oxide electrodes prepared by different routes were studied and the results discussed in terms of the possibility of using these electrodes in high power/high energy supercapacitors. The supercapacitor electrodes were prepared by mixing RuO2 particles with a binder (Nafion® or polyvinilydenfluoride) in various ratios. The results show that charging/discharging reaction of RuO2 consists of at least two redox reactions taking place simultaneously at different rates. The contribution of each reaction in the overall process depends on the hydration of RuO2 as well as on the type of binder and binder/RuO2 ratio. From both energy and power capability of supercapacitors the best electrode composition would be hydrous RuO2 with č20% Nafion® as a binder. Asymmetric supercapacitors assembled with RuO2 and activated carbon as a counter electrode gave 26 and 12 W h kg-1 at average specific power of 5 W g-1 for RuO2/Nafion® and RuO 2/polyvinylidene fluoride, respectively.
