In this manuscript, the effect of potassium hydroxide (KOH) electrolyte concentrations (0.1 M, 1.0 M, and 6.0 M) to the specific gravimetric capacitance of vertically aligned single-walled carbon nanotube (VA-SWCNT) based supercapacitor will be reported. VA-SWCNT electrode was prepared using direct growth technique of alcohol catalytic chemical vapor deposition. It was found that specific gravimetric capacitance of the VA-SWCNT supercapacitors increased with increasing KOH electrolyte concentration. Besides, lower concentration (or viscosity) of the KOH electrolyte may give better stability in charge storage performance; suggesting difference of ion movement inside the VA-SWCNT double-layer system. The capacitance slope (as a function of cyclic voltammetry scan rate) can be improved by lower concentration of the electrolyte. Â© 2013 by ESG.
