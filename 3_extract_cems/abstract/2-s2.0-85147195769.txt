Supercapacitors are particularly interested in low-dimensional materials. Herein, MnO2 nanorods and ultralong MnO2 nanowires (NWs) were synthesized along with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) via a simple hydrothermal method. MnO2 NWs/MnO2 NRs crystallize with a low diameter of 20–30 nm when synthesized in situ with rGO. The basic crystallographic structure and chemical state of the composites were investigated using XRD, Raman, and XPS. The MnO2 NWs/rGO composite had the highest specific capacitance (Cs) of 536 Fg−1 at a current density of 1 Ag−1 with an outstanding capacitance retention of 92.3 % over 10,000 cycles, which is much superior than the pure MnO2 NWs/MnO2 NRs and MnO2 NRs/rGO composites. Moreover, MnO2 NWs/rGO composites demonstrated excellent rate performance by sustaining a specific capacitance of 321 F g−1 even at high current density of 5 A g−1, which is 60 % of its initial capacitance. Therefore, present strategy is the most viable option for fabricating high-performance electrode materials to address practical concerns of supercapacitors.
