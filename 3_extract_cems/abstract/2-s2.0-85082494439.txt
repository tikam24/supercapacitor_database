The conventional distributed super capacitor energy storage system (DSCESS) based on the modular multilevel converter (MMC), using dispersed energy storage units, inconvenient assembly and maintenance, and complex system control. An improved modular multilevel converter (IMMC) based symmetrical super capacitor energy storage system (SSCESS) was proposed by adding two DC buses to simplify system control complexity and enhance the dynamic response performance. The operation principles and power transmission of IMMC-SSCESS were analyzed firstly. Based on mathematical modeling analysis, the sub-modules capacitor voltage control and super capacitor state of charge (SOC) balancing control were studied in detail. Finally, the comparison between IMMC-SSCESS and conventional MMC-DSCESS was validated by simulation. The results show that IMMC-SSCESS can quickly realize SOC balance and effective power transmission under corresponding control strategy, and shows good industrial application prospects.
