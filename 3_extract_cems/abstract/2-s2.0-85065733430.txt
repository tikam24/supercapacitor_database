Enormous research activities have been accomplished to evolve improved cathode for advanced Li-ion-based devices. In this article, we account the preparation of spinel LiMn2O4 synthesized by microwave irradiation method and investigated the influence of calcination temperature (550–750°C) on its crystallinity, morphology and electrochemical properties. The crystallinity of the samples showed a linear increment with the calcination temperature, and from the structural analysis, the interlinking of the polyhedral subunits with one another was encountered. The electrochemical investigations revealed that the sample calcined at 650°C exhibited a high capacitance of 473.44 F/g in the 3M LiNO3 electrolyte with stable cycling performance. The obtained results suggested the significance of optimum calcination temperature in the effective tailoring of crystallinity, morphology and electrochemical properties of LiMn2O4 nanoparticles.
