To overcome the environmental challenges caused by utilization of fossil fuel based energy technologies and to utilize the full potential of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and tidal, high power and high energy density containing large scale electrochemical energy storage devices are a matter of concern and a need of the hour. Pseudocapacitors with accessibility to multiple oxidation states for redox charge transfer can achieve a higher degree of energy storage density compared to electric double layer capacitors (EDLC) and the hybrid supercapacitor is one of the prominent electrochemical capacitors that can resolve the low energy density issues associated with EDLCs. Due to its open pore framework structure with superior structural stability and accessibility of Co2+/3+/4 redox states, porous anhydrous CoC2O4 nanorods are envisaged here as a potential energy storage electrode in a pseudo-capacitive mode. Superior specific capacitance equivalent to 2116 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 in the potential window of 0.3 V was observed for anhydrous CoC2O4 nanorods in aqueous 2 M KOH electrolyte. A predominant pseudo-capacitive mechanism seems to be operative behind the high charge storage at electrodes as intercalative (Inner) and surface (outer) charge storage contributions were found to be 75% and 25% respectively. Further, in full cell asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) mode in which porous anhydrous CoC2O4 nanorods were used as positive electrodes and activated carbon (AC) was utilised as negative electrodes within an operating potential window of 1.3 V, a highest specific energy of W h kg-1 and specific power of âˆ¼647 W kg-1 at 0.5 A g-1 current density were obtained with superior cycling stability. High cycling stability coupled with superior electrochemical storage properties make anhydrous CoC2O4 nanorods potential pseudo-capacitive electrodes for large scale energy storage applications.
