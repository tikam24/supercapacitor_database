In this work, a one pot, hassle-free hydrothermal technique was implemented for synthesizing of Ni-Co-Zn-S/AC (activated carbon) composites irrespective of any surfactant in order to analysis the electrochemical performance for energy storage device applications. The crystallinity, morphology, porosity and the composition of the obtained composite material was studied by powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy and Raman spectroscopy, respectively. Additionally, the as fabricated Ni-Co-Zn-S/AC composite based electrode was tested for supercapacitor applications by utilizing 3.5 M of KOH aqueous solution as electrolyte. For the supercapacitor measurements, we have preceded with cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis. The as fabricated Ni-Co-Zn-S/AC electrode exhibited a specific capacitance of about 444.4 F gâˆ’1. Thus, the Ni-Co-Zn-S/AC composite with high porous spherical morphology proved itself as a worthy electrode material for supercapacitors.
