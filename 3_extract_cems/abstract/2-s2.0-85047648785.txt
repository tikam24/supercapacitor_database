CsPbI3 has been synthesized by chemical route in ambient environment. Orthorhombic phase of CsPbI3 has been confirmed by x-ray diffraction spectra followed by Rietveld refinement. We have fabricated a symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) with CsPbI3 as electrode material to demonstrate the charge storing capability. The device shows good electrochemical properties with specific capacitance 7.23 mF cm−2 at a scan rate 2 mV S−1 and 65.5% cyclic stability after 1000 cycles. So, this CsPbI3 can be used as a promising energy storage electrode material in future.
