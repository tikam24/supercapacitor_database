In this paper, system integration and power-flow management algorithms for a four-wheel-driven series hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) having multiple power sources composed of a diesel-engine-based generator, lead acid battery bank, and supercapacitor bank are presented. The super-capacitor is utilized as a short-term energy storage device to meet the dynamic performance of the vehicle, while the battery is utilized as a mid-term energy storage for the electric vehicle (EV) mode operation due to its higher energy density. The generator based on an interior permanent magnet machine (IPMM), run by a diesel engine, provides the average power for the normal operation of the vehicle. Thanks to the proposed power-flow management algorithm, each of the energy sources is controlled appropriately and also the dynamic performance of the vehicle has been improved. The proposed power-flow management algorithm has been experimentally verified with a full-scale prototype vehicle. Â© 2008 IEEE.
