In this work, a simple and facile one-step hydrothermal method is developed to synthesize oxygen-incorporated molybdenum disulphide (O-MoS2) microspheres with tunable interiors (solid, yolk-shell and hollow microstructures) by using carbon disulfide (CS2) as soft template and sulfur source simultaneously. The synthesized O-MoS2 microspheres with enlarged interlayer spacing of ca. 9.8 Å show remarkable electrochemical performances as novel electrode materials for supercapacitors (SCs). Specifically, O-MoS2 hollow microsphere exhibits optimal electrochemical performances with a high specific capacitance of 744.2 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and a good cycling stability with ca. 77.8% capacitance retention after 10 K continuous charge–discharge cycles at a high current density of 5 A g−1, thus making it a promising electrode material for high-performance SCs. The excellent electrochemical performances are mainly attributed to the enlarged interlayer spacing and the reduced band gap owing to the oxygen incorporation in MoS2 and the hollow microstructure.
