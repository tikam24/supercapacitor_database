A novel nanostructure of Co 3 O 4 was prepared via pulse cathodic deposition followed by heat-treatment.The prepared sample was characterized by XRD, IR, SEM and TEM techniques. The results revealed thatthe prepared sample is composed of crystalline cubic spinel Co 3 O 4 with capsule-like morphology. Thesupercapacitive investigation by cyclic voltammetry and charge-discharge tests displayed that the Co 3 O 4 nanocapsules have high electrochemical contribution into the redox reactions where they delivered highcapacitance of 454.7 F g -1 at the applied discharge current density of 2 A g -1 , and an excellent long-termcycling stability (94.5%) capacity retention after 500 cycling at current density of 2 A g -1 . These abilitiesof Co 3 O 4 nanocapsules suggest their potential application in the electrochemical supercapacitors. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
