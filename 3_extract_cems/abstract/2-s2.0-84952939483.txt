By using three-dimensional (3D) tubular molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) as both an active material in electrochemical reaction and a framework to provide more paths for insertion and extraction of ions, PANI nanowire arrays with a diameter of 10-20 nm can be controllably grown on both the external and internal surface of 3D tubular MoS2 by in situ oxidative polymerization of aniline monomers and 3D tubular MoS2/PANI hybrid materials with different amounts of PANI are prepared. A controllable growth of PANI nanowire arrays on the tubular MoS2 surface provides an opportunity to optimize the capacitive performance of the obtained electrodes. When the loading amount of PANI is 60%, the obtained MoS2/PANI-60 hybrid electrode not only shows a high specific capacitance of 552 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g, but also gives excellent rate capability of 82% from 0.5 to 30 A/g. The remarkable rate performance can be mainly attributed to the architecture with synergistic effect between 3D tubular MoS2 and PANI nanowire arrays. Moreover, the MoS2/PANI-60 based symmetric supercapacitor also exhibits the excellent rate performance and good cycling stability. The specific capacitance based on the total mass of the two electrodes is 124 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g and 79% of its initial capacitance is remained after 6000 cycles. The 3D tubular structure provides a good and favorable method for improving the capacitance retention of PANI electrode.
