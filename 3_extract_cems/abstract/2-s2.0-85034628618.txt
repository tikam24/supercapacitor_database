A now type of porous Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 has been successfully fabricated via a simple template-assistant method followed by a post-calcining treatment. The as-prepared samples were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), Brunauere-Emmette-Teller (BET) surface analyzer, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectra. The as-prepared Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 displays a nano-porous structure with the porous diameter of 45–140 nm. The porous Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 sample exhibits excellent electrochemical performances, including the specific capacitance of 113 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in 1 M KOH aqueous electrolytes. In addition, the porous Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 sample possesses an excellent cycling stability by 120.05% growth of its specific capacitance after 1000 cycles. The faradic-redox activity of porous Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 sample results in the high specific capacitance and excellent cycling stability. Thus, the porous Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 sample is a promising pseudocapacitive material for supercapacitors.
