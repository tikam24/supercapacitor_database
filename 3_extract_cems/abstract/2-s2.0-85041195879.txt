A series of "ravine-like" boron carbonitrides (abbreviation: BCN) were synthesized by a green precursor pyrolysis method at different temperatures (about 700-1100 Â°C). The highest electrochemical performance of BCN-800 (Named BCN-temperature) electrode was observed, because the "ravine-like" structure can significantly increase the contact area and improve the wettability between electrode and electrolyte. The BCN electrode exhibited ultrahigh specific capacitance 805.9 F/g (at a current density of 0.2 A/g), excellent rate capability, and good cycling stability (91%) after 3000 cycles at a current density of 8 A/g, showing high potential applications in supercapacitors.
