Carbon frameworks with well-developed porosity present broad application prospects in energy-related materials, and green preparation still face challenges. Herein, the tannins-derived framework-like carbon material is obtained by cross-linking and self-assembly strategy. The phenolic hydroxyl and quinones in tannin cross-linking react with the amine groups in the methenamine by simple stirring, which drives the self-assembly of tannins and methenamine, contributing to the reaction products being precipitated in solution as aggregates with framework-like structure. The porosity and micromorphology of framework-like structures are further enriched by the thermal stability difference between tannin and methenamine. The methenamine of framework-like structures is entirely removed by the sublimation and decomposition and the tannin is transformed into carbon materials inheriting framework-like structures after the carbonization, which offers the path for rapid electron transport. The framework-like structure, excellent specific surface area and nitrogen doping give the assembled Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors a superior specific capacitance of 165.3 mAh·g−1 (350.4 F·g−1). This device could be charged to 1.87 V to power the bulb by using solar panels. This study proves that the tannin-derived framework-like carbon is a promising electrode of the Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors, which is beneficial for value-added and industrial supercapacitors application of green feedstocks.
