The rapid development of electrochemical energy storage (EES) systems requires novel electrode materials with high performance. A typical 2D nanomaterial, layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are regarded as promising materials used for EES systems due to their large specific surface areas and layer structures benefiting fast ion transport. The typical methods for the preparation of TMDs and TMD-based nanohybrids are first summarized. Then, in order to improve the electrochemical performance of various kinds of rechargeable batteries, such as lithium-ion batteries, lithiumâ€“sulfur batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and other types of emerging batteries, the strategies for the design and fabrication of layered TMD-based electrode materials are discussed. Furthermore, the applications of layered TMD-based nanomaterials in supercapacitors, especially in untraditional supercapacitors, are presented. Finally, the existing challenges and promising future research directions in this field are proposed.
