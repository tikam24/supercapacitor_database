Reduced graphene oxide (RGO) is a promising electrode material for supercapacitors, where aggregation structure and corresponding transport pathway for ions can determine the rate capability, as well as surface functionalities and corresponding surface wettability will influence the specific capacitance. Inspired by the cation-π interaction and hard templating of water-soluble-salt, a facile NaCl-assisted spray drying and thermal reduction strategy is proposed for simultaneously tuning the aggregation structure and chemical composition of RGO microspheres, resulting in a remarkably enhanced capacitive performance. Aggregation structure of the RGO microspheres can be finely controlled by regulating the strength of cation-π interaction and the amount of NaCl templates. Meanwhile, surface oxygen groups could also be reserved after reduction through the strong interaction and the powerful protection from NaCl. The RGO microsphere presents low aggregation degree, spherical morphology, efficient porosity and high surface oxygen content. When assembled into a symmetric supercapacitor, it gives superior gravimetric capacitance of 234 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, marvelous rate performance of 74.4 % at 100 A g−1 and impressive power density of 29.6 kW kg−1. Additionally, the presence of NaCl can significantly improve yield of the RGO materials during spray drying, which is very important for the practical industrial process.
