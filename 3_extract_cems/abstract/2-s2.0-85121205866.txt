Nowadays, it is a great challenge to develop electrode materials with microstructure exhibiting good electrochemical performances. There is poor adhesion between nano-electrode materials and conducting substrate, because large specific surface area causes serious aggregation and uneven coating, limiting the practical application of high performance nano-electrode materials. In this work, micron-sized NiMn-glycerate (NiMn-Gly) solid spheres were synthesized via a facile solvothermal method as cathode material of supercapacitor. By optimizing Ni/Mn ratio and designing amorphous structure, NiMn-Gly microspheres electrode delivers a specific capacitance of 719C g−1 at the current density of 1.0 A g−1. Furthermore, an all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor assembled by NiMn-Gly microspheres and activated carbon exhibits a maximum energy density of 54.4 Wh kg−1 at 800 W kg−1 and achieves outstanding cycling stability (100%, 20,000 cycles, 10 A g−1). Two devices connected in series can light up a blue LED bulb and keep it bright for more than 15 min. Hence, we successfully prepared micron-sized electrode material with excellent electrochemical performances which may be a breakthrough for the practical application of supercapacitors.
