Whether it is using renewable energy photovoltaic or wind type, the problem is that this energy to be delivered at constant parameters. Classic storage on lithium-ion or lead-acid battery, ensure some stability of the voltage supplied, but when new alternative storage solutions arise, the stability of the voltage supplied can be improve. For example, for systems off - grid can go on the DC-DC converters. Article proposes a study on replacing classic batteries with supercapacitors battery and converter pair. Supercapacitor can be considered a promising device. It can be used virtually maintenance free. It is analyzed several operating schematics (inverter and SEPIC) of buck-boost type converters that can be used together with supercapacitors. The converter is designed to maintain a constant output. Designing such a converter is, considering the work situation, to achieve high efficiency and a wide range of input voltage. Â© 2012 IEEE.
