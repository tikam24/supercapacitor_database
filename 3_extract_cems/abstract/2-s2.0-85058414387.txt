This attempt reports on cobalt oxide (Co3O4) nanoparticles (NPs) prepared through the traditional chemical reflux method to examine the behavior of supercapacitor performance. The synthesized NPs were characterized using several analytical tools such as ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, and scanning electron microscope (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Moreover, the electrochemical performance was analyzed using galvanostatic charge and discharge studies (GCD), cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies as well as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The cubical phase of Co3O4 was identified from the XRD pattern and also the average crystalline size was measured by Scherrer’s equation. FTIR confirmed the functional group of Co3O4 NPs. SEM images revealed the hexagonal-shaped nanoflakes-like morphology of the sample. From the elemental analysis, the formation of pure Co3O4 NPs by means of high purity and composition ratio of cobalt with oxygen was found. Vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) plot scrutinized the magnetic performance of Co3O4 NPs. The Co3O4 NPs modified electrode has delivered maximum specific capacitance as 1413 Fg−1 at a current density of 1 Ag−1 which maintains tremendous cycling stability within the retention ratio of 98.4% after 1000 cycles.
