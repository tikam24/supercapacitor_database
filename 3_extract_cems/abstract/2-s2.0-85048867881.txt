Co9S8/Mo2S3 nanorods on CoS2 laminar arrays (CoS2-Co9S8/Mo2S3, defined as Co1Mo1) were synthesized via one step hydrothermal method for high performance supercapacitors. The Co1Mo1 hybrid was in-situ grown on Ni foam (NF). The nanorods and laminar arrays constructed 3D network with stable structure, maintaining high durability during electrochemical reactions. What's more, this Co1Mo1 hybrid electrode combined the merits of both cobalt sulfides (the high capacity) and molybdenum sulfides (the excellent cycling stability). As expected, the Co1Mo1//NF hybrid exhibited excellent capacitance (2777.5 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), wonderful rate performance (81.46% from 1 to 50 A g−1), as well as superior stability (100% at 10 A g−1 after 8500 cycling) when used as single electrodes. The Co1Mo1//AC device was also assembled, showing high energy density (56.56 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 850 W kg−1). When combined two Co1Mo1//AC devices in series, six colored led bulbs which were in parallel can be lighted (green LED, working voltage greater than 3 V), further corroborated the possibility of the Co1Mo1 electrode for practical application. This study provided an easy and low-cost method for synthesizing electrode materials with excellent electrochemical performance.
