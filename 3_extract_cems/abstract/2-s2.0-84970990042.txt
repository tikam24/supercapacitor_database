This work presents the first demonstration of a one-dimensional (1-D), «resistive-capacitive» porous electrode study both analytically and experimentally for faradaic (pseudo) supercapacitors, including an analysis of supercapacitor performance limitations. Resistive-capacitive model predictions for metal oxide pseudocapacitors (high and low conductivity oxides) and conducting polymer pseudocapacitors are compared with experimental results to determine the validity of model assumptions. Specific accomplishments compared to the state-of-the-art include: (1) a macroscale approach for ohmically-limited porous supercapacitor electrodes; (2) experimental validation for metal oxide- and conducting polymer-carbon nanotube (CNT) pseudocapacitors; and (3) identification of performance-limiting factors. As such, this work could open up a new methodology for guiding performance enhancements in the field of pseudocapacitor energy storage.
