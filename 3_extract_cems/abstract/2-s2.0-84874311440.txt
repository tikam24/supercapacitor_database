Electrochemical capacitors, based on the double-layer capacitance of high specific surface area carbon materials, are attracting major fundamental and technological interest as highly reversible, electrical-charge storage and delivery devices, capable of being operated at high power densities. In the present paper, studies have been carried out on nanocomposite gel polymer electrolyte comprising poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene)-propylene carbonate-magnesium perchlorate-nanofumed silica with a view to use them as electrolyte in electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) based on chemically treated activated charcoal as electrodes. The optimized composition of nanogel polymer electrolyte exhibits high room-temperature ionic conductivity of 5. 4 × 10-3 S cm-1 with good mechanical and dimensional stability which is suitable for their application as electrolyte in EDLCs. Detailed chemical and microstructural characterization of chemically treated and untreated activated charcoal was conducted using scanning electron microscopy and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET). BET studies reveal that the effective surface area of treated activated charcoal powder (1,515 m2 g-1) increases by more than double-fold compared with untreated one (721 m2 g-1). Performance characteristics of EDLCs have been tested using cyclic voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy, prolonged cyclic test, and charge-discharge techniques. Analysis shows that the treated activated charcoal electrodes have almost five times more capacitance values as compared with the untreated one. The maximum capacitance of 324 mF cm-2, equivalent to single electrode specific capacitance of 216 F g-1 was achieved. It corresponds to an energy density of 20 Wh kg-1 and a power density of 2. 2 kW kg-1. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.
