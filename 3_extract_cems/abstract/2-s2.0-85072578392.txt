In this work, we report a feasible fabrication of NiCo2S4 nanotree-like structures grown from the Ni nanoparticle (NP)-doped reduced graphene oxides (Ni-rGO) by a simple hydrothermal method. It is found that the presence of Ni NPs on the surface of the rGOs initiates growth of the NiCo2S4 nanotree flocks with enhanced interfacial compatibility, providing excellent cyclic stability and rate performance. The resulting NiCo2S4/Ni-rGO nanocomposites exhibit a superior rate performance, demonstrating 91.6% capacity retention even after 10,000 cycles of charge/discharge tests.
