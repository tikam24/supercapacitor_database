Biomass refers to all the non-fossilized biological materials that exist on the Earth, including forest residues, agricultural residues, energy crops, industrial residues, food wastes, municipal wastes, animal residues, algal residues, etc. As a renewable source, biomass has been used as an energy and non-energy source for producing fuels and power and for agricultural and industrial uses. Accordingly, biomass supplies almost 10% of the world's energy demand and 35% of the developing countries. With the advancement of science and technology, the utilization of biomass and its derived materials has been expanding not only for energy and fuel production but also for energy storage, sensors, and catalysis applications. In particular, biomass has led to interest in developing electrochemical supercapacitors using biomass as their main component, including electrodes, electrolytes, binders, separators, and packaging materials that can be produced from biomass. This chapter comprehensively discusses the general characteristics, categories, pyrolysis method, and environmental and energy aspects of biomass by highlighting the application of biomass for electrochemical supercapacitors.
