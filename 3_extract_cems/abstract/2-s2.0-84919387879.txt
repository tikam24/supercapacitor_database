Sustainable penetration of all kinds of electric vehicles is mainly dependent on the onboard availability of energy provision/storage system to the vehicle. Hybrid fuel cell power structure, appropriately composed of battery, ultra-capacitor and fuel cell, is used to overcome disadvantageous features of the fuel cell such as slow response and the lower energy density. This paper presents a cascaded system of a bidirectional power converter, fuel cell, battery and ultra-capacitor employing voltage allocation and compensation concept. In the presented configuration of the hybrid fuel cell power system, major portion of the energy is supplied directly, without being subjected to power conversion loss, by the FC. A novel control strategy for DC/DC power converter, with high efficiency, is also presented. Simulation results validate the proposed system configuration showing the overall efficiency around 92%.
