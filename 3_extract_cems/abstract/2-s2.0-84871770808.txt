Ni(OH)2 xerogels were formed by sol-gel method at 80 °C followed drying at 110 °C and ambient pressure. The structure of Ni(OH)2 xerogels was characterized using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscope (TEM) and N2 (77K) adsorption. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) results showed that the material obtained has a crystalline ß-Ni(OH)2. TEM images showed that average size of the crystalline phase is about 10 nm. Results of N2 (77K) adsorption isotherm showed that the (BET) specific surface area is 232 m2/g and the Pore size distribution is in the regime 1-4 nm (Barrett-Joyner-Halenda, BJH). The Ni(OH)2 xerogels electrodes were activated using cyclic voltammetry, and their capacitive performance was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and constant current discharge. The Ni(OH)2 xerogels electrodes exhibited excellent capacitive behavior with a specific capacitance of 635 F/g (calculated by CV). High performance obtained indicates that the Ni(OH)2 xerogels are promising electrode materials for supercapacitors, and the electrochemical activation of these electrodes is doable.
