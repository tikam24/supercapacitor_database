Herein, activated porous carbon (ACTS-900) derived from Tamarindus indica, a bio-source, via KOH activation and carbonization at 900 °C was used as an active electrode material for supercapacitor (SC) applications. In the three-electrode configuration, ACTS-900 shows the maximum specific capacitance (C s,3E ) of 225 F g -1 at 50 mV s -1 and 249 F g -1 at 0.5 A g -1 in 1 M H 2 SO 4 . A high-performance, bio-based, environmentally benign and cost-effective chitosan/poly(ethylene glycol)-ran-poly(propylene glycol) [Ch/poly(EG-ran-PG)]-based polymer blend was employed as a membrane-cum-separator as well as a green binder in the electrodes. The blend polymer membrane was prepared by mixing chitosan (Ch) and poly(EG-ran-PG) in a 11 weight ratio in a 1% aqueous acetic acid solution followed by drying under controlled evaporation. The blend membrane showed high porosity (2 μm-7 μm diameter pores) and excellent thermal (up to 250 °C), chemical (in 1 M H 2 SO 4 ), electrochemical (up to 1.21 V) and mechanical stability (up to 39 MPa under tensile loading). The performance of a symmetric two-electrode SC device was evaluated using a H 2 SO 4 -(1 M)-soaked-Ch/poly(EG-ran-PG) membrane and ACTS-900 active electrode materials. The obtained results were compared with those obtained using commercially available binders and membranes. The single electrode specific capacitances (C s , 2E ) in the symmetrical SC device were 193 F g -1 at 50 mV s -1 and 132 F g -1 at 2 A g -1 with H 2 SO 4 -(1 M)-soaked-Ch/poly(EG-ran-PG) as the membrane and binder. The maximum energy density and power density of the SC device are 4.7 W h kg -1 (at 1 A g -1 ) and 2.5 kW kg -1 (at 5 A g -1 ), respectively. Due to the superior wetting properties of the blend membrane and binder, excellent capacity retention was observed (∼99%) over 6000 cycles at the current density of 3.5 A g -1 . As a proof-of-concept, a red light-emitting diode was illuminated using three serially connected 3 V SC stacks.
