With the rapid development of portable electronics, such as e-paper and other flexible devices, power sources with a high flexibility become an important prerequisite. In this run, supercapacitors with a small form factor are recently emerging as a competitive candidate. Here, we introduce an all-printed paper based supercapacitor (PPS) assembled by screen printing and stencil printing technology, which shows superior electrochemical performance; moreover, it is compatible with mass production processes. The key electrode material, δ-MnO2 nanosheets, synthesized by one-step synthetic process exhibit a high specific capacitance of 120 F g-1. Using this δ-MnO2 nanosheets electrode material and aqueous electrolyte, the capacity of the device could reach 4.7 mF g-1 with the volume of 2.0∗1.7∗0.2mm3. More important, the supercapacitor is lightweight and miniaturized, which can well cater to the development of future wearable electronics.
