Electrochemical supercapacitors could be thought of as a major energy storage instrument for electrical devices. Nano metal oxides supercapacitors as materials with high electro-activity are attracting supreme consideration due to the best electrochemical efficiency. In this project, synthesis of pure and gold doped PdO-reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites by sonochemical and deposition-precipitation process was performed. The characterization of synthesized un-doped and Au doped PdO-RGO composites were performed by using X-ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopy, transmission electronic microscopy, and X-ray diffraction method. The characterization results demonstrated PdO particles are embedded into the interlayer of RGO sheets. The electrochemical supercapacitive efficiency of the nanosamples was evaluated by different electrochemical analysis. Au-doped PdO-RGO nanocomposite shows enhanced specific capacitance of 253.0 Fg− 1 at 5 mVs− 1 and its high excellent effect was collated with PdO-RGO. The high cyclic stability and specific capacitance of Au doped PdO-RGO demonstrates to the doping of gold and good dispersion of PdO particles on RGO.
