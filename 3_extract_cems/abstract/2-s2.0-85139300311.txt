In the last few years, perovskites have been getting a lot of attention towards energy storage devices. Herein, to increase the energy density of supercapacitors, solgel technique was employed to fabricate sandwich like DyMnO3 nanostructure. The DyMnO3 structural, morphological, and elemental analysis as well as its electrochemical characteristics, are meticulously investigated via different techniques. Due to the large surface area (97.9 m2/g) of the DyMnO3 resulted in a high specific capacitance of 1929 F/g, while it has a high energy density of 72.3 Wh/kg at a scan rate of 5 mV/s via cyclic voltammogram. This is due to the fact that these devices are more durable, with the DyMnO3 retaining 95 % of their particular capacitance after 10,000 cycles.
