Pyrrole (Py) and carbazole (Cz) monomers are polymerized simultaneously in the presence of MnOx nanoparticles synthesized chemically on a stainless steel mesh (SSM) electrode by the pulse galvanostatic method in an acetonitrile medium. The resulting p(Py-co-Cz)/MnOx composite is characterized by cyclic voltammetry EIS, GCD XPS, XRD, FESEM, BET, and TEM. Since the current is applied for short periods in the presence of both monomers, p(Py-co-Cz) copolymer chains occur in short lengths, suitable for supercapacitor electrodes. The copolymer has higher Cm and lower Rct values as well as higher porosity that improves ion transport, thus greater stability than the homopolymers. It may be due to tricyclic Cz segments located between Py segments in the chains, which inhibit degradation. During the synthesis, nano-sized MnOx is also encapsulated homogeneously into the p(Py-co-Cz) coating, where 5 % is the weight percentage of manganese. Since the composite combines the advantages of the conductive polymer and metal oxide, it has the lowest Rct and highest Cm values among the coatings here. The p(Py-co-Cz)/MnOx coating with 10 mg cm−2 exhibits a high specific capacitance of 352 F g−1 at 5 A g−1 as well as flexibility, as its specific capacitance remains nearly stable (99 %) up to a bending angle of 90°. The cathode prepared from polyvinyl chloride (PVC)/activated carbon/carbon black on SSM operates within a wide voltage range of 0 to −1.5 V at 98 % cycle stability after 1000 cycles. The asymmetric cell configuration with the flexible anode and cathode electrodes provides 38 kW kg−1 and 5.28 Wh kg−1 at 5 A g−1 at a wide potential range of 2.1 V in PVA/Na2SO4 gel electrolyte, and the cycling stability was 67 % after 1000 cycles.
