A layered compound composed of crystalline ruthenic acid sheets interleaved with layers of water can be exfoliated (delaminated) to yield colloidal nanosheets. This material is a mixed conductor where the crystalline nanosheets contribute to the electron conductivity and the hydrous interlayer supplies proton transport (see diagram). A large active surface area and a high specific capacitance is promising for electrochemical supercapacitor applications.
