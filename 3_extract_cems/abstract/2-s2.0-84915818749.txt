This paper presents a non-contact method of harvesting energy from an aircraft power line that has an AC current of variable amplitude and a frequency range of 360-800 Hz. The current and frequency characteristics of the aircraft power line are dependent on the rotation speed of the electrical generators and will therefore change during a flight. The harvester consists of an inductive coil with a ferrite core, which is interfaced to a rectifier, step-down regulator and supercapacitor. A prototype system was constructed to demonstrate reliable output voltage regulation across a supercapacitor that will supply a peak power of 100 mW under duty cycled load conditions. The system could fully charge a 40 mF supercapacitor to 3.3 V in 78 s from a power line current of 1.5 Arms at 650 Hz.
