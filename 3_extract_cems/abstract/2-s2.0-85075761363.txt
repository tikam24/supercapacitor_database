A facile, innovative synthesis for the fabrication of NiCo2Se4-rGO on a Ni foam nanocomposite via a simple hydrothermal reaction is proposed. The as-prepared NiCo2Se4-rGO@Ni foam electrode was tested through pxrd, TEM, SEM, and EDS to characterize the morphology and the purity of the material. The bimetallic electrode exhibited outstanding electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance of 2038.55 F g-1 at 1 A g-1. NiCo2Se4-rGO@Ni foam exhibits an extensive cycling stability after 1000 cycles by retaining 90% of its initial capacity. A superior energy density of 67.01 W h kg-1 along with a high power density of 903.61 W kg-1 further proved the high performance of this electrode towards hybrid supercapacitors. The excellent electrochemical performance of NiCo2Se4-rGO@Ni foam can be explained through the high electrocatalytic activity of NiCo2Se4 in combination with reduced graphene oxide which increases conductivity and surface area of the electrode. This study proved that NiCo2Se4-rGO@Ni foam can be utilized as a high energy density-high power density electrode in energy storage applications.
