Polypyrrole (PPy) nanospheres with uniform size distribution were successfully prepared by chemical synthesis, and then KMnO4 was decomposed into MnO2 by acid hydrolysis. Finally, the polyaniline (PANI) in-situ grew on the surface of MnO2 by dilute solution synthesis to form PANI@MnO2@PPy ternary composite. Scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed that the PANI@MnO2@PPy was successfully synthesized. The PANI@MnO2@PPy ternary composite was prepared as electrode by solution coating and its electrochemical energy storage capacity was measured in 1 mol·L-1 Na2SO4 electrolyte solution. The specific capacitance of PANI@MnO2@PPy electrode was about 357 F·g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A·g-1, which was 1.96 times compare to the MnO2@PPy electrode. The capacitance loss of PANI@MnO2@PPy electrode was 26.9% when the current density increased from 0.5 A·g-1 to 5.0 A·g-1, indicating it had good rate capability. When the current density was 10.0 A·g-1, the capacitance retention rate of PPy, MnO2@PPy and PANI@MnO2@PPy electrodes were 45%, 70% and 76% respectively, after 1000 cycles of constant current charge and discharge, which showed that the chemical modification of PPy through PANI and MnO2could effectively improve the long-life cycle stability of PANI@MnO2@PPy.
