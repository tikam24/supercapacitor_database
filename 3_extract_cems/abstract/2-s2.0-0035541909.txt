A totally solid state electric double layer capacitor was fabricated using a PVA-H2SO4-H2O polymer electrolyte and activated carbon powder (ACP) as an electrode material. The polymer electrolyte served both as a separator as well as a binder of carbon powder. The PVA-H2SO4-H2O (separator) as well as PVA-H2SO4-H2O-ACP foils were prepared by the solution cast technique. The electric performance of the capacitors was investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charging/discharging and impedance spectroscopy. The prototype capacitors were assembled by contacting three foils (electrode + electrolyte + electrode) having a thickness of en. 1.5-2 mm, a diameter of 1.8 cm and a capacity of ca. 0.6-1.5 F. The specific capacitance of ACP was estimated to be of ca. 130 F/g.
