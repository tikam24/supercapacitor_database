2D transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) are emerging as a novel class of pseudocapacitive materials. However, 2D MXene sheets usually easily restack and aggregate, which greatly hinder their practical application in high performance energy storage devices. Herein, the reinforced MXene electrode is rationally designed and constructed by inserting 18-π aromatic electron system of Phaseolus vulgaris-like MPc among MXene sheets, this system constitutes a new functionalization strategy through π-π interactions for stabilizing MXene. Further, in this study, MXenes/NiPc achieves a superior specific capacitance of 792 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, and the assembled ASC provides a high energy density of 84.58 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 749.97 W kg−1, while also produces the excellent cycling stability of 95.1 % retention over 5000 cycles. Notably, the assembled ASC can easily power the green LED light strip. Our research findings provide a novel strategy and paradigm to design high-performance MXene-based energy storage materials.
