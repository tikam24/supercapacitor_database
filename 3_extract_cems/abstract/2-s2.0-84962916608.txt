This paper presents a possible scheme to integrate a SuperCapacitor pack in a full electric, battery powered, three-wheel vehicle. The proposed hybridization is built upon a fully-active parallel topology. First, a complete model based on energetic macroscopic representation is established for power energy analysis of standard driving cycles. Thereafter, the control scheme is deduced, based on the maximum control structure approach. Finally, the energy management strategy is approached using fuzzy logic controller. To validate the proposed topology, simulation results are provided for the New European Driving Cycle and World-wide Motorcycle emissions Testing Cycle.
