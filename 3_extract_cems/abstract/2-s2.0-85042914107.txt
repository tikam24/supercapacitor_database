Supercapacitor (SC) is an energy storage technology that is rapidly developing, and being implemented in various industrial applications. Several electric rail transportation systems currently use super capacitors for voltage enhancement, and improved recuperation of regenerative braking energy. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the various aspects related to super capacitors applied in electric rail systems, such as their design, sizing and modeling, has been presented.
