Graphitic carbon nitride (GCN): a structural analogous of graphite with aromatic tri-s-triazine units has attracted and opened a new arena in energy storage and conversion of supercapacitors owing to its nitrogen rich framework, metal-free characteristic, earth abundance and environmental friendliness in the current decade. Nevertheless, the supercapacitance performance of GCN can be enhanced by coupling with transition metal oxide/hydroxides, metal sulfides or conducting polymers, which increases the surface area, number of active sites and easy diffusion of inserted/de-inserted ions at the electrode-electrolyte interface further facilitating the faradaic reaction. Therefore, the present review discusses the different GCN based electrode materials with enhanced supercapacitor performance. Furthermore, the historical development, future prospects and opportunities in supercapacitors are elaborately addressed.
