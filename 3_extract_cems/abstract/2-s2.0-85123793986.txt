This paper proposes a new hybrid energy storage system(HESS) incorporating a battery and ultracapacitor(UC). The proposed system uses separate energy sources to use their characteristics at their best, which reduces the size, efficiency, or cost of the embedded source. Electric Vehicle power conversion system is implemented with Hybrid Energy Storage System(HESS), consisting of a battery and UC.The simulink model of the proposed system with Nissan Electric Vehicle model is implemented and the results validated the theoretical studies.The electric vehicle(EV) operates in various modes depending on acceleration, deceleration, and State of Charge (SoC) of the HESS. The choice of energy storage device for vehicle propulsion is taken based on voltage, SoC, and other parameters. The proposed system is more precise and reliable, and the final results showed improvement in the overall performance, resulting in the extension of the range. The system allows one to utilize batteries optimized for energy density seeing that the system was able to actively limit the power drawn from the battery while providing the required power to the load by utilizing the UC bank.
