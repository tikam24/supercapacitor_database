Layered 2D/2D heterointerface composites experience interesting properties that greatly stimulate the recent surge in the attention as robust supercapacitor electrode materials, especially the MXene-based 2D/2D heterointerface for its robust energy storage compatibility. This report unveils a synergistically in situ prepared 2D/2D Nb2C/Ti3C2 MXene (NCTC) heterointerface nanoarchitecture by facile one-pot chemical etching. The methodology adopted enables the interconnected and simultaneous growth of MXenes exposing and retaining their active surfaces for enhanced ion diffusion pathways, charge storage dynamics, microstructural stability, and a noticeable potential window. Henceforth, the in situ developed NCTC heterointerface electrode delivered an excellent specific capacitance of 584 F/g at 2 A/g with a commendable energy density of 38.5 W h/kg in MXene supercapacitors owing to the augmented surface-and redox-based charge storage at the interface. Finally, the developed all-solid-state system demonstrated a superior cycling retention of 98% capacitance after 50,000 cycles. These superlative results encourage the exploration of such prospective 2D/2D heterointerfaces with intriguing charge storage and microstructural attributes for designing next-generation energy storage systems.
