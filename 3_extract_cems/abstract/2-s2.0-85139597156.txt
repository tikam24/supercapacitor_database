The influence of Sr2+ on the structure, topography, magnetic, and electrochemical behavior of MnFe2O4 prepared by co-precipitation approach. The unique products were characterized by Thermogravimetric and Differential Thermal Analysis (TG-DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Scanning Electron Microscope with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (EDX), X-ray Photoelectron Microscopy (XPS), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM). XRD pattern declares the cubic structure with a mean crystallite size decrease from 49.54 nm to 34.6 nm. Metal oxide bands were identified for all samples using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. The BET analysis exhibit a specific surface area of 22.89 m2/g. Magnetic investigations revealed a steady drop in saturation magnetization, remanence, and an increase in the coercive field with increasing Sr2+ content. The electrochemical behavior of pure (MF) and doped manganese ferrite (MSF9) electrodes was investigated using KOH electrolytes by Voltammetry, Charge–Discharge Spectroscopy, and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy. A three-electrode setup with a high specific capacity of 381F/g at 1A/g was attained. Sr2+ (9%) doped MnFe2O4 electrode have excellent surface mobility and high conductivity than pure MnFe2O4 electrode. The synthesized electrodes deliver (MSF9) a higher energy density of 68Whkg−1 at a power density of 5400 Wkg−1 at 5A/g. Such excellent capacitive performances were due to fast charge transport and self-assembled robust microstructural stability.
