Supercapacitors are highly attractive energy storage device of the modern world. It can supply peak pulse power and high cycle stability to an electrochemical system. Here, we have explored the formation of copper ferrite (CuFe2O4) nanowire formation in presence of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and enhancement of electrochemical performance on fluorination. All the electrochemical characterization was studied by three electrode system. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was performed to test the functionality present in the composite. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study had been carried out to observe the change in surface and bulk morphology of the composites which showed that CuFe2O4 nanowires are attached with CNTs or fluorinated CNTs. This fluorinated nanocomposite shows the highest specific capacitance of 267 F/g. Â© 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.
