Holey layered oxygen-rich graphene (HLGH) xerogel material is prepared with a green pore-making agent (potassium ferrate, K2FeO4), whose morphology and pore structure are completely different from traditional 3D graphene xerogels. The extra oxygen-containing functional groups existing around the in-plane pores in HLGH xerogels can contribute more pseudocapacitance to the total capacitance. The optimal HLGH xerogels electrode material obtained a high specific capacitance of 329.5 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, which is much larger than that of traditional graphene xerogel (GH, 169.0 F g−1). Finally, the symmetric supercapacitor is assembled by using the HLGH xerogels, which achieves the high energy (25.3 Wh kg−1) and power densities (0.9 kW kg−1). The specific capacitance is only reduced by 10% after 5000 cycles, showing the excellent stability. Herein, an insight for designing a high-performance graphene carbon-based supercapacitor is provided.
