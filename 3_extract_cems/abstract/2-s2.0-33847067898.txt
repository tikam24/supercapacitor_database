The paper presents method of reduction of negative impact of the drive system on a supply grid by application of supercapacitor energy storage. The paper shows an example of application the supercapacitor energy storage in lift drive system application. For the investigation of the conditioned drive a dynamic model is developed. The model and its simulator is based on PSIM simulation software. Results of peak power, peak current and harmonics reduction for typical lift operation are presented. Â© 2005 IEEE.
