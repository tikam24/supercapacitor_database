A well-dispersed and orange-like Bi2O2.33 microspheres with a narrow size distribution in the range of 3-5 mm used as electrode material of supercapacitor have been prepared for the first time via a facile low-cost strategy. The interior structure of the orange-like Bi 2O2.33 microspheres possesses many channels of about 1.01 nm, which contribute to promote ion penetration and electron transport in the redox reactions. The Bi2O2.33 electrode reveals high specific capacitance (893 Fg-1 at 0.1 Ag-1) with long cycle life, suggesting potential application in energy storage. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.
