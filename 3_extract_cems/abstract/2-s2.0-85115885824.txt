In-plane micro-supercapacitors, in which the electrodes are arranged on the same plane have attracted much attention because of their light weight, simple device structure, etc. In this paper, micro-supercapacitors were fabricated by using polymer nanosheet multilayer film as a solid electrolyte. The micro-supercapacitors were fabricated by sequential deposition poly(N-dodecyl acrylamide-co-acrylic acid) monolayer onto a solid substrate with interdigitated gold electrodes. The capacitor characteristics were investigated by cyclic voltammetry under saturated humidity condition. It was revealed that the micro-supercapacitor showed a capacitance of 33 ÂµF/cm2.
