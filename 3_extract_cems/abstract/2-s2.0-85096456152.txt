Nano size transition metal oxides are attracted the attention of researchers due to its interesting electrochemical properties. Here, vanadium oxide (V5O9) nanostructures were synthesized by one pot hydrothermal route where three different kinds of acids were used such as H2SO4, HCl and HNO3 to synthesize V5O9 and its physico-chemical studies were examined. The structural parameters of the obtained products were investigated from XRD data. Anorthic structure of vanadium oxide (V5O9) phase was confirmed from XRD spectra. Vibration of V-O in V5O9 was confirmed by FTIR. Interstitial vacancies and oxygen related deficiencies present in the sample were confirmed from PL spectra. The typical nanoplate morphology of V5O9 was confirmed by SEM images. The excellent pseudocapacitive storage behavior was achieved as 218 F/g at 10 mV/s scan rate for V5O9 nanoplates synthesized by using H2SO4. The better conductivity and high charge discharge specific capacitance were also achieved for the same electrode. Hence, the strong acidic nature of H2SO4 is concluded as the better mineralizing agent for producing suitable electrode for future energy storage devices.
