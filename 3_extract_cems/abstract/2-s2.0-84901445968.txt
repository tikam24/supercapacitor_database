In this work nanostructured ε-MnO2/C composite electrode was synthesized via the reduction reaction of potassium permanganate. A wide range of carbons such as mesoporous carbon (MC), graphite (GC), super P carbon (super P) and Vulcan carbon (VC) were used in order to enhance the interfacial electrical conductivity and the electrochemical capacitance of the composite electrodes. Physical properties, structure and specific surface area of electrode materials were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction and nitrogen adsorption measurements. The capacitance behavior of MnO2/C materials was studied in aqueous and nonaqueous solution using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and impedance spectroscopy measurements. The composite electrode exhibits the highest capacitance at 30 wt% activated carbon. Among different carbons used, the maximum capacitance of MnO2/super P electrode is as high as 205 F g-1 at 50 mV s-1 and retains 98% after 300 cycles. © 2014 Vietnam Academy of Science & Technology.
