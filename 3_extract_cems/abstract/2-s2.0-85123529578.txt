Cobalt doped MoS2 (Co-MoS2) nanoflowers have been successfully synthesized via a simple one-step hydrothermal method for supercapacitor applications. To identify the crystalline nature and morphology, the as-prepared material is characterized by XRD, SEM, and TEM measurements. The material exhibits a specific capacitance value of 86 F g-1 at a current density of 1 Ag-1 in symmetric two-electrode configuration with excellent cyclic stability of 98.5% even after 10,000 chargeâ€“discharge cycles. The results suggest the suitability of Co-MoS2 as an efficient electrode material for supercapacitors.
