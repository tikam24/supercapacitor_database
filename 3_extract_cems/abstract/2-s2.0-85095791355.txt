In this study, ZnMoO4 nanofibers were synthesized in double distilled water solvent within clean and easy ultrasonic bath method and also investigate their supercapacitive ability. The maximum capacitance of the prepared electrode by these nanofibers is 487 Fg−1 with a scan rate of 2 mVs−1. Also, ZnMoO4 nanofibers electrode maintained 93.6 % of its original capacity after 4000 cycles at a scan rate of 100 mVs−1.
