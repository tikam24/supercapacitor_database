A kindof hybrid energy storage system (HESS) based on multiport DC/DC converters (MPC) and its application to DC microgrid were presented. Aiming at problem of severe impact caused by pulse load power mutation on DC bus voltage and normal operation of battery bank, a new adaptive energy control strategy (AECS) based on moving average filtering algorithm is proposed. Firstly, pulse load power is filtered with moving average filtering algorithm, and battery bank is assumed to moderate power change, whileusing supercapacitorto compensateinstantaneous power mutation, to optimize battery charge and discharge process and prolong its service life. Secondly, adaptive control of supercapacitor port voltage is presented, so that supercapacitor terminal voltage is kept near reference value. Energy flow equilibrium control is used in battery bank ports, makingstate of charge (SOC) of various battery bankstend to be uniform. Effectiveness of the proposed energy control strategy is verified with simulations and experiments.
