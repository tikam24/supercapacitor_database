Nanostructured manganese oxide was produced by potentiostatic and cyclic voltammetric deposition techniques from aqueous KMnO4 solutions. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction were used to study the morphology and crystal structure of the deposited films. The electrochemical properties of deposited films, that obtained by two techniques, were investigated via performing the cyclic voltammetric tests. The results showed the higher specific capacitances of the nanostructured manganese oxide electrodes which have been produced via cyclic voltammetric deposition. The good retention was obtained for all synthesized electrode materials. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
