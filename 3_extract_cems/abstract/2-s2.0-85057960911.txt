Gamma-polyglutamic acid (γ-PGA) hydrogel is a kind of material with three-dimensional network structure formed by the crosslinking of γ-polyglutamic acid. Because the molecule contains a large number of carboxyl groups, it has good absorptive capacity. Since γ-PGA is derived from microorganisms, its hydrogel is a biocompatible, environmentally friendly, and multi-functional material that can be applied to the biomedicine, daily chemical, environmental and textile fields. In this paper, three crosslinking methods for preparing γ-PGA hydrogels in recent years:physical crosslinking, chemical crosslinking and enzymatic crosslinking are reviewed. Then the application of γ-PGA hydrogels in tissue engineering, supercapacitor and textile is summarized, and the future prospective tendency is presented.
