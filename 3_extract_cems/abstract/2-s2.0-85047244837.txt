In recent years, the rapid development of portable and wearable electronic products has promoted the prosperity of fiber supercapacitors (FSCs), which serve as flexible and lightweight energy supply devices. However, research on FSCs is still in its infancy and the energy density of FSCs is far below the level of lithium-ion batteries. Here, we report a facile method to prepare a novel fibrous CNT-aerogel by electrochemical activation and freeze-drying. The fibrous CNT-aerogel electrode possesses a large specific surface area, high mechanical strength, excellent electrical conductivity, as well as a high specific capacitance of 160.8 F g-1 at 0.5 mA and long cycling stability. Then we assembled a non-faradaic FSC based on a fibrous CNT-aerogel as the electrode and a P(VDF-HFP)/EMIMBF4 ionogel as the electrolyte. The introduction of the ionogel electrolyte increases the operating voltage of the FSC to 3 V, and makes the device combine the intrinsic high power density (27.3 kW kg-1) of non-faradaic SCs with an ultrahigh energy density of 29.6 W h kg-1. More importantly, the assembled FSCs show excellent flexibility and bending-stability, and can still operate normally within a wide working temperature window (0-80 Â°C). The outstanding electrochemical performance and the mechanical/thermal stability indicate that the assembled FSC device is a promising power source for flexible electronics.
