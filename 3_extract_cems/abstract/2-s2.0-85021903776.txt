Self-assembled manganese cobalt oxide (Mn0.5Co2.5O4) nanofibers intercalated into graphene frameworks (Mn0.5Co2.5O4@G) with a mesoporous structure are successfully synthesized by a hydrothermal treatment and annealing process. The unique structure can effectively prevent volume changes of Mn0.5Co2.5O4 nanofibers and graphene layers from restacking, and enhance the electrode kinetics, so the composite demonstrates superior electrochemical performances for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and supercapacitors. As an anode material for LIBs, the Mn0.5Co2.5O4@G composite shows a large reversible specific capacity of 950 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.2 A g−1. In a three-electrode system, it achieves specific capacitances of 1926 F g−1 at a current density of 10 A g−1, and capacitances of 1575 and 1211 F g−1 at ultrahigh current densities of 30 and 40 A g−1, respectively. For an asymmetric supercapacitor, Mn0.5Co2.5O4@G//AC (AC=activated carbon) can achieve high energy densities of 64.9 and 14.6 Wh kg−1 at power densities of 75.2 and 3754.3 W kg−1, respectively.
