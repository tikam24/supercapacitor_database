2D transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) have shown outstanding potential as electrode materials for energy storage applications due to a combination of metallic conductivity, wide interlayer spacing, and redox-active, metal oxide-like surfaces capable of exhibiting pseudocapacitive behavior. It is well known that 2D materials have a strong tendency to restack and aggregate, due to their strong van der Waals interactions, reducing their surface availability and inhibiting electrochemical performance. In order to overcome these problems, work has been done to assemble 2D materials into 3D porous macrostructures. Structuring 2D materials in 3D can prevent agglomeration, increase specific surface area and improve ion diffusion, whilst also adding chemical and mechanical stability. Although still in its infancy, a number of papers already show the potential of 3D MXene architectures for energy storage, but the impact of the processing parameters on the microstructure of the materials, and the influence this has on electrochemical properties is still yet to be fully quantified. In some situations the reproducibility of works is hindered by an oversight of parameters which can, directly or indirectly, influence the final architecture and its properties. This review compiles publications from 2011 up to 2020 about the research developments in 3D porous macrostructures using MXenes as building blocks, and assesses their application as battery and supercapacitor electrodes. Recommendations are also made for future works to achieve a better understanding and progress in the field.
