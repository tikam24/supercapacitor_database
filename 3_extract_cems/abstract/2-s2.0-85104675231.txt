Cellulose paper has been functionalized by nanoparticles such as Ag nanoparticles, TiO2, and BaTiO3 for versatile applications including supercapacitor, sensors, photoactivity, and packaging. Herein, zinc oxide (ZnO) nanosheet-modified paper (ZnO@paper) with excellent antibacterial properties was fabricated via a mild ZnCl2-urea eutectic solvent. In this proposed method, cellulose fibers as the raw material for ZnO@paper were treated by an aqueous solvent of ZnCl2-urea; the crystalline region was destroyed and [ZnCl]+-based cations were adsorbed on the surface of cellulose fibers, facilitating more ZnO growth on ZnO@paper. A flexible paper-based triboelectric nanogenerator (P-TENG) was made of ZnO@paper paired with a PTFE film. The P-TENG presents high triboelectric output performance and antibacterial activity. For instance, the output voltage and current of the P-TENG were 77 V and 0.17 ÂµA, respectively. ZnO@paper showed excellent antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus, suggesting that a P-TENG can restrain and kill the bacteria during the working process. The results also indicated that ZnO could improve the surface roughness of cellulose paper, enhancing the output performance of a flexible P-TENG. In addition, the potential application of a P-TENG-based pressure sensor for determining human motion information was also reported. This study not only produced a high-performance P-TENG for fabricating green and sustainable electronics, but also provides an effective and novel method for ZnO@paper preparation.
