Supercapacitors, as energy storage devices with high specific power and long cycle life, play an important role in the field of portable electronic equipment and new energy vehicles. The improvement of supercapacitorsâ€™ performance mainly depends on the development of new electrode materials, the innova-tion of electrolyte solutions, and the optimization of assembly technology. In this article, we review the preparation methods and optimization strategies of electrode for iron-based bimetal oxides, and focuse on the latest research progress on the microstructure regulation and composite construction of these materials. We summarize the innovative ideas and propose the challenges and future developments trend.
