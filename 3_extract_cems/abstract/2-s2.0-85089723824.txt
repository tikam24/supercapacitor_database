Poly 3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene/carbon paper (PEDOT/CP) was used as electrode, and polyvinyl alcohol/sulfuric acid/potassium iodide (PVA/H2SO4/KI) was used as gel polymer electrolyte to assemble PEDOT solid supercapacitor. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were carried out to study the effect of PVA concentration in the electrolyte on the electrochemical performance of the supercapacitor. The results show that the solid-state capacitor assembled with PVA solution with a concentration of 10% has a higher specific capacitance (352.59 F/g) at the discharge current of 1 mA/cm2, as well as high energy and power densities of 451.32Wh/kg and 13.29 kW/kg, respectively. Because the gel polymer electrolyte combines the advantages of excellent conductivity of liquid electrolyte, the easy encapsulation and no leakage of solid electrolyte, etc., it has good application potential in the fields of power backup system, electric vehicle, medical electronic equipment and military equipment.
