A three-dimensional nanoporous NiO film was fabricated using a two-step process through an electrochemical route. The as-prepared NiO film exhibited a highly nanoporous structure and high surface area (264 m 2 g -1). The textural characterization of the film and its electrochemical performance as an electrochemical electrode were investigated. The electrode showed a high specific capacitance (1776 F g -1), power density (89 Wh kg -1), and energy density (16.5 kW kg -1). In addition, the electrode exhibited high and stable specific capacitance retention after a long cycle test in KOH solution. More importantly, the power density met the power requirements of the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV). Â© 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
