We report the synthesis of CuFe2O4-Fe2O3 composite material for efficient and highly stable supercapacitor electrode by using eco-friendly lowerature co-precipitation method. The CuFe2O4-Fe2O3 composite demonstrated the highest specific capacitance of 638.24 F g-1 and excellent stability up to 2000 charge/discharge cycles. The achieved capacitance value is 16 times higher than that of pure CuFe2O4. The results revealed the extraordinary performance of CuFe2O4-Fe2O3 composite as supercapacitor electrode with excellent retention in comparison to CuFe2O4. The enhanced electrochemical activity of CuFe2O4-Fe2O3 composite is attributed to the synergistic effect which is responsible for redox coupling between Cu2+ and Fe3+ that has never been achieved by single component before.
