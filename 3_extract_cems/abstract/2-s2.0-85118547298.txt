Abstract: An effective technique for improving electrochemical efficiency is to rationally design hierarchical nanostructures that completely optimize the advantages of single components and establish an interfacial effect between structures. In this study, core–shell NiMoO4@Ni9S8/MoS2 hetero-structured nanorods are prepared via a facile hydrothermal process followed by a direct sulfurization. The resulting hierarchical architecture with outer Ni9S8/MoS2 nanoflakes shell on the inner NiMoO4 core offers plentiful active sites and ample charge transfer pathways in continuous heterointerfaces. Ascribing to the porous core–shell configuration and synergistic effect of bimetal sulfides, the obtained NiMoO4@Ni9S8/MoS2 as electrode material presents an unsurpassed specific capacity of 373.4 F g−1 at 10 A g−1 and remarkable cycling performance in the 6 M KOH electrolyte. This work delivers a rational method for designing highly efficient electrodes for supercapacitors, enlightening the road of exploring low-cost materials in the energy storage domain.
