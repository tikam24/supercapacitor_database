Electrode materials with efficient electrochemical properties are always desirable for high storage energy devices. Here, due to the attractive attributes of metal phosphates and sulfides, we present a sonochemically synthesized binary composite of cobalt manganese phosphate (CoMn(PO4)2) and sulfide (CoMnS) for the real-world applications. The surface and structural properties of the synthesized materials are then investigated through X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Subsequently, the prepared electrode materials are optimized through electrochemical measurements performed in a three-electrode assembly. The best performing electrode, (CoMnS (S2) yielding a specific capacity (Qs) of 537 C/g at a current density js of 1 A/g) is then amalgamated with a carbonaceous electrode (activated carbon AC) for the fabrication of asymmetric (supercapattery) device. The constructed device (S2//AC) is then subjected to a two-electrode setup, providing an outstanding specific energy (Es) of 73.52 Wh/kg and a maximum specific power (Ps) of 10,200 W/kg. Afterwards, the device is analyzed for a stability test and preserved a maximum capacity retention of 90.03% against 10 A/g for 10,000 charge-discharge cycles. A semi-empirical approach via Dunn's model is next exploited to scrutinize the negative (capacitive) and positive (diffusive) electrode contributions for the device.
