This work firstly prepared CuMn2O4 hierarchical microspheres by using micro/nano MnCO3 precursor. Notably, a remarkable specific capacitance of 657 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, 368.8 F g−1 even at 5 A g−1 and an excellent capacitance retention of 96% after 3000 cycles are achieved for supercapacitors (SCs). In additional, the specific capacitances of this asymmetric capacitor are approximately 134.7, 110.5, 88, 75.8 and 71.7 F g−1 for 2, 3, 5, 8 and 10 A g−1, respectively. The result indicated a highly promising application in SCs.
