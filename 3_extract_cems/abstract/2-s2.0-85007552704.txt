Polymeric transition metal complexes with salen-type Schiff base ligands are considered as promising materials for modification of electrical double layer capacitor electrodes. Electrochemical properties of these polymers that define their performance in supercapacitors should be influenced by the ligand structure but this influence has never been systematically investigated. This article describes results of a comparative study of capacitance and charge transfer rate in polymeric nickel complexes with six different salen-type ligands using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, analyzes advantages and limitations of this method vs. cyclic voltammetry, and provides some insights into the structure and morphology of nickel-salen type polymers. Analysis of results obtained by different analytical techniques shows that introduction of methoxy-substituents into the phenyl rings of the salen ligand and different substituents to the diamine bridge of the ligand causes noticeable changes in electrochemical properties of corresponding polymeric nickel complexes. Experimentally obtained values of gravimetric and volumetric capacitance, as well as effective charge diffusion coefficient provide guidelines for selection of most suitable nickel-salen type polymers for application in energy storage devices, including supercapacitors.
