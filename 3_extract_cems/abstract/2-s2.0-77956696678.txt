Conducting polymers (polyaniline, polypyrrole and polythiophene) as electrode materials for supercapacitor have been attracted great interest due to their low cost, high capacity, rapid charge and discharge, environmental friendliness and safety. In this paper, conducting polymers and hybrid materials of conducting polymers and inorganic materials (carbon materials/metal oxide materials) as electrode materials for supercapacitor have been reviewed, it is believed that the conducting polymers with nanostructures and the hybrid materials of conducting polymers and inorganic nanomaterials are the important research directions of electrode materials for supercapacitor.
