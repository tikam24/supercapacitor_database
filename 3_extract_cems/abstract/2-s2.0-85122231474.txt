Graphite was used to prepare functionalized graphene oxide (GO) by Hummers method. The α-Fe2O3 powder was prepared by hydrothermal technique. Thin-film electrodes of GO, α-Fe2O3 (0.05. 0.1 and 0.2 M concentrations) and graphene coupled with α-Fe2O3@GO (1, 2 and 3 %) were prepared by spray pyrolysis technique using air and various optimized conditions: the distance between the spray nozzle and the substrate was 22 cm, the flow rate was 5 ml/min, and were used as anode material for supercapacitor. GO and α-Fe2O3@GO nanocomposite were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The FTIR showed the strong band at 1735 cm–1 associated with stretching vibration modes of C=O in carboxylic acid and carbonyl groups. The XRD (002) peak disappeared and the (111) peak appeared for graphite and GO, respectively, i.e., the product was completely oxidized after chemical oxidation and exfoliation. The SEM showed that thick sheets are stacked together. For electrochemical studies, cyclic voltammetry and stability of GO and α-Fe2O3@GO nanocomposite were carried out using three electrode configurations in 1 M KCl aqueous electrolyte. The GO, α-F0.05, α-F0.05@1%GO nanocomposites provided the maximum specific capacitance of 262, 201 and 312 F.g–1 at a scan rate of 2 mV.s–1, respectively.
