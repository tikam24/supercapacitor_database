Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as attractive electrode materials for applications in energy storage and conversion, owing to their high porosity and surface area. In this communication, we report a hierarchically structured Co-MOF supported on nickel foam (Co-MOF/NF) serving as a high-performance electrode material for supercapacitors. The as-obtained Co-MOF/NF exhibits an ultrahigh areal specific capacitance of 13.6 F cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2 in 2 M KOH, exceeding those of the previously reported MOF-based materials. It also shows an excellent rate performance of 79.4% at a current density of 20 mA cm−2. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device employing Co-MOF/NF as the positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as the negative electrode achieves a high energy density of 1.7 mW h cm−2 at a power density of 4.0 mW cm−2 with a capacitance retention of 69.7% after 2000 cycles.
