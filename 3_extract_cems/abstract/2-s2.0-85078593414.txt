Porous carbon for supercapacitor was prepared by KOH chemical activation method with water chestnut shell as the precursor. The effects of different impregnation on the structure and electrochemical properties of the porous carbon were systematically investigated. The microstructure of porous carbon was characterized by SEM, XRD, Raman and N2 adsorption-desorption, and the capacitive properties were studied by using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, long cycle and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results show that the porous carbon manifested the highest specific surface area up to 2 046.74 m2/g and the most abundant pore structure when the impregnation ratio was 4:1. As the electrode materials in supercapacitor with TEABF4/PC as the electrolyte, the porous carbon exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 126.1 F/g at the current density of 0.1 A/g and retained a specific capacitance of 92.6 F/g at 0.5 A/g after 10 000 cycles, which exhibited superior capacitive properties.
