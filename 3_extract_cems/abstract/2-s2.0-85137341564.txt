Herein, this report uses Co3O4 nanoneedles to decorate Mo-Co3O4 nanosheets over Ni foam, which were fabricated by the hydrothermal route, in order to create a supercapacitor material which is compared with its counterparts. The surface morphology of the developed material was investigated through scanning electron microscopy and the structural properties were evaluated using XRD. The charging storage activities of the electrode materials were evaluated mainly by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge investigations. In comparison to binary metal oxides, the specific capacities for the composite Co3O4@Mo-Co3O4 nanosheets and Co3O4 nano-needles were calculated to be 814, and 615 C g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, respectively. The electrode of the composite Co3O4@Mo-Co3O4 nanosheets displayed superior stability during 4000 cycles, with a capacity of around 90%. The asymmetric Co3O4@Mo-Co3O4//AC device achieved a maximum specific energy of 51.35 Wh Kg−1 and power density of 790 W kg−1. The Co3O4@Mo-Co3O4//AC device capacity decreased by only 12.1% after 4000 long GCD cycles, which is considerably higher than that of similar electrodes. All these results reveal that the Co3O4@Mo-Co3O4 nanocomposite is a very promising electrode material and a stabled supercapacitor.
