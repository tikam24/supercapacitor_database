For short distance (neighbourhood) transport of people in locations of cultural, historical and natural heritage such as places of tourist interest, electrically driven vehicles, equipped with advanced energy storage and management devices could be used. Increasing the efficiency of energy conversion and energy exchange between different kinds of secondary energy sources is very important for the development of hybrid and electric propulsion systems. The capabilities of secondary energy sources to store energy depend on important vehicle parameters: maximum range, gradability and acceleration ability. These parameters affect life cycles of traditional secondary energy sources (electrochemical batteries). Using ultracapacitors (UCAP) as an additional secondary energy source makes it possible to improve the life cycle of a battery and simultaneously to decrease the exploitation costs of electric (EV) or hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). Such electrochemical elements are called: ultracapacitor, supercapacitor, pseudocapacitor or Electric Double Layer Capacitor (EDLC).
