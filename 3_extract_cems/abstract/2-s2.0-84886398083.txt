We demonstrate the self-assembly of highly dispersed NiO nanoparticles embedded in lignin-derived mesoporous carbon (MPC) frameworks. Self-assembly is induced by evaporation of the solvent from a mixture of metal-containing liquid crystalline mesophases of lignin-derived polymers and transition metal nitrate hydrate, which yielded NiO@MPC nanostructures at 600 °C under a N 2 atmosphere. The microstructure and morphology of the NiO@MPC are characterized by XRD, TEM and BET. The results show that the NiO nanoparticles are highly dispersed in a mesoporous carbon matrix. The NiO@MPC composites show metal oxide contents in the range 49-79 wt%, high surface areas (503-802 m 2 g-1), uniform pore sizes (≈3.7 nm), various porous distributions and large pore volumes (0.46-0.68 cm3 g-1). Electrochemical studies were carried out by measurement of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and charge-discharge tests. The results demonstrate that the NiO@MPC composites have high specific capacitance (880.2 F g-1 at a current density of 1.0 A g-1) and display good retention. 90.9% of the specific capacitance is retained when the current density changes from 1 A g-1 to 10 A g-1 in the charge-discharge tests and 93.7% of the specific capacitance is retained after 1000 charge-discharge cycles. Thus, the NiO@MPC composites are promising supercapacitor electrode materials. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
