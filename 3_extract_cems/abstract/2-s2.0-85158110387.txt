The era of declining fossil fuel reserves in our world and advent towards renewable energy made a leapfrog in innovations, designing of electric vehicles with more power, smoother driving experience and better efficiency. In India, various auto manufacturers set targets to launch new and upgraded electric or hybrid vehicles to capture the dynamically changing demands. TATA Motors recently announced the launch of new EVs every year to Morris Garage aka MG commencing with Astor Electric to OLA Electric to Tesla, which is going to begin with its Model S. EVs are nowadays changing the perspective of their potential customers by extra power and efficiency (less than a rupee/km) as compared to Internal Combustion (IC) engine which typically costs around 2â€“2.5 rupee/km. This paper gives general views about the components of an EV, their developments and controls deployed and their scope in the automotive industry by focusing on cell equalizers and various machine drives. Further, a concept for PMBLAC drive is being introduced with appropriate MATLAB Simulations in a Simscape environment to show the drive parameters, speed variations, different conditions and responses for further support and it gives added advantage of brushless drives over conventional ones.
