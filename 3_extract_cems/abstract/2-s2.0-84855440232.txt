λ-MnO 2 nanoparticles and β-MnO 2 nanorods were successfully prepared from spent LiMn 2O 4 cathode materials by controlling appropriate leaching conditions in this study. Their electrochemical properties were investigated as electrode materials for primary cells and supercapacitors. The composition, morphology and electrochemical properties of the obtained samples were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), constant current charge-discharge and cyclic voltammetry measurements. The results indicated that λ-MnO 2 nanoparticles could be prepared at ambient temperature and pressure, with 0.5 mol·L -1 H 2SO 4 leaching the spent LiMn 2O 4 for 3 h, and β-MnO 2 nanorods could be synthesized under hydrothermal conditions of 140°C, with 2 mol·L -1 H 2SO 4 leaching the spent LiMn 2O 4 for 24 h. The λ-MnO 2 and β-MnO 2 samples delivered discharge capacities of 142 mA·h·g -1 and 275 mA·h·g -1, respectively as electrode materials for Li/MnO 2 primary cells, while the commercial β-MnO 2 only delivered a discharge capacity of 163 mA·h·g -1. Both of the λ-MnO 2 and β-MnO 2 samples as electrode materials for supercapacitors exhibited good capacitance property, with specific capacitance of 87.4 F·g -1 and 85.7 F·g -1, respectively in 1 mol·L -1 Na 2SO 4 electrolyte solution, while the commercial β-MnO 2 only presented a specific capacitance of 76.1 F·g -1. © All Rights Reserved.
