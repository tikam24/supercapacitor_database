Lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors are examples of energy storage technologies that have a lot of promise in a variety of applications. Herein, NiO-porous carbon composites were prepared by a green and cost-effective facile synthesis route from banana peel waste materials. The surface morphology and chemical composition of the NiO-porous carbon composite were investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX). The prepared samples were also described through Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, x-ray powder diffraction (XRD), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), and surface area measurements. The electrochemical behavior of prepared materials was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance (EIS) to test their applicable suitability as supercapacitor electrode. PC-NiO (3) composite exhibits a remarkable specific capacitance of 811 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g. The specific capacitance of PC-NiO (3) is 5.3 times more than that of PC material at 1.0 A/g. Furthermore, the PC-NiO (3) composite material still exhibits a specific capacitance of 780 F/g at 5.0 A/g, high rate capability of 84.55% retention at a high current density of 10.0 A/g and superior cycle stability at 1000 cycles. Based on its high specific capacitance, the NiO-porous carbon nanocomposite is one of the most promising electrode materials for supercapacitors, according to the above results.
