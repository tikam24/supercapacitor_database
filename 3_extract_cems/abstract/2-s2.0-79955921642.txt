Carbon aerogel (CA) microspheres were successfully synthesized by an inverse emulsion polymerization routine. Morphology and physical properties of the CA microspheres were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, N 2 sorption isotherm, and transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that the CA microspheres were all fine spheres with diameters about 4 μm, and the CA microsphere was a typical mesoporous material with ordered mesoporous nano-network structure. The maximum capacitance of the electrode obtained from cyclic voltammetry was 187.08 F/g and the capacitance of the supercapacitor resulted from galvanostatic charge-discharge tests was up to 45.98 F/g. The supercapacitor using CA microsphere as electrode material presented a long cycle life, high charge-discharge efficiency, and low R s of 0.70 Ω in 6 M KOH electrolyte. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.
