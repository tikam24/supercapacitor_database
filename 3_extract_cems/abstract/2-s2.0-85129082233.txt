With greater power density, a hybrid power source that combines supercapacitors and batteries has a wide range of applications in pulse-operated power systems. In this paper, a supercapacitor/battery semi-active hybrid energy storage system (HESS) with a full current-type control strategy is presented. The studied HESS is composed of batteries, supercapacitors, and a bidirectional buckâ€“boost converter. The converter is controlled such that supercapacitors supply load power pulses, and batteries provide the power in steady state. To realize the fast compensation of the supercapacitors to the load power pulses, a power distribution module based on hysteresis control theory is designed in the control system. Moreover, the control strategy does not require the model parameters of the converter and supercapacitors, so the control system is simplified. A complete configuration scheme and cost analysis of the proposed HESS are also presented. Obtained results show that the proposed supercapacitor/battery semi-active HESS has good performance in terms of dynamic response, weight, and energy utilization coefficient (EUC).
