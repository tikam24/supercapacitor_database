Since the 1950s, with the acceleration of urbanization in the world, the urban population has gradually increased. Due to the increase of floating population and road vehicles, urban traffic shows a rapid growth trend. As a mass and high-density public transport, urban rail transit has attracted worldwide attention, and three-dimensional rapid rail transit has been adopted to solve the worsening urban traffic problems. As a mass, fast and punctual public transport, urban rail transit needs frequent start-up and braking. As the traditional traction power supply substation cannot absorb energy in reverse direction, the excess energy generated during vehicle regenerative braking cannot be reused, resulting in energy waste. Therefore, this paper studies the regenerative braking energy absorption and utilization technology based on supercapacitor, and stores the excess energy generated during vehicle regenerative braking into the supercapacitor energy storage system. And the energy in the supercapacitor energy storage system is released when the vehicle starts to accelerate, so that the regenerative braking energy is fully and effectively utilized.
