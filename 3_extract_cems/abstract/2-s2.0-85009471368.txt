The porous anatase TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method and characterized by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). A non-aqueous hybrid supercapacitorwith the as-prepared TiO2 nanoparticles anode and activated carbon (AC, BP-2000) cathode was fabricated and investigated electrochemically. The results showed that the hybrid supercapacitor with the optimal mass ratio 1:2 of AC to TiO2 delivers a specific capacitance of 48 F g-1 at a current rate of 100 mA g-1 and exhibits a good cycling stability. Within a voltage window of 0-3 V, 60.75 W h kg-1 of energy is acquired at 150 W kg-1, indicating the promising application of such hybrid supercapacitor in achieving both high energy density and power density to power the burgeoning hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs)/electric vehicles (EVs).
