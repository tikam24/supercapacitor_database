All-in-one supercapacitors constitute an indispensable part in adapting to the rapid development of flexible energy storage equipment. Herein, an all-in-one configured PANI supercapacitor with a dynamic electrode/electrolyte interface was designed through hydrogen bonds and metal coordination bonds. The supercapacitor exhibits remarkable electrochemical capacitance (162 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, 137.4 mF cm−2 at 0.5 A cm−2) and excellent structural stabilities (almost no degradation in performance and structural damage in the cases of bending, folding, stretching and self-healing process). Besides, the hydrogel electrode can be efficiently recycled through a convenient method without virtual loss of electrochemical performance. Construction of the dynamic interface inside the supercapacitor provides a practical guidance for large-scale preparation of flexible energy storage devices, electronic skin and stretchable sensors.
