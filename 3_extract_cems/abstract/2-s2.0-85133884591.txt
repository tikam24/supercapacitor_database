This paper reported an easy synthesis of MnCo2S4 (MCS) nanosheets using a one-pot solvothermal method for high performance supercapacitor electrode material applications. The obtained ultrathin MCS nanosheets with a thickness of approximately 10 nm are coated on a graphite paper substrate without a binder using the 3D printing technique to form supercapacitor electrodes. The electrochemical performance of the MCS electrode was studied by CV, GCD, EIS measurements in a 6 M KOH electrolyte using a three electrode system. As a result, the MCS electrode material exhibits a higher specific capacity of 2203.6 F g−1 at a current density of 3 A g−1 along with an excellent cycling stability of 93% after 5000 charge-discharge cycles. Furthermore, the symmetric supercapacitor is fabricated using a two-electrode system with synthesized MCS nanosheets and exhibits an outstanding energy density and power density of 96 W h kg−1 and 1857 W kg−1, respectively. These results demonstrate the potential of the MCS nanosheets as an efficient electrode material for next generation supercapacitors.
