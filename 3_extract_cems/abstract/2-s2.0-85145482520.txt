This study investigated the supercapacitor performance of the MAPbI3/MWCNT composite electrode produced by spin coating. The produced electrode's structural properties and surface morphology were analyzed by FESEM, EDX, XRD, and FTIR. Filling the voids in the MWCNT structure by MAPbI3 perovskite crystals increases the charge density but provides ease of charge transport. The supercapacitor electrode performance was determined using specific capacitances calculated from current-voltage measurements in the potential range of -0.5-2 V at 25, 50, 75, and 100 mV/s scan rates. The maximum specific capacitance was 845.03 F/g at 25 mV/s. The electrode's capacitance ratios to the capacitance at 100 mV/s were calculated as 25.8%, 37.3%, and 54.6% for 25, 50, and 75 mV/s scan rates, respectively. Current-voltage cycles are important because they show that the electrode has a stable structure.
