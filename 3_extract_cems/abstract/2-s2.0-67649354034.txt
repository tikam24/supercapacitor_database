Net-like nanostructured SnS/carbon composite was prepared by heating mixture of SnS nanoparticles and resorcinol-formaldehyde sol at 650 °C. The morphology and structure of prepared SnS and SnS/carbon composite were studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Electrochemical investigation indicated that SnS/carbon composite presented superior electrochemical performances than pristine SnS. SnS/carbon composite had better capacitive response in cyclic voltammetry and could deliver larger specific capacitance of 36.16 F/g in galvanostatical charge-discharge process. Net-like structure of SnS/carbon composite and good conductivity of carbon were considered to be responsible for its preferable electrochemical performances. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
