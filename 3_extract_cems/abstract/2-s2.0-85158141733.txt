Biomass is considered a sustainable and renewable raw material for preparing exquisite carbon materials that can be utilized in multiple applications based on the properties required. One such application is in energy storage systems known as supercapacitors. In this chapter, the strategies that involve the usage of biomass to prepare porous carbon materials are discussed in detail. The influence of various activation strategies on the tuning or optimization of the pore structure of the bio-derived carbons has been explained. Furthermore, the charge storage properties of various bio-derived porous carbons have been presented to provide insight into the electrochemical behavior of microporous, mesoporous, and hierarchical porous carbons.
