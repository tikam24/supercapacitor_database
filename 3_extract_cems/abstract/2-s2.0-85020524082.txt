The three-dimensional (3D) lawn-shaped Co-Zn(OH)F nanoneedle arrays have been directly grown on Ni foam by a hydrothermal method. The morphological evolution process of Co-Zn(OH)F has been investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) at different time intervals in detail. Owing to the high activity of the well-ordered Co-Zn(OH)F nanoneedles with a diameter of about 50 nm at the sharp tip, the 3D electrode architectures achieve an ultra-high specific capacitance of 1970 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and excellent cycle stability (105% initial capacity retention after 5000 cyclic voltammetry test). An aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is developed by using Co-Zn(OH)F and activated carbon as the positive and negative electrode. The ASC delivers a specific capacitance of 275 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with a potential window of 0–1.5 V. It retains 99.9% initial specific capacitance even after 10,000 continuous charge-discharge cycles (5 A g−1). The optimized ASC cell can deliver an energy density of 86.2 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 285 W kg−1 and it retains 18.8 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 5062 W kg−1.
