Mobile X-ray device is widely employed because it is useful for diagnosis in patients having mobility difficulties and in medical emergencies. As various devices for X-ray generation have continued to be developed, X-ray devices can now be used more safely and effectively. However, mobile X-ray devices generate relatively low X-ray doses due to the limitation of the power input. Therefore, the use of mobile X-ray devices is limited to thin parts of body. In this study, a new device was designed in order to increase the usefulness of mobile X-ray devices by offsetting the weaknesses of the existing mobile X-ray devices, rendering them useable independently. A supercapacitor and battery were used as the internal power source for the X-ray generation in the manufactured device. The pulse width modulation (PWM) method is applied to control the tube voltage and current required for generating the X-ray, and the pulse frequency modulation (PFM) method is applied to the control to generate the high voltage in order to enhance the precision and efficiency. The manufactured X-ray device was used to evaluate the control signal, frequency, and output characteristics according to changes in tube voltage and current. Based on the results of X-ray generation, it is confirmed that precise control was achieved by X-ray generation increases linearly with increasing tube voltage and tube current. This means that precise control of the manufactured mobile X-ray device is passible. In addition, the study confirmed that stable output was achieved by checking the tube voltage, tube current and exposure rate during the exposure times by high power condition.
