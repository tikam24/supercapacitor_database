Characterizing and modeling supercapacitors(SCs) accurately is essential for the state estimation in supercapacitor energy storage systems. Firstly, the paper makes an introduction to the fractional-order calculus, which is well-suited to the nonlinear process. Secondly, the paper analyzes the frequency domain behavior of the SC and the impedance spectroscopy. Then, the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy(EIS) measurement of hybrid SCs and EDLC is done respectively to get the experimental data, and the parameter estimation shows that the error of fractional-order model is less than the 3-branches RC models.
