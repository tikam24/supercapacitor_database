PbO 2/activated carbon (AC) hybrid supercapacitor in H 2SO 4 with a carbon foam current collector is studied. The PbO 2/AC hybrid is designed with electrodeposited PbO 2 thin film as positive electrode to match with AC negative electrode. The discharge curve shows capacitive characteristics between 1.88 V and 0.65 V. The hybrid system exhibits excellent energy and power performance, with specific energy of 43.6 Wh/kg at a power density of 654.2 W/kg. The use of carbon foam current collector ensures stability of the PbO 2 electrode in H 2SO 4 environment. After 2600 deep cycles at 15 C high rate of charge/discharge, the capacity remains nearly unchanged from its initial value. Â© 2012 Li Jun Gao.
