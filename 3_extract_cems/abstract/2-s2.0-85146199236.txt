Supercapacitors are electrochemical capacitors that differ significantly from conventional capacitors in their virtually unlimited durability, lower current losses, and higher power density values. At the same time, they have an order of magnitude smaller dimensions. This is a new generation battery that can open up numerous prospects in the energy sector.Great interest in supercapacitors is due to the possibility of replacing batteries, as well as the creation of flexible high-power power supplies. The strategic goal for scientists is to create high-capacity batteries that could be used in different areas, for example, for electric vehicles. This will allow you to travel long distances and quickly charge the batteries. It also guarantees a more economical operation of renewable energy sources by accumulating excess energy: wind turbines, solar panels, etc.The purpose of this article is study of the impact of using supercapacitors on the stability of frequency and rotor angle by doing several experiments with different capacities and voltages and then comparing the results which were obtained with the help of the program PSS/E.
