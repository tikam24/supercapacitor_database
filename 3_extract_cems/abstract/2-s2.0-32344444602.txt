The various applications of the chemically modified multiwalled carbon nanotubes are presented. The unprecedent properties of carbon materials can lead to clean-energy devices including Li ion secondary batteries, electric double-layer capacitors (EDLC) or supercapacitors, fuel cells, hydrogen storage devices, display emission sources, and supercomputers. CNTs are mostly used as an electrode material for use in a supercapacitor due to the useful space within their cores and between neighboring tubes, and good accessibility of their surfaces. This material also has sufficient surface area to prevent deterioration of the capacitance at low current densities on discharge that contributes to energy density.
