Mechanically and thermally stable novel gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) have been prepared and applied in supercapacitor cells. Quasi-solid and flexible films were prepared by solution casting technique and formulated by immobilization of ionic liquids (ILs) differing in their aggregate state. A crosslinking agent and a radical initiator were added to further stabilize them. The physicochemical characteristics of the obtained crosslinked films show that the realized cross-linked structure contributes to their improved mechanical and thermal stability, as well as an order of magnitude higher conductivity than that of the non-crosslinked ones. The obtained GPEs were electrochemically tested as separator in symmetric and hybrid supercapacitor cells and showed good and stable performance in the investigated systems. The crosslinked film is suitable for use as both separator and electrolyte and is promising for the development of high-temperature solid-state supercapacitors with improved capacitance characteristics.
