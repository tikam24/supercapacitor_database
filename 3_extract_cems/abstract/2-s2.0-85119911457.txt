Mixed metal sulfides exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance compared to single metal sulfides and mixed metal oxides because of their richer redox reactions and high electronic conductivity. In the present study, Zn-Co-S nanostrip cluster arrays were formed from ZnCo2O4 grown on Ni foam by an anion exchange reaction using a two-step hydrothermal process. Morphological characterization confirmed that the Zn-Co-S nanostrip cluster arrays had grown homogeneously on the skeleton of the 3D Ni foam. The length of the nanostrip was approximately 8 µm, and the width ranged from 600 to 800 nm. The Ni foam-supported Zn-Co-S nanostrip cluster arrays were assessed directly for electrochemical supercapacitor applications. Compared to ZnCo2O4, the Zn-Co-S electrode exhibited a three-fold higher specific capacity of 830 C g−1 at a specific current of 2.0 A g−1 . The higher polarizability, lower electro-negativity, and larger size of the S2− ion played an important role in substituting oxygen with sulfur, which enhanced the performance. The Zn-Co-S//AC hybrid device delivered a maximum specific energy of 19.0 Wh kg−1 at a specific power of 514 W kg−1 . The remarkable performance of Zn-Co-S nanostrip cluster arrays highlights their potential as a positive electrode for hybrid supercapacitor applications.
