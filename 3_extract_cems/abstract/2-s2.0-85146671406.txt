There is still a great need for production and design of electrode materials with superior electrochemical properties for supercapacitor application. Nanocomposites containing graphene-based metal-metal oxide nanostructures are promising electrode materials because of their high conductivity, excellent surface properties, and effective charge storage with both EDLC and pseudocapacitance mechanisms. In this study, Ag@Fe3O4 core@shell nanoparticles decorated nitrogen doped reduced graphene oxide (NrGO) was obtained with a facile and simple method. On the surface of NrGO nanosheets, Ag nanoparticles were found to be coated with Fe3O4 nanoparticles with a particle size of 5â€“12 nm. The electrochemical measurements of NrGO-Ag@Fe3O4 nanocomposite were carried out in a two-electrode cell. The ternary nanocomposite exhibited 212.2 F/g specific capacitance at a current density of 1 A/g, as well as high cyclic stability, the NrGO-Ag@Fe3O4 nanocomposite retained 77 % of its specific capacitance after 10,000 cycles. The Ag@Fe3O4 decorated NrGO nanocomposite indicates great potential as an electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
