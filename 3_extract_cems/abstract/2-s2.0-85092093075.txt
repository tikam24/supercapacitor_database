In this work, nanorod bundles of Ni-Mo-O were synthesized within nickel foam (NF) using a conventional hydrothermal method, which was the further vulcanized to form Ni-Mo-S upon doping sulfur. The NF/Ni-Mo-O and NF/Ni-Mo-S materials were characterized in terms of their morphology, composition and electrochemical properties. NF/Ni-Mo-O showed excellent performance as a supercapacitor. In addition, NF/Ni-Mo-S catalyzed the electrochemical oxidation of glucose in alkaline medium, exhibiting its potential application as a new fuel cell. Their excellent electrochemical performances greatly benefited from the preferred activity of NF/Ni-Mo-O and NF/Ni-Mo-S, efficient electron transfer over the electrode and high conductivity of NF.
