Graphene, a two-dimensional (2D), with an electron configuration of is a single molecule crystalline structure that forms a hexagonal honeycomb lattice structure. Since its discovery in 2004, graphene has been widely researched for applications in numerous industries namely electronics, optics, automobile etc. The 2D carbon material is known to be the chemical basis for all life on earth, thus, making grapheme potentially an eco-friendly, sustainable solution for various applications. Today, grapheme has been known to be the strongest material due to the presence of the strongest Câ€“C bonding. Due to its fascinating properties such as excellent mechanical, thermal, electrical and chemical inertness, graphene is also a suitable candidate for applications associated with batteries and supercapacitors, where by the inclusion of graphene will result in more energy storage in the batteries and supercapacitors.
