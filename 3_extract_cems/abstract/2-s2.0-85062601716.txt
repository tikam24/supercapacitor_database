In this work, novel hollow coral-shaped Co 3 O 4 nanostructures are synthesized via a precursor conversion method for the first time, and the detailed process of precursor conversion is revealed. L-ascorbic acid as the structure-directing agent and the origin of oxalate (C 2 O 4 2− ) contributes to the formation of the precursors, providing a low-cost and facile method for preparing Co 3 O 4 . Hollow coral-shaped Co 3 O 4 nanostructures are obtained by calcining cobalt oxalate precursors in air. The special Co 3 O 4 nanostructures exhibit noticeable pseudocapacitive properties with a capacitance of 626.5 F g -1 at 5 mV s -1 and show superior stability (capacity retention of 99%) and outstanding Coulombic efficiency (˜100%) within 5000 charge–discharge cycles at 10 A g -1 . Furthermore, the asymmetric supercapacitor Co 3 O 4 //G fabricated by Co 3 O 4 cathode and graphene hydrogel anode delivers a specific capacitance of 115 F g -1 (47.9 mA h g -1 ) at 1 A g -1 and attains the maximum energy density of 35.93 Wh kg -1 at the power density of 801.6 W kg -1 . The excellent durability of Co 3 O 4 //G is demonstrated by the retention of 85.1% of initial capacitance after 5000 cycles at 5 A g -1 . The novel and feasible route proposed in the work is expected to be applied prospectively and widely in preparing Co 3 O 4 pseudo-capacitance material, which owns great application value in supercapacitors, as well as in batteries.
