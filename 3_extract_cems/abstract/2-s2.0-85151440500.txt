Flexible electronics are essential for the rapid development of human–machine interface technology, encompassing sensors and energy storage systems. Solid-state supercapacitors with 1D nanofiber electrodes are critical for enhancing ion transport. In this study, a flexible supercapacitor integrated with a strain sensor was designed using a polyvinyl alcohol/polymethyl methacrylate (PVA/PMMA)-based electrolyte and a metal–organic framework (MOF)-derived Zr–nanoporous carbon mat (Zr–NPC). The sensor showed remarkable sensitivity over a broad strain range, enabling reliable and precise detection of mechanical deformation. The supercapacitor with Zr–NPC@PVDF electrode also demonstrated a specific capacitance of 286 mF cm−2 at 0.5 mA cm−2, maintaining high flexibility and mechanical strength. The fabricated supercapacitor maintained around 81% charge retention after 10,000 cycles. Ultimately, the self-powered integrated model was directly connected to the human body to detect physical motion, accentuating its potential for widespread applications in wearable technology.
