Silk derived carbon materials have received extensive research interest owing to their good properties. A transparent and flexible conductive carbon net film was obtained by carbonizing pristine silk fabric. Based on this, transparent capacitive touch pads and all-solid supercapacitors can be fabricated utilizing a transparent carbon fiber net through laser patterning with a 2D programmable platform. The as-prepared devices present good performance. A high capacitance of 35.8 mF cm-2 can be achieved for the supercapacitor device. The design strategy developed here opens up a new avenue for transparent electronics.
