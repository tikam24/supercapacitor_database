Nowadays Electric vehicles play a major role, due to their cleanliness and minimal influence on the environment. An essential component of electric car energy storage systems is lithium-ion batteries. While lithium batteries with high energy densities can deliver adequate steady-state power, their energy density is insufficient to meet the highest power requirements. This issue can be resolved by integrating supercapacitors (SC) and lithium-ion batteries into a hybrid energy storage system (HESS). The need for transitory power increases with increasing power density, which is why this is the case. A DC converter must be used to raise the voltage of the lithium battery because the voltage source inverter's maximum output voltage is lower than the voltage on the DC link side. Due to its direct connection to the inverter, the SC can enhance HESS's dynamic reaction during surges in power consumption. In contrast, a bi-directional DC/DC converter is used to connect lithium batteries to the DC line. Zeta converters are employed in this paper as hybrid energy storage. It has been extensively explored how to control and regulate power and voltage in such systems using DC-DC converters, which can step up and down voltage levels. The zeta converter is one of the probable DC-DC conversion topologies with a low output current ripple. To better regulate load voltage, zeta converters function in both overfeed and underfeed modes. Due to their quick switching and slow switching reduction capabilities, hybrid energy storage systems (HESS) are becoming more and more common energy storage devices. The management of the charging side and optimal energy transfer between charging and storage is made possible by the integration of the zeta-converter and energy storage system. The circuit is simulated using MATLAB and the simulated results are obtained.
