Various CuBO2 nanostructures were developed using different synthesis methods like sol-gel, hydrothermal and molten salt route. The synthesis procedures include different starting materials as well as different sets of synthesis parameters. The resulting samples showed different shapes like nanoparticles, nanocubes and nanorods and exhibited different stoichiometric, crystallographic and electrical properties. The samples were thoroughly characterized by XRD diffractometer, FESEM, EDX, electrometer for structural, morphological, stoichiometric and electrical properties. The sample synthesized via sol-gel method exhibited highest aspect ratio. All samples were subjected to thorough electrochemical studies which showed that the copper boron oxide (CBO)nanoparticles synthesized via sol-gel route can act as the most efficient candidate (specific capacitance142Î¼F) for supercapacitor applications compared to the other nanostructures of CBO. Another interesting feature involving the type of electrochemical properties was found in this work. The NP sample obtained via sol-gel method showed pseudo capacitive nature whereas it gradually expressed EDLC as the samples exhibited different nanostructures of cubes and rods. The electrochemical properties were correlated with the aspect ratio, surface area and the constituent elemental variation of the samples. This work has introduced an entirely new era of applications of CBO in addition to its green cleaning application cooled electron application and photo response efficiency.
