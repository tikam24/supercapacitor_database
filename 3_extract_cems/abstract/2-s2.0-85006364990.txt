The hybrid supercapacitors are fabricated with activated carbon as a cathode and various hydrogen titanates (H2Ti3O7, H2Ti6O13, H2Ti12O25) as an anode to improve electrochemical performances and solve an unbalance between the electrodes. Among them, the hybrid supercapacitors using the H2Ti12O25anode show superior electrochemical performance such as a discharge capacitance of 57 Fg-1at 0.5 Ag−1, cycle performance with a capacitance retention of 65.3% after 1000 cycles at 3.0 Ag−1at 40 °C, an energy density of 35 Wh kg−1at a power density of 179 W kg−1and an energy density of 4 Wh kg−1at a power density of 5383 W kg−1. Also it shows the best balancing between anode and cathode. These results indicate that the H2Ti12O25is a promising anode material for hybrid supercapacitors.
