The purpose of this paper is to carry out a comprehensive study of supercapacitor in the application of power electronics. According to the practical demand and feasibility of power electronics, the modelling, voltage management and topology of supercapacitor-based power system have been discussed. Further more, in order to study the terminal behaviour of supercapacitor and voltage balancing strategy for the application of power electronics, a test bench based on HP-VEE has been built. The measurements on supercapacitor's capacitance, ESR (Equivalent serial resistance) and the consistency of a group of serial supercapacitors, concerning practical application have been suggested. As an example, Maxwell's BCAP0120 supercapacitors have been selected for a 1.5kW hybrid supercapacitor- fuel cell power system. Tests have been carried out and the results show that the ESR is higher and the capacitance is lower compared with the values supplied by manufacturers; and the consistency of them is good, thus the voltage initialization strategy can be used for voltage balancing.
