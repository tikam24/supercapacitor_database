Although the double-fed induction generator can retain part of the active reserve capacity to participate in the system frequency regulation under the conventional overspeed and load reduction control, there are problems such as reduced power generation efficiency of wind turbine, reduced speed adjustment range, and frequent start-up of pitch angle control. Therefore, this paper combines the control characteristics of the grid-side converter of the doubly-fed wind turbine, and proposes an adaptive control strategy for the inertia and primary frequency modulation of the doubly-fed induction generator that takes into account the supercapacitor energy storage state-of-charge (SOC) control. Combining the advantages of inertia and droop control on the basis of maintaining energy storage SOC, this paper proposes a proportional coefficient model that can automatically adjust the two frequency modulation controls to participate in frequency modulation with the value of frequency deviation and the rate of change of frequency deviation. It can realize the smooth switching between the two frequency modulation modes, improve the frequency adjustment effect, and improve the disturbance resistance and self-stabilizing of a single wind turbine. Simulation experiments show that the doubly-fed induction generator's inertial support, primary frequency adjustment capability and power generation efficiency are significantly improved compared with the conventional primary frequency control, Which provides new ideas and new applications for the transformation and upgrading of the doubly-fed induction generator.
