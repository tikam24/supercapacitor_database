The importance given to the market integration of PHEV (Plug-in-Hybrid Electric Vehicle) and EV resulted in an increase in the interest for the fast charging technology of such car batteries. The paper reviews work recently conducted in this area and proposes a fast charging station using a flywheel energy storage and a supercapacitor as energy storage devices. Design issues and simulation results for a typical Level III charger are presented. Â©2010 IEEE.
