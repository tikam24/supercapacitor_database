Nickel and cobalt layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) has large specific surface area and interlayer spacing, multiple redox states and high ion-exchange capability, but poor electrical conductivity, severe agglomerations and structural defect restrict energy storage ability of NiCo-LDH as active materiel of battery supercapacitor hybrids (BSH). In this study, it is the first time to design sulfur-doped NiCo-LDH and polypyrrole nanotubes composites (NiCo-LDH-S/PNTs) from zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) as the efficient active material of BSH using electrospinning and hydrothermal processes. Effects of sulfur doping amounts are investigated. The one-dimensional hollow polypyrrole decorated with NiCo-LDH-S sheets with high aspect ratio provides straight charge-transfer routes and abundant contacts with electrolyte. The highest specific capacitance (CF) of 1936.3 F/g (specific capacity of 322.8 mAh/g) is achieved for the NiCo-LDH-S/PNTs with sulfur doping amount of 7% at 10 mV/s. The BSH comprising graphene LDH negative electrode and NiCo-LDH-S/PNTs positive electrode shows the maximum energy density of 16.28 Wh/kg at 650 W/kg. The CF retention of 74% and Coulombic efficiency of 90% are also achieved after 8000 charge/discharge cycles.
