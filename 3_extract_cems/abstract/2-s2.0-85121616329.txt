Bimetallic transition metal selenides have high theoretical capacitance for energy storage, which are considered as a hopeful supercapacitor electrode material. Herein, a MXene-induced strategy was used to synthesize NiCo2Se4/MXene composite via a one-step hydrothermal process. The conductive MXene sheets could boost the electrochemical activity of NiCo2Se4 nanoparticles while provide additional capacitance. The charge storage performance is improved by the synergy between the NiCo2Se4 and MXene, as a result, the NiCo2Se4/MXene composite electrode achieved a better performance capacitance of 953.8 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, which is higher than the NiCo2Se4 electrode. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device has been made up of NiCo2Se4/MXene and acetylene carbon, exhibits outstanding energy storage capacity and cycle stability. These electrochemical results indicate the NiCo2Se4/MXene composite could be a promising electrode material for practical energy reserve applications.
