A composite of MnO2/SiO2 sphere was coated on single-wall carbon nanotubes (MnO2/SiO2/SWCNT) using one-pot hydrothermal synthesis method. KMnO4 was used as an oxidizing agent for mild functionalization of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT), and also as a precursor of MnO2. A comparative study in the presence of SiO2 and SWCNT was carried out using bare MnO2 as a reference. After addition of SiO2, the composite obtained showed an increase in both the specific capacitance and cycle life which can be associated with spherical shape of SiO2 which offered reduction sites for MnO2. With the addition of SWCNT less than 5%, the composite further showed an increase in capacitance and cycle life, this is because of the good conductive nature, excellent mechanical property and chemical stability of SWCNT. The electrochemical behaviour was studied using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge method in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The specific capacitance of MnO2, MnO2/SiO2 and MnO2/SiO2/SWCNT composite is 73.6 F g-1, 108.7 F g-1 and 136 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1, respectively. The MnO2/SiO2/SWCNT energy density was 68 Wh kg-1 with power density of 444.4 W kg-1. The MnO2/SiO2/SWCNT composite retained 88% of its specific capacitance after 500 cycles. We envisage that this hybrid material could be applied for preparation of supercapacitor electrode.
