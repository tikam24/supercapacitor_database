High-performance energy storage devices are extremely useful in sustainable transportation systems. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and supercapacitors (SCs) are well-known energy storage technologies due to their exceptional role in consumer electronics and grid energy storage. However, in the present state of the art, both devices are inadequate for many applications such as hybrid electric vehicles and so on. Lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) are combinations of LIBs and SCs which phenomenally improve the performance by bridging the gap between these two devices. In this review, we first introduce the concept of LICs, criteria for materials selection and recent trends in the anode and cathode materials development. Then, the achievements and prospects associated with LICs are discussed. Finally, we give our recommendations on fabricating anode with hybrid and nanostructured form and cathode with improved capacitive performance.
