Mn3O4/MnSnO3 nanocomposites have been successfully synthesized via solvothermal method by using the mixed solution consisting of manganese chloride and tin chloride salt dissolved in the mixture of ethanol and deionized water in 50:50 ratio at the processing temperature of 180 °C by adapting different capping agents such as PVP, PVA and ethylene glycol. The synthesized Mn3O4/MnSnO3 nanocomposites were characterized by employing X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectra and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies. The obtained XRD spectra confirmed the formations of Mn3O4/MnSnO3 nanocomposite illustrated by the sharp predominant diffraction peak observed at 34.2° corresponding to the (021) lattice planes of Mn3O4. The SEM images supply the information about the morphology of synthesized Mn3O4/MnSnO3 nanocomposites. The sharp peaks observed at 483 cm−1 further characterize the presence of Mn–O stretching vibration bond in Mn3O4/MnSnO3 nanocomposite by employing Raman spectra. The PL result revealed the emissive nature of the sample. FTIR spectra observed at 625 cm−1 attributed to the characteristic peaks of Mn3O4/MnSnO3 nanocomposite. The Mn3O4/MnSnO3 nanocomposite synthesized by the assistance of PVP surfactant exhibits the high specific capacitance of 178.2 F g−1 at 0.5 Ag−1 current density which can be considered as potential candidate and excellent electrode for pseudocapacitors applications.
