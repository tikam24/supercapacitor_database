Hierarchical mesoporous core-shell CoMn2O4@MnO2 nanoneedle arrays on nickel foam have been manufactured via a two-step hydrothermal process. Electrochemical performances of the CoMn2O4@MnO2 nanomaterials have been tested for supercapacitors and demonstrated outstanding properties. The CoMn2O4@MnO2 electrode delivers a specific capacitance of 2126 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 in 2 M KOH aqueous solution and also shows an excellent cycling stability, which retains 94.4% of the initial capacitance after 5000 charge/discharge cycles at a current density of 4 A g-1. The result confirms the superiority of the CoMn2O4@MnO2 electrode compared with the CoMn2O4 electrode and demonstrates the potential application of the CoMn2O4@MnO2 nanoneedle array electrode for high-performance energy storage device applications.
