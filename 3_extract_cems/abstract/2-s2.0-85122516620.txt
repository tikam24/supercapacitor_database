Due to the growing number of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) in use in industry, as well as the increasing demand for limited raw materials, such as lithium for electric vehicles (EV), a more sustainable solution for mobile energy storage in AGVs is being sought. This paper presents a dual energy storage system (DESS) concept, based on a combination of an electrical (supercapacitors) and an electro-chemical energy storage system (battery), used separately depending on the required transport distance. Each energy storage unit (ESU) in this DESS is capable of supplying the AGV completely. The concept takes into account requirements for a complex material flow as well as minimizing the energy storage capacity required for the operation of the AGV. An energy flow analysis is performed and further used as a basis to derive three possible circuit concepts for the technical realization. The circuit concepts are compared to other approaches from related work, differentiating the functionality to hybrid energy storage systems (HESS). The functionality of the concepts was validated by mapping the energy flow states to active circuit components. Finally, an approach for implementing the control strategy as a state machine is given, and conclusions for further investigations are drawn.
