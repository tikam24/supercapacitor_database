Hierarchically porous carbon nanofoams (CNFs) with uniform cavity and highly porous skeleton have been prepared via the formation of core-shell organosilica nanoparticles in one-pot reaction and subsequent Friedel-Crafts chemistry. The porosity of the CNFs, which have macroporous cavity (∼50 nm), mesoporous windows (∼12 nm) between adjacent cavities and mesoporous skeleton (∼3 nm), were facially tuned by varying the amount of phenyltriethoxysilane (PTES) used in the first step. CNFs with high surface area (>1100 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>), large pore volume (∼2 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>) and partially graphitized skeleton exhibited good performances as supercapacitor electrode materials. The specific capacitance of the porous CNFs reached 170 F g<sup>-1</sup> at a current density of 0.5 A g<sup>-1</sup> in an aqueous electrolyte.
