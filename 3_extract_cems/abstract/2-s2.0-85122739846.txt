Energy generation can be clean and sustainable if it is dependent on renewable resources and it can be prominently utilized if stored efficiently. Recently, biomass-derived carbon and polymers have been focused on developing less hazardous eco-friendly electrodes for energy storage devices. We have focused on boosting the supercapacitor’s energy storage ability by engineering efficient electrodes in this context. The well-known conductive polymer, polyaniline (PANI), deposited on nickel foam (NF) is used as a positive electrode, while the activated carbon derived from jute sticks (JAC) deposited on NF is used as a negative electrode. The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is fabricated for the electrochemical studies and found that the device has exhibited an energy density of 24 µWh/cm2 at a power density of 3571 µW/cm2 . Furthermore, the ASC PANI/NF//KOH//JAC/NF has exhibited good stability with ~86% capacitance retention even after 1000 cycles. Thus, the enhanced electrochemical performances of ASC are congregated by depositing PANI on NF that boosts the electrode’s conductivity. Such deposition patterns are assured by faster ions diffusion, higher surface area, and ample electroactive sites for better electrolyte interaction. Besides advancing technology, such work also encourages sustainability.
