The electrochemical capacitor (EC) from various carbon materials, i.e., carbon nanosheet from gelam wood, carbon nanotube from sesame oil, carbon honeycomb-like from sengon wood used as electrodes were studied, as well as the solvent used, i.e., dimethylsulphoxide, ethyleneglycol, propilene carbonate and the electrolytes, i.e., disodiumtetraboratdecahidrate (DSTB) and sodiumdietyldithiocarbaminate (SDEDTC). Their performance were optimized for three factors by using full factorial design of experiment technique. The three factors chosen for experiments were the controllable variables that have key role to play in the EC performance, i.e., carbon types applied in electrodes, organic solvent that dispersed electrolytes, and electrolytes. Types of carbon has highest effect on capacitance value and carbon from gelam wood bark has the best capacitance value. There exist strong interaction effect between type of carbon and solvent as well as between type of carbon and electrolyte contribute capacitance of ECs. Operating voltage of EC from the beginning cycle until cycle-2000 is about 1.2 to 1.4 volts, i.e., using CNS electrode with 20% SDEDTC electrolyte and DMSO as solvent.
