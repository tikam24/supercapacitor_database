Years are passing and so is the population of the world increasing. Electricity is the major requirement in the present era because of its increasing demands. In future due to energy shortage, the dependence on renewable energy sources will increase because nonrenewable sources are present in very less amount and nonrenewable energy sources will not be able to fulfill our requirement for energy. There comes a major problem of energy storage when in future most part of the earth would be dependent on non-conventional energy sources. Supercapacitors can play an important role in the area of energy storage along with conventional energy storage. Electrode material processing is important to improve parameters of Supercapacitors. This paper focusses on improving the parameters of supercapacitors such as power density, energy density, capacitance and effective series resistance by ultrasonic treatment on various electrode materials.
