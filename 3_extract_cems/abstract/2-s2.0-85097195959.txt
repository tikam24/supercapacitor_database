Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) are widely used in power systems due to their ability to provide fast responses and high controllability. Among ESS technologies, supercapacitor-based ESS are especially suitable for ultra-fast power intensive application. This paper presents the results from the field testing of a 0. 675MW/0.017 MWh supercapacitor-based ESS installed in Terna's HV substation in Codrongianos (Sardinia). Performance tests and special operation modes, e.g. black start and islanding, have been investigated. Also, a new functionality to proper manage the State Of Charge (SOC) is implemented.
