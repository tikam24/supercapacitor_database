MnO2/carbon sphere composites (MnO2/CS composites) have been prepared in neutral KMnO4 solution using CS as a reducing reagent. The structures and electrochemical properties of the composites were investigated. The results reveal that the cycling stability of MnO2/CS composites electrodes is improved with increasing CS content, while the specific capacitance decreases. The specific capacitance of a composite containing 35% mass fraction of CS was 181 F/g at a current density of 50 mA/g. The stability and capacitance of the composite electrodes were greatly improved by using KOH-activated or acid-oxidized CS; the corresponding specific capacitances of the composite electrodes were increased to 192 F/g and 218 F/g, respectively. Furthermore, the values remained as high as 184 F/g and 192 F/g respectively, after 500 times charge-discharge cycles. MnO2/CS composites containing pre-treated CS exhibit excellent capacitance characteristics as supercapacitor electrode materials.
