Efficient and high storage capacity composite electrodes are needed to store energy in flexible devices. We are reporting effect of filler concentration of bismuth oxide (Bi2O3) (Bi2O3 represented as BO = 1 to 5 wt%) on the charge storage performance of polystyrene (PS) composites. Bi2O3/PS composites fabricated via solution casting method, show homogenous distribution of bismuth oxide (Bi2O3) in the polystyrene matrix and attains high dielectric constant upto 5.39 at low frequency while stable dielectric constant upto 4.38 at high frequency attributes interfacial polarization occurred due to bismuth oxide distribution in the polystyrene matrix. The dielectric response indicates that Bi2O3/PS composites maybe thought of as flexible electrodes for high performance super capacitors.
