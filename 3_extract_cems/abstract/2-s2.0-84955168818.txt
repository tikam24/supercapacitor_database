Graphene/polyaniline nanotube (GPNT) composite was synthesized using Vitamin C as both the template of polyaniline nanotube via in situ polymerization of aniline and the reducing agent of graphene oxide. The pure polyaniline (PANI), graphene/PANI composite (GP) (using hydrazine monohydrate instead of VC) and GO/PANI composite were also prepared. IR spectroscopy and morphologies of the as-prepared samples were characterized. And the electrochemical performances were conducted on a three-electrode cell. IR spectroscopy demonstrated the interaction between graphene and PANI nanotube in GPNT, which is beneficial to enhance the electrochemical performance of the composite electrode. Surface morphology showed PANI nanotube with outer diameter of 140 nm in GPNT. GPNT composites exhibited better electrochemical performances than GP composite and pure PANI. The electrochemical performances showed that the specific capacitance of GPNT was 561 F/g which is more than that of either GP or PANI, it is not only due to the graphene which can provide good electrical conductivity and high specific surface area, but also associated with a good redox activity of ordered PANI nanotubes. The as-prepared GPNT composites with higher conductivity, lower resistance and better cycle life in our laboratory are promising electrode materials for high-performance electrical energy storage devices.
