Stand-alone photovoltaic systems are widely used to generate electrical power in rural areas. Transients in solar radiation affect the electrical power generated by solar stand-alone photovoltaic systems. Solar stand-alone PV systems strictly require energy storage units like batteries to compensate the solar power deficiency. Batteries cannot deliver power to the system during fast transient condition. Supercapacitor has the capability to deliver power very fast. A combination of battery and supercapacitor as Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) is the best solution for stand-alone PV systems. A multiple converter type HESS configuration model is simulated using MATLAB/Simulink and the system performance is investigated under the different input radiation conditions.
