Here, a three-dimensional electrode substrate derived from graphite paper is developed via an electrochemically assisted modification method. The as-obtained sample (denoted as EGP) containing partially exfoliated graphite sheets atop its surface and expanded lateral graphite layers provides a large surface area for loading NiCo-layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH). Therefore, combined three-dimensional electrode architecture with high capacitance of NiCo-LDH, the EGP@NiCo-LDH exhibits ultrahigh capacitance (1650 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) coupled with improved rate performance. In addition, an asymmetric supercapacitor based on EGP@NiCo-LDH supplies a high energy density of 44.31 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 799.98 W kg−1 and remarkable cycling stability with 92.8% retention after 5000 cycles.
